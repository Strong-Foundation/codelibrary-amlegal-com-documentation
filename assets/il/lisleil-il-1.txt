the annual appropriation ordinance. The members of the planning and zoning
commission, by their chairman, shall from time to time make recommendations to
the village board of trustees with respect to compensation for the secretary of

but it first must obtain from the village board of trustees prior approval and
authority to incur any expense and said expense, before incurred, must have
been provided for in the annual appropriation ordinance or budget as amended
and as passed by the village board of trustees. The corporate authorities may
appropriate or budget such sums as they may deem proper for the maintenance and
operation of said planning and zoning commission and/or planning department
which may hereafter be created, including the salaries of all paid members and
employees; development of a planning program; preparation of regulations,
projects and programs pertinent to the development, redevelopment and renewal
of the municipality and such surrounding territory over which the municipality
exercises subdivision jurisdiction; the preparation and revision of the
official map and the exercise of such powers germane to the purposes for which
it was created, as may be conferred upon the planning and zoning commission or
planning department by ordinance. (Ord. 2003-3451, 4-7-2003, eff. 5-1-2003)
2-1-6: PLANNING DEPARTMENT:
The corporate authorities may, by ordinance, establish a planning department.
(Ord. 2003-3451, 4-7-2003, eff. 5-1-2003)
2-1-7: HEARINGS; APPEALS; NOTICES:
Appeals to the planning and zoning commission may be taken by any person
aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the village
affected by a decision of the building commissioner and/or zoning inspector.
Such appeal shall be taken within such time as shall be prescribed by the
planning and zoning commission by general rule, by filing with the building
commissioner and with the planning and zoning commission a notice of appeal,
specifying the grounds thereof. The building commissioner shall forthwith
transmit to the planning and zoning commission all of the papers constituting
the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. (Ord. 2003-3451, 4-7-
2003, eff. 5-1-2003)
2-1-8: STAY OF PROCEEDINGS:
An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the building commissioner certifies to the planning and zoning
commission after the notice of appeal has been filed with him that, by reason
of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order granted by the planning and zoning
commission, or by a court of record, on application or notice to the building
commissioner on due cause shown.
The planning and zoning commission shall fix a reasonable time and place for
the hearing of the appeal, shall give due notice thereof to the parties in
interest, and shall render a decision within a reasonable time.
Any person may appear and testify at the hearing, either in person or by duly

2-1-9: POWERS OF COMMISSION:
Said planning and zoning commission shall, in addition to all other powers
provided by law, have the following powers:
   (A)   To prepare and recommend to the board of trustees of the village a
comprehensive plan of public improvements looking to the present and future
development of the village, which plan shall be known as the official plan of
Lisle. Such plan shall include reasonable requirements in reference to streets,
alleys and public grounds, unsubdivided lands within the corporate limits of
the village and in contiguous territory outside of and distant not more than
one and one-half (11/2) miles from such limits and not included in any city,
village or incorporated town. Said requirements to be effective whenever such
land shall be subdivided after the adoption of such plan.
   (B)   To prepare and recommend to the board of trustees from time to time
such changes in the plan as may be deemed necessary by the board of trustees or
by the planning and zoning commission; provided, however, that such change will
not affect the general principles of the plan as adopted.
   (C)   To prepare and recommend to the board of trustees from time to time
general plans for specific improvements in accordance with such official plan.
   (D)   To give aid to the officials of the village charged with the direction
of projects for improvements embraced within the official plan, to further
making of such improvements and generally promote the realization of the
official plan.
   (E)   To exercise such other powers germane to the powers granted by law and
as may be conferred by the corporate authorities of the village.
   (F)   The power to perform the duties that are set out in the zoning
regulations of the village, being in particular title 5, chapter 19 of this
code. (Ord. 2003-3451, 4-7-2003, eff. 5-1-2003)
2-1-10: PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF SUBDIVISION PLATS 1 :
All plats of subdivision shall be submitted initially to the planning and
zoning commission for preliminary approval. The application for approval shall
show location and width of proposed streets and public ways; shall indicate
proposed location of sewers and storm drains; proposed dedication of public
grounds, if any; lot sizes; proposed easements for public utilities; and
proposed methods of sewage and waste disposal; but need not contain
specifications for proposed improvements.
The planning and zoning commission shall approve or disapprove the application
for preliminary approval within ninety (90) days of the date of application or
the filing by the applicant of the last item of required supporting data,
whichever date is later, unless such time is extended by mutual consent. If
such plat is disapproved, then within ninety (90) days the planning and zoning
commission shall furnish to the applicant a statement, in writing, setting
forth the reason for disapproval and specifying with particularity the aspects
in which the proposed plat failed to conform to the ordinances including
official map. If the plat is approved, the corporate authorities shall accept
or reject said plat within thirty (30) days after its next regular stated
meeting following the action of the planning and zoning commission. Preliminary
approval shall not qualify a plat for recording.
Application for approval of the plat shall be made not later than one year
after preliminary approval has been granted. The application must be supported
by such drawings, specifications and bond as may be necessary to demonstrate
compliance with all requirements of applicable statutes and such regulations as
the corporate authorities may provide by ordinance under law.
The applicant may elect to have final approval of the geographic part or parts
of the plat that received preliminary approval and may delay application for
approval of other parts until a later date or dates beyond one year with the
approval of the corporate authorities; provided that all facilities required to
serve the part or parts for which the final approval is sought have been
provided. In such case only, such part or parts of the plat as have received
final approval shall be recorded.
When a person submitting a plat of subdivision or resubdivision for final
approval has supplied all drawings, maps and other documents required by the
municipal ordinances to be furnished in support thereof, and if all such
material meets all municipal requirements, the corporate authorities shall
approve the proposed plat within sixty (60) days from the date of filing the
last required document or other paper or within sixty (60) days from the date
of filing application for final approval of the plat, whichever date is later.
The applicant and the corporate authorities may mutually agree to extend the
sixty (60) day period.
Any person seeking approval of a subdivision or resubdivision map or plat shall
post a good and sufficient bond with the village clerk and a penal sum
sufficient to cover the estimate made by the village engineer, or other
authorized person, of expenditures including, but not limited to, reasonable
inspection fees to be borne by the applicant, necessary to conform to the
requirements established and conditions upon completion of said requirements in

organization, administration, training, and operation of the EMA, subject to
the direction and control of the mayor and board of trustees as provided by the
act. (Ord. 2001-3291, 3-5-2001)
2-9-3: CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT:
The principal executive officer ("PEO") of the village is the village
president. The "PEO", or the emergency interim successor, is the only
individual who can officially declare a disaster in the village. The "PEO" or
the emergency interim successor is the ultimate authority in the village during
any declared disaster, but relies directly on information and advice from the
coordinator and the village manager.
In the event that the "PEO" is unavailable, the powers of office shall be
exercised, and duties shall be discharged by the designated emergency interim
successors in the order specified. The emergency interim successors shall
exercise the powers and discharge the duties of the office to which designated

   Village board:
   (A)   Senior trustee.

   (C)   Most senior trustee available.
In cases in which two (2) or more trustees have served the same length of time,
seniority of those trustees will be determined as follows: The most senior
trustee will be the trustee who received the greatest number of votes in the
election in which the trustees who are tied for seniority were first elected to
the village board. If two (2) or more trustees who are tied for seniority have
served intermittent terms on the board, the vote count used to determine
seniority shall be from the election from which the trustee was elected to this
current and consecutive length of service. Trustees will be ranked for
seniority purposes by the total numbers of votes received by each individual
trustee from highest number to lowest number. Seniority will continue to be
assigned by vote totals from the above designated election to the village
board.
All emergency interim successors shall exercise the powers and discharge the
duties of an office until a successor is appointed or elected and qualified as
may be provided by the constitution, statutes, charters, and ordinances or
until the lawful incumbent is able to resume the exercise of the power and
discharge the duties of office.
All vital records shall be maintained and protected by the coordinator for use

The coordinator may, in collaboration with other public agencies within his
immediate vicinity, develop or cause to be developed mutual aid arrangements
with other political subdivisions within this state for reciprocal disaster
response and recovery assistance in case a disaster is too great to be dealt
with unassisted. The mutual aid shall not, however, be effective unless and
until approved by each of the political subdivisions. The arrangements shall be
consistent with the state emergency operations plan and state emergency
management program, and in the event of a disaster, it shall be the duty of
each emergency management agency to render assistance in accordance with the
provisions of the mutual aid arrangements. (Ord. 97-2866, 4-7-1997)

operations plan of that village and to authorize the furnishing of aid and
assistance thereunder. (Ord. 97-2866, 4-7-1997)

In carrying out the provisions of the act, the village may enter into contracts
and incur obligations necessary to place it in a position effectively to combat
the disaster; to protect the health and safety of persons; to protect property;
and to provide emergency assistance to victims of those disasters. If a
disaster occurs, the village may exercise powers vested under the act in the
light of exigencies of the disaster and, excepting mandatory constitutional
requirements, without regard to the procedures and formalities normally
prescribed by law pertaining to the performance of public work; entering into
contracts, incurring of obligations; the employment of temporary works; the
rental of equipment; the purchase of supplies and materials; and the
appropriation, expenditure, and disposition of public funds and property. (Ord.

any capacity in the Illinois emergency management agency or the village
emergency management agency, shall, before entering upon his duties, take an
oath, in writing, before the coordinator or before other persons authorized to
administer oaths in this state, which oath shall be filed with the coordinator

chapter.

notify shall constitute cause for suspension or revocation of the licensee's
liquor license. For the purpose of this subsection "licensed premises" shall
include, but is not limited to, any building, structure, parking lot or vacant
area directly or indirectly related to the retail sale of alcoholic liquor.
   (H)   Access to Licensed Premises: The licensee or officer, agent or

and necessity require a change in the number of taxicabs which may be
registered for operation in the village or hours of taxicab services required
by section
3-8-19 of this chapter. In determining whether the public convenience and
necessity require change in the number of taxicabs which may be registered for
operation in the village or hours of taxicab service, due consideration shall
be given by the village board to the following:
      1.   The public demand for taxicab service.
      2.   The effect of increased competition on revenues of taxicab
operators, on cost of rendering taxicab service including provisions of proper

AUTOMATIC DRY CLEANING MACHINES
SECTION:
3-9-1: Compliance Required
3-9-2: Definition
3-9-3: License And Permit
3-9-4: Installation Regulations
3-9-5: Operation Regulations
3-9-6: Inspections
3-9-7: Penalty
3-9-1: COMPLIANCE REQUIRED:
It shall be unlawful to install, operate or maintain any "automatic dry
cleaning machine", as hereinafter defined, except in compliance with the
provisions of this chapter, or without complying with all of the provisions
pertaining to the installation and operation of such machines herein contained,
or in violation of any laws, rules or regulations of the Illinois department of
health relating thereto. (Ord. 138, 10-16-1962)
3-9-2: DEFINITION:
An "automatic dry cleaning machine", as the term is used herein, shall be
construed to include and mean any device or apparatus for the cleaning of
clothes or fabrics, and designed to be used or operated by the owner or an
employee of the owner, which machine or device makes use of or contains
perchloroethylene or any other chemical solvent or substance which may cause
harm to human beings by reason of inhalation or contact. (Ord. 138, 10-16-1962)
3-9-3: LICENSE AND PERMIT:
It shall be unlawful to install any automatic dry cleaning machine without
first having secured a permit therefor. Applications for such permit shall
contain full information as to the mechanical equipment of such machine and
provisions for ventilation for both the machine and the room in which the
machine will be located. Applicants shall supply all such other information as
may be requested by the permit application form as amended from time to time.
It shall be unlawful to engage in the business of maintaining any such machine
for use by the public upon payment of a fee without having first secured a
license therefor. The annual fee for such license shall be as established by
Title 1, Chapter 20, “Fees, Fines, Insurance, Guarantees, and Regulatory
Measures” plus an amount as established by
Title 1, Chapter 20, “Fees, Fines, Insurance, Guarantees, and Regulatory
Measures” for each unit in addition to five (5) maintained in any one
establishment. (Ord. 98-2956, 2-2-1998; amd. Ord. 2021-4921, 9-20-2021)
3-9-4: INSTALLATION REGULATIONS:
Each machine shall be completely enclosed by a cabinet and shall be vented with
intake at the top and the outlet at or near the bottom of such machine. Groups
of machines may be entirely enclosed or supported on all sides by an enclosure
topped with a hood vented as provided for each individual machine.
The exhaust system must maintain a minimum flow of one hundred (100) cubic feet
per minute face velocity through the loading door whenever the door is open.
The discharge stack for the machines and for the room in which the machines are
located shall extend at least two feet (2') above the level of any window which
can be opened, located within fifty feet (50') of the outlet of the stack, and
shall be at least fifty feet (50') away from any fresh air intake leading to
any premises.
The machines must be so constructed so as to prevent the loading door from
being opened during the normal cycle of operation. Each machine shall be
equipped with a transparent door or port to allow visual examination of the
status of the cleaning cycle.
Any connection of such machine with the water supply system must be equipped
with an air gap or vacuum breaker in the line upstream from the condenser; with
no control valves downstream from such gap or breaker. Wastewater shall be
discharged through an air gap.
Each machine must be so designed and constructed as to prevent the leakage of
liquids, gas or vapors.
The solvent shall be stored in closed containers and should be transferred from
the containers in a line free of leaks. All storage facilities for solvent,
external from the equipment, must meet the requirements of the village fire
inspectors.
Filter residue and other residues containing solvent shall be disposed of so as
not to create a health hazard or nuisance.
Respiratory protective equipment shall be provided for maintenance personnel
and must be kept in good repair and available for immediate use. Chemical
cartridge respirators are approved for light solvent concentrations and the
wearer should replace the cartridges immediately upon noting odor.
A utility fire extinguisher of either the carbon dioxide or dry chemical type
must be provided for use against electrical or oil fires.
Only the front or customer side of the dry cleaning machine should be exposed
in the customer area. The working or maintenance portion of the equipment
should be separated from the front of the machine by a solid partition. As a
means of minimizing any solvent buildup in the customer area and also to
control any minor solvent leakage, it is required that there be a minimum flow
rate from the customer area through the partition as follows:
 
Number Of Machines Minimum Flow Rate
                   Per Machine (cfm)
1 - 3              500
4 - 8              400
9 - 16             375
17 or more         360
 
Example: An 8 machine installation requires a minimum continuous exhaust flow
rate of 3,200 cfm.
The exhaust ventilation as described above shall be provided on a continuous
basis while the store is open for business. The fan wiring shall be such that
the dry cleaning equipment cannot be operated unless the fan system is in
operation.
Where grille openings are to be installed in the partition to facilitate air
movement, they should be sized on the basis of about five hundred (500) cfm per
square foot of net grille area and should be placed as close to the machines as
possible. An example would be the use of a thirty inch by six inch (30" x 6")
grille located directly over a machine.
Access doors to the maintenance area shall be kept locked.
It is also required that a general ventilation fan be installed in the back
room or maintenance area to be used in case of serious solvent leakage. This
may be installed in the rear wall and when combined with the system required in
the minimum flow rate table above, should enable the exhausting of a minimum of
one thousand (1,000) cfm per machine.
A satisfactory means of preventing liquid leaks from escaping the enclosure
must be provided. This should include some method of "diking" the floor of the
enclosure or machine base to hold a liquid volume equal to the maximum quantity
of solvent which might possibly escape from the system. Some means must be
provided for draining solvent in the event of a leak and containment. This can
be done by gravity flow with the solvent transferred to a standby holding tank.
This tank should be vented to the outside.
An interlock system must be provided on the machine to prevent the loading door
from being opened during the normal cycle. This system may be either electrical
and/or mechanical and so connected that in the event of a power failure the
machine remains safe.
A step by step instruction list must be posted in a conspicuous location near
the machine for customer use. Competent, trained and maintenance personnel must
be available or on call as long as the premises is open for business.
A solvent vapor sensing device within the tumbler is desirable to control the
drying cycle and to prevent the removal of solvent laden garments.
The machine design must be such that essentially no solvent is retained in the
cleaned items upon completion of the dry cleaning cycle. A simple performance
test which must be satisfied is the lack of any solvent odor in a closed
automobile containing a newly cleaned load.
It is the responsibility of the proprietor to make certain that clothing which
cannot be properly cleaned and dried will not be placed in the machines.
The machine should be checked daily and kept in good repair. All maintenance
personnel should be familiar with necessary machine repairs and instructed as
to the solvent hazards.
Solvent control is to be such that under normal operation and use conditions no
solvent odor can be detected in the customer area.
Only the solvent specified by the equipment manufacturer shall be used.
A supply of tempered (heated to 60 or 65 degrees Fahrenheit) make-up air equal
to or greater than the total volume of air exhausted from the plant should be
provided in order to eliminate any negative pressure conditions which might
otherwise develop.
It is important that solvent contaminated air, even in very low concentrations
(5-20 ppm), be kept out of the air intakes of all combustion equipment so as to
minimize the thermal decomposition of the solvent. Breakdown products such as
hydrochloric acid, free chloride and phosgene corrode metal surfaces including
flues and heater components and can seriously damage cloth through acid burns
or weakening of fibers.
Exhaust ventilation stacks from dry cleaning machines should be located as far
as possible from combustion air or dryer intakes. (Ord. 138, 10-16-1962)
3-9-5: OPERATION REGULATIONS:
No such automatic dry cleaning machine shall be operated unless all the
equipment described in the foregoing section is properly installed and in good
working condition.
No establishment for which a license is required under this chapter shall be
open for business, and it shall be unlawful to admit the public or customers
into the room where such machines are located unless there is on duty in the
establishment at all times a competent person in charge of the establishment,
and in charge of the operation of such machines. There shall be warning signs
posted in places of easy observation warning of the dangers in the event
leakage of liquids, gas or vapor occurs. It shall be unlawful to permit any
residue containing solvent to flow into the sewer system of the village;
tightly covered metal containers may be used for temporary storage of such
waste outside the building. Such containers shall bear labels indicating the
contents and dangers involved in handling, and shall be locked if in an
unenclosed place.
At least one legible sign shall be maintained in a place available to customers
giving the name, address and phone number of the owner of the establishment,
and of the service department or agency responsible for the proper maintenance
of the machine. (Ord. 138, 10-16-1962)
3-9-6: INSPECTIONS:
It shall be the duty of the village president to cause such inspections to be
made as are necessary to see to the enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter. (Ord. 138, 10-16-1962)
3-9-7: PENALTY:
Any person violating any provisions of this chapter shall be fined as
established by
Title 1, Chapter 20, “Fees, Fines, Insurance, Guarantees, and Regulatory
Measures” for each offense; and a separate offense shall be deemed committed on
each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. (Ord. 96-2776, 5-
29-1996; amd. Ord. 2021-4921, 9-20-2021)

charges for which are written off as uncollectible, and provided further, that
if such charges are thereafter collected, the delivering supplier shall be
obligated to remit such tax.
      3.   Persons delivering electricity shall collect tax from the purchaser
by adding such tax to the gross charge for delivering the electricity. Persons

The Mayor and Village Board of Trustees expressly find and declare that:
   (A)   Cigarette smoking, vaping and the use of electronic cigarettes are
dangerous to human health;
   (B)   There exists substantial scientific evidence that the use of tobacco
products causes cancer, heart disease and various other medical disorders;
   (C)   The Surgeon General of the United States has declared that nicotine
addiction from tobacco is similar to addiction to cocaine, and is the most
widespread example of drug dependence in this country;
   (D)   The Director of the National Institute On Drug Abuse concluded that
the majority of the three hundred twenty thousand (320,000) Americans who die
each year from cigarette smoking became addicted to nicotine as adolescents
before the age of legal consent;
   (E)   The National Institute On Drug Abuse found that cigarette smoking
precedes and may be predictive of adolescent illicit drug use; and
   (F)   The present legislative scheme of prohibiting sales of tobacco
products to persons under the age of eighteen (18) has proven ineffective in
preventing such persons from using tobacco products; and the State Legislature
has recently enacted Public Act 101-0002, prohibiting sales of tobacco products
to persons under the age of twenty one (21).
The enactment of this chapter directly pertains to and is in furtherance of the
health, welfare and safety of the residents of the Village, particularly those

the purpose nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to
sexually oriented entertainment protected by the first amendment, or to deny
access by distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to
their intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this
chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of
entertainment that is obscene.
   (C)   Findings: Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of sexually oriented businesses presented to the municipality from findings
incorporated in the cases of City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 120
S.Ct. 1382 (2000); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of
Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini
Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); Berg v. Health and Hospital Corporation, 865 F.2d
797 (7th Cir. 1989); Ellwest Stereo Theaters v. Wenner, 681 F.2d 1243 (9th Cir.
1982); Bamon Corp v. City of Dayton, 730 F.Supp. 80 (S.D. Ohio, 1990); and EWAP
Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 97 Cal.App. 3d 179, 158 Cal.Rptr. (1979), and on
studies in other cities including the "Report Of The Attorney General's Working
Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses" (Minnesota, 1989);
"Memorandum Re: Adult Entertainment Ordinance", of the assistant chief of
police of Tucson, Arizona (May 1, 1990); Hecht, Peter R., Ph.D., "Report To The
American Center For Law And Justice On The Secondary Impacts Of Sex Oriented
Businesses" (March 31, 1996); "Adult Entertainment Businesses In Indianapolis,
An Analysis" (1984) and McCleary, Richard, Ph.D., and Meeker, James W., Ph.D.,
"Final Report To The City Of Garden Grove: The Relationship Between Crime And
Adult Business Operations On Garden Grove Boulevard", (Garden Grove,
California, October 23, 1991), this legislative body finds:
      1.   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary, unlawful
and unhealthy activities.
      2.   Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral sex and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually
oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable
diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      3.   Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
      4.   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      5.   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented
films concealed from public view.
      6.   The findings noted in subsections (C)1 through (C)5 of this section
raise compelling and substantial governmental concerns.
      7.   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics, which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those compelling and
substantial governmental concerns.
      8.   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented
businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare
of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the municipality. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, and fully in possession and control
of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      9.   The regulation of nudity, seminudity, and physical contact between
employees and patrons in sexually oriented businesses will further the
compelling and substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution
and other sex related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the
public health, safety, and welfare.
      10.   Requiring open sight lines in sexually oriented businesses and
requiring sufficient lighting will advance the compelling and substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity
occurring in sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and local laws, thereby
furthering the compelling and substantial governmental interest in protecting
the public health, safety, and welfare.
      11.   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented
businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, and will thereby further the compelling and substantial government
interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      12.   A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually
oriented business.
      13.   Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in
sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and
prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct
which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. (Ord. 2004-
3838, 5-17-2004)

5-1-11: ZONING MAP AND DISTRICT BOUNDARIES:
   (A)   Official Zoning Map. In accordance with 65 ILCS 5/11-13-19, the
Village Board shall cause to be published no later than March 31 of each year a
zoning map clearly showing the existing zoning, divisions, restrictions,
regulations and classifications of the Village for the preceding calendar year.
   (B)   Zoning Map Maintenance. The Zoning Administrator is responsible for
directing revisions to the Village’s geographic information system and the
official zoning map to reflect zoning map amendments after the effective date
of zoning map amendments. No unauthorized person shall alter or modify the
Village’s geographic information system or official zoning map. The Zoning
Administrator may authorize printed copies of the official zoning map to be
produced and maintain digital or printed copies of superseded versions of the
official zoning map for historical reference.
   (C)   Zoning district boundary lines must be described by legal description
or by a map that accompanies the ordinance establishing the district or
amending the district boundaries. When a legal description is used, the zoning
district boundary is deemed to extend to the centerline of abutting streets.
When a map is used, district boundary lines must be established by dimensions,
property lines, recorded lot lines, or the centerline of abutting streets,
alleys, or railroad rights-of-way, as those features were of record at the time
of adoption.
   (D)   Zoning Map Interpretations. Where any uncertainty exists about a
zoning boundary, the legal description governs. When there is no legal
description of the zoning district boundary, the Zoning Administrator is
authorized to make an interpretation of the zoning map using the following
rules of interpretation or refer the matter to the Planning and Zoning
Commission, in which case they must also use the following rules of
interpretation:
      1.   A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately following lot
lines or section lines will be construed as following those lot lines or
section lines.
      2.   A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately following a
street, alley or railroad line will be construed as following the centerline of
the street, alley or railroad right-of-way.
      3.   A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately following the
boundary of a municipality will be construed as following that boundary.
      4.   A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately following the
shoreline or centerline of a river, stream, lake or other water body will be
construed as following the actual shoreline or centerline of that water body.
If, subsequent to the establishment of the boundary, the shoreline or
centerline of the watercourse moves as a result of natural processes (flooding,
erosion, sedimentation, etc.), the boundary will be construed as moving with
the shoreline or centerline of the water body.
      5.   A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately parallel to, or
as an apparent extension of, a feature described above will be construed as
being actually parallel to, or an extension of, the feature.
   (E)   Split-zoned lots. The zoning map shall not be amended to classify a
single lot into two or more base zoning districts.
      1.   The split zoning of any newly created lot (into more than one base
zoning district classification) is prohibited.
      2.   When an existing lot is classified in two or more base zoning
classifications prior to the effective date of this ordinance, the more
restrictive provisions of the subject zoning districts, including but not
limited to, use, parking, signs, setbacks, height and other lot and building
regulations, shall be applied to the entire lot.
   (F)   Zoning of Public Ways and Rights-of-way. All streets, alleys, public
ways and railroad rights-of-way, if not otherwise specifically designated, will
be deemed to be in the same zoning district as the property in the most
restrictive classification immediately abutting the street, alley, public way
or railroad rights-of-way. If the centerline of a street, alley, public way or
railroad right-of-way serves as a zoning district boundary, the zoning of such
areas, unless otherwise specifically designated, will be deemed to be the same
as that of the abutting property up to the centerline.
      1.   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by
official action of the Village Board, the zoning district adjoining each side
of such street, alley or public way is automatically extended to the centerline
of such a vacation (or to the reversionary owner should such reversionary
rights be different than the centerline of the right-of-way).
   (G)   Zoning of Annexed Land. When land is annexed or otherwise brought into
the zoning jurisdiction of the Village, it is automatically classified in the
R-1 zoning district. (Ord. 2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-1-12: TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS:
The provisions of this section address the transition from the previous zoning
ordinance (the one in effect before the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance).
   (A)   Applications, Permits and Approvals. Any building, development or
structure for which a building permit was issued or a complete permit
application had been accepted for processing before the effective date of this
Zoning Ordinance may be completed in conformance with the issued building
permit and other applicable permits and conditions, even if such building,
development or structure does not comply with provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance. If the building is not commenced within the time allowed under the
original building permit, the building, development or structure may be
constructed, completed and occupied only if it complies with the regulations of
this Zoning Ordinance.
   (B)   Applications for special uses, variations or other zoning approvals
that were submitted in complete form and are pending approval before the
effective date of this ordinance must be reviewed wholly under the terms of the
zoning ordinance in effect immediately before the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance. Building permits for construction and development approved under
such zoning approvals may be issued even if such building, development or
structure does not fully comply with provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. If
building is not commenced within the time allowed under the building permit,
then the building, development or structure may be constructed, completed and
occupied only if it complies with the regulations of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (C)   When a use classified as a special use under this Zoning Ordinance
exists as a permitted use on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, that
use will be considered a lawfully established special use under this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (D)   When an approved variance or special use has been lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, such variance or special
use shall be deemed valid subject to any conditions placed thereon at the time
of approval.
   (E)   When any amendment to this Zoning Ordinance changes the classification
of a permitted use to a special use, any use lawfully established before such
amendment will be considered a lawfully established special use after the
effective date of the amendment.
   (F)   A lawfully established existing use that is not allowed as a special
use or permitted use in the district in which the use is now located under this
Zoning Ordinance will be considered a nonconforming use and will be subject to
all applicable regulations of Chapter 10 of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (G)   Violations Continue. Any violation of the previous zoning ordinance
will continue to be a violation under this Zoning Ordinance and be subject to
enforcement under Chapter 19 of this Zoning Ordinance.
      1.   If the use, development, construction or other activity that was a
violation under the previous zoning ordinance complies with the express terms
of this Zoning Ordinance, enforcement action will cease, except to the extent
of collecting penalties for violations that occurred before the effective date
of this ordinance.
      2.   The adoption of this Zoning Ordinance does not affect any pending or
future prosecution of, or action to abate, violations of the previous zoning
ordinance that occurred before the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance.
      3.   Any nonconformity under the previous zoning ordinance will also be
nonconformity under this Zoning Ordinance, as long as the situation that
resulted in the nonconforming status under the previous regulation continues to
exist.
         (a)   If, however, a nonconforming situation under previous zoning
regulations becomes conforming because of the adoption of this Zoning
Ordinance, or any subsequent amendment to it, then the situation will no longer
be considered a nonconformity.
         (b)   A situation that did not constitute a (lawful) nonconforming
situation under the previously adopted zoning ordinance does not achieve
(lawful) nonconforming status under this Zoning Ordinance merely by repeal of
the previous zoning ordinance. (Ord. 2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-1-13: SEVERABILITY:
If any portion of this Zoning Ordinance is held to be invalid or
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, that portion is to be
deemed severed from the zoning ordinance and in no way affects or diminishes
the validity of the remainder of the zoning ordinance. (Ord. 2021-4931, 11-15-
2021)

allowed if reviewed and approved in accordance with the special use permit
procedures in Chapter 17 of this Zoning Ordinance. Special uses are subject to
compliance with any use-specific standards identified in the final column of
the table and with all other applicable regulations of this Zoning Ordinance.
   D.   Prohibited uses. Uses identified with an “-“ are expressly prohibited.
Uses that are not listed in the use table and that cannot reasonably be
interpreted to fall within a use category, subcategory, or specific use type
are also prohibited. See Section
5-7-3-4 for use interpretation rules.
   E.   Use supplemental regulations. The “supplemental regulations” column of
use table identifies use-specific standards that apply to some uses. Unless
otherwise expressly stated, compliance with such standards is required
regardless of whether the use is permitted as-of-right or requires special use
approval.
   F.   Accessory uses. Accessory uses and structures are permitted in
conjunction with allowed principal uses, provided they comply with all
applicable regulations of Chapter 8 of this Zoning Ordinance. (Ord. 2021-4931,
11-15-2021)
5-7-3: USE CLASSIFICATIONS:
   A.   Use Categories. This Zoning Ordinance classifies principal uses into
the following five use categories:
      1.   Residential
      2.   Public, Civic, and Institutional
      3.   Business
      4.   Industrial
      5.   Other
   B.   Use Subcategories. Each use category is further divided into more
specific subcategories. Use subcategories classify principal uses and
activities based on common function, products, or physical characteristics.
Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, types of customers or
residents, and how goods are produced, sold, or delivered.
      1.   Use subcategories may include a list of items or examples preceded
by the phrase “typical uses include.” The listed items or examples are intended
to assist with classification only. They are not to be construed as exhaustive
lists of all possibilities.
   C.   Specific Use Types. Some use subcategories are further divided to
identify a specific use, business, or activity that are regulated differently
than the subcategory.
   D.   Determination of use category and subcategory
      1.   The Zoning Administrator is authorized to classify uses on the basis
of use category and subcategory descriptions in this chapter.
      2.   When a use cannot be readily classified into a use category or
subcategory or appears to fit into multiple categories or subcategories, the
Zoning Administrator is authorized to determine the most similar, and most
appropriate use category/subcategory based on the actual or projected
characteristics of the principal use or activity in relationship to the use
category and subcategory descriptions provided in this Chapter. In making such
determinations, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to consider all of the
following:
         (a)   The types of activities that will occur in conjunction with the
use;
         (b)   The types of equipment and processes to be used;
         (c)   The existence, number and frequency of residents, customers or
employees;
         (e)   Parking demands associated with the use; and
         (e)   Other factors deemed relevant to a use determination.
      3.   If a use can be classified in multiple categories, subcategories or
specific use types, the Zoning Administrator must categorize the use in the
category, subcategory or specific use type that provides the narrowest and
restrictive match.
      4.   If the Zoning Administrator is unable to determine the appropriate
use category for a proposed use, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to deny
the permit request. This decision may be appealed in accordance with Chapter 17
of this Zoning Ordinance. (Ord. 2021-4931, 11-15-2021)

5-10-1: GENERAL:
The regulations of this Chapter govern nonconformities, which are lots, uses
and structures that were lawfully established but-because of the adoption of
new or amended regulations-no longer comply with one or more requirements of
this Zoning Ordinance.
   (A)   Nonconforming status runs with the land and is not affected by changes
of tenancy, ownership, or management. (Ord. 2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-10-2: PURPOSES:
The regulations of this Chapter are intended to:
   (A)   Recognize the interests of landowners in continuing to use their
property for uses and activities that were lawfully established;
   (B)   Promote maintenance, reuse and rehabilitation of existing buildings;
and
   (C)   Place reasonable limits on nonconformities that have the potential to
adversely affect surrounding properties. (Ord. 2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-10-3: AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE:
Any nonconformity that existed on the effective date specified in Chapter 1 of
this Zoning Ordinance or any situation that becomes nonconforming upon adoption
of any amendment to this Zoning Ordinance may be continued in accordance with
the regulations of this Chapter, unless otherwise expressly stated. (Ord. 2021-
4931, 11-15-2021)
5-10-4: DETERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING STATUS:
The burden of proving that a nonconformity exists rests entirely with the
property owner.
   (A)   The Zoning Administrator is authorized to determine whether adequate
proof of nonconforming status has been provided by the property owner. In
making this determination, the following forms shall constitute conclusive
evidence:
      1.   Certificates of occupancy or completion, lawfully recorded plats,
aerial photography and other records that indicate lawful establishment of the
use, lot or structure.
   (B)   If such forms of conclusive evidence are not available, the Zoning
Administrator is authorized to consider whether other forms of evidence
provided by the property owner are reliable and adequate to document
nonconforming status. Common examples of evidence that may be determined to be
reliable and adequate include:
      1.   Professional registrations or business licenses;
      2.   Utility billing records;
      3.   Rent records;
      4.   Advertisements in dated publications; and
      5.   Listings in telephone or business directories.

be supported by written findings.
   (D)   The Zoning Administrator’s determination of nonconforming status may
be appealed in accordance with Chapter 17 of this Zoning Ordinance. (Ord. 2021-
4931, 11-15-2021)

   (A)   Nonconformities must be maintained to be safe and in good repair.
   (B)   Repairs and normal maintenance necessary to keep a nonconformity in
sound condition are permitted unless the work increases the extent of the
nonconformity or is otherwise expressly prohibited by this Zoning Ordinance.
   (C)   Nothing in this Chapter is intended to prevent nonconformities from
being structurally strengthened or restored to a safe condition in accordance
with an order from a duly authorized order of a public official. (Ord. 2021-
4931, 11-15-2021)
5-10-6: REPLACEMENT VALUES:
   (A)   Replacement value for all structures is deemed to be three times the
equalized assessed valuation of the improvement (based upon information
obtained from the DuPage County Supervisor of Assessments or Township Assessor)
for the tax year in which the loss occurred.
      1.   The Zoning Administrator is authorized to accept an appraisal
prepared by an Illinois licensed Appraiser for the purpose of determining
replacement value.
      2.   The Zoning Administrator is authorized to accept a construction
quote that includes materials and labor for the purpose of determining
replacement value for an accessory structure. (Ord. 2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-10-7: EFFECT OF PUBLIC ACQUISITION:
If a lot, use, or structure is rendered nonconforming by acquisition by a
public agency, the lot, use, or structure is deemed to be conforming. (Ord.
2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-10-8: NONCONFORMING LOTS:
   (A)   General
A nonconforming lot is a lot that was lawfully created in accordance with lot
area and lot frontage regulations in effect at the time of the lot’s
establishment but that does not comply with currently applicable lot area or
lot frontage regulations.
      1.   Use of and building on nonconforming lots. Development on all
nonconforming lots must comply with the lot and building standards of the
subject zoning district.
         (a)   Exception. Building permits may be issued for any principal or
accessory uses and structures allowed in the subject zoning district without
bringing the nonconforming lot into compliance with the current lot area or lot
frontage standards of the subject zoning district.
   (B)   Nonconforming lots shall not be adjusted in size or shape to increase
the extent of nonconformity for lot area, lot frontage, setback or other
applicable lot and building standards. Lot area or shape adjustments that
decrease the extent of nonconformity are allowed. (Ord. 2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-10-9: NONCONFORMING USES:
   (A)   General
A nonconforming use is a land use that was lawfully established in accordance
with applicable zoning regulations in effect at the time of its establishment
but that is no longer allowed by the use regulations of the zoning district in
which the use is now located.
   (B)   Change of use. A nonconforming use may be changed to any other use
that is allowed in the subject zoning district. Once changed to a conforming
use, a nonconforming use shall not be re-established.
   (C)   Expansion Prohibited
      1.   A nonconforming use shall not be expanded into another part of the
same building.
      2.   Nonconforming open-air uses shall not be expanded beyond the area
occupied by the use at the time it became nonconforming.
      3.   Expansion for the sole purpose of complying with off-street parking
standards of this Zoning Ordinance is not considered expansion of a
nonconforming use.
   (D)   Remodeling and improvements. When a building containing a
nonconforming use is remodeled, intentionally damaged, or destroyed by causes
within the control of the owner and the extent of remodeling, damage, or
destruction is more than 50% of the replacement value of the structure, the use
shall not be reestablished except in compliance with all regulations applicable
to the zoning district in which it is located.
   (E)   Moving. A nonconforming use may be moved in whole or in part to
another location on the same lot only if the movement or relocation does not
increase the extent of the nonconformity. A nonconforming use may be moved to
another lot only if the use is allowed under the zoning regulations that apply
to that (relocation) lot.
   (F)   Loss of Nonconforming Status
      1.   Abandonment
         (a)   Once a nonconforming use is abandoned, its nonconforming status
is lost and any new, replacement use must comply with the regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located.
         (b)   A nonconforming use is presumed abandoned when the use is
discontinued or ceases for a continuous period of one year or more.
         (c)   The presumption of abandonment may be rebutted upon showing, to
the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator, that during such period the owner
of the land or structure has been:
            (1)   Maintaining the land and structure in accordance with all
applicable Village requirements and did not intend to discontinue the use;
            (2)   Actively and continuously marketing the land or structure for
sale or lease for that particular nonconforming use; or
            (3)   Engaged in other activities that affirmatively prove there
was not intent to abandon.
      2.   Abandonment Exceptions
         (a)   Any period of discontinued use caused by government action,
unintended fire, or natural disaster will not be counted in calculating the
length of discontinuance.
   (G)   Change to Conforming Use. If a nonconforming use is changed to a
conforming use, no matter how short the period of time, all nonconforming use
rights are lost and re-establishment of the nonconforming use is prohibited.
   (H)   Accidental damage or destruction. When a building containing a
nonconforming use is accidentally destroyed or damaged by causes that are not
within the control of the property owner or tenant, the building may be
restored or repaired, provided that no new nonconformities are created and that
the existing extent of nonconformity is not increased. A building permit to
reconstruct a destroyed or damaged structure must be obtained within 12 months
of the date of occurrence of such damage.
   (I)   Accessory uses. No use that is accessory to a principal nonconforming
use may continue after the principal nonconforming use has ceased.
   (J)   Conversion to special use. A nonconforming use may be converted to a
special use by the granting of a special use permit, in accordance with the
special use permit procedures of Chapter 17 of this Zoning Ordinance. This
conversion may occur only when it is shown that the nonconforming use is
providing a particular service to the residents of the Village and that the use
is not detrimental to the Village as a whole or to surrounding properties.
(Ord. 2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-10-10: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:

regulations established in Chapter 11 of this Zoning Ordinance.
      2.   Structures that comply with building or setback lines indicated on a
final subdivision plat, recorded after June 3, 1958, rather than the minimum
setbacks of the subject zoning district are considered conforming structures.
Permits may be issued for new buildings and building additions that comply with
building or setback lines indicated on recorded final subdivision plats,
recorded after June 3, 1958, subject to compliance with all other applicable
regulations of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (B)   Use of Nonconforming Structures. A nonconforming structure may be used
for any use that is permitted by right in the zoning district in which the

may be used for any use classified as a special use if such use is approved in
accordance with the special use procedures of Chapter 17 of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (C)   Alterations and expansions. Alterations, including enlargements and
expansions, are permitted if the proposed alteration or expansion complies with
all applicable lot and building standards and does not increase the extent of
the nonconformity. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence:
      1.   Front street, side street and rear yard vertical extensions: Any
portion of a nonconforming structure that is nonconforming with respect to a
required front street, side street, or rear yard setback may be extended
vertically within its existing perimeter walls but shall not be extended
horizontally; and
      2.   Side yard vertical extensions: Any portion of a nonconforming
structure that is nonconforming with respect to a required side yard setback
may be extended vertically within its existing perimeter walls; and
      3.   Roof elevation extensions: Any portion of a nonconforming structure
that is nonconforming with respect to the permitted maximum building height may
be extended horizontally at an elevation in excess of said permitted maximum
elevation; provided, however, that the top of the roof of such extension shall
not exceed the top of the precode structure.
      4.   Roof height extensions: Any portion of a nonconforming structure
located on a conforming lot in a single-family residential district that is
nonconforming with respect to the permitted maximum height and that is a
precode structure solely due to the nonconforming height of the structure may
be extended: a) horizontally at a height in excess of said permitted maximum
height but not in excess of the roofline of the existing structure or b)
horizontally and vertically at a height in excess of the permitted maximum
height but not in excess of the height of the structure as of the date of
initial occupancy of the original structure, provided, however, that such
extension shall not be permitted where the height of the structure as of the
date of initial occupancy of the original structure exceeded the maximum height
authorized by law; and, in either case, such extension shall not extend more
than twenty four inches (24") beyond the exterior face of the exterior walls of
said existing structure.
   (D)   Moving. A nonconforming structure may be moved in whole or in part to
another location only if the movement or relocation does not increase the
extent of the nonconformity. This provision is not intended to prohibit
elevation of a nonconforming structure for the purpose of flood proofing or
repair.
   (E)   Loss of Nonconforming Status
      1.   Accidental damage or destruction. When a nonconforming structure is
accidentally destroyed or damaged by causes that are not within the control of
the owner, the structure may be restored or repaired, provided that no new
nonconformities are created and that the existing extent of nonconformity is
not increased. A building permit to reconstruct a destroyed or damaged
structure must be obtained within 12 months of the date of occurrence of such
damage.
      2.   Remodeling and improvements. When a nonconforming structure is
remodeled, intentionally damaged, or destroyed by causes within the control of
the owner and the extent of the remodeling, damage or destruction is more than
50% of the replacement value of the structure, the structure shall not be
reestablished except in compliance with all regulations applicable to the
zoning district in which it is located.
   (F)   Conversion to special use. A nonconforming structure may be converted
to a special use by the granting of a special use permit, in accordance with
the special use permit procedures of Chapter 17 of this Zoning Ordinance. This
conversion may occur only when it is shown that the nonconforming structure is
providing a particular service to the residents of Village and that the use is
not detrimental to the Village as a whole or to surrounding properties. (Ord.
2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-10-11: NONCONFORMING DEVELOPMENT FEATURES:
   (A)   General
A nonconforming development feature is any aspect of a development-other than a
nonconforming lot, nonconforming use, nonconforming structure, or nonconforming
sign that was lawfully established, in accordance with zoning regulations in
effect at the time of its establishment but that no longer complies with one or
more standards of this Zoning Ordinance. Common examples of nonconforming
development features are off-street parking or loading areas that contain fewer
spaces than required by current standards or otherwise do not comply with

5-11-7: RULES OF MEASUREMENT:
The following criteria shall be used in measuring a sign or building facade in
order to determine compliance with this Chapter. The illustrations provided in
this Section are provided to offer clarification, not replace the written
requirements of this Chapter. These illustrations do not reflect every sign
type.
   (A)   Sign Area, Ground Sign
      1.   The sign area shall be the extreme outer dimension of the ground
structure, excluding the support structure and architectural features. For
ground signs that contain multiple cabinets on one structure, the modules
together are counted as one sign face in order to compute the sign area.
   (B)   Sign Height, Ground Sign
      1.   The overall height of a ground sign or sign structure is measured
from the average finished grade at the base of the sign to the highest point of
the sign structure.

   (C)   Sign Setback, Ground Sign
      1.   The minimum setback of a ground sign shall be the distance from the
extreme outer dimension of the structure to the applicable property line. This
extreme outer dimension shall include, but not be limited to, the sign face,
support structures, and architectural features.
   (D)   Ground Sign, Landscape Requirement
      1.     Ground Sign (Landscape Requirement): The landscape requirement is
determined by calculating the area of the landscaped area located around the
base of the ground sign. Examples of a rectangular and circular area are
provided below:

IMAGES/0-0-0-2896.png]
   (E)   Sign Area, Wall Sign (Single Element)
      1.   The sign area is determined by calculating the measurement of the
outer dimensions of the frame surrounding the sign. See Illustration below.
   (F)   Sign Area, Wall Sign (Multiple Elements)
      1.   When signs are constructed of individual letters and / or elements,
the area will be measured as one sign when the distance between the elements is
less than the largest dimension of the largest sign letter or element. The sign
area is determined by calculating the combined area of an imaginary rectangle,
circle, triangle, or parallelogram drawn around the sign elements. See
Illustrations below.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2898.png]
 
   (G)    Sign Area, Awning And Canopy
      1.    When signs are incorporated into the awning or canopy, the sign
area is determined by calculating the combined area of an imaginary rectangle,
circle, triangle, or parallelogram drawn around the sign elements. See
Illustration below.
   (H)   Measurement of Qualifying Façade
      1.   Qualifying facades include facades that directly face public or
private streets, sidewalks, alleys, courtyards, and parking lots.
      2.   For the purposes of determining maximum wall sign area:
         (a)   The linear width of first floor tenant spaces shall be
calculated as the width of the exterior building wall (or walls) that directly
abut the tenant’s interior floor space. Exterior wall dimensions shall be
measured at the base of the ground floor, excluding screened walls, fences,
etc. Alcoves, entryways and extruding portions shall be measured through as
though along a flat wall of a building.
         (b)    All tenant spaces located above or below the first floor of a
building shall be eligible for a combined / cumulative pool of wall sign square
footage equal to one-half (1/2) the width of the overall qualifying facade on
which these wall signs are located.

intensity or brilliance that they impair the vision or endanger the safety and
welfare of any pedestrian, cyclist, or person operating a motor vehicle.
      4.   Changeable copy displays must be equipped with a light detector /
photocell that automatically adjusts the display’s brightness according to
natural ambient light conditions.
      5.   Brightness
         (a)   The maximum brightness level of a changeable copy display shall
not exceed 5,000 nits (candelas per square meter) during daylight hours or 250
nits between 30 minutes after sunset and 30 minutes before sunrise, as those
times are determined by the National Weather Service (Actual Time).
         (b)   Brightness must be measured from the brightest element of the
sign’s face. Before the issuance of a sign permit, the applicant must provide
written certification from the sign manufacturer that the light intensity has
been factory pre-set so that it will not exceed 5,000 nits (candelas per square
meter).
         (c)   For the purpose of verifying compliance with maximum brightness
level requirements, the Zoning Administrator will measure brightness levels
with the changeable copy display sign set to run full white copy with a
luminance meter positioned at a location perpendicular to the sign face center.
When taking the luminance reading, the sign face must be the only subject
visible in the viewfinder. If the measurement is more than the maximum allowed,
the brightness level is in violation of this Section and must be adjusted
downward. Failure to make such adjustments may result in other available
enforcement actions to be taken by the Village.
         (d)   Light trespass from any changeable copy display shall not cause
the light level along a property line adjoining any residentially zoned
property, as measured at a height of 60 inches above grade in a in a plane at
any angle of inclination, to exceed 0.1 foot-candles above ambient light levels
at the property line adjoining the residentially zoned property. (Ord. 2021-

Regulations relating to landscaping and tree preservation are listed below.
When this ordinance refers to landscaping or tree preservation, it is referring
to this Chapter. (Ord. 2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-12-2: PURPOSES:
This purpose of this Chapter is to establish uniform landscaping and tree
preservation standards for development of property in the Village in order to
ensure that the Village remains attractive, safe and comfortable:
   (A)   To promote, protect and preserve the general health and safety of the
people of the community and, as part of the general welfare, ensure aesthetic
compatibility among land uses within the community;
   (B)   To conserve soil and reduce soil erosion, reduce stormwater runoff, to
provide oxygen regeneration to enhance air quality, and to reduce the effects
of urban heat islands;
   (C)   To minimize the harmful or nuisance effects resulting from noise,
dust, debris, motor exhaust, headlight glare, artificial light intrusions,
objectionable sight or activities, or similar incompatible impacts conducted or
created by adjoining or nearby land use;
   (D)   To safeguard the environmental quality and aesthetic character of the
community by limiting the removal and ensuring replacement of trees upon
private property within the Village;
   (E)   To preserve, insofar as practical, existing vegetation and
topographical features by limiting unnecessary clearing and modification of
land, encouraging the retention of existing mature trees, requiring the
replacement of indigenous trees with approved species; and
   (F)   To encourage the energy efficient operation of land uses in the public
interest. (Ord. 2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-12-3: APPLICABILITY:
The landscaping requirements of this Chapter apply as set forth in the

      3.   When the development is associated with a plat of subdivision or re-
subdivision.
   (B)   Standards
      1.   Parkway Turf
         (a)   All parkways shall be fine graded with a minimum of six inches
(6") of topsoil and sodded. Sod shall be a Kentucky bluegrass blend and grown

         (b)   Number of trees required. One parkway tree shall be provided for
every 40 feet of road frontage. For road frontages of less than 40, a minimum
of one parkway tree is required. When measurement for the number of parkway
trees required results in a fractional number, any fraction of less than one-
half (0.5) is rounded down to the next whole number, and any fraction of one-
half (0.5) or more is rounded up to the next whole number.
         (c)   Required spacing of trees. Parkway trees may be clustered or
irregularly spaced, but the maximum spacing of parkway trees shall not exceed

5-13-1: GENERAL:
The Village’s regulations relating to off street parking are listed below. When
this Ordinance refers to Off Street Parking, it is referring to this Chapter.
(Ord. 2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-13-2: PURPOSES:
   (A)   The regulations of this Chapter are intended to:
      1.   Ensure provision of off-street motor vehicle parking facilities,
bicycle parking and other transportation circulation facilities in rough
proportion to the generalized demands of different land uses.
      2.   Avoid the negative impacts associated with spillover parking into
adjacent areas.
      3.   Avoid the negative environmental and visual impacts that can result
from unnecessarily large parking and vehicular use areas.
      4.   Protect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      5.   Enhance safety and convenience for non-motorized travel.
      6.   Providing flexible methods of responding to the transportation and
access demands of various land uses in different areas of the Village. (Ord.
2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-13-3: SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY:
The provisions of this Chapter shall apply as follows.
   (A)   General. Unless otherwise stated, the regulations of this Chapter
apply to all zoning districts and all uses.
   (B)   Scope of Regulations:
      1.   The regulations of this Chapter apply to all buildings and
structures erected and all uses of land established after the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance.
      2.   Increase in Intensity of Use: When the intensity of use of any
building, structure, or parcel of land is increased by the addition of dwelling
units, gross floor area, design capacity, employees, or other units of
measurement specified herein for required off street parking facilities, off
street parking shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use. In the
case of increase in intensity of use, additional spaces are required only to
serve the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire building or use. In other
words, there is no requirement to address lawfully existing parking space
deficits.
      3.   Decrease in Intensity of Use: When the intensity of use of any
building, structure, or parcel of land is decreased by the reduction of
dwelling units, gross floor area, design capacity, employees, or other units of
measurement specified herein for required off street parking facilities, and
further, when the decrease would result in a requirement for fewer total off
street parking spaces, off street parking facilities may be reduced
accordingly, provided that existing off street parking facilities shall be so
decreased only when the facilities remaining will at least equal or exceed the
off street parking requirements resulting from application of the standards of
this Chapter to the use of the entire building, structure, or parcel of land as
modified.
      4.   Change of Use: Whenever the existing use of a building, structure,
or parcel of land is hereafter changed to a new use, off street parking
facilities as required herein shall be provided for such new use.
   (C)   Time of Construction of Off Street Parking Facilities:
      1.   Off street parking facilities, as required by this Chapter, shall be
constructed at the time of erection, establishment, alteration, or enlargement
of the building, structure, or use of land they are required to serve.
Occupancy or use shall not be established until the required parking facilities
have been installed. (Ord. 2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-13-4: CALCULATION OF REQUIRED PARKING:
The following rules apply when calculating the required number of off-street
parking spaces:
   (A)   Multiple Uses:
      1.   Unless otherwise expressly allowed in accordance with the shared
parking regulations of this Chapter, lots containing more than one use must
provide parking in an amount equal to the sum total of the requirements for all
uses that occupy the lot.
   (B)   Fractions
      1.   When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a
fractional number, any fraction of less than one-half (0.5) is rounded down to
the next whole number, and any fraction of one-half (0.5) or more is rounded up
to the next whole number.
   (C)   Area Measurements
      1.   Unless otherwise expressly stated, all area-based (square footage)
parking standards must be computed based on the sum of the gross floor area of
a building devoted to a use requiring off-street parking.
      2.   The following areas shall not be included in the sum of gross floor
area for the purpose of calculating off-street parking requirements:
         (a)   Floor space devoted primarily to the housing of mechanical or
electrical equipment.
         (b)   Elevator shafts and stairwells,
         (c)   Commercial kitchen areas, ramps, aisles, and maneuvering space
devoted to off-street parking or loading facilities.
         (d)   Basement floor space used exclusively for storage activities.
         (e)   Storage areas, or areas used for incidental repair, processing
or packaging of merchandise.
         (f)   Show windows.
         (g)   Toilet or rest room areas.
         (h)    Dressing rooms, fitting or alteration rooms.
   (D)   Occupancy Based Standards
      1.   For the purpose of computing off-street parking requirements based
on occupancy, calculations must be based on the occupant load factor
established by the Village’s adopted building codes.
   (E)   Seating Based Standards
      1.   A seat is the space intended for a single individual. In places
where patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews, or other similar seating
arrangements, each 20 linear inches of such seating is counted as one seat. In
places without fixed seating, each 8 square feet of seating floor area is
counted as one seat.
   (F).   Employees
      1.   For the purpose of computing requirements based on number of
employees, calculations shall be based on the average number of persons working
on any single shift.
   (G)   Unlisted Uses
      1.   Upon receiving an application for a use not specifically listed in
the off-street parking schedule, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to
apply the off-street parking ratio specified for the listed use that is deemed
most similar to the proposed use or to establish a minimum off-street parking
requirement for the proposed use in accordance this Chapter.
   (H)   Establishment of Other Parking Ratios
      1.   The Zoning Administrator is authorized to establish required minimum
off street parking ratios in those instances where authority to establish a
requirement is expressly granted. Such ratios may be established on the basis
of a similar use/parking determination, on parking data provided by the
applicant, or information otherwise available to the Zoning Administrator.
         (a)   Parking data and studies must include estimates of parking
demand based on reliable data collected from comparable uses or on external
data from credible research organizations (e.g., Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) or American Planning Association (APA)).
      2.   Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type
of activity and location. Parking studies must document the source of all data
used to develop recommended requirements.
   (I)   Accessible Parking for People With Disabilities:
      1.   Parking provided in accordance with Illinois Accessibility Code
shall count towards the total number of parking spaces required. (Ord. 2021-
4931, 11-15-2021; amd. Ord. 2023-5042, 12-18-2023)

CHAPTER 20
MEASUREMENTS, OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, AND DEFINITIONS
SECTION:
5-20-1: Lot Area, Frontage, And Coverage
5-20-2: Setbacks
5-20-3: Permitted Projections
5-20-4: Building Height
5-20-5: Fence Height
5-20-6: Operational Performance Standards
5-20-7: Definitions
5-20-1: LOT AREA, FRONTAGE, AND COVERAGE:
   (A)   Lot Area. Lot area includes the total land area contained within the
property lines of a lot.
   (B)   Lot Frontage. Lot frontage is measured along the right-of-way line
between opposite-side boundaries of the lot. Lot frontage on cul-de-sac bulbs
is measured at the actual building line. The lot frontage of a lot or parcel
that is legally created or described as extending to the center line of a
street must be measured along the line that denotes the edge or boundary of the
easement established for the street.
   (C)   Lot Coverage. The total area of a lot improved with structures and
impervious surfaces. Lot coverage is expressed as a percentage of the total lot
area. Lot coverage does not include the following:
      1.   Swimming pools and spas
      2.   Decks
      3.   Permeable asphalt, concrete, or paver systems
      4.   Landscape rock beds
      5.   The lot coverage calculation shall be reduced for principal or
accessory buildings improved with green roof systems. The reduction shall be
equal to the total area of the green roof system.
      6.   Public improvements
      7.   The maximum lot coverage calculation for planned unit developments
containing residential uses approved prior to November 6, 2006 shall only
include the principal building, accessory buildings, and driveway
   (D)   Building Coverage. Building coverage is the area of a lot covered by
principal and accessory buildings. Building coverage is expressed as a
percentage of the total lot area. Only building areas beneath a roof are
counted for purposes of measuring building coverage.
      1.   The building coverage calculation shall be reduced for principal or
accessory buildings improved with green roof systems. The reduction shall be
equal to the total area of the green roof system. (Ord. 2021-4931, 11-15-2021)
5-20-2: SETBACKS:
   (A)   Front Street Setbacks
      1.   Measurement. Front street setbacks are measured from the right-of-
way line to the closest point of the building or structure.
      2.   Permitted Obstructions / Encroachments. Unless specifically
authorized by this Ordinance, front street setbacks must be unobstructed from
the ground to the sky.
      3.   Double Frontage Lots. On double-frontage lots, the Zoning
Administrator is authorized to establish which of the frontages constitutes the
front lot line (and is thereby subject to front street setback regulations)
based on factors such as the pattern of front and rear yards on the subject
block, existing limitations on street access, where the building’s “front” door
is located or other reasonable considerations. Only such obstructions permitted
in front street setback may be located in that part of a rear setback adjoining
a street that is equivalent in depth to a required front setback, except for
lots backing to thoroughfares in subdivisions where no-access strips have been
provided on the recorded plat.
      4.   Front Street Exceptions. When existing buildings on one or more
abutting lots are closer to the street property line than the otherwise
required street setback, additions to existing residential buildings or
construction of new residential buildings on the subject lot may comply with
the average street yard depth that exists on the nearest 2 lots on either side
of the subject lot instead of complying with the zoning district’s minimum
street setback requirement.
         (a)    If one or more of the lots required to be included in the
averaging calculation is vacant, the vacant lot will be deemed to have a front
street yard depth equal to the minimum street setback requirement of the
subject zoning district.

         (d)   When the subject lot abuts a corner lot with frontage on the
same street, the average street yard depth will be computed on the basis of the
abutting corner lot and the nearest 2 lots with frontage on the same street as
the subject lot.
   (B)   Side Street Setbacks
      1.   Measurement. Side street setbacks are measured from the right-of-way
line to the closest point of the building or structure.
      2.   Permitted Obstructions / Encroachments. Unless specifically
authorized by this Ordinance, side street setbacks must be unobstructed from
the ground to the sky.
      3.   The zoning administrator is authorized to establish which of the
frontages constitutes the side street (and is thereby subject to side street
setback regulations) based on factors such as the pattern of front yards on the
subject blockface, existing limitations on street access, where the building’s
“front” door is located or other reasonable considerations.
   (C)   Rear Setbacks
      1.   Measurement. Rear setbacks are measured from the rear property line
to the closest point of the building or structure.
         (a)   In subdivisions improved with townhouses, duplexes, or multi-
unit buildings, or in cases in which individual fee simple lots are surrounded
by common area, the rear setback shall be measured to the perimeter of the
subdivision.
      2.   Permitted Obstructions / Encroachments. Unless specifically
authorized by this Ordinance, rear setbacks must be unobstructed from the
ground to the sky.
      3.   Corner Lots. No rear setback is required on corner lots. A corner
lot shall have a front street, side street, and two side setbacks.
   (D)   Side Setbacks
   1.   Measurement. Side setbacks are measured from the interior or side lot
line to the closest point of the building.
      (a)   In subdivisions improved with townhouses, duplexes, or multi-unit
buildings, or in cases in which individual fee simple lots are surrounded by
common area, the side setback shall be measured to the perimeter of the
subdivision.
   2.   Permitted Obstructions / Encroachments. Unless specifically authorized
by this Ordinance, side setbacks must be unobstructed from the ground to the

purpose which is described in the easement. Public easements are dedicated
either to the "public" or to a specific governmental unit. Public easements are
controlled by the governmental unit that has jurisdiction over the land in
question for the purpose designated in the easement. Easements are defined by
how they are created, to whom they are dedicated, or how they are used.

platting process or through public use over a prolonged period of time. Common
law dedication of a right-of-way results in an easement in favor of the public,
not an ownership interest of a governmental unit. This Section covers statutory
dedication of right-of-way.

payment of the land value as determined by an appraisal report, prepared by an
Illinois licensed Appraiser, at a cost borne by the petitioner

6-6-1: DEDICATION OF PARK LANDS:
   As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, each subdivider
or developer will be required to dedicate land for park and recreational
purposes, to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the
development. The dedication of aforesaid land and any other land dedicated to
the village shall be accompanied by a title insurance policy acceptable to the
village attorney. A cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a
combination of both, at the option of the village, will be acceptable in
accordance with the following criteria and formula.
(Ord. 2024-5096, 10-7-2024)
6-6-2: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING PARK AND RECREATION LAND DEDICATION:
   (A)   Requirement and Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed
development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for
dedication. The total requirement shall be five and five-tenths (5.5) acres of
land per one thousand (1,000) of ultimate population in accordance with the
following classifications:
 
Types Of Recreation Areas     Size Range                Minimum Acres Per 1,000
                                                        People
Play lot                      Minimum 8,000 square feet Not applicable
School-park (neighborhood     Minimum park of 5 acres   1.25
playground)
Neighborhood park             Minimum 31/2 acres        1.0
Districtwide park or play     Minimum 4 acres up to 30  1.25
field                         acres
Communitywide recreation park Minimum 12 acres up to 30 2.0
                              acres
                                                      Total: 5.5
 
   (B)   Location: The comprehensive park and recreation plan and/or the
"Standards By Types Of Recreation And Park Areas", as adopted by the Lisle Park
District, shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A park site adjoining
all elementary school sites of not less than five (5) acres shall be considered
a requirement. A central location which will serve equally the entire
development is most desirable. In large developments, these sites can be
located throughout the development according to established standards for park
area distances.
   (C)   Credit for Private Open Spaces and Recreation Areas: When subdividers
or developers provide their own open spaces for recreation areas and
facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public
recreational services. Depending on the site of the development, a portion of
the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may,
at the option of the Village Board, be provided in the form of "private" open
space in lieu of dedicated "public" open space. The extent of same shall be
determined by the Village Board, based upon the needs of the projected
residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the
general area.
      In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will
imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of
recreational facilities, including equipment by the developer as part of his
obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of
facilities to be installed, must be approved by the village and before any
credit is given for private recreation areas, the subdivider or developer must
guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained
for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. Private
"swimming clubs" are included in this provision. When an adjustment for private
recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total park
land dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned
unit development and then subtract the credit to be given.
(Ord. 2024-5096, 10-7-2024)
6-6-3: DEDICATION OF SCHOOL SITES:
   (A)   As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, or a final
plat of planned unit development, each subdivider or developer will be required
to dedicate land for school sites, to serve the immediate and future needs of
the residents of the development. The dedication of aforesaid land and any
other land dedicated to the village shall be accompanied by a title insurance
policy acceptable to the village attorney. A cash contribution in lieu of
actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the village,
will be acceptable in accordance with the following criteria and formula.
(Ord. 2024-5096, 10-7-2024)
6-6-4: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING SCHOOL SITE DEDICATION:
   (A)   Requirement and Population Ratio: The ultimate number of students to
be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly
upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The land
dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of: 1)
estimated children to be served in each such school classification over the 2)
maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school
classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to the 3) said
minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school
classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the acres of land
deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated
increased children in each such school classification.
   (B)   School Classifications and Size of School Site: School classifications
and size of school sites within the village shall be determined in accordance
with the following criteria:
 
School Classification by  Maximum Number of Students Minimum Number of Acres of
Grades                    For Each Such School       Land For Each School Site
                          Classification             of Such Classification
Elementary Schools        600                        11
Junior high schools,      900                        19
grades 6 through 8
High schools, grades 9-12 2,300                      48
 
   (C)   Location: The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted
by the affected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites.
(Ord. 2024-5096, 10-7-2024)
6-6-5: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING A CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF PARK AND SCHOOL SITES:
   The Village shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash
contribution in lieu of or in combination with the land dedication required
when so determined by the Village. The cash contributions in lieu of park and
recreation land as hereinbefore classified, shall be available to serve the
immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development
or for the improvement of other existing local park and recreation land which
already serves such needs. The cash contributions in lieu of park land shall be
paid to and held in trust by the Village, or the park district, as determined
by the Village. The cash contributions in lieu of school sites shall be paid to
and held in trust by the Village, or the public school district, as determined
by the Village, and used solely for the acquisition of land for a school site
to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or
development or for the improvement to any existing school site which already
serves such needs. Improvement under this section shall be liberally construed
and shall include, but shall not be limited to, the development of parking
lots; sidewalks; traffic signals; arterial streets; collector streets; internal
roadways; connections with sewer, water and electrical lines; and street
lights; playgrounds; recreation grounds; athletic fields; excavation and site
preparation, and the purchase of any material, goods or equipment necessary to
said development and construction. Improvement shall further include the
construction of buildings; additions to existing school buildings; remodeled or
renovated non instructional spaces in classrooms and the purchase of
prefabricated classroom units to be used at a school site. If any portion of a
cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication or cash
contribution in lieu of school site is not expended for the purposes set forth
herein within ten (10) years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to
the developer who made such contribution.
   (A)   Fair Market Value: The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be
based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved as
specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and
recreation and school sites. It has been determined that the impact fee of such
improved land in and surrounding the Village is established in
Title 1, Chapter 20, "Fees, Fines, Insurance, Guarantees, and Regulatory
Measures" per acre and such figure shall be used in making any calculation
herein unless the subdivider or developer files a written objection thereto. In
the event of any such objection, the developer shall submit an appraisal
showing the fair market value of such improved land in the area of his
development or other evidence thereof and final determination of said fair
market value per acre of such improved land shall be made by the Village Board
based upon such information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from
other sources which may be submitted to the village board by the park district,
school district or others.
   (B)   Criteria for Requiring Dedication and a Fee: There will be situations
in subdivisions when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in
lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise when:
      1.   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a park or school site. That portion of the land within the
subdivision falling within the park or school location shall be dedicated as a
site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required
for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated;
      2.   A major part of the local park or recreational site or school site
has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the
development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by
dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.

7-1-1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
   (A)   Purpose: The purpose of this Chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for excavating, and for constructing facilities on rights-of-way
within the Village's jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent
with the preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the
Village rights-of-way and the Village as a whole.
   (B)   Intent: In enacting this Chapter, the Village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the Village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities and contractors, by establishing
uniform standards to address issues presented by small wireless facilities and
utility facilities, including, without limitation:
      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
Village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that
characterize the Village's residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to facilities locations.
   (C)   Applicability of this Chapter: This Chapter applies to all excavation
and construction within the right-of-way and facilities on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the
Village. A facility lawfully established prior to the effective date of this
chapter may continue to be maintained, repaired and operated by the wireless
provider or utility as presently constructed and located, except as may be
otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or similar agreement.
Further, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to excavation work under
the direction of the Public Works Director by Village employees or contractors
performing work under contract with the Village, necessitating excavation in
the Village rights-of-way or property.
   (D)   Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements: The Village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the Village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the Village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the Village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this chapter.
   (E)   Effect of Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements:
      1.   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers: In the event that
a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or
similar agreement with the Village, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      2.   Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the Village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicting Provisions:
      1.   Conflict with State or Federal Regulations. If the provisions of
this Chapter are inconsistent with those of the state or federal government,
the more restrictive provision governs, to the extent allowed by law. The more
restrictive provision is the one that imposes more stringent controls.
      2.   Conflict with Other Village Regulations. If the provisions of this
Chapter are inconsistent with one another or if they conflict with provisions
found in other adopted ordinances or regulations of the Village, the more
restrictive provision governs unless otherwise expressly stated. The more
restrictive provision is the one that imposes more stringent controls.
(Ord. 2024-5097, 10-7-2024)
7-1-2: ADOPTION OF CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS:
   (A)   Adoption of Village of Lisle Design Manual: It is hereby adopted by
the Village for the purpose of establishing uniform engineering practices,
specifications, and design standards for public and private improvements, that
certain manual known as the Village of Lisle Design Manual being particularly
the May 10, 2023 edition thereof, as may be amended from time to time by the
Public Works Director, of which one copy has been and now is filed in the
Office of the Village Clerk.
   (B)   Interpretation of Construction Standards: If a discrepancy exists
between or among differing principles and standards required by this chapter,
the Public Works Director shall determine, in the exercise of sound engineering
judgment, which principles apply and such decision shall be final. Nothing

(Ord. 2024-5097, 10-7-2024)
7-1-18: SECURITY:
   (A)   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section and
Title 1, Chapter 20, "Fees, Fines, Insurance, Guarantees, and Regulatory
Measures". The Security Fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance
with this section at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion
of the work authorized under the permit. The Security Fund shall serve as
security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form: The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in
the form of cash or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to
the Village. Any letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall,
at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
      2.    Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the Village and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount: The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Public Works Director, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Public Works
Director may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post
a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals: The Village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the Village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security
Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in
subsection (C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and Return of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not Limited: The rights reserved to the Village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

than thirty (30) days prior to the transfer of ownership or control of any
facility in the right-of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new
owner of the utility or the facility shall have all the obligations and
privileges enjoyed by the former owner under the permit, if any, and applicable
laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, including this chapter, with respect
to the work and facilities in the right-of-way. Any transactions which
singularly or collectively result in a change of ten percent (10%) or more of
the ownership or working control of the grantee or of the ownership or working
control of affiliated entities having ownership or working control of the
grantee, shall be considered a transfer of ownership or control. Transactions
between affiliated entities are not exempt from the notice requirement.
   (B)   Amended Permit: A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the Village's right-
of- way.
   (C)   Insurance And Security: All required insurance coverage or security
instrument must be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.

provider or utility or contractor's workers when performing any work on the
rights-of-way.
   (C)   Interference with Traffic: All work shall be phased so that there is
minimum interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   (D)   Notice When Access Is Blocked: At least forty eight (48) hours prior
to beginning work that will partially or completely block access to any
residence, business or institution, the wireless provider, utility or
contractor shall notify the resident, business or institution of the
approximate beginning time and duration of such work; provided, however, that
in cases involving emergency repairs performed pursuant to this Chapter, the
utility contractor shall provide such notice as is practicable under the
circumstances. It is the permittee's responsibility to notify the Lisle
Woodridge Fire District, the Lisle Police Department and the Lisle Public Works
Department if the permittee's construction work inhibits or prohibits the flow
of traffic on the roadway.
   (E)   Compliance: The utility shall take immediate action to correct any
deficiencies in traffic protection requirements that are brought to its
attention by the Village.
(Ord. 2024-5097, 10-7-2024)

An applicant shall obtain one or more permits from the Village to collocate a
small wireless facility. An application shall be received and processed, and
permits issued shall be subject to the following conditions and requirements:
   (A)   Application Requirements: A wireless provider shall provide the
following information to the Village, together with the Village's Small Cell
Facilities Permit Application, as a condition of any permit application to
collocate small wireless facilities on a utility pole or wireless support
structure:
      1.   Site specific structural integrity and, for a municipal utility
pole, make-ready analysis prepared by a structural engineer, as that term is
defined in Section 4 of the Structural Engineering Practice Act of 1989;
      2.   The location where each proposed small wireless facility or utility
pole would be installed and photographs of the location and its immediate
surroundings depicting the utility poles or structures on which each proposed
small wireless facility would be mounted or location where utility poles or
structures would be installed. This should include a depiction of the completed
facility;
      3.   Specifications and drawings prepared by a structural engineer, as
that term is defined in Section 4 of the Structural Engineering Practice Act of
1989, for each proposed small wireless facility covered by the application as
it is proposed to be installed;
      4.   The equipment type and model numbers for the antennas and all other
wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility;
      5.   A proposed schedule for the installation and completion of each
small wireless facility covered by the application, if approved; and
      6.   Certification that the collocation complies with the Collocation
Requirements and Conditions contained herein, to the best of the applicant's
knowledge.
      7.   In the event that the proposed small wireless facility is to be
attached to an existing pole owned by an entity other than the Village, the
wireless provider shall provide legally competent evidence of the consent of
the owner of such pole to the proposed collocation.
      8.   Certification by a radio engineer that a new, replacement or
modified small wireless facility operates within all applicable FCC standards.
   (B)   Application Process: The Village shall process applications as
follows:
      1.   The first completed application shall have priority over
applications received by different applicants for collocation on the same
utility pole or wireless support structure.
      2.   An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an existing
utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement of an existing
utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the Village fails to
approve or deny the application within 90 days after the submission of a
completed application.
      However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity
on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the Village in writing
of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than seventy
five (75) days after the submission of a completed application.
      The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the 90th day after
submission of the complete application or the 10th day after the receipt of the
deemed approved notice by the Village. The receipt of the deemed approved
notice shall not preclude the Village's denial of the permit request within the
time limits as provided under this Ordinance.
      FCC regulation provides that an application to collocate a small wireless
facility using an existing structure shall be granted or denied within sixty
(60) days of submission of a completed application. Delays beyond that time
limit are available only in exceptional circumstances. These FCC time limits
may be enforced through litigation.
      3.   An application to collocate a small wireless facility that includes
the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the Village fails to approve or
deny the application within one hundred twenty (120) days after the submission
of a completed application.
      However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity
on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the Village in writing
of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than one
hundred and five (105) days after the submission of a completed application.
      The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the 120th day after
submission of the complete application or the 10th day after the receipt of the
deemed approved notice by the Village. The receipt of the deemed approved
notice shall not preclude the Village's denial of the permit request within the
time limits as provided under this Ordinance.
      FCC regulation provides that an application to collocate a small wireless
facility using a new structure shall be granted or denied within ninety (90)
days of submission of a completed application. Delays beyond that time limit
are available only in exceptional circumstances. These FCC time limits may be
enforced through litigation.
      4.   The Village shall deny an application which does not meet the
requirements of this Ordinance.
      If the Village determines that applicable codes, ordinances or
regulations that concern public safety, or the Collocation Requirements and
Conditions contained herein require that the utility pole or wireless support
structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be
conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
      The Village shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific
code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is based, and
send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the Village denies
an application.
      The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the Village and
resubmit the revised application once within thirty (30) days after notice of
denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee.
The Village shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30)
days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved.
Failure to resubmit the revised application within thirty (30) days of denial
shall require the application to submit a new application with applicable fees,
and recommencement of the Village's review period.
      The applicant must notify the Village in writing of its intention to
proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be
submitted with the revised application.
      Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies
cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not apply if the
cure requires the review of a new location, new or different structure to be
collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the
small wireless facility.
      5.   Pole Attachment Agreement: Within thirty (30) days after an approved
permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the
Village and the applicant shall enter into a Master Pole Attachment Agreement,
provided by the Village for the initial collocation on a municipal utility pole
by the application. For subsequent approved permits to collocate on a small
wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the Village and the applicant
shall enter into a License Supplement of the Master Pole Attachment Agreement.
   (C)   Completeness of Application: Within ten (10) days after receiving an
application, the Village shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the Village must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the Village fails to provide notification to the applicant within
ten (10) days after all documents, information and fees specifically enumerated
in the permit application form are submitted by the applicant to the Village.
FCC regulation allows ten (10) days for determination of completion, and that
ten (10)-day time frame replaces the thirty (30)-day period provided in the
state Act.
      Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the Village sends the
notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing
information.
   (D)   Tolling: The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
      1.   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the Village;
or,
      2.   A local, state or federal disaster declaration or similar emergency
that causes the delay.
   (E)   Consolidated Applications: An applicant seeking to collocate small
wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village shall be allowed, at
the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to twenty five (25) small wireless
facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of
small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure.
      If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the
Village may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application
and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided, or that do not qualify for consolidated
treatment, or that are denied. The Village may issue separate permits for each
collocation that is approved in a consolidated application.
   (F)   Duration of Permits: The duration of a permit shall be for a period of
not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
durations unless the Village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities
or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable Village
codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this Ordinance.
   (G)   If the Act is repealed as provided in Section 90 therein, renewals of
permits shall be subject to the applicable Village code provisions or
regulations in effect at the time of renewal.
   (H)   Means of Submitting Applications: Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information and notices to the Village by personal
delivery at the Village's designated place of business, by regular mail
postmarked on the date due or by any other commonly used means, including
electronic mail.

interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
   (D)   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on
Village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission
system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric
supply zone of the pole.
      However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility
may be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on
the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
      For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space,"
"communication worker safety zone," and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
   (E)   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes,
including acoustic regulations, and local code provisions or regulations that
concern public safety.
   (F)   The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards that

including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
   (G)   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this Collocation
Requirements and Conditions Section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocat small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category
of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a
single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within two hundred
(200) feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
      If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
   (H)   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten (10) feet above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
      New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which
small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
      1.   Ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred (300) feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed
utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation
for such facility; or
      2.   Forty five (45) feet above ground level.
   (I)   Height Exceptions or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height for
a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which
the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall
apply for a Variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set
forth in Title 5 of the Village Code.
   (J)   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
   (K)   Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: The wireless provider shall comply
with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
   (L)   Undergrounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
   (M)   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend
this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility
pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be
void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   (N)   Residential Design Standards:
      1.   Purpose: Ensure visually acceptable facility design and to provide
discretion on required and preferred design of small wireless facilities.

restoration work or reseeding for a period of one year.
         (l)   No facility may display any signage or advertisements unless
expressly allowed by the Village in a written approval, recommended under FCC
regulations or required by law or permit condition. Every facility shall at all
times display signage that accurately identifies the facility owner and
provides the facility owner's unique site number, and also provides a local or
toll-free telephone number to contact the facility owner's operations center.
All required or permitted signage must face toward the street or otherwise
placed to minimize visibility from adjacent sidewalks and structures.
   (O)   Design Standards In Special Aesthetic/Economic Purpose Zones:
      1.   Purpose: To protect and promote the Village's unique character in a
manner consistent with State and Federal laws and regulations.
      2.   Applicability: These design standards shall apply to: a) each area,

         (d)   Small wireless facilities must be designed so that the
facilities' silhouette, mass and color are masked in such a way as to be
virtually indistinguishable from their background.
   (P)   Design Standards In Historic Districts:
      1.   Purpose: To promote the educational, cultural, economic and general
welfare of the Village by identifying, preserving, protecting, enhancing and
encouraging the continued utilization and the rehabilitation of such areas,
properties, structures, sites and objects having a special historical interest
or value to the Village and its citizens.
      2.   Applicability: These design standards apply in any historic district
or on any historic landmark:
         (a)   Districts, sites, buildings, structures or objects, significant
in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering or culture, that are
listed, or are eligible for listing, in the National Register of Historic
Places are to be avoided, to the greatest extent possible. Local landmarked
buildings, properties, sites, or historic districts that are so recognized by
an ordinance that meets the requirements of the certified Local Government
Program of the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office are also to be
avoided, to the greatest extent possible.
         (b)   Applicants must include proposed stealth and concealment
measures in their applications.
         (c)   Applicant must implement said Village-approved design concepts,
and the use of camouflage or stealth materials as necessary in order to achieve

endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes
of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to the department within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the

premises, the director may order such nuisance to be abated upon determination
that the nuisance constitutes a threat to public health or safety.
      1.   In the event of an emergency situation, as determined by the
director, involving an immediate threat to public health and safety, the
director may direct legal counsel to immediately commence any legal or
equitable proceeding necessary to restrain, abate, and/or remedy said
situation. The director may take such action without having to first issue a
notice of violation to the person(s) having control of, or acting as agent for,
such premises where the nuisance is located, or waiting for such person(s) to
abate or remove such nuisance as previously ordered by the director.
      2.   In all other cases, the director may notify, in writing, the person
(s) having control of, or acting as agent for, such premises where the nuisance

person(s) to comply with the notice, the director may direct that appropriate
proceeding commence to compel the abatement, or removal, of such a nuisance in

   (A)   Suspension Of MS4 Access Due To Detection Of Illicit Discharges:

have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge. The department shall notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the department for a
reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without
the prior approval of the department.
      2.   In emergency situations, the department may, without prior notice,
suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge, which presents or may present imminent
and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of
persons, or to the MS4, storm drainage system, or waters of the United States.
If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,

Except as otherwise provided in this section, collection of towing and storage

will the police department call any towing service not on the tow list unless
all tow operators are unavailable. It is specifically permitted for the police
department to call a tow operator out of sequence in a life threatening
emergency where there is an urgent need for services of a tow operator located

material fact, that if known would have caused disapproval of the application;
or
      2.   The tow operator has violated any of the provisions of this chapter;

inadequate, because of one or more of the following reasons:

         (b)   Slow response time,
         (c)   Excessive damage claims,
         (d)   Repeated complaints from citizens, or

required by the tow operator for reinstatement on the tow list.
   (B)   Immediate Suspension Or Removal: If the chief of police determines
that a tow operator presents an immediate threat to the health, safety or
welfare of the village, or if the tow operator has not provided proof of valid
and current insurance in the amounts required by this chapter, the chief of
police may, in his sole and absolute discretion, and without prior notice,
suspend or remove the tow operator from the tow list.
   (C)   Appeals: Any suspended or removed tow operator may appeal the chief of

circumstances require an exceptional amount of extra work or equipment, the tow
operator may charge an additional reasonable fee; provided, however, that the
owner or operator of the vehicle to be serviced, if available, is first

service while under the influence of intoxicants.
   (C)   Towed vehicles will be taken to the location designated by the vehicle

tow operator's facility; provided, however, that vehicles towed upon the
direction of the police department will be towed to such a place as designated
by the police officer in charge at the scene.
   (D)   When a tow operator tows a vehicle pursuant to a DUI arrest, the tow
operator will hold that vehicle in storage for six (6) hours and may only then
release the vehicle to the owner.
   (E)   When a tow operator tows a vehicle pursuant to a driving while license

must submit proof of a valid and current state of Illinois driver's license.
   (F)   Once notified of a tow, the tow operator will provide the police
department an approximate time it will take to arrive at the scene of a tow. If
a tow operator is unable to respond to a tow request within twenty (20)
minutes, the tow operator or his employee will advise the police department
that he is not available. The tow operator will be marked unavailable. The
police dispatcher will then call the next tow operator on the list. (Ord. 2009-

vehicles can be safely stored. A storage lot must be enclosed by a fence not
less than six feet (6') in height and have a locked gate and a storage building
must be fully enclosed and secured. All storage facilities must meet all zoning
and fire ordinances and restrictions. When instructed by the police department
that a vehicle in storage must be secured from tampering, the operator must
store the vehicle so that it is not accessible to any person except upon
specific approval of the tow operator or his agent. A clearance of twenty four

   (A)   Permit Required: It shall be unlawful for any owner, operator, lessee
or driver to operate or move any vehicle over, upon or across any village road
or highway when the vehicle exceeds any of the limitations and regulations
stated in Illinois Compiled Statutes chapter 625, act 5, sections 15-102
(width), 15-103 (height), 15-107 (length) and 15-111 (weight), as such
limitations and regulations are amended from time to time, without having first
obtained a valid permit to do so from the director of public works.
   (B)   Liability For Damage: The permittee shall assume total liability for
any and all damages to streets, bridges, village owned appurtenances and
private or public property while engaged in a permit movement. The measure of
liability is the cost for all repairs or the cost of replacement of property
damaged beyond repair together with all other expenses incurred by the
authorities in control of the highway structure in providing a temporary
detour, including a temporary structure, to serve the needs of traffic during
the period of repair or replacement of the damaged highway or highway structure
by the permittee.
   (C)   Application For Permit; Authority To Grant And Establish Conditions:
The director of public works shall be empowered to receive, investigate and
determine the propriety of requests to transport or move overweight and
overdimension vehicles over, upon or across village roads and highways, to
require written application therefor, and to issue permits therefor consistent
with the public health, comfort, safety and welfare and the reasonable
preservation of the village roads and highways. The application for and
issuance of a permit shall be in accordance with Illinois Compiled Statutes
chapter 625, act 5, section 15-301, as amended from time to time, and all
movements under the permit shall be made in accordance with all applicable
federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
      1.   Permits shall be issued only in the name of a person, firm,
business, or corporation that owns and operates the transporting vehicle or
that operates the vehicle under a bona fide lease agreement. The permit is
nontransferable and applies only to the permittee. Whenever such driver is not
the owner of such vehicle, object, or contrivance, but is so operating,
driving, or moving the same with the express or implied permission of the
owner, then the owner and driver are jointly and severally liable to the extent
provided herein.
      2.   The permit, when issued, constitutes an agreement between the
permittee and the village that the move described in the application will take
place only as described. The permittee has the responsibility to report to the
village any inaccuracies or errors on the part of either the village or the
permittee before starting any move. Any revisions made at the request of the
permittee for purposes of changing weights, dimensions, routes, or load
description shall be at the discretion of the director of public works.
Undertaking the move is prima facie evidence of acceptance of the permit as
issued and its terms.
      3.   The route prescribed in the permit constitutes the sole extent of
the authority granted by the permit for the use of village roads, and any
vehicle and/or load found to be off route will be considered off route and
without a permit.
      4.   It is the duty of the permittee to read and familiarize himself or
herself with the permit provisions upon receipt. Undertaking of the permit move
is deemed prima facie evidence of acceptance of the permit and that:
         a.   The permittee is in compliance with all operation requirements;
         b.   All dimension and weight limitations specified in the permit
shall not be exceeded;
         c.   All operation, registration and license requirements have been
complied with;
         d.   All financial responsibilities, obligations and other legal
requirements have been met; and
         e.   The permittee, including its officers, agents, or employees,
assumes all responsibility for injury or damage to persons or to public or
private property, including his or her own, or to the object being transported,
caused directly or indirectly by the transportation or movement of vehicles and
objects authorized under the permit. He or she agrees to hold the village
harmless from all suits, claims, damages, or proceedings of any kind and to
indemnify the village for any claim it may be required to pay arising from the
movement.
      5.   Upon application for a permit(s), the village may require an
applicant to provide evidence of a valid comprehensive general liability
insurance policy for protection against personal injury or property damage, in
the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence. The village
shall be named as an additional, noncontributory coinsured on all policies of
insurance. The village shall receive written notice of cancellation or
reduction in coverage of any insurance policy thirty (30) days prior to the
effective date of cancellation or reduction. The permittee will be responsible
for obtaining new insurance coverage in this event. In addition, the permittee
shall carry, at its own expense, at least the following insurance coverage:
         a.   Commercial General Liability Insurance:
            Bodily injury, personal injury, and property damage with limits of
not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) each occurrence/two million
dollars ($2,000,000.00) aggregate.
            Contractual insurance - broad form, with limits of not less than
one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) each occurrence/two million dollars
($2,000,000.00) aggregate.
         b.   Business Automobile Liability: One million dollars
($1,000,000.00) combined single limit per accident for bodily injury and
property damage.
      6.   As a condition of the issuance of any permit, the director of public
works shall have the power to regulate the date, time, route and conditions,
safety equipment and measures to be employed in making any such movement. This
may include the use of Woodridge police department escorts, which shall be
determined by the village based on density of the area and other safety
concerns, at the sole discretion of the village. The expenses for such escort
shall be paid for by the permittee with a one hour minimum charge. The director
of public works shall process all applications within one business day of the
receipt of a complete and proper application. Said applications and permits
shall be made and granted upon such forms as the director of public works may,
from time to time, reasonably provide.
         The permits issued under this section constitute the grant of a
privilege by the village and may be denied, suspended or revoked for such
reasons as the village may deem rationally related to its governmental
interests including, but not limited to:
         a.   A permittee knowingly providing incorrect information on an
application for a permit;
         b.   A permittee, its agents or employees acting on a permit which has
been altered;
         c.   Noncompliance by permittee, its agents or employees with federal,
state or local laws pertaining to the transport of goods or operation of a
vehicle engaged in the transportation of goods;
         d.   Overdue fines or fees due to the village;
         e.   Moving on village streets without a valid permit as is required.
      7.   Suspension or revocation of a current permit shall be for the time
determined appropriate by the director of public works or his or her designee;
however, reinstatement may be made upon conditions determined by the village
and payment of all outstanding settlements or judgments. The charges for
reinstatement are in accordance the annual fee ordinance.
         The director of public works or his or her designee shall administer
and enforce this section and shall have the authority to grant, deny, suspend,
revoke and reinstate permits. Any applicant or permittee denied a permit or who
has had a permit suspended or revoked, upon request, shall be given a hearing
before the director of public works or his or her designee and, if applicant or
permittee desires, may appeal the decision of the director of public works
before the village administrator.
   (D)   Permit Fees: Permits may be applied for and granted in accordance with
the annual fee ordinance, plus necessary and appropriate administrative or
engineering fees. In addition to any ordinance violation prosecution or other
remedies authorized by law, the village manager is hereby authorized to direct
the village attorney to file suit to recover any and all costs incurred by the
village for any damage to any roadway of the village as determined by the
public works director, including, but not limited to: any repair costs, any
village staff time and equipment including overhead used to repair any damage
and any village payments to contractors for the same.

the village. Upon determination that the recorded image captures a violation
and that no defense applies, the notice of violation shall be served upon the
registered vehicle owner in the manner provided for above. The traffic
compliance administrator shall retain a copy of all violation notices, recorded
images and other correspondence mailed to the owner of the vehicle. Each notice
of violation shall constitute evidence of the facts contained in the notice and
is admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation of the above noted
statutory and local provisions and shall be prima facie evidence of a
violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in this
section. (Ord. 2007-4139, 9-10-2007; amd. Ord. 2010-4358, 12-20-2010)

section may request a hearing by the respond-by date on the notice of violation
(14 days from the date of issuance), to challenge the evidence or set forth an
applicable defense. The notice of violation shall constitute evidence of the

hereinafter set forth:

determination of automated traffic law violation liability which shall become
final: 1) upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination, or
2) upon expiration of the period for filing such a petition without a filing
having been made. If a person appears at a hearing and is found liable or
contests the violation by mail and is found liable, the hearing officer will
enter findings, decision and order, which is a final determination of automated
traffic law violation liability that is a final, appealable order.
The owner (or lessee) of a motor vehicle is subject to a penalty as set forth
in
Title 1, Chapter 20, “Fees, Fines, Insurance, Guarantees, and Regulatory
Measures”. In the event that such penalty is not paid within fourteen (14) days
after service of a final determination of liability, an additional late payment
penalty shall be imposed as set forth in Title 1, Chapter 20, “Fees, Fines,
Insurance, Guarantees, and Regulatory Measures”. A penalty shall not apply if
the driver of the motor vehicle received a uniform traffic citation from a
police officer at the time of the violation. The village shall not charge court
costs or hearing fees to persons found liable after exercising their right to
appear and contest the violation at an administrative hearing. (Ord. 2010-4358,

be sent following the final determination of automated traffic law violation
liability and the conclusion of judicial review. The notice of final
determination shall include the following information:
      1.   A statement that the unpaid fine is a debt due and owing to the
village;
      2.   A warning that a failure to pay any fine due and owing to the
village of Lisle within fourteen (14) days may result in a petition to the
circuit court of DuPage County to have the unpaid fine rendered as a judgment
or may result in the suspension of the person's driver's license for failure to
pay fines or penalties for five (5) or more violations under this section.
   (K)   Petitions To Set Aside Determination: A petition to set aside
determination of an automated traffic law violation must be filed with or
mailed to the traffic control administrator within fourteen (14) days of the
date of mailing of the notice of determination of liability. The grounds for
the petition are limited to:
      1.   The person was not the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the
date the violation notice was issued;
      2.   The person having already paid the fine for the violation in
question; and
      3.   Excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing.
   Upon receipt of a timely petition to set aside the determination of
liability, the hearing officer shall review the petition to determine if cause
has been shown to set aside the determination. If cause has been shown, the
village shall forward the petitioner a new hearing date on which the petitioner
must appear to present his case. The village shall notify the petitioner of the
hearing officer's decision to grant a hearing or deny the petition within
fourteen (14) days of the village's receipt.
   (L)   Notice Of Impending Driver's License Suspension: A notice of impending
driver's license suspension shall be sent to the person liable for any fine or
penalty that remains due and owing on five (5) or more violations of this
section. The notice of impending driver's license suspension shall state the
following information:
      1.   The failure to pay the fine owing within forty five (45) days of the
notice's date will result in the village notifying the secretary of state that
the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings under 625
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/6-306.5;
      2.   A statement that the person may obtain a copy of the original ticket
imposing a fine by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the village
along with a request for the copy.
   The notice of impending driver's license suspension shall be sent by first
class mail, postage prepaid, to the address recorded with the secretary of
state or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the
last known address recorded in a United States post office approved database.
   (M)   Driver's License Suspension: The traffic compliance administrator, by
certified report, may request that the secretary of state suspend the driving
privileges of an owner of a registered vehicle who has failed to pay any fine
or penalty due and owing as a result of five (5) automated traffic violations.
The report shall be certified and contain the following:
      1.   The name, last known address as recorded with the secretary of
state, as provided by the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease, or
as recorded in a United States post office approved database if any notice sent
under this section is returned as undeliverable, and driver's license number of
the person who failed to pay the fine or penalty and the registration number of
any vehicle known to be registered to such person in a state;
      2.   A statement that the report is being made by the village of Lisle
pursuant to this section; and
      3.   A statement that a notice of impending driver's license suspension
has been sent to the person named in the report at the address recorded with

vehicle at the time of the lease or, if any notice sent under this section is
returned as undeliverable at the last known address recorded at a United States
post office approved database; the date on which such notice was sent; and
address to which such notice was sent.
   The traffic compliance administrator shall notify the secretary of state
whenever a person named in the certified report has paid the previously
recorded fine or penalty or whenever the municipality determines that the
original report was in error. A certified copy of such notification shall also
be given upon request and at no additional charge to the person named therein.
   Any person receiving notice from the secretary of state that their driving
privileges may be suspended at the end of a specified period may challenge the
accuracy of the certified report prepared by the traffic compliance
administrator. The person shall, within seven (7) days after having received
notice from the secretary of state, request an opportunity to speak with the
traffic compliance administrator to challenge the accuracy of the certified
report. If the traffic compliance administrator determines that the original
report was in error due to the fact that the person challenging the report was
not the owner or lessee of the vehicle or that the person has already paid the
fine for the five (5) or more automated traffic violations, the traffic
compliance administrator shall immediately notify the secretary of state of
such error in a subsequent certified report. (Ord. 2007-4139, 9-10-2007)

   (C)   Tow And Impoundment Of Vehicles: Whenever a police officer has
probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle is subject to tow and
impoundment pursuant to this section, and none of the circumstances delineated
in subsection (D) of this section are present, the police officer shall cause
the motor vehicle to be towed to a facility authorized by the village or its
agents in accordance with the procedures set forth in title 9, chapter 9 of
this code. When the vehicle is towed, the police officer shall notify any
person identifying himself or herself as the owner of the vehicle or any person
who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged
violation, if there is such a person, of the fact of the tow and of the vehicle
owner's right to request a preliminary hearing to be held in accordance with
the administrative hearing procedures set forth in subsection
10-1-12(F) of this chapter, though the owner is not restricted to the defenses
enumerated in subsection
10-1-12(D) of this chapter. Said motor vehicle shall be impounded pending the
completion of the hearings provided for in this chapter, unless the owner of
the motor vehicle posts with the village a cash bond as set forth in subsection
(E) of this section and in an amount established by
Title 1, Chapter 20, “Fees, Fines, Insurance, Guarantees, and Regulatory
Measures”.
   (D)   Exceptions To Vehicle Tow And Impoundment: A police officer who has
probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle is subject to tow and
impoundment pursuant to this section shall first ascertain whether the tow and
impoundment is necessary and reasonable under the circumstances. If in the
judgment of the police officer then present, a person authorized by the owner
of record or the operator of the vehicle is present, capable and willing to
provide for the lawful immediate removal of the vehicle and the owner or
operator of the vehicle executes an indemnification agreement, holding the
village harmless for releasing the motor vehicle into the custody of said
person, the police officer shall allow that individual to promptly remove the
motor vehicle without it being subject to tow and impoundment.
   (E)   Posting A Bond: If a bond is posted with the village, the impounded
vehicle shall be released to the owner of record, upon the payment by the owner
of record of the towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company. If
an administrative fee is imposed pursuant to this section and established by
Title 1, Chapter 20, “Fees, Fines, Insurance, Guarantees, and Regulatory
Measures”, the bond shall be applied to said fee; provided, in the event that a
violation of this section is not proven at the hearing referenced in subsection
(C) of this section, the bond shall be returned to the person posting the bond.
All bond money posted pursuant to this section shall be held by the village

review, until a reviewing court issues a final decision.
   (F)   Preliminary Hearing: Where the owner of a motor vehicle seized under
the provisions of this section requests in writing a preliminary hearing within
twelve (12) hours after the tow of the motor vehicle, the watch commander or
designated supervising officer must conduct a preliminary hearing within twenty
four (24) hours after the request for a preliminary hearing is received by the
village; provided that if the date for the hearing falls on a Saturday, Sunday,
or legal holiday, the preliminary hearing will be held on the next business day
following the Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. For purposes of this section,

heard at the preliminary hearing.
      2.   The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the hearing, and
hearsay testimony will be allowed and shall be admissible.
      3.   If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the watch commander or
designated supervising officer determines that there is probable cause to
believe that the vehicle was properly towed and impounded in accordance with
this section and that no enumerated exception justifies release of the vehicle
from impoundment, he or she shall order the continued impoundment of the
vehicle unless and until the owner of the vehicle posts a cash or certified
check bond with the village, and pays all towing and storage costs to the
applicable towing company. The village shall hold the cash or certified check
bond, together with payment for all accrued towing and storage charges, until
such time as the final hearing is completed.
      4.   If the watch commander or designated supervising officer determines
that there is not probable cause to believe that the vehicle was properly towed
and impounded under this section, then the motor vehicle shall be returned to
the owner of record of the vehicle without any penalty or other costs.
   (G)   Final Hearing:
      1.   Notice Of Hearing: Within twenty one (21) days after a motor vehicle
is towed and impounded pursuant to this section, the village shall notify the
owner of record of the vehicle of the date, time and location of a final
hearing, to be conducted in accordance with subsection
10-1-12(F) of this chapter. Such notice shall be mailed by certified mail,
return receipt requested, to the owner of record, as shown on the records of
the Illinois secretary of state. Notice by certified mail need not be given
when the owner of the vehicle has been personally served with notice in written
form of the time, date and location of the hearing.
      2.   Hearing: For purposes of this section, the following shall apply at
an owner's final hearing:
         (a)   Unless continued by order of the hearing officer, the hearing
shall be held within forty five (45) days after the motor vehicle was
impounded.
         (b)   All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to be heard at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the
hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. At the hearing, the violation
citation shall be prima facie evidence that the violation was committed as
provided in the citation, and the burden of proof shall be upon the defendant
to prove that the violation was not committed.
         (c)   If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer
determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was properly
impounded, the hearing officer shall enter an order for the continued
impoundment of the vehicle until the owner of the vehicle pays to the village
the administrative fee, as established by
Title 1, Chapter 20, “Fees, Fines, Insurance, Guarantees, and Regulatory
Measures”, plus all accrued towing and storage costs to the applicable towing
company. The administrative fee shall be a debt due to the village and the
owner shall be civilly liable therefor. If a cash bond has been posted, said
bond shall be applied to the administrative fee.
         (d)   If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the
hearing officer shall enter an order of default in favor of the village, which
order shall require the payment to the village of an administrative penalty, as
established in Title 1, Chapter 20, “Fees, Fines, Insurance, Guarantees, and
Regulatory Measures”, plus towing and storage costs to the applicable towing
company, as well as the continued impoundment of the vehicle until the owner
remits to the village the administrative fee and towing and storage costs to
the towing company.
         (e)   If the hearing officer determines that the vehicle was not used
in violation of this section then the motor vehicle shall be returned to the
owner of the vehicle promptly and without any penalty or other costs, or, if a
cash bond had previously been posted, said cash bond shall be returned.
   (H)   Unclaimed Vehicles:
      1.   Any motor vehicle that is not claimed within thirty (30) days after
the expiration of time in which the owner of record may seek judicial review of
the action of the village under this section or any vehicle for which payment
of all required monies to secure the vehicle has not been tendered within
thirty (30) days of the expiration of time in which the owner of record may
seek judicial review of the order entered at the conclusion of the final
hearing, or the time at which a final judgment is rendered in favor of the
village by a court of proper jurisdiction, or the time at which a final
administrative decision is rendered against an owner of record who is in
default, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and may be disposed of as an
abandoned or unclaimed vehicle, as otherwise provided in the Illinois vehicle
code.
   (I)   Liability For Penalty And Costs:
      1.   The owner of record of a motor vehicle that is seized or impounded
shall be liable to the village for an administrative fee, established by
Title 1, Chapter 20, “Fees, Fines, Insurance, Guarantees, and Regulatory
Measures”, in addition to any fees and charges for the towing and storage of
the motor vehicle by the applicable towing company.
      2.   Fees for towing and storage are established by the towing company
and not by the village, in accordance with the provisions of title 9, chapter 9
of this code.
      3.   A vehicle impounded pursuant to this section shall remain impounded
until the earlier of the following events occurs:
         (a)   The administrative fee is paid to the village, and all towing
and storage costs are paid to the applicable towing company.
         (b)   A bond in an amount equal to the liability of the owner as
provided in this section is posted with the village and all applicable towing
and storage costs are paid to the applicable towing company.
         (c)   The vehicle is deemed unclaimed or abandoned, in which case the
vehicle shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition
of abandoned or unclaimed vehicles.
         (d)   Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner, lien
holder or any other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a
motor vehicle impounded under this section until the administrative fee and all
towing and storage costs applicable under this section have been paid in full.

The Business Office Manager shall issue, without charge, upon application of
any handicapped person or disabled veteran, a special handicapped motorist card
furnished by the Illinois Secretary of State, pursuant to the provisions of the
Illinois Vehicle Code, for the purpose of allowing said card to be used and
displayed on a vehicle being used to transport said handicapped person or
disabled veteran, but not owned or displaying a special handicapped or disabled
veteran's license plate, so as to identify said vehicle and entitle it to all
the parking privileges afforded to a vehicle possessing such special
handicapped or disabled veteran's license plates as hereinbefore provided. Such
card shall be issued only to handicapped persons or disabled veterans and the
same shall be displayed by hanging such card from the rearview mirror of the
vehicle and shall allow the vehicle to utilize special, handicapped parking
privileges when used to transport such handicapped person or disabled veteran.
The Village shall issue only temporary handicapped motorist cards. Requests for
permanent cards shall be directed to the Illinois Secretary of State.
For purposes of this section, a "physically handicapped person" shall mean
every natural person who is unable to walk two hundred feet (200') or more
unassisted by another person or without the aid of a walker, crutches, brace,
prosthetic device, or a wheelchair or without great difficulty or discomfort
due to the following impairments: neurologic, orthopedic, respiratory, cardiac,
arthritic disorder, blindness, or the loss of function or absence of a limb or
limbs.
All applicants shall complete an application form as provided by the business
office manager. Such form includes information which shall be completed by the
applicant and his or her physician. The physician shall designate whether the
handicap is temporary or permanent. If temporary, the physician must indicate
the length of the handicap. A temporary card will be issued for the designated
period not to exceed ninety (90) days. If an extension is needed, the applicant
must complete a new application and furnish proof of the reason for such
extension from the attending physician. No handicapped motorist vehicle card
shall be transferable. Use of any such card by any person other than the
handicapped person to whom it is issued except as provided herein, shall be
deemed a violation of this section and shall render the card void. Any abuse of
the card or unauthorized use shall render any such card subject to revocation.
No handicapped motorist card shall be issued until an application form is
completed and received by the business office manager. Providing false
information in the application filed with the business office manager shall be
deemed a violation of this section. (Ord. 2000-3185, 2-21-2000)

allowed to use the permit at any one time.
         (b)   The transfer of any permit required herein between vehicles

forth. Further, if any person violates this subsection (A)1 while he is on the
permit waiting list, he shall be automatically placed at the end of the waiting
list for a parking permit in addition to paying any applicable fines.
      2.   Permit Issuance: The village reserves the right to issue permits
based upon rules which, in the opinion of the corporate authorities, further
the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of its citizens, and
which, in the opinion of the corporate authorities, are in the best interests
of the village. Such rules may include giving priority to village employees,
village residents or any other group of persons determined appropriate by the
corporate authorities of the village.
      3.   Fee Increase: The village reserves the right to increase the fee due
for a parking permit at any time prior to the effective date of the permit.
Notification of the increase and the effective date thereof shall be deemed
given upon passage of the ordinance modifying the fee.
      4.   Payment Of Fee Difference Required: Holders of permits which are not
yet effective at the time a fee increase ordinance is passed shall pay to the
village the difference between the new fee and amount previously paid for the
permit.
   (B)   Categories: For purposes of issuing the parking permits prescribed
herein, there shall be the following categories:
Category 1    Lots A, B, C, D and E.

business district. As used in this subsection, the term central business
district shall refer to that portion of the village bounded by Ogden, Garfield,

business owners and operators and residents of multi-family units, the business
office manager may issue permits to others, or provide free public parking as
deemed appropriate by the business office manager.
   (C)   Fees And Purchasing Procedure:

office manager. Fees shall be as established by
Title 1, Chapter 20, “Fees, Fines, Insurance, Guarantees, and Regulatory

office manager prior to five o'clock (5:00) P.M. on the last village business
day of the quarter preceding the quarter for which the permit is to apply.
         (b)   Failure to pay for and obtain a parking permit by five o'clock
(5:00) P.M. on the last business day of a quarter shall be deemed to be a
forfeiture of the permittee's parking permit without further notice on the part
of the village. However, if the permittee pays for and obtains the parking
permit within the first five (5) business days of the quarter to which the
permit applies, the business office manager, upon the payment of a late fee in
the amount as established by Title 1, Chapter 20, “Fees, Fines, Insurance,
Guarantees, and Regulatory Measures”, may reinstate and reissue the permit.
Further, if the permittee pays for and obtains the parking permit within six
(6) to fifteen (15) business days after the first day of the quarter to which
it applies, the business office manager, upon the payment of a late fee in the
amount as established by
Title 1, Chapter 20, “Fees, Fines, Insurance, Guarantees, and Regulatory
Measures”, may reinstate and reissue the permit. Upon the passage of fifteen
(15) days following the first day of the quarter, the permittee forfeits all
rights and privileges whatsoever in the permit and must reapply for a permit
pursuant to subsection (D) of this section.
         (c)   Failure to pay to the village any increase in parking permit
fees, as set forth in subsection (A)3 of this section, shall render the parking
permit void.

this chapter, and due pursuant to the terms of this code, by five o'clock (5:
00) P.M. on the last village business day of the quarter to which the current
permit applies, shall be denied the issuance of a permit for the new quarter
until such tickets are paid in full.
   (D)   Permit Application: Every owner or operator of a motor vehicle
desiring a permit for such vehicle, shall file a permit application with the
village business office setting forth the name and address of the applicant,
the description of the vehicle for which the permit is desired, and the state
license number of the vehicle for which the permit is desired. The applicant
shall furnish proof of ownership and/or registration if it is requested by the
village. Upon satisfactory completion and acceptance of the application and
payment of the applicable permit fees hereinafter provided, the village may
issue a permit. Upon the issuance of a permit by the village business office,
the applicant shall be permitted to park said registered vehicle in the
appropriate village parking lot until the expiration or revocation of such
permit. In the event that no commuter parking permits are available for sale,
the village of Lisle may at its discretion maintain a wait list for commuter
parking permits as provided for in subsection (D)1 of this section. If any
applicant uses or attempts to use a permit in connection with the parking of a
vehicle not registered with the village business office; or if any applicant
uses or attempts to use a permit in connection with the parking of a vehicle
not owned or leased by said applicant; or if any applicant uses or attempts to
use a permit in any manner not authorized by this chapter, the applicant shall
be automatically placed at the end of the waiting list, the permit will be
revoked and fines shall be imposed as hereinafter set forth.

sale, the village of Lisle may at its discretion maintain a wait list for
commuter parking permits. In order to be placed on the wait list an application
must be submitted on a form provided by the business office and a fee paid as

Measures”. The applicant must be the individual in whose name the permit will
be issued. As permits are offered to those on the wait list, forty five percent
(45%) of available permits must be offered only to incorporated village of
Lisle residents in chronological order, with those residents on the list the
longest being offered permits first, and the remaining fifty five percent (55%)
of available permits offered without regard for residency in chronological
order, with those on the list the longest being offered permits first.

permit from the business office manager as provided in subsection (D) of this
section may obtain a partial refund according to the schedule as established by
Title 1, Chapter 20, “Fees, Fines, Insurance, Guarantees, and Regulatory
Measures” if the owner or operator desires to cancel said permit at some time
prior to its expiration.

the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or
between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the
corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering

   (G)   Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a
sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or

of this state.
PURCHASE AT RETAIL: The acquisition, consumption or use of telecommunications
through a sale at retail.

discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby
imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state,
who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to
ensure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.
The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion.

telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications
services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined
location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime

in the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act. For air to ground
systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
TAXPAYER: A person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or
permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability as
authorized by this chapter.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS: In addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly
ascribed to it includes, without limitation, messages or information
transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide area telephone service,
private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter,
computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service,

other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any

a dedicated nontraffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of
intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this chapter,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the retailers' occupations tax act. (Ord. 2002-3412, 9-3-2002)
11-11-2: TAX IMPOSED:
A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all the following acts or privileges:

percent (6%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer.
   (B)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six
percent (6%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multistate taxation of the act or
privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon
proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be
allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this
section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such
other state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
state or local tax in this state.
   (C)   The tax imposed by this section is not imposed on such act or
privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution
and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality. (Ord. 2002-3412, 9-3-2002)
11-11-3: COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS:
   (A)   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the
taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use in
the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
department in the manner provided by the department.
   (B)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 2002-3412, 9-3-2002)
11-11-4: RETURNS TO DEPARTMENT:
On or before the last day of February, and on or before the last day of every
month thereafter, the tax imposed under this chapter on telecommunication
retailers shall be returned with appropriate forms and information as required
by the department pursuant to the Illinois simplified municipal
telecommunications tax act (public act 92-526, section 5-50) and any
accompanying rules and regulations created by the department to implement the
act. (Ord. 2002-3412, 9-3-2002)
11-11-5: RESELLERS:
   (A)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided in this chapter, the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax
free on the grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active
resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in
connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is
nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 2002-3412, 9-3-2002)
11-11-6: REBATES:
The village may rebate some or all of the amount of the tax authorized by this
chapter paid by persons sixty five (65) years of age or older. Any tax related
to such rebate shall be rebated from the village directly to persons qualified
for the rebate as determined by chapter 12 of this title of the village of
Lisle, which shall not be filed with the department. (Ord. 2002-3412, 9-3-2002)
11-11-7: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision of this chapter, or the application of any provision of this
chapter, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such occurrence shall
not affect other provisions of this chapter, or their application, that can be
given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision or its
application. Each unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of such
provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this chapter. (Ord. 2002-
3412, 9-3-2002)
11-11-8: EFFECTIVE DATE:
This chapter shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and
approval and publication as required by law, provided, however, that: a)
sections
11-11-2 and
11-11-3 of this chapter shall take effect for all bills issued on or after
January 1, 2003, b) the tax provided for herein shall take effect for all bills
issued on or after January 1, 2003, and c) any amounts due or payable to the
municipality for any tax periods ending prior to January 1, 2003, shall

            (6)   15-98.B.6. Refunds shall be made provided that the person who
paid the fee, or that person’s successor in interest, files a petition with the
village of Lisle within one year from the date on which such fees are required
to be encumbered.
      2.   15-98.C. Funds collected in the village of Lisle shall be used
within the village of Lisle, or within the watershed planning area in which the

   (M)   Section 15-117.E of the DuPage County countywide stormwater and
floodplain ordinance is hereby amended by deleting that section and replacing
it with the following:
      1.   All variance petitions filed pursuant to this article XVI shall be
filed with the stormwater administrator of the village of Lisle. The fee shall
be as established by Title 1, Chapter 20, of the Lisle Village Code.
   (N)   Appendix A, Definitions of the DuPage County countywide stormwater and
floodplain ordinance is hereby amended by deleting those definitions for “flood
protection elevation” and “substantial improvement” and replacing them with the
following:
      1.   Flood Protection Elevation (FPE). The base flood elevation plus two
feet of freeboard. If an approved FEQ watershed plan model produces a higher
elevation than the regulatory BFE, the FPE shall be the FEQ flood of record
elevation plus two feet of freeboard.
      2.   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or improvement of a structure taking place during a ten year period,
in which the cumulative percentage of improvements equals or exceeds fifty (50)
percent of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair
is started.
      Substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration
of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of
the building. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage, regardless of the actual work done. The term does not,
however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to
comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
(2) any alteration of a “historic structure” listed on the national register of
historic places or the Illinois register of historic places, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.

   (A)   Separability: If any section, clause, provision or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
   (B)   Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection required by
this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
historical records, engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods
may occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that areas outside the prescribed floodplain boundaries
or land uses permitted within such floodplains will be free from flooding or
flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the
Village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages which may
result from reliance on this chapter or on any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
