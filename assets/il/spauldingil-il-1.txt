deemed as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accrued or

force at the time of the adoption of this Village Code.

Trustees, the vote of the majority of the trustees shall be sufficient to pass
an ordinance. The yeas and nays shall be taken upon the question of the passage
of the designated ordinances, resolutions, or motions and recorded in the
Journal of the Village Board. In addition, the Corporate Authorities at any
meeting may by unanimous consent take a single vote by yeas or nays on the

in a single group, which single vote shall be entered separately in the journal

the members of the Village Board voting “yea” and of those voting “nay” on the
passage of each of the designated ordinances, orders, resolutions and motions
included in such omnibus group. The taking of such single or omnibus vote and
such entries of the words “omnibus vote” in the journal shall be a sufficient
compliance with the requirements of this section to all intents and purposes
and with like effect as if the vote in each case had been taken separately by
yeas and nays on the question of the passage of each ordinance, order,
resolution and motion included in such omnibus group, and separately recorded
in the journal. Likewise, the yeas and any other resolution or motion at the
request of any Trustees and shall be recorded in the journal.

liability against the Village, or 2) which provide for the expenditure or
appropriation of its money, or 3) to sell any Village property, and all

Clerk. If the Mayor approves them, he shall sign them. Those of which he
disapproves he shall return to the Village Board, with his written objections,
at the next regular meeting of the Village Board occurring not less than five
(5) days after their passage. The Mayor may disapprove of any one or more sums
appropriated in any ordinance, resolution, or motion making an appropriation,
and, if so, the remainder shall be effective. However, the Mayor may disapprove
entirely of an ordinance, resolution, or motion making an appropriation. If the
Mayor fails to return any ordinance or any specified resolution or motion with
his written objections, within the designated time, it shall become effective
despite the absence of his signature.

   A.   The Village shall designate one or more officials or employees to act
as its Freedom of Information Act officer (“FOIA officer”). The Chief of Police
is hereby designated as Deputy FOIA officer for FOIA requests involving the
Police Department and the Village Attorney is designated as Deputy FOIA Officer
in the place and stead of the FOIA Officer if the FOIA Officer is unavailable.
Except in instances when records are furnished immediately, the FOIA Officer,
or designee, shall receive requests submitted to the village under this chapter
and issue responses accordingly. All Village officers and employees who receive
an FOIA request from any source whatsoever shall notify the FOIA Officer within
one (1) working day. If the FOIA Officer is not available, the Village Attorney
shall be notified.
   B.   Upon receiving a request for a public record, the FOIA Officer shall:
      1.   Note the date the Village receives the written request;
      2.   Compute the day on which the period for response will expire and
make a notation of that date on the written request;
      3.   Maintain an electronic or paper copy of a written request, including
all documents submitted with the request until the request has been complied
with or denied; and
      4.   Create a file for the retention of the original request, a copy of
the response, a record of written communications with the requester, and a copy
of other communications.
   C.   The Village FOIA Officer and deputies shall, by July 1, 2010,
successfully complete an electronic training curriculum to be developed by the
public access counselor and thereafter successfully complete an annual training
program. Thereafter, whenever a new FOIA Officer is designated by the Village,
that person shall successfully complete the electronic training curriculum
within thirty (30) days after assuming the position. Successful completion of
the required training curriculum within the periods provided shall be a
prerequisite to continue serving as an FOIA Officer.
1-11-6: REQUESTS TO BE IN WRITING:
   A.   All requests for inspection or copying of public records shall be in
writing and shall be addressed to the FOIA Officer. The requester shall include
the following information in any request for public records:
      1.   The requester’s full name, mailing address and telephone number at
which the requester can be reached during normal business hours;
      2.   A description of the records sought, as specific as possible;
      3.   An indication of whether the records are requested for a commercial
purpose and whether the requester seeks a fee waiver; and
      4.   A statement as to whether the request is for inspection, copying, or
both.
   B.   The FOIA Officer shall make available a form for use by requesters;
however, no request shall be denied for failure to use the form.
   C.   All requests for inspection and copying received by the Village shall
immediately be forwarded to its FOIA Officer or designee.
1-11-7: FEES:
   A.   The Village hereby establishes and shall charge fees reasonably
calculated to reimburse its actual cost for reproducing and certifying public
records and for the use, by any person, of the equipment of the Village to copy
records. Such fees exclude the costs of any search for and review of the
record, and shall not exceed the actual cost of reproduction and certification,
unless otherwise provided by state statute. The charge for copying shall be ten
cents ($0.10) per page for photocopies, five cents ($0.05) per page for
computer printouts, and two dollars fifty cents ($2.50) per audiotape, CD, or
DVD. No fees shall be charged for the first fifty (50) pages of black and
white, letter or legal sized copies requested by a requester. If the village
provides copies in color or in a size other than letter or legal, it shall
charge the actual cost for reproducing the records. In calculating the actual
cost for reproducing records or for the use of the equipment of the Village to
reproduce the records, the Village shall not include the costs of any search
for and review of the records or other personnel costs associated with
reproducing the records. The cost for certifying a record shall be one dollar
($1.00).
   B.   Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge
where the Village determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the
public interest because furnishing information can be considered as primarily
benefiting the general public. Waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public
interest if the principal purpose of the request is to access and disseminate
information regarding the health, safety and welfare or the legal rights of the
general public and is not for the principal purpose of personal or commercial
benefit. For purposes of this subsection, “commercial benefit” shall not apply
to requests made by news media when the principal purpose of the request is to
access and disseminate information regarding the health, safety, and welfare or
the legal rights of the general public. In setting the amount of the waiver or
reduction, the Village may take into consideration the amount of materials
requested and the cost of copying them.
1-11-8: TIME LIMIT FOR COMPLIANCE WITH REQUEST:
   A.   Compliance With Request (Noncommercial Purpose): The Village shall
either comply with or deny a request for public records within five (5)
business days after its receipt. If the Village fails to respond to a request
within the requisite periods in this section but thereafter provides the
requester with copies of the requested public records, it may not impose a fee
for such copies. If the Village fails to respond to a request received, it may
not treat the request as unduly burdensome under section
1-11-10 of this chapter. Denials shall be in writing and in accordance with
section
1-11-12 of this chapter.
   B.   Compliance With Request (Commercial Purpose): The Village shall respond
to a request for records to be used for a commercial purpose within twenty one
(21) working days after receipt. The response shall:
      1.   Provide to the requester an estimate of the time required by the
village to provide the records requested and an estimate of the fees to be
charged, which the Village may require the person to pay in full before copying
the requested documents;
      2.   Deny the request pursuant to one or more of the exemptions set out
in this chapter;
      3.   Notify the requester that the request is unduly burdensome and
extend an opportunity to the requester to attempt to reduce the request to
manageable proportions; or
      4.   Provide the records requested.
   C.   Unless the records are exempt from disclosure (see section
1-11-19 of this chapter), the Village shall comply with a request within a
reasonable period considering the size and complexity of the request, and
giving priority to records requested for noncommercial purposes. No person
shall knowingly obtain a public record for a commercial purpose without
disclosing that it is for a commercial purpose, if requested to do so by the
Village.
1-11-9: EXTENSION OF TIME LIMIT (NONCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE); NOTICE:
   A.   The time limit prescribed in subsection
1-11-8A of this chapter may be extended in each case for not more than five (5)
additional business days from the original due date for any of the following
reasons:
      1.   The requested records are stored in whole or in part at other
locations other than the office having charge of the requested records.
      2.   The request requires the collection of a substantial number of
specified records.
      3.   The request is couched in categorical terms and requires an
extensive search for the records responsive to it.
      4.   The requested records have not been located in the course of routine
search and additional efforts are being made to locate them.
      5.   The requested records require examination and evaluation by
personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they
are exempt from disclosure under the terms of the Illinois freedom of
information act or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions.
      6.   The request for records cannot be complied with by the Village
within the time limits prescribed by the foregoing subsection without unduly
burdening or interfering with the operations of the Village.
      7.   There is a need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all
practicable speed, with another public body or among two (2) or more components
of a public body having a substantial interest in the determination or in the
subject matter of the request.
   B.   The person making a request and the village may agree in writing to
extend the time for compliance for a period to be determined by the parties. If
the requester and the Village agree to extend the period for compliance, a
failure by the Village to comply with any previous deadlines shall not be
treated as a denial of the request for the records.
   C.   When additional time is required for any of the above reasons, the FOIA
Officer shall notify the person making the request, by letter, within the five
(5) business days after receipt of the request, of the reasons for the delay
and the date by which the records will be made available or denial will be
forthcoming. In no instance may the delay in processing last longer than five
(5) business days. A failure to render a decision within the time permitted for
extension shall be considered a denial of the request.
   D.   If the Village fails to respond to a request within the time permitted
for extension but thereafter provides the requester with copies of the
requested public records, the Village may not impose a fee for those copies. If
the Village requests an extension and subsequently fails to respond to the
request, it may not treat the request as unduly burdensome under section
1-11-10 of this chapter.
1-11-10: UNDULY BURDENSOME REQUESTS:
   A.   Requests calling for all records falling within a category shall be
complied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for
the Village, there is no method of narrowing the request, and the burden on the
Village strongly outweighs the public interest in the information. Before
invoking this exemption, the Village shall extend to the person making the
request an opportunity to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to
manageable proportions. If the Village responds to a categorical request by
stating that compliance would unduly burden its operation and the conditions
described above are met, it shall do so in writing signed by the FOIA Officer
specifying the reasons why it would be unduly burdensome and the extent to
which compliance will so burden the operation of the Village. Such a response
shall be treated as a denial of the request for information.
   B.   Repeated requests for the same public records by the same person shall
be deemed unduly burdensome. Repeated requests from the same person for the
same records that are unchanged or identical to records previously provided or
properly denied under this chapter shall be deemed unduly burdensome.
1-11-11: CERTAIN INFORMATION EXEMPT FROM INSPECTION AND COPYING:
   A.   Information exempted by sections 7 and 7.5 of the Freedom of
Information Act shall be exempt from inspection and copying (see section
1-11-19 of this chapter). If a record contains both exempt and nonexempt
information, the village may elect to redact the information that is exempt and
make the remainder of the record available for inspection and copying.
   B.   Moreover, information described in the definition for PUBLIC RECORD may
be withheld if it is determined that disclosure would: a) interfere with
pending or actually and reasonably contemplated law enforcement proceedings
conducted by any law enforcement agency; b) endanger the life or physical
safety of law enforcement or correctional personnel or any other person; or c)
compromise the security of any correctional facility.
1-11-12: NOTICE OF DENIAL OF REQUEST; REQUEST FOR REVIEW:
   A.   The FOIA Officer, when denying a request for public record, shall
notify the requester, by letter, of the decision to deny the information, the
reason for the denial, including a detailed factual basis for the application
of any exemption claimed, and the names and titles or positions of each person
responsible for the denial.
   B.   Each notice of denial by the FOIA Officer shall inform the person of
the right to review by the Public Access Counselor and provide the address and
phone number for the Public Access Counselor.
   C.   Each notice of denial shall also inform such person of his or her right
to judicial review in accordance with section 11 of the Freedom of Information
Act.
   D.   When a request is denied on the grounds that the records are exempt
under the provisions of this chapter, the notice of denial shall specify the
exemption claimed to authorize the denial and briefly explain how the exemption
applies to the specified records withheld.
   E.   Copies of all notices of denials shall be retained by the Village in a
single central office file that is open to the public and indexed according to
the type of exemption asserted and, to the extent feasible, according to the
types of records requested.
   F.   Any person making a request for public records shall be deemed to have
exhausted his or her administrative remedies with respect to that request if
the Village fails to act within the time periods provided in sections
1-11-8 and 1-11-9 of this chapter.
1-11-13: PUBLIC ACCESS COUNSELOR; OPINIONS:
   A.   A person whose request to inspect or copy a public record is denied by
the village may file a request for review with the public access counselor
established in the Office of the Attorney General not later than sixty (60)
days after the date of the final denial. The request for review must be in
writing, signed by the requester, and include: 1) a copy of the request for
access to records and 2) any responses from the public body.
   B.   If the Village receives a request for records, and asserts that the
records are exempt under general exemptions (1)(C) or (1)(F) (see section
1-11-19 of this chapter), it shall, within the time periods provided for
responding to a request, provide written notice to the requester and the public
access counselor of its intent to deny the request in whole or in part. The
notice shall include:
      1.   A copy of the request for access to records;
      2.   The proposed response from the public body; and
      3.   A detailed summary of the public body's basis for asserting the
exemption.
   C.   In accordance with FOIA, upon receipt of a notice of intent to deny
from the Village, the Public Access Counselor determines whether further
inquiry is warranted. Within five (5) working days after receipt of the notice
of intent to deny, the Public Access Counselor notifies the Village and the
requester whether further inquiry is warranted. If the Public Access Counselor
determines that further inquiry is warranted, the procedures set out in this
section regarding the review of denials, including the production of documents,
shall also be applicable to the inquiry and resolution of a notice of intent to
deny from the Village. Times for response or compliance by the Village under
sections
1-10-8 and 1-10-9 of this chapter shall be tolled until the public access
counselor concludes his or her inquiry.
   D.   In accordance with FOIA, upon receipt of a request for review, the
Public Access Counselor determines whether further action is warranted. If the
Public Access Counselor determines that the alleged violation is unfounded, he
or she so advises the requester and the village and no further action shall be
undertaken. In all other cases, the Public Access Counselor forwards a copy of
the request for review to the Village within seven (7) working days after
receipt and specifies the records or other documents that the village shall
furnish to facilitate the review. Within seven (7) working days after receipt
of the request for review, the FOIA Officer shall provide copies of records
requested and shall otherwise fully cooperate with the Public Access Counselor.
If the FOIA Officer fails to furnish specified records pursuant to this
section, or if otherwise necessary, the Attorney General may issue a subpoena
to any person or public body having knowledge of or records pertaining to a
request for review of a denial of access to records under the Freedom of
Information Act. By statute, to the extent that records or documents produced
by the Village contain information that is claimed to be exempt from disclosure
under section
1-10-19 of this chapter, the Public Access Counselor does not further disclose
that information.
   E.   In accordance with FOIA, within seven (7) working days after it
receives a copy of a request for review and request for production of records
from the public access counselor, the FOIA Officer may, but is not required to,
answer the allegations of the request for review. The answer may take the form
of a letter, brief, or memorandum. The Public Access Counselor forwards a copy
of the answer to the person submitting the request for review, with any alleged
confidential information to which the request pertains redacted from the copy.
The requester may, but is not required to, respond in writing to the answer
within seven (7) working days and shall provide a copy of the response to the
Village. In addition to the request for review, and the answer and the response
thereto, if any, a requester or the Village may furnish affidavits or records
concerning any matter germane to the review.
   F.   1.   In accordance with FOIA, unless the public access counselor
extends the time by no more than twenty one (21) business days by sending
written notice to the requester and the village that includes a statement of
the reasons for the extension in the notice, or decides to address the matter
without the issuance of a binding opinion, the attorney general examines the
issues and the records, makes findings of fact and conclusions of law, and
issues to the requester and the village an opinion in response to the request
for review within sixty (60) days after its receipt. The opinion is binding
upon both the requester and the village, subject to administrative review under
section 11.5 of the Freedom of Information Act (5 ILCS 140/11.5).
      2.   Upon receipt of a binding opinion concluding that a violation of
FOIA has occurred, the FOIA Officer shall either take necessary action
immediately to comply with the directive of the opinion or shall initiate
administrative review under section 11.5 of FOIA. If the opinion concludes that
no violation of FOIA has occurred, the requester may initiate administrative
review under section 11.5 of FOIA. If the village discloses records in
accordance with an opinion of the Attorney General, it is immune from all
liabilities by reason thereof and shall not be liable for penalties under FOIA.
   G.   In accordance with FOIA, the Attorney General may also issue advisory
opinions to the Village regarding compliance with FOIA. A review may be
initiated upon receipt of a written request from the Mayor or the Village
Attorney, which shall contain sufficient accurate facts from which a
determination can be made. The Public Access Counselor may request additional
information from the Village in order to assist in the review. If the Village
relies in good faith on an advisory opinion of the Attorney General in
responding to a request, it is not liable for penalties under FOIA, so long as
the facts upon which the opinion is based have been fully and fairly disclosed
to the public access counselor.

disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual
subjects of the information. “Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy” means
the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a
reasonable person and in which the subject’s right to privacy outweighs any
legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of
information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials
shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy.
         D.   Records in the possession of the village created in the course of
administrative enforcement proceedings, and any law enforcement or correctional
agency for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that disclosure
would:
            (i)   Interfere with pending or actually and reasonably
contemplated law enforcement proceedings conducted by any law enforcement or
correctional agency that is the recipient of the request;
            (ii)   Interfere with active administrative enforcement proceedings
conducted by the village that is the recipient of the request;
            (iii)   Create a substantial likelihood that a person will be
deprived of a fair trial or an impartial hearing;
            (iv)   Unavoidably disclose the identity of a confidential source,
confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, or persons
who file complaints with or provide information to administrative,
investigative, law enforcement, or penal agencies; except that the identities
of witnesses to traffic accidents, traffic accident reports, and rescue reports
shall be provided by agencies of local government, except when disclosure would
interfere with an active criminal investigation conducted by the agency that is
the recipient of the request;
            (v)   Disclose unique or specialized investigative techniques other
than those generally used and known or disclose internal documents of
correctional agencies related to detection, observation or investigation of
incidents of crime or misconduct, and disclosure would result in demonstrable
harm to the agency or public body that is the recipient of the request;
            (vi)   Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement
personnel or any other person; or

that is the recipient of the request.

person or business from consenting to disclosure.
         H.   Proposals and bids for any contract, grant, or agreement,
including information which if it were disclosed would frustrate procurement or
give an advantage to any person proposing to enter into a contractor agreement
with the Village, until an award or final selection is made. Information

exempt until an award or final selection is made.
         I.   Valuable formulae, computer geographic systems, designs, drawings

or the public. Information exempt under this item may include such things as
details pertaining to the mobilization or deployment of personnel or equipment,

         b.   Discharges specified in writing by the Village as being necessary
to protect public health and safety.
         c.   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the Village prior to the time of the test.
         d.   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drainage system.
   B.   Prohibition Of Illicit Connections.
      1.   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drainage system is prohibited.
      2.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was

connection.
      3.   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying any pollutants or sewage to the storm drainage
system, or allows such a connection to continue.
5-10-7: SUSPENSION OF STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM ACCESS:
   A.   Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The
Village may, without prior notice, suspend storm drainage system discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge, which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
system or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the Village may take such steps as
deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the system or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   B.   Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge.
      1.   Any person discharging to the storm drainage system in violation of
this chapter may have their storm drainage system access terminated if such
termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Village shall
notify a violator of the proposed termination of its storm drainage system
access. The violator may petition the Village for a reconsideration and
hearing.
      2.   A person violates this chapter if the person reinstates storm
drainage system access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without
the prior approval of the Village.
5-10-8      INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES:
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm water
discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of
compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Village
prior to the allowing of discharges to the storm drainage system.
5-10-9:   MONITORING OF DISCHARGES:
   A.   Applicability: This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with residential, commercial and industrial
activity, including construction activity.
   B.   Access To Facilities:
      1.   The Village shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures
in force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry into
its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow
access to representatives of the Village.
      2.   Facility operators shall allow the Village ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by State and Federal law.
      3.   The Village shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Village to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s storm water discharge. Parameters
to be tested shall include, but not be limited to, total suspended solids
(TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), fecal coliform and pH.
      4.   The Village has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      5.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Village and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Village access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this chapter.
A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the Village reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
      7.   If the Village has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and the Village representative is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the Village may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
5-10-10: USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES:
The Village will adopt requirements identifying Best Management Practices for
any activity, operation, or facility, which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drainage system, or waters
of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person’s expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the system. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a
stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with
requirements of the NPDES permit.
5-10-11: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, sediment and other
obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or any way retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned uninhabitable structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
5-10-12: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any private property
owner or person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for
emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drainage
system, or waters of the U.S. said person shall take all necessary steps to
ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of
such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify
emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services.
In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify
the Village in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business
day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the Village within three (3) business days of the phone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from private
property, a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of
such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge
and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained
for at least three (3) years by the owner or operator.
5-10-13: ENFORCEMENT; NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
   A.   Whenever the Village finds that a person has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the Village may order compliance

required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the
expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.

If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth
in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within fifteen (15)
days of the decision of the Village then representatives of the Village shall
enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all
measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall
be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any
premises to refuse to allow the Village or their designated contractor to enter
upon the premises for the purposes set forth above.

   A.   Within thirty (30) days after abatement of the violation, the owner of
the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including
administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting
to the amount of the assessment within fifteen (15) days. If the amount due is
not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the Village or
by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall
become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on
the property for the amount of the assessment.
   B.   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall become
liable to the Village by reason of such violation. The liability shall be paid
in not more than twelve (12) equal payments. Interest at the rate of nine
percent (9%) per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the
fifteenth (15th) day following discovery of the violation.
5-10-17: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the authorized enforcement
agency may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the
person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the
person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
5-10-18: COMPENSATORY ACTION:
In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this

alleys of the Village at a speed which is reasonable and proper with regard to

jurisdiction of the Village meet the requirements of this chapter.
Specifically, the Mayor shall:
   A.   Process development permits in accordance with section
10-3-5 of this chapter;
   B.   Ensure that all development in a floodway (or a floodplain with no
delineated floodway) meets the damage prevention requirements of section
10-3-6 of this chapter;
   C.   Ensure that the building protection requirements for all buildings
subject to section
10-3-7 of this chapter are met and maintain a record of the as-built elevation
of the lowest floor (including basement) or floodproof certificate;
   D.   Assure that all subdivisions and annexations meet the requirements of
section
10-3-8 of this chapter;
   E.   Ensure that water supply and waste disposal systems meet the public
health standards of section
10-3-9 of this chapter;
   F.   If a variance is requested, ensure that the requirements of section
10-3-11 of this chapter are met and maintain documentation of any variances
granted;
   G.   Inspect all development projects and take any and all penalty actions
outlined in section
10-3-14 of this chapter as is necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter;
   H.   Assure that applicants are aware of and obtain any and all other
required local, State, and Federal permits;
   I.   Notify IDNR/OWR and any neighboring communities prior to any alteration
or relocation of a watercourse;
   J.   Provide information and assistance to citizens upon request about
permit procedures and floodplain construction techniques;
   K.   Cooperate with State and Federal floodplain management agencies to
coordinate base flood data and to improve the administration of this chapter;
   L.   Maintain for public inspection base flood data, floodplain maps, copies
of State and Federal permits, and documentation of compliance for development
activities subject to this chapter;
   M.   Perform site inspections to ensure compliance with this chapter and
make substantial damage determinations for structures within the floodplain,
and
   N.   Maintain the accuracy of floodplain maps including notifying IDNR/OWR
and/or submitting information to FEMA within six (6) months whenever a
modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in
a change to the floodplain map.
(Ord. 2007-6-1, 6-7-2007)
10-3-5: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
   A.   Permit Required: No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not
exempted by law shall commence any development in the floodplain without first
obtaining a development permit from the Mayor. The Mayor shall not issue a
development permit if the proposed development does not meet the requirements
of this chapter.
   B.   Application For Permit: The application for development permit shall be
accompanied by:
      1.   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line
dimensions;
      2.   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      3.   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings;
      4.   The elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of section
10-3-7 of this chapter; and

or architect. A signed estimate by a contractor may also meet this requirement.
   C.   Actions By Mayor:
      1.   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the Mayor
shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood elevation. Any
development located on land that can be shown by survey data to be higher than
the current base flood elevation and which has not been filled after the date
of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map is not in the floodplain and
therefore not subject to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely, any
development located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and
hydraulically connected, but not shown on the current Flood Insurance Rate Map,
is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
      2.   The Mayor shall maintain documentation of the existing ground
elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation
existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map
identification. The Mayor shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant
copies of all other Federal, State, and local permits, approvals or permit-not-
required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The Mayor
shall not issue a permit unless all other Federal, State, and local permits
have been obtained.

   B.   All other activities defined as development shall be designed so as not
to alter flood flows or increase potential flood damages.
(Ord. 2007-6-1, 6-7-2007)
10-3-10: CARRYING CAPACITY AND NOTIFICATION:
For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance
(including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be
maintained. In addition, the Village shall notify adjacent communities in
writing thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration
or relocation of the watercourse.
(Ord. 2007-6-1, 6-7-2007)
10-3-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Board of Trustees for a
variance. The Board of Trustees shall review and make a determination on the
applicant's request for a variance. The Board of Trustees may attach such
conditions to granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the
intent of this chapter.
   A.   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that all
of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities.
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP.
      7.   All other State and Federal permits have been obtained.
   B.   The Board of Trustees shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of the building protection standards of section
10-3-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   C.   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
10-3-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
the definition of “historic structures” in section
10-3-2 of this chapter, may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
10-3-6 and 10-3-7 of this chapter, subject to the conditions that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.
(Ord. 2007-6-1, 6-7-2007)
10-3-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the Village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
made lawfully hereunder.
(Ord. 2007-6-1, 6-7-2007)
10-3-13: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the Village to
fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. However, this
chapter does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve
eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair
any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and
other ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 2007-6-1, 6-7-2007)
10-3-14: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Board of Trustees may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
Board of Trustees shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   A.   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The Village shall make application to the Circuit Court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the Court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof,
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues.
      4.   The Village shall record a notice of violation on the title of the
property.
   B.   The Village shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended. The Board of
Trustees is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of the
subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing, indicate the
reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve
the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit. No site development permit shall be
permanently suspended or revoked until a hearing is held by the Board of
Appeals. Written notice of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and
shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation;
and
      2.   the time and place of the hearing. At such hearing, the permittee
shall be given an opportunity to present evidence on their behalf. At the
conclusion of the hearing, the Board of Trustees shall determine whether the
permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   C.   Nothing herein shall prevent the Village from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

      1.   Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers and antennas;
      2.   Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas;
      3.   Minimize the total number of towers throughout the Village;
      4.   Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as
a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
      5.   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent
possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the Village is minimal;
      6.   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through
careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging
techniques;
      7.   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services to the Village quickly, effectively, and efficiently;
      8.   Consider the public health and safety of communication towers; and
      9.   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.
   C.   In furtherance of these goals, the Village shall give due consideration
to its Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Map, existing land uses, and environmentally
sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.

      7.   If an administrative approval is denied, the applicant’s
administrative remedy shall be limited to filing an application for a special
use permit pursuant to section
11-1-8 of this chapter.
   B.   List Of Administratively Approved Uses: The following uses may be
approved by the Zoning Committee after conducting an administrative review:
      1.   Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of additional
buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said tower or
antenna, in any industrial zoning district.
      2.   Locating antennas on existing structures or towers consistent with
the terms of subsections B2a and B2b of this section.
         a.   Antennas On Existing Structures: Any antenna which is not
attached to a tower may be approved by the Zoning Committee as an accessory use
to any commercial, industrial, professional, institutional, or multi-family
structure of eight (8) or more dwelling units, provided:
            (1)   The antenna does not extend more than thirty feet (30') above
the highest point of the structure;
            (2)   The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA
regulations; and
            (3)   The antenna complies with all applicable Building Codes.
         b.   Antennas On Existing Towers: An antenna which is attached to an
existing tower may be approved by the Zoning Committee and, to minimize adverse
visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of towers,
collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on existing towers shall take
precedence over the instruction of new towers, provided such collocation is
accomplished in a manner consistent with the following:
            (1)   A tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the
collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type as the
existing tower, unless the Zoning Committee allows reconstruction as a
monopole.
            (2)   Height:
               (A)   An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt, to a taller
height, not to exceed thirty feet (30') over the tower’s existing height, to
accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna.
               (B)   The height change referred to in subsection B2b(2)(A) of
this section may only occur one time per communication tower.
               (C)   The additional height referred to in subsection B2b(2)(A)
of this section shall not require an additional distance separation as set
forth in section
11-1-8 of this chapter. The tower’s premodification height shall be used to
calculate such distance separations.
            (3)   On-Site Location:
               (A)   A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the
collocation of an additional antenna may be moved on-site within fifty feet
(50') of its existing location.
               (B)   After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation,
only one tower may remain on the site.
               (C)   A relocated on-site tower shall continue to be measured
from the original tower location for purposes of calculating separation
distances between towers pursuant to subsection
11-1-8B5 of this chapter. The relocation of a tower hereunder shall in no way
be deemed to cause a violation of subsection
11-1-8B5 of this chapter.
               (D)   The on-site relocation of a tower which comes within the
separation distances to residential units or residentially zoned lands as
established in subsection
11-1-8B5 of this chapter shall only be permitted when approved by the Zoning
Committee.
      3.   Locating any new tower in a nonresidential zoning district other
than industrial, provided a licensed professional engineer certifies the tower
can structurally accommodate the number of shared users proposed by the
applicant; the Zoning Committee concludes the tower is in conformity with the
goals set forth in section
11-1-1 of this chapter and the requirements of section
11-1-5 of this chapter; the tower meets the setback requirements in subsection
11-1-8B4 of this chapter and separation distances in subsection

antennas within the Village based upon existing physical, engineering,
technological or geographical limitations in the event the proposed tower is
erected.
      2.   Factors Considered In Granting Special Use Permits For Towers: In
addition to the standards for consideration of special use permit applications
pursuant to the zoning title of this Code, the Plan Commission shall consider
the following factors in determining whether to recommend issuance of a special
use permit, although the Plan Commission may recommend waiver or reduction of
the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the Plan
Commission concludes that the goals of this chapter are better served thereby:
         a.   Height of the proposed tower;
         b.   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
         c.   Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
         d.   Surrounding topography;
         e.   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
         f.   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
         g.   Proposed ingress and egress; and
         h.   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures, as
discussed in subsection B3 of this section.
      3.   Availability Of Suitable Existing Towers, Other Structures, Or
Alternative Technology: No new tower shall be recommended unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Plan Commission that no
existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the
use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna.
An applicant shall submit information requested by the Plan Commission related
to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing
tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant’s
proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
         a.   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meets the applicant's engineering requirements.
         b.   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet the applicant’s engineering requirements.
         c.   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
         d.   The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant’s proposed antenna.
         e.   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner
in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower
or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower
development are presumed to be unreasonable.
         f.   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
         g.   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell
network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a
wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new
tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology
unsuitable.
      4.   Setbacks: The following setback requirements shall apply to all
towers for which a special use permit is required; provided, however, that the
Plan Commission may recommend reduction of the standard setback requirements if
the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby:
         a.   Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least seventy five
percent (75%) of the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line.
         b.   Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning
district setback requirements.
      5.   Separation: The following separation requirements shall apply to all
towers and antennas for which a special use permit is required; provided,
however, that the Plan Commission may reduce the standard separation
requirement if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby.
         a.   Separation From Off-Site Uses/Designated Areas:
            (1)   Tower separation shall be measured from the base of the tower
to the lot line of the off-site uses and/or designated areas as specified in
Table 1, except as otherwise provided in  Table 1.
            (2)   Separation requirements for towers shall comply with the
minimum standards established in Table 1.

                                           whichever is greater
Existing multi-family residential units    100 feet or 100% of height of tower,
greater than duplex units                  whichever is greatest
Nonresidentially zoned lands or            None; only setbacks apply
nonresidential uses
 
         b.   Separation Distances Between Towers:  Separation distances
between towers shall be applicable for and measured between the proposed tower
and preexisting towers. The separation distances shall be measured by drawing
or following a straight line between the base of the existing tower and the
proposed base, pursuant to a site plan, of the proposed tower. The separation
distance (listed in linear feet) shall be as shown in Table 2.

      6.   Security Fencing: Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not
less than six feet (6') in height and shall also be equipped with an
appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, that the Plan Commission
may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate.
      7.   Landscaping: The following requirements shall govern the landscaping
surrounding towers for which a special use permit is required; provided,
however, that the Plan Commission may waive such requirements if the goals of
this chapter would be better served thereby:
         a.   Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from property
used for residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at
least four feet (4') wide outside the perimeter of the compound.
         b.   In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be
minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived.
         c.   Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as
towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property
perimeter may be sufficient buffer.

12-3B-1: VARIANCES DESCRIBED:
A variance is a relaxation of the requirements of this title that are
applicable to a particular lot, structure, or use. A so-called "use variance"
which would allow a use that is neither permitted nor special in the district
in question is not a variance, it is an amendment, and may be granted only as
provided in article D of this chapter.
12-3B-2: APPLICATION; INFORMATION:
   A.   Filing Application: Every application for a variance shall be filed
with the Administrator on a prescribed form. Every variance application shall
also be filed with the Soil and Water Conservation District as per State law.
The Administrator shall promptly transmit said application, together with any
advice he might wish to offer, to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   B.   Information: The application shall contain sufficient information to
allow the Board to make an informed decision and shall include at a minimum,
the following. A filing fee is required.
      1.   Name and address of the applicant;
      2.   Location of the structure/use for which the variance is sought;
      3.   Brief description of adjacent lots, structures, and/or uses;
      4.   Brief description of the problems/circumstances engendering the
variance request;
      5.   Brief, but specific, explanation of the desired variance;
      6.   Specific section(s) of this title containing the regulations which,
if strictly applied, would cause a serious problem; and
      7.   Any other pertinent information that the Administrator may require.
(1990 Code § 40-10-19)
12-3B-3: PUBLIC HEARING; NOTICE:
   A.   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on each
variance request within a reasonable time after the variance application is
submitted to them. At the hearing, any interested party may appear and testify
either in person or by duly authorized agent or attorney. Notice indicating the
time, date, and place of the hearing, and the nature of the proposed variance,
shall be given not more than thirty (30) nor less than fifteen (15) days before
the hearing:
      1.   By first class mail to the applicant and to all parties whose
property is within two hundred fifty feet (250') of the property affected by
the proposed variance;
      2.   By publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the
Village; and
      3.   By posting in places of business within the Village, including the
Village Hall.
   B.   This notice shall contain the particular location for which the
variation is requested as well as a brief statement of what the proposed
variation consists. Any notice required by this section need not include a
metes and bounds legal description of the location for which the variation is
requested, provided that the notice includes: (i) the common street address or
addresses and (ii) the property index number (“PIN”) or numbers of all the
parcels of real property contained in the area for which the variation is
requested.
(1990 Code § 40-10-20)
12-3B-4: ADVISORY REPORT; FINDINGS OF FACT:
Within a reasonable time after the public hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall submit their advisory report to the Village Board. The report shall state
the recommendation of the Board of Appeals regarding the proposed variance. The
Board of Appeals shall not recommend any variance unless, based upon the
evidence presented to them, they determine that:
   A.   The proposed variance is consistent with the general purposes of this
Code;
   B.   Strict application of the district requirements would result in great
practical difficulties or hardship to the applicant, and prevent a reasonable
return on the property;
   C.   The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from such requirements
that will alleviate the difficulties/hardship, and allow a reasonable return on
the property;
   D.   The plight of the applicant is due to peculiar circumstances not of his
own making;
   E.   The peculiar circumstances engendering the variance request are not
applicable to another property within the district and, therefore, a variance
would be a more appropriate remedy than an amendment (rezoning); and
   F.   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the
area where the premises in question is located, nor materially frustrate
implementation of the Village Comprehensive Plan.
(1990 Code § 40-10-21)
12-3B-5: ACTION BY VILLAGE BOARD:
The Village Board shall act on every proposed variance at their next regularly
scheduled meeting following submission of the advisory report of the Board of
Appeals. Without further public hearing, the Village Board may approve or
disapprove any proposed variance by a simple majority vote of all the members
then holding office.

This title divides the Village into various districts, and permits in each
district as a matter of right only those uses which are clearly compatible with
one another. Certain other uses, because of their special operational or
physical characteristics, may or may not have a detrimental impact on nearby
permitted uses, depending upon their precise location, manner of operation and
other factors. Such “special uses” require careful case-by-case review, and may
be allowed only after review and approval by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(1990 Code § 40-10-24)

12-3C-3: PUBLIC HEARING; NOTICE:
   A.   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on every
special use permit application within a reasonable time after the application
is submitted to them. At the hearing, any interested party may appear and
testify, either in person or by duly authorized agent or attorney. Notice
indicating the time, date, and place of the hearing and the nature of the
proposed special use shall be given not more than thirty (30) days nor less
than fifteen (15) days before the hearing:
      1.   By first class mail to the applicant and to all parties whose
property is within two hundred fifty feet (250') of the lot line of the
proposed special use;
      2.   By publication in a newspaper published within the Village; and
      3.   By posting in places of business within the Village, including the

   A.   Zoning Districts: In order to implement the regulatory scheme of this
title so as to achieve the objectives enumerated in section
12-1-2 of this title, the entire Village is hereby divided into the following
zoning districts:
District Designation Minimum Area
District                                    Designation Minimum Area
Agricultural                                A           None
Single-Family Residence (Small Lots)        R-1         5 acres

Industrial (Restricted)                     I-1         5 acres
 
   B.   Minimum Area: The minimum area requirement (which is intended to
prevent spot zoning) refers to the smallest total area of contiguous parcels
that can properly be given the particular district classification. The minimum
area requirement is not satisfied merely because the acreage of numerous
noncontiguous parcels, when aggregated, happens to equal or exceed the minimum
area indicated in subsection A of this section.

In determining, with precision, what territory is actually included within any
zoning district, the Administrator shall apply the following rules:

follows any of the features listed below, the corresponding feature shall be
deemed the district boundary:
      1.   Centerline of any street, alley, or highway: Such centerline.
      2.   Lot line: Such lot line.
      3.   Railroad tracks: Right-of-way line of such tracks.
      4.   Stream: Center of such stream.
      5.   Section, fraction, or survey lines: Such lines.
   B.   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is legally vacated, the
zoning districts adjoining each side of such vacated public way shall
automatically extend to the center of such way, and all territory included in
the vacated way shall thereafter be subject to all regulations of the extended
districts.
(1990 Code § 40-3-2.2)
12-4-4: ZONING OF ANNEXED LAND:
Any territory hereafter annexed to the Village shall automatically be in the R-
1 Single-Family Residence District, until duly changed by an amendment to this
title; except, that the Village Board of Trustees, with the advice of the
Zoning Board, may annex any territory as any other zoning district or districts
herein established if all legal requirements for zoning the property at the
time of the annexation and the requirements for amending this title by the
extension of the zoning district provisions are met.

if they comply with all other pertinent ordinances of the Village.
   B.   Vision Triangle: On corner lots, in the triangular portion of land
bounded by intersecting street lines and a line joining these street lines at
points thirty feet (30') from the point of intersection, no obstruction,

12-14-4: Nonconforming Uses Occupying A Structure
12-14-5: Nonconforming Uses Of Land
12-14-6: Nonconformities Under Permit Authority
12-14-1: PURPOSE:
The requirements imposed by this title are designed to guide the use of land by
encouraging the development of structures and uses that are compatible with the
predominant character of each of the various districts. Lots, structures, and
uses of land or structures that do not conform to the requirements of the
district in which they are located tend to impede appropriate development. For
example, nonconformities are frequently responsible for heavy traffic on
residential streets, the overtaxing of parking facilities, the creation of
nuisances, and/or the lowering of property values. The regulations of this
chapter are intended to alleviate such existing/potential problems by
encouraging the gradual elimination of nonconformities.
(1990 Code § 40-8-1)
12-14-2: NONCONFORMING LOTS:
   A.   Vacant Lot: Any vacant lot that does not conform to one or more of the
lot size (area dimensions) requirements of the district in which it is located
may, nonetheless, be developed for any use permitted in that district if such
vacant lot:

   B.   Two Or More Lots In Common Ownership: If two (2) or more lots or
combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage were of
record and in common ownership on the effective date hereof, and if one or more
of those lots does not meet the minimum lot width, depth, or area requirements
of the district in which it is located, the land involved shall be considered
an undivided parcel. No portion of any such parcel shall be developed except in
compliance with this title, nor shall any such parcel be divided so as to
create a lot that does not meet the requirements of this title.
(1990 Code § 40-8-2.1)
12-14-3: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
   A.   Any otherwise lawful structure which exists on the effective date
hereof, but which could not be erected under the terms of this title because of
requirements/restrictions concerning lot size, height, setbacks, or other
characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, may lawfully
remain, subject to the following provisions:
      1.   Maintenance: A nonconforming structure may be maintained by ordinary
repairs.
      2.   Enlargement; Alteration: A nonconforming structure shall not be
enlarged or altered in any way which increases its nonconformity.
      3.   Relocation: A nonconforming structure shall not be moved unless,
after relocation, it will conform to all the regulations of the district in
which it will be situated.
      4.   Reconstruction: A nonconforming structure which is destroyed or
damaged by any means shall not be reconstructed if the Administrator determines
that the cost of such reconstruction exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
structure's market value at the time of loss, unless, after reconstruction, the
structure will conform to all applicable regulations of the district in which
it is located. In the event the Administrator determines the estimated cost of
reconstruction is less than fifty percent (50%) of the structure's market value
at the time of loss, repairs or reconstruction shall be permitted, provided
such work starts within six (6) months from the date the damage occurred and is
diligently pursued to completion.
   B.   The Administrator may require that the reconstruction cost estimate be
made by a bona fide construction contractor, and that the structure's market
value at the time of loss be determined by a licensed real estate appraiser.
The owner of the damaged structure shall be responsible for obtaining these
estimates for the Administrator.
(1990 Code § 40-8-3)
12-14-4: NONCONFORMING USES OCCUPYING A STRUCTURE:
If any lawful use occupying a structure exists on the effective date hereof,
but would not be allowed under the terms of this title, such use may lawfully
continue, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   Maintenance: Any structure housing a nonconforming use may be
maintained through ordinary repairs.
   B.   Enlargement; Alteration; Reconstruction; Relocation: No structure
housing a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, structurally altered,
reconstructed, or relocated unless fifty percent (50%) of the structure is
changed to a permitted use.
   C.   Extension Of Use: No conforming use may be extended to any part(s) of
the structure not intended or designed for such use, nor shall the
nonconforming use be extended to occupy any land outside such structure.
   D.   Change Of Use: A nonconforming use occupying a structure may be changed
to a similar use, to a more restrictive use, or to a conforming use. Such use
shall not thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use.
   E.   Discontinuance Of Use: When a nonconforming use of a structure or of a
structure and premises in combination is discontinued for twelve (12)
consecutive months or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year
period, the nonconforming use shall not thereafter be resumed. Any
discontinuance caused by government action and without any contributing fault
by the nonconforming user shall not be counted in calculating the length of
discontinuance.
(1990 Code § 40-8-4)
12-14-5: NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND:
Any lawful use of land existing on the effective date hereof that would not be
permitted under the terms of this title may lawfully continue, subject to the
following provisions:
   A.   Intensification Or Extension Of Use: A nonconforming use of land shall
not be intensified or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was
occupied by such use on the effective date hereof.
   B.   Relocation: No nonconforming use of land shall be moved, in whole or in
part, unless such use, upon relocation, will conform to all pertinent
regulations of the district to which it is proposed to be located.
   C.   Change Of Use: Whenever a nonconforming use of a building has been
changed to a more restrictive use or to a conforming use, such use shall not
thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use. If no structural alterations
are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or more restricted classification.
   D.   Discontinuance: When a nonconforming use of land is discontinued for a
period of twelve (12) consecutive months, it shall not thereafter be resumed,
and any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the applicable district
regulations. Any discontinuance caused by government action and without any
contributing fault by the owner or operator shall not be counted in calculating
the length of discontinuance.
(1990 Code § 40-8-5)
12-14-6: NONCONFORMITIES UNDER PERMIT AUTHORITY:
The regulations of this chapter shall not apply to any change in an existing
structure or to any change in the use of a structure or of land for which a
permit was issued prior to the effective date hereof, or any pertinent
amendment hereto; provided, that the work authorized by such permit is
completed within a reasonable time.

mains, sanitary sewers, stormwater sewers, and other utilities and services;
and
   J.   To ensure that in conservation areas, adequate parks and similar
facilities can be made available to serve the residents of new developments.
(1990 Code § 34-1-3)
13-1-3: SCOPE:
   A.   For the purpose of present and future development of the Village and
for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of
persons living within the territory governed, the provisions and regulations
hereafter contained shall govern the subdividing and platting of lands lying
within the corporate limits of the Village and within all unincorporated
territory located within one and one-half (11/2) miles of the Village, as now
or hereafter existing, except as otherwise provided in this title. Within the
area of jurisdiction of the Village, the provisions of the Statutes of the
State of Illinois are hereby adopted as part of the “Official Plan of the
Village”.
   B.   This title prescribes procedures for the subdivision or resubdivision
of land within the area of jurisdiction of the Village and comprises the
procedures, requirements, standards and specifications with respect thereto.

13-1-4: APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATION:
   A.   Application Of Provisions: No lot, tract or parcel of land in a
“subdivision”, as defined herein, may be conveyed unless a final plat of the
property has been approved according to the requirements and provisions of this
title and recorded in the Office of the County Recorder of Deeds, except in
those instances in section
13-1-6 when subdivision plats will not be required.
(1990 Code § 34-1-5)
   B.   Interpretation: This title is intended as minimum requirements to
provide for coordinated, efficient, and economic development of the Village, to
ensure the adequacy of street and utility facilities, and to promote the public
health, safety and welfare. Thus, in accordance with State law, whenever this
title imposes higher standards than the County subdivision ordinance and the
Plat Act, 765 Illinois Compiled Statutes, said higher standards shall supersede
the County regulations in the unincorporated territory located within the
subdivision jurisdiction of the Village.
(1990 Code § 34-1-4)
13-1-5: SUITABILITY OF LAND FOR SUBDIVISION:
Land unsuitable for subdivision development due to drainage, flood hazard area,
hillside area, rock formation or any other condition or conditions constituting
a danger to health, life or property shall not be approved for subdivision
development unless the subdivider presents evidence or data satisfactory to the
Plan Commission, establishing that the methods proposed to meet any such
condition(s) are adequate to avoid any danger to health, life, or property.
(1990 Code § 34-1-6)
13-1-6: EXEMPTIONS FROM PROVISIONS:
The provisions of this title do not apply, and no subdivision plat is required,
in any of the following instances; provided, however, all of the resulting
divisions shall conform to the zoning regulations:
   A.   The division or subdivision of land into parcels or tracts of five (5)
acres or more in size which does not involve any new streets or easements of
access.

approved final plats;
   F.   To review and forward applications for subdivision variances to the
Plan Commission;
   G.   To periodically review the provisions of this title to determine
whether revisions are needed, and to make recommendations to the Plan
Commission as necessary;
   H.   To maintain up-to-date records of matters pertaining to this title,
including, but not limited to, preliminary plats, as-built records of completed
improvements, final plats, variances, and amendments; and
   I.   To provide information to subdividers/developers and to the general
public on matters related to this title.
(1990 Code § 34-5-1)
13-3-2: VARIANCES:
   A.   Application And Filing For Variance: Any subdivider/developer desiring
a variance from the requirements of this title shall file a written application
therefor with the Zoning Administrator at the same time that he files his
preliminary plat. The application shall fully explain the grounds for the
variance request, and specify the sections of this title which, if strictly
applied, would cause great practical difficulties or hardship. The
Administrator shall prepare an advisory report on the variance application and
submit it, together with the completed application, to the Plan Commission.
   B.   Review By Plan Commission: The Plan Commission shall review the
variance application and the Administrator's comments and submit their advisory
report to the Village Board, together with their recommendation on preliminary
plat approval. The Plan Commission's advisory report shall be responsive to all
the variances standards set forth in subsection C of this section.
   C.   Action By Village Board; Standards: At the same meeting at which they
take action on the application for preliminary plat approval, the Village Board
shall decide by resolution whether to grant or deny the requested subdivision
variance. A copy of their decision, clearly stating their reasons therefor and
the exact texts of any variance granted, shall be attached to both the
preliminary and final plats. The Village Board stall not grant any subdivision
variance unless, based upon the information presented to them, they determine
that:
      1.   The proposed variance is consistent with the general purposes of
this title; and
      2.   Strict application of the subdivision design and improvement
requirements would result in great practical difficulties or hardship to the
applicant, not a mere inconvenience; and
      3.   The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from the subdivision
requirements that will alleviate the difficulties/hardships; and
      4.   The plight of the applicant is due to peculiar circumstances not of
his own making; and
      5.   The peculiar circumstances engendering the variance request are not
applicable to other tracts, and therefore, a variance would be a more
appropriate remedy than an amendment; and
      6.   the variance, if granted, will not substantially impair
implementation of the Village Community Plan, including the Official Map.

controlling access to streets are prohibited, except where their control is
placed with the Village Board.
      2.   The arrangement of rights-of-way in a subdivision shall provide for
the continuation of the existing streets or rights-of-way in adjoining areas,
unless the Plan Commission deems such continuation undesirable for reasons of
topography or design. Where subdivision streets or rights-of- way are
continuations or extensions of existing streets or rights-of-way, the width
thereof shall be of the same or greater width as the existing street or right-
of-way; except, that in no case shall the street or right-of-way in the
subdivision be of less width than hereinafter provided.
      3.   Where, in the opinion of the Plan Commission, it is desirable to
provide future street access to adjoining areas, the streets and rights-of-way
in the subdivision shall be extended to the property line. If deemed necessary
by the Plan Commission, any temporary dead-end street shall be provided with a
temporary turn-around. In no case shall access be denied to any parcel or part

shall have radii of not less than twenty five feet (25').
      6.   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty
five feet (125') are prohibited.
      7.   Unless topography indicates a need for a greater length, dead-end
streets designed to be so permanently shall be no longer than five hundred feet
(500') and shall terminate in a circular open space having a radius at the
outside of the pavement of at least forty feet (40') and a diameter at the
outside of the right-of-way of at least one hundred feet (100').
      8.   Local streets shall be designed so as to discourage through traffic.
      9.   No local street grade shall be in excess of ten percent (10%) and no
collector street or arterial street grade shall be in excess of seven percent

      10.   The Plan Commission shall not approve streets which will be subject
to frequent inundation or flooding.
      11.   Alleys shall be avoided in a single-family and two-family district,
except as required by this subsection; however, they may be required in
multiple-family districts and commercial or industrial districts, unless other
definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street
loading, unloading and parking consistent and adequate for the use proposed.
      12.   Dead-end alleys shall not be permitted, except where provided with
adequate turn-around facilities at the dead end, or where such dead-end alleys
provide the only access to off-street parking.
      13.    Alleys, where provided, shall have a right-of-way of not less than
twenty feet (20').
      14.   The minimum right-of-way of local streets, including marginal
access streets and cul-de-sacs, shall be fifty feet (50').

sixty feet (60').
      16.   The minimum right-of-way of arterial or primary streets shall be
eighty feet (80').
      17.   Intersections of more than two (2) streets at one point shall be
avoided.
      18.   Where the subdivision abuts in or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the Plan Commission may require that marginal access streets
be provided in order that no lots front on such existing or proposed arterial
street.
      19.   Dedication of half-streets shall be discouraged, but may be
permitted whenever there is no other logical method of platting. However,
wherever there exists a dedicated or platted half-street or alley adjacent to
the tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street or alley shall be
platted, unless otherwise permitted by the Plan Commission.
(1990 Code § 34-2-10)
   C.   Drainage:
      1.   No plat shall be approved for any subdivision which is subject to
flooding unless the plat conforms to the applicable requirements of this title.
      2.   No plat shall be approved for any subdivision or part thereof which
is subject to periodic flooding or which contains inadequate drainage
facilities or which makes adequate drainage of streets impossible. However, if
the subdivider agrees in writing to make improvements at his expense which
will, in the opinion of the Plan Commission, make the area safe for human
occupancy and use and further provide adequate drainage for streets, then the
preliminary and final plat may be approved.
      3.   Stormwater drainage shall be discharged to marshlands, swamps,
retention basins, or other treatment facilities. Diversion of stormwater to
marshlands or swamps shall be considered by the Plan Commission for existing or
planned surface drainage. Marshlands and swamps used for stormwater shall
provide for natural or artificial water level control.
      4.   No existing ditch, stream, drain or drainage canal shall be
deepened, widened, rerouted or filled without written permission from the
Village.
      5.   Where artificial channels must be constructed to augment the natural
drainage system, such channels, as well as the natural drainageways, may be
planned as part of a recreation trail system. Channels shall be designed to be
aesthetically compatible for recreational trail use.
      6.   The drainage system shall be constructed and operational during
construction or as approved by the Village.
      7.   The natural drainage system shall be used as far as is feasible for
the storage and flow of runoff.
      8.   No plat shall be recorded for any subdivision situated within five
hundred feet (500') of any surface drain or watercourse serving a tributary
area of six hundred forty (640) acres or more, until such plat or map has been
reviewed by the Department of Transportation, either independently or in
cooperation with Federal, State or local agencies, for the purpose of
determining, for the protection of persons and property, the flood hazards
involved, and a report thereon filed by that Department with the County
Recorder.
(1990 Code § 34-2-11)
   D.   Erosion And Sediment Control: The following standards shall be applied
in the subdivision and construction of land areas:
      1.   The development shall conform to the natural limitations presented
by topography and soil so as to create the least potential for soil erosion.
      2.   Natural plant covering shall be retained and protected so far as is
consistent with development of the site.
      3.   When soil is exposed, the exposure shall be for the shortest
feasible period of time.
      4.   Land shall be developed in increments of workable size such that
adequate erosion and siltation controls can be provided as construction
progresses. The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one

completed as follows:
   (A) Undertaking in Lieu of Completion Bond.
   WHEREAS, the statutes of the State of Illinois grant to a municipal
corporation the right to require that a developer constructing certain
improvements within that community guarantee the construction of such
improvements by a completion bond or other security acceptable to the
community; and WHEREAS,                desires to construct a residential
development within the                of               , and that said
municipality is willing to accept an undertaking from a financial institution

      2.   THAT THE OWNER is the legal title holder of the following described
property:
         [LEGAL DESCRIPTION]
      3.   THAT THE OWNER shall be required to install and guarantee the
installation of streets, sidewalks, street lights, sanitary sewers, storm
sewers, water line s, recreational facilities (including structures), and
common landscaping. In order to guarantee that such facilities shall be
installed, the OWNER shall submit to the municipal engineer such specifications
and estimated engineering costs as shall be required to meet with his approval.
In aiding the municipal engineer in determining the amount of reasonably
anticipated costs for the construction of such improvements, the OWNER may
submit to the engineer signed contracts for the construction of such
improvements. The municipal engineer, upon being satisfied that the design of
the required improvements are in accordance with the ordinances of the Village
and in accordance with good engineering practices, shall estimate and certify
an amount which shall represent one hundred ten percent (110%) of the
reasonably estimated cost of completing the required improvements for which the
Village is requiring a completion guarantee.

(60) days prior to the expiration of this irrevocable credit we shall notify
the corporate authorities of the Village, by registered letter return receipt
requested, of the impending expiration date. This commitment shall not
terminate without such notice. If the work covered by this commitment has not
been completed within the time set forth in this agreement, the Village may, at
its option, continue drawing funds as otherwise provided for an additional
period of 1 year. It is recognized that the Village is according to the owner
and/or developer the permission to proceed with the development project
expressly upon the guarantee of the irrevocable nature of this commitment. It
is further acknowledged that the consideration for this irrevocable commitment
is provided by agreements between this financial institution and the developer.
The sum of this credit shall, however, be reduced in the amount of
disbursements made from time to time in accordance with the terms under which
this credit is extended as set out above.
