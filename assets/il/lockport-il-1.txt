in the manner prescribed by the provisions of ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, §§ 8-7-1 et
seq., for the purpose of enabling the city to have in its treasury at all times

tures of all general and corporate purposes.
(Ord. 665, passed 1-18-65)
   (B)   The Treasurer of the city is directed to set apart in such working

pursuant to authority granted by such act authorizing the creation of the
working cash fund referred to in division (A) of this section, which money
shall be used only for the purposes and in the manner provided in such act and
as authorized by separate ordinance, to be adopted by the Council from time to
time in order to provide moneys to meet ordinary and necessary expenditures for
all general and special corporate purposes.
   (C)   That all interest earned on investments of moneys of the working cash
fund of the city received for the tax year 1973 and thereafter shall be

(`79 Code, § 35.030) (Ord. 785, passed 3-18-74)
DEBT MANAGEMENT POLICY
§ 33.50 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose for the debt management policy is to provide a general
framework for the use, management, and reporting of the City of Lockport's debt
financing. It is the objective of the policy for the city to obtain financing
only when necessary, establish conditions to obtain financing at the lowest
cost, retain the highest practical credit rating, and maintain full and
complete financial disclosure and reporting. In addition to adherence to this
policy, the city's financing will also be in compliance with applicable Federal
law, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, and Illinois
Compiled Statutes (ILCS).
   (B)   This policy provides a functional tool for debt management, as well as
enhances the city's reputation for managing its debt in a conservative and
prudent manner. Adherence to the policy is essential to ensure the city
maintains a sound financial position and protects the credit quality of its
obligations.
(Ord. 19-012, passed 5-2-19)
§ 33.51 SCOPE.
   This policy will be all-inclusive of debt issued by the city including, but
not limited to, general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, alternate revenue
source bonds, debt certificates, installment contracts, leases, special service
area bonds, special assessment bonds, working cash bonds, tax anticipation
warrants, tax anticipation notes, revenue anticipation notes, and tax increment
bonds. In addition, refunding bonds may be issued to save the city interest
costs or to restructure the city's debt payments. This policy contains certain
elements on procedures and practices to achieve the objectives of the policy
and to ensure professional standards are defined and met in the policy's
implementation.
(Ord. 19-012, passed 5-2-19)
§ 33.52 LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Federal. 
      (1)   The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) of 1986 as amended and its
arbitrage and rebate regulations govern the tax-exempt status of the interest
on municipal bonds. Upon issuance of any municipal bonds, the city will
covenant to follow certain Federal rules and regulations in order to maintain
the tax-exempt status of the interest on the bonds. To receive these benefits,
the city must ensure that the requirements under the IRC are met, generally for
as long as the bonds remain outstanding.
      (2)   These requirements include, but are not limited to:
         (a)   File Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 8038-G, Information
Return for Tax-Exempt Governmental Bonds ($100,000 issue price or greater) or
Form 8038-GC, Information Return for Small Tax-Exempt Governmental Bond Issues,
Leases, and Installment Sales (less than $100,000 issue price);
         (b)   Bond proceeds must be used to finance activities of, or
facilities owned, operated or used by, the city for its purpose or another
state or local government for its own purposes;
         (c)   Allocate to expenditures not later than 18 months after the
later of the date each expenditure is paid or the date the project, if any,
that is financed by the issue is placed in service; and
         (d)   Rebate to the IRS for investments earning a yield materially
higher than the yield of the bond issue (arbitrage).
   (B)   U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Congress passed the
Securities Act of 1933 with the objective of providing investors full
disclosure of material facts about securities offered and sold. In 1934,
Congress passed the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”) that
created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and empowered the SEC with
broad authority over most aspects of the securities industry. Although
municipal securities are exempt from many of the requirements, the city is
still subject to:
      (1)   Rule 10b-5 of the 1934 Act. Sets out the general statement of
federal intent to protect investors against misleading statements or omissions
of important facts in official statements or other documents pertaining to the
bond issuance; and
      (2)   Rule 15c2-12 of the 1934 Act. Governs the preparation and
distribution of official statements for municipal securities and satisfying
continuing disclosure requirements.
   (C)   State. The Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS) authorize and govern the
issuance of municipal bonds. The key laws include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   The Bond Authorization Act (ILCS Ch. 30, Act 305) allows for the
issuance of bonds by cities.
      (2)   The Illinois Municipal Code (ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 8-5-1) subjects
cities to a legal limitation of general obligation bonded indebtedness of
8.625% of the total assessed equalized value of real property within the city
(the “city's debt limit”).
      (3)   The Local Government Debt Reform Act (ILCS Ch. 30, Act 350, § 15)
allows for the issuance of alternate bonds in lieu of revenue bonds. In
addition, alternate bonds are not subject to the city's debt limit.
      (4)   The Illinois Property Tax Extension Limitation Law (ILCS Ch. 35,
Act 200, § 18-185) (“PTELL”) allows the issuance of an amount of general
obligation bonds equal to the aggregate extension for principal and interest
payments for non-referendum bonds that cities issued prior to January 1, 1997
(debt service extension base). The following bonds are not subject to PTELL
limitations: alternate bonds; and
      (5)   Revenue obligations issued to refund or to continue to refund
operations initially issued pursuant to referendum. As a home rule unit of
local government, the city is not subject to any debt limitation nor is it
subject to the limitations of PTELL.
(Ord. 19-012, passed 5-2-19)
§ 33.53 GUIDELINES FOR USE.
   This policy establishes standards to help determine whether debt is an
appropriate option as shifting circumstances arise over time. Borrowing money
is a financing tool which should be thoughtfully used and will be considered
when some or all of the following conditions exist:
   (A)   Adequate resources. Future revenues sufficient to cover debt service;
   (B)   Characteristics. Project represents a one-time investment (e.g.
building) rather than ongoing operations (e.g. maintenance of building);
   (C)   Favorable market conditions. Interest rates and construction costs are
reasonable;
   (D)   Intergenerational equity. Help distribute costs and benefits of
capital asset over its useful life;
   (E)   Length of issuance. Term of financing will not exceed expected life of
capital asset;
   (F)   Mandates. Improvements required by Federal or state authorities;
   (G)   Options. Other financing has been explored and is not viable for the
timely acquisition or completion of a capital asset; and
   (H)   Within financial limits. Consistent with Federal, state, and local
regulations.
(Ord. 19-012, passed 5-2-19)
§ 33.54 TYPES OF DEBT.
   (A)   The Illinois Municipal Code (ILCS Ch. 65 Act 5, § 8-4.1-2) defines
bonds as “any instrument evidencing the obligation to pay money authorized or
issued by or on behalf of a municipality under applicable law including,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, bonds, notes, installment or
financing contracts, leases, certificates, tax anticipation warrants or notes,
vouchers, or any evidence of indebtedness.”
   (B)   The types of debt permitted by the city to meet its financing
objectives includes, but is not limited to:
      (1)   General obligation bonds. Financing secured only by the full faith
and credit of the city;
      (2)   Alternate bonds. Financing secured by a defined source of revenue
(not property tax) and the full faith and credit of the city;
      (3)   Revenue bonds. Financing secured only by a defined source of
revenue (not property tax);
      (4)   Capital leases. Financing of a vehicle or equipment over time with
a provision to transfer ownership at a nominal amount at the termination of the
lease;
      (5)   Loans. Federal and state low interest financing secured by a
defined source of revenue (not property tax) typically used for water and
wastewater projects; and
      (6)   Other. Special circumstances may exist when other forms of debt are
appropriate, necessary, and advantageous to the city
   (C)   State and local governments receive tax benefits under the IRC that
lower borrowing costs on their bonds. Bondholders are willing to accept a lower
interest rate because interest paid to bondholders on these obligations is not
includable in their gross income for federal income tax purposes. The city will
generally issue tax-exempt bonds. However, the city may occasionally, based on
facts and circumstances, issue taxable bonds which have a higher interest rate.
   (D)   In addition, the city shall be mindful of the potential benefits of
bank-qualified bonds. This designation is given to a bond issuance if the city
reasonably expects to issue in the calendar year of such offering no more than
$10,000,000 of tax-exempt debt. When purchased by a commercial bank for its
portfolio, the bank may deduct a portion of the interest cost of carrying the
debt. Therefore, the city will strive to limit its annual issuance of tax-
exempt debt to $10,000,000 or less, as amended by IRC from time to time, when
the estimated benefits are greater than the benefits of exceeding the bank
qualification limit.
   (E)   The city shall not be permitted to use derivative instruments
including interest rate swaps, forward swaps, swap options, basis swaps, caps,
floors, collars, rate locks, cancellation options or any similar hedge,
derivative, or synthetic instrument.
(Ord. 19-012, passed 5-2-19)
§ 33.55 STANDARDS OF CARE.
   (A)   Prudence. Debt shall be issued with judgment and care under the
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion, and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs. The standard of
prudence to be used by debt management officials shall be the “prudent person”
standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall debt
portfolio. City officers and employees acting in accordance with this policy,
and any other written procedures, and exercising due diligence shall be
relieved of personal liability, provided that officers and employees report
deviations from expectations in a timely fashion and take appropriate action to
control adverse developments.
   (B)   Maintaining the public trust. All participants in the debt management
process shall seek to act responsibly as custodians of the public trust and
shall avoid any transaction that might impair public confidence in the city.
   (C)   Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees of the city
who are involved in the debt management process shall refrain from personal
business activity that could conflict with proper execution and management of
the debt program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial
decisions. Employees and officials shall disclose to the Board any material
interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business.
(Ord. 19-012, passed 5-2-19)
§ 33.56 STRUCTURING PRACTICES.
   The duration of a bond issue shall not exceed the economic or useful life of
the improvement or asset that the issue is financing. The city shall design the
financing schedule and repayment of bonds to take best advantage of market
conditions and, as practical, to recapture or maximize its credit capacity for
future use, and moderate the impact to the taxpayer.
   (A)   Maturity guidelines.
      (1)   Governmental activities. Maturity limited to 20 years.
      (2)   Business-type activities. Maturity limited to 40 years.
   (B)   Debt service schedule.
      (1)   A level or declining debt service schedule will be employed unless
operational matters dictate otherwise, or except to achieve overall level debt
service with existing bonds.
      (2)   The city will use the debt service schedule which will best fit
with the overall debt structure of the city's bonds at the time the new bonds
are issued.
      (3)   Consideration will be given to coordinating the length of the issue
with the lives of assets, whenever practicable.
   (C)   Use of credit enhancements. Credit enhancements are mechanisms which
guarantee principal and interest payments. The city may enter into agreements
with commercial banks or other financial entities to acquire letters of credit,
municipal bond insurance, or other credit enhancements that will provide the
city with access to credit under terms and conditions as specified in such
agreements, when their use is judged cost effective or otherwise advantageous.
A credit enhancement, while costly, will usually bring a lower interest rate on
bonds and a higher rating from the rating agencies, thus lowering overall
costs.
   (D)   Use of redemption features. A call option, or optional redemption
provision, gives the city the right to prepay or retire bonds prior to their
stated maturity. These prepayment provisions are structured into the original
bond issuance to provide the city an opportunity to manage its debt portfolio.
The exercise of these prepayment provisions is typically accomplished through
the issuance of refunding bonds. Bonds can be refunded to achieve one or more
of the following objectives:
      (1)   Reduce future interest costs. Shall be at least 2% present value
savings for current refunding and at least 3% present value savings for advance
refunding;
      (2)   Restructure future debt service in response to evolving conditions
regarding anticipated revenue sources;
      (3)   Alter bond characteristics, such as call provisions or payment
dates, on existing bonds; and
      (4)   Change the legal requirements, termed covenants, of the original
issue to reflect more closely the changing conditions of the city or the type
of bond.
   (E)   Debt capacity. As a local government entity with home-rule authority,
the city has no statutorily determined debt limit. However, it is important
that the city issue debt prudently.
      (1)   Funds borrowed for a project today are not available to fund other
projects tomorrow.
      (2)   Funds committed for debt repayment today are not available to fund
operations in the future.
      (3)   Enterprise fund debt capacity will be evaluated as an integral part
of the city's rate review and setting process. The city will set rates at the
level needed to cover the full cost of operations, maintenance, administration
and capital improvement costs, including debt service requirements.
(Ord. 19-012, passed 5-2-19)
§ 33.57 DEBT ISSUANCE PROCESS.
   (A)   Approval of issuance. The City Council shall adopt an ordinance
authorizing the issuance of bonds.
   (B)   Method of sale. The city will select the method of sale which best
fits the type of bonds being sold, market conditions, and the desire to
structure bond maturities to enhance the overall performance of the debt
portfolio. The general methods for the sale of municipal bonds include:
      (1)   Competitive sale. Bonds are marketed to a wide audience of
investment banking firms (underwriters). Their bids are submitted
electronically at a specific time and the bonds are sold to the bidder
proposing the lowest true interest cost (TIC).
      (2)   Negotiated sale. The city will negotiate all rates and terms of the
sale with an underwriter who is selected in advance of the bond sale.
      (3)   Private placement. The city sells its bonds to a limited number of
sophisticated investors, but not the general public.
   (C)   Selection and use of professional service providers. The city will
procure professional services as needed to successfully authorize, structure,
and market bonds due to the complex nature of the transactions. These
professional service providers may include arbitrage consultants, bond counsel,
disclosure counsel, escrow agents, financial advisors, paving agents,
underwriters, and verification agents.
      (1)   Financial Advisor. The Financial Advisor will recommend the
financing structure; prepare and review preliminary and official statements;
review ordinances concerning the authorization and award of financing: assist
the city in developing and presenting information to rating agencies; provide
the electronic bidding platform; and provide assistance with the closing and
delivery of securities. To ensure independence, the Financial Advisor will not
bid on or underwrite any city bond issues on which it is advising.
      (2)   Bond Counsel involvement. Bond Counsel will prepare and review the
ordinances authorizing and awarding the bonds; provide a written opinion
regarding the validity and binding effect of the bonds; determine the Federal
tax status of interest on any bonds: and prepare electronically bound official
transcripts related to the authorization, offering, sale and delivery of the
bond issue. The city will also seek assistance from Bond Counsel on other types
of debt financing, as well as on any questions involving federal tax or
arbitrage law. To ensure independence, Bond Counsel will not simultaneously
represent any other party involved in the financing unless a conflict waiver is
obtained from the city.
   (D)   Credit ratings. The city may seek a rating on all new bond issues
being sold in the public market-municipal bond ratings determine the amount of
investment risk and interest cost on bonds issued to finance city projects.
These ratings assess several factors including, but not limited to, current
state of the economy, debt structure, financial condition, and management
practices. The city will use both formal and informal methods to disseminate
information and communicate with the rating agencies as follows:
      (1)   Full disclosure of the financial condition of the city on an annual
basis;
      (2)   Formal presentation on a regular basis covering economic,
financial, operational, and other issues that impact the city's credit;
      (3)   Disclosure of financial events that may impact the city's credit;
      (4)   Dissemination of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR);
and
      (5)   Distribution of any documents pertaining to the sale of bonds.
(Ord. 19-012, passed 5-2-19)
§ 33.58 DEBT MANAGEMENT PROCESS.
   (A)   Investment of proceeds. The city acknowledges its ongoing fiduciary
responsibilities to actively manage the proceeds of bonds issued for public
purposes in a manner that is consistent with the city's investment policy,
Illinois statutes that govern the investment of public funds, and consistent
with the covenants of related bond documents. The investment of bond proceeds
requires significant diligence in meeting the objectives of regulatory
compliance, management of the covenants described in financing documents, and
the needs of the projects being funded.
   (B)   Compliance practices.
      (1)   Arbitrage. It is the city's policy to minimize the cost of
arbitrage rebate and yield restriction while strictly complying with the
Federal arbitrage and rebate regulations. The city will take the following
steps to minimize any rebate liability through proactive management in the
structuring and oversight of its bonds.
         (a)   Examine whether the city met the arbitrage rebate exception
rules;
         (b)   Use bond proceeds only for the purpose and authority for which
they were issued;
         (c)   Monitor the expenditure of bond proceeds and exercise best
efforts to spend proceeds in such a manner that the city will meet one of the
spend-down exemptions from arbitrage rebate;
         (d)   Maintain detailed investment records and monitor the investment
of bond proceeds with awareness of rules pertaining to yield restrictions; and
         (e)   Perform arbitrage rebate calculations as determined by the IRS.
      (2)   Continuing disclosure. The city has covenanted and agreed in
previous instances, in accordance with Rule 15c2-12 of the 1934 Act, to provide
certain financial information and operating data relating to the city within
210 days after the close of the city's fiscal year; and, in a timely manner, to
provide notices of the occurrence of certain enumerated events. The following
will be filed by the city with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)
for disclosures on its Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) system:
         (a)   Audited financial statements;
         (b)   Financial and operating data included in the original official
statement;
         (c)   Required event notices; and
         (d)   Voluntary event notices.
      (3)   Legal covenants. The city shall comply with all covenants and
conditions contained in any legal document entered into at the time of the bond
offering.

§ 34.33 TAX IN ADDITION TO OTHER PAYMENTS.
   The tax authorized by this subchapter shall be in addition to the payment of
money or value of products or services furnished to the city by the taxpayer as

(Ord. 15-106, passed 8-19-15)
§ 34.34 COLLECTION OF TAX.
   (A)   The tax authorized by this subchapter shall be collected from the
purchaser by the person maintaining a place of business in this state who
delivers the electricity to the purchaser. This tax shall constitute a debt of
the purchaser to the person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser and
if unpaid, is recoverable in the same manner as the original charge for
delivering the electricity. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to this
subchapter and any such tax collected by a person delivering electricity shall
constitute a debt owed to the municipality by such person delivering the
electricity provided that the person delivering electricity shall be allowed a
credit for such tax related to deliveries of electricity the charges for which
are written off as uncollectible and provided further, that if such charges are
thereafter collected, the delivering supplier shall be obligated to remit such
tax. Persons delivering electricity shall also be authorized to add to such
gross charge an amount equal to 3% of the tax to reimburse the person
delivering electricity for the expense incurred in keeping records, billing
customers, preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data
to the city upon request. If the person delivering electricity fails to collect
the tax from the purchaser, then the purchaser shall be required to pay the tax
directly to the city in the manner prescribed by the city. Persons delivering
electricity who file returns pursuant to this section shall, at the time of
filing such return, pay the city the amount of the tax collected pursuant to
this subchapter. In the event a purchaser shall make only a partial payment of
any bill supplied to him, her or it by the supplier, any such partial payment
not specifically identified by the purchaser to be applied to the tax imposed
by this subchapter shall be deemed to be for the delivery of electricity.

make a like return to the City Treasurer for a corresponding one month period.
The Tax Collector making the return herein provided for shall, at the time of
making such return, pay to the City Treasurer, the amount of tax herein
imposed; provided that in connection with any return the Tax Collector may, if
he so elects, report and pay an amount based upon the total billings of
business subject to the tax during the period for which the return is made
(exclusive of any amounts previously billed) with prompt adjustments of later
payments based upon any differences between such billings and the taxable gross
receipts.
   (C)   If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been paid which was not
due under the provisions of this section, whether as the result of a mistake of
fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be credited against any tax
due, or to become due, under this section from the taxpayer or tax collector
who made the erroneous payment; provided that no amounts erroneously paid more
than three years prior to the filing of a claim therefor shall so be credited.
   (D)   No action to recover any amount of tax due under the provisions of

   As used in this subchapter, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:
   AMOUNT PAID. The amount charged to the taxpayer’s service address in the
city, regardless of where such amount is billed or paid.
   DEPARTMENT. The Illinois Department of Revenue.
   GROSS CHARGE. The amount paid for the act or privilege of originating or

connection therewith by a retailer, valued in money whether paid in money or
otherwise, including cash, credits, services and property of every kind or
nature, and shall be determined without any deduction on account of the cost of
such telecommunications, the cost of the materials used, labor or service
costs, or any other expense whatsoever. In case credit is extended, the amount
thereof shall be included only as and when paid. GROSS CHARGES for private-line
service shall include charges imposed at each termination channel point within
the city, and charges for that portion of the inter-office channels provided
within this city. Charges for that portion of the inter-office channel
connecting two or more channel termination points, one or more of which is
located within the jurisdictional boundary of this city, shall be determined by
the retailer by multiplying an amount equal to the total charge for the inter-
office channel by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of channel
termination points that are located within the jurisdictional boundary of the
city, and the denominator of which is the total number of channel termination
points connected by the inter-office channel. However, GROSS CHARGE shall not
include any of the following:
      (1)   Any amounts added to a purchaser’s bill because of a charge made
pursuant to:
         (a)   The tax imposed by §
34.52;
         (b)   The tax imposed by the Telecommunications Excise Tax Act;
         (c)   The tax imposed by Section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (d)   911 surcharges; or
         (e)   Charges added to customers' bills pursuant to the provisions of
Section 9-221 or 9-222 of the Public Utilities Act, as amended, or any similar

regulation by the Illinois Commerce Commission, for the purpose of recovering
any of the tax liabilities or other amounts specified in those provisions of
the Public Utilities Act;
      (2)   Charges for a sent-collect telecommunication received outside of
the city;
      (3)   Charges for leased time on equipment or charges for the storage of
data or information for subsequent retrieval or the processing of data or
information intended to change its form or content. Such equipment includes,
but is limited to, the use of calculators, computers, data processing
equipment, tabulating equipment or accounting equipment, and also includes the
usage of computers under a time-sharing agreement;
      (4)   Charges for customer equipment, including such equipment that is
leased or rented by the customer from any source, wherein such charges are
disaggregated and separately identified from other charges;
      (5)   Charges to business enterprises certified as exempt under Section
9-222.1 of the Public Utilities Act, to the extent of such exemption, and
during the period of time specified by the Department of Commerce and Economic

provided in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly
owned subsidiaries, or between wholly owned subsidiaries, when the tax imposed
by §
34.52 has already been paid to a retailer, and only to the extent that the
charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries, or
between wholly owned subsidiaries, represent expense allocation between the
corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering
such service;
      (7)   Bad debts (BAD DEBT means any portion of a debt that is related to
a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or
excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under
applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to
be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that
portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made);
      (8)   Charges paid by inserting coins in coin-operated telecommunications
devices;
      (9)   Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the
Telecommunications Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act; or
      (10)   Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if: (a)
those charges are aggregated with other charges for telecommunications that are
taxable; (b) those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or
invoice; and (c) the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on
the retailer's books and records kept in the regular course of business. If the
nontaxable charges cannot be reasonably identified, the gross charge from the
sale of both taxable and nontaxable services of telecommunications billed on a
combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or
telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the
retailer of the telecommunications.
   INTERSTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS. All telecommunications that either originate
or terminate outside this state.
   INTRASTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS. All telecommunications that originate and
terminate within this state.
   PERSON. Any natural individual, firm, trust, estate, partnership,

subdivision of this state.

not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction
of the Department, furnishes adequate security to insure collection and payment
of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect
such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect
the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this state, in
the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining
a place of business within this state. The permit may be revoked by the
Department at its discretion.
   RETAILER MAINTAINING A PLACE OF BUSINESS IN THIS STATE, or any like term,
means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state,
directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission
facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or
other representative operating within this state under the authority of the
retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or
agent or other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or
whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this state.
   SALE AT RETAIL. The transmitting, supplying or furnishing of
telecommunications, and all services and equipment provided in connection
therewith, for a consideration, to persons other than the federal and state
governments, and state universities created by statute, and other than between

subsidiaries, for their use or consumption and not for resale.
   SERVICE ADDRESS. The location of telecommunications equipment from which
telecommunications services are originated, or at which telecommunications
services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined
location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime
systems, SERVICE ADDRESS means the customer's place of primary use, as defined
in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-ground
systems and the like, SERVICE ADDRESS shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment, as defined by telephone
number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
   TAXPAYER. A person who, individually or through his or her agents, employees
or permittees, engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications in a municipality, and who incurs a tax liability as
authorized by this subchapter.
   TELECOMMUNICATIONS. In addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly
ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information
transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide-area telephone service,
private-line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter,
computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service,
specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any
other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any
other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means,
between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio,
satellite or similar facilities. As used in this subchapter, PRIVATE LINE means
a dedicated non-traffic-sensitive service for a single customer, which entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. This definition of TELECOMMUNICATIONS shall not include
value-added services in which computer-processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. TELECOMMUNICATIONS shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications.
Carrier-access charges, right-of-access charges, charges for use of inter-
company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered TELECOMMUNICATIONS
subject to the tax imposed under §
34.52. For purposes of this section, PREPAID TELEPHONE CALLING ARRANGEMENTS
means that term as defined in Section 2-27 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax
Act.

privileges:
      (1)   The act or privilege of originating in the city or receiving in the
city intrastate telecommunications by a person, at a rate of 2% of the gross
charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. To
prevent actual multi-municipal taxation of the act or privilege that is subject
to taxation under this division, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has
paid a tax in another municipality on that event, shall be allowed a credit
against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section, to the
extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the city that was not
previously allowed as a credit against any other municipal tax.
      (2)   The act or privilege of originating in the city or receiving in the
city interstate telecommunications by a person, at a rate of 2% of the gross
charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. To
prevent actual multi-state or multi-municipal taxation of the act or privilege
that is subject to taxation under this division, any taxpayer, upon proof that
the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state or municipality in this state on
such event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or
authorized by this section, to the extent of the amount of such tax properly
due and paid in such other state, or such tax properly due and paid in another
municipality in this state, which was not previously allowed as a credit
against any other state or local tax in this state.
   (B)   The tax imposed by this section is not imposed on such act or
privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the Constitution
and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the city.

§ 34.53 COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS.
   (A)   The tax authorized by this subchapter shall be collected from the
taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state, and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to, or as authorized by, this subchapter, and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the Department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this subchapter
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
Department in the manner provided by the Department.
   (B)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this subchapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item, separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.

§ 34.55 RESELLERS.
   (A)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
Department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts that will show
the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by this
subchapter on any of such purchases, and shall furnish such additional
information as the Department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
Department may cancel any number obtained through misrepresentation, or used to
send or receive such telecommunication tax-free, when such actions in fact are
not for resale, or that no longer applies because of the person's having
discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale, unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department, and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is nontaxable because of being a sale for resale.

the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty of 5% of the amount of tax required to be shown as due on a return
shall be imposed, and a late payment penalty of 5% of the tax due shall be
imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided by the
controlling tax ordinance and prior to the city issuing a notice of tax
delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be
assessed equal to 25% of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period
for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty

administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is 34 days delinquent, the taxpayer
shall have 14 working days to cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to
cure the delinquency within the 14-day period or fails to demonstrate good
faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local administrator,
the installment contract shall be canceled without further notice to the
taxpayer.
(Ord. 00-281, passed 12-26-00)
§ 34.82 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.

tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still due and
owing.

years maximum after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.

be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in which return for the
applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was filed.
   (C)   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer.
(Ord. 00-281, passed 12-26-00)
§ 34.83 VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.
   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent per month for all periods prior to the
filing of the application, but not more than four years before the date of
filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the
filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the
local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.

Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the City
Clerk's office.
(Ord. 00-281, passed 12-26-00)
§ 34.85 INTERNAL REVIEW.
   The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (A)   In a timely manner, remove the lien at the city's expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.

CODE OF ETHICS
§ 39.11 POLICY AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of the Code of Ethics is to establish ethical standards of
conduct for city officials and employees by identifying acts or actions that
are incompatible with the best interests of the city. By eliminating conflicts
of interest and providing a guide for conduct in city matters, the Mayor and
City Council hope to promote the faith and confidence of the citizens in their
government.
   (B)   It is essential to the proper operation of democratic government that
public officials and employees be independent and impartial; that governmental
decisions and policy be made through proper channels; that public office not be
used for private gain; and that there be public confidence in the integrity of
government. Public officials and employees must serve their government in a
fiduciary capacity and must not bestow special consideration upon any person
merely because of that person's relationship to an official or employee. The
attainment of these ends is impaired whenever there exists conflict between the
private interests of a public official or employee and his or her duties as
such. The public interest therefore requires that the law protect against such
conflicts of interest and establish appropriate ethical standards with respect
to the conduct of elected officials and government employees in situations
where conflicts exist, as well as in situations where conflicts might develop.
   (C)   It is also essential to the proper operation of government that those
best qualified be encouraged to serve the government. Accordingly, legal
safeguards against conflicts of interest must be so designed as not to
unnecessarily or unreasonably impede the recruitment and retention by the
government of those persons who are best qualified to serve it. The right of
each official and employee to privacy in his or her financial affairs must not,
therefore, be limited beyond that disclosure necessary to ensure the integrity
of government. Moreover, because an essential principle underlying the staffing
of our government is that its officials and employees should not be denied the
opportunity, available to all other citizens, to acquire and retain private
economic and other interests, such opportunity should not be limited unless
conflicts with the responsibility of such officials and employees to the public
cannot be avoided.

application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim,
controversy, investigation, charge, accusation or other particular matter
involving a specific party or parties in which the city is a party or has a
direct and substantial interest. Nothing contained herein shall, however,
preclude any official or employee from exercising his or her duties and
responsibilities as an official or employee of the city. Nothing in this

matter before the city or other entity that does not involve the board or
commission to which that person has been appointed.
   (F)   Post-employment restrictions. No person, having been an official or

connection with any judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a
ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, investigation,
charge, accusation or other particular matter involving a specific party or

confidential or other non-public information.

any board or commission having final or advisory jurisdiction over any

member is present at the meeting or is a party to the telephone conference.

the gift and the recipient of the gift, including any previous exchange of

that no such finding shall be made except after all process due under
applicable federal, state, or local law is taken.
   (B)   Prosecution.
      (1)   Prohibited political activity. It shall be a misdemeanor for any

jurisdiction as set forth in the code the City Attorney may commence criminal
proceedings in the name of the city and in accordance with the Criminal Code of
1961, as amended (ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, §§ 1-1 et seq.) and the Code of Criminal
Procedure of 1963, as amended (ILCS Ch. 725, Act 5, §§ 100-1 et seq.) if he or

Ethics has occurred. A person convicted of a violation of the Code of Ethics
may be punished by a term of incarceration in a penal institution other than a
penitentiary for a period not more than six months and may be fined in an
amount not to exceed $750.
      (2)   Other violations. It shall be an ordinance violation for any person
to knowingly violate, or knowingly attempt to violate, any provision of the
city Ethics Code other than §
39.15. At the direction of the entity having enforcement jurisdiction as set
forth in division (D) of this section, the City Attorney may commence quasi-
criminal proceedings in the name of the city and in accordance with the Code of
Ordinances, as amended, and the Illinois Municipal Code, as amended (ILCS Ch.
65, Act 5, §§ 1-1 et seq.) if he determines that there exists probable cause
that a violation of the city Ethics Code has occurred. A person convicted of a
violation of the Code of Ethics may be punished by a fine of up to $750.
      (3)   False reports. It shall be a violation of the city Ethics Code for
any person to knowingly file a false report with an entity having enforcement
jurisdiction alleging that a city official or city employee committed a
violation of the city Ethics Code. Any person who knowingly makes a false
report alleging a violation of the city Ethics Code to an entity having
enforcement jurisdiction commits a misdemeanor. At the direction of the entity
having enforcement jurisdiction as set forth in division (D) of this section,

added to the customer's monthly bill.
   (E)   Who may remove, repair meters; meter stop. After any water meter is
placed, only officers or employees of the Water and Sewer Department shall be
allowed to repair, remove or in any manner interfere with such meter. A meter
stop or valve shall be placed on each side of the meter.
   (F)   Injuring, defacing meters; notice of defective meter. It shall be
unlawful for any person to injure, deface, mar, destroy or in any manner to
interfere with any water meter. It shall be the duty of the owner or occupant
to promptly notify the Water and Sewer Department of defects in any such meter,
or of its failure to properly register the quantity of water passing through
the same.
   (G)   Cost of keeping meter repaired. Water meters shall be deemed

jointly and severally liable for any breakage or damage done to such meter,
including damage by freezing, hot water, or breakage, and also for the theft
thereof.
   (H)   Liability to city for losses incurred by city caused by chapter
violations and additional charges.  Any person violating any of the provisions
of this section shall become liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage
occasioned the city by reason of such violation. The cost of making good such
loss or damage, any replacement meter charge, any resealing of meter charge or
meter test charge shall be paid by the owner and/or the occupant of the

   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the city's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the city
rights-of-way and the city as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this chapter, the city intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the city and, in particular, the use of the
public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:

parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
city’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;

installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the city’s residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.

facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the city
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the city enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the city may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this
chapter.
   (E)   Effect of Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements.

§ 53.05 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   City Review of Permit Applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the City Engineer
within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not conform to
the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations,
the City Engineer shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons
therefor. If the City Engineer is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to
the requirements of this chapter and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules,
and regulations, the City Engineer shall issue a permit therefor as soon as
practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to
demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, that the construction
proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Additional City Review of Applications of Telecommunications
Retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, ILCS Ch. 220,
Act 65, § 4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the city that it
intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for the
provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the city not less than 45 days prior to the commencement of work
requiring no excavation and not less than 45 days prior to the commencement of
work requiring excavation. The City Engineer shall specify the portion of the
right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the City Engineer fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either (i)
ten days after service of notice to the city by the telecommunications retailer
in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or (ii) 25
days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of
work involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer
may commence work without obtaining a permit under this chapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the city, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
53.04 of this chapter the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the city
an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of division (A) of this
section.

§ 53.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority Granted, No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on city rights-of-way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the city with
such city representatives in attendance as the city deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by the
city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the city and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. 99-223, passed 6-30-99; Am. Ord. 07-744, passed 12-12-07)
§ 53.07 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within 90 days after the
completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
53.21. If the city denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall
either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that
it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.

§ 53.08 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required Coverages and Limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the city, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents,
and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in divisions (A)(1)
and (2) below:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products- completed operations coverage
with limits not less than:
         (a)   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each person;
         (b)   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any one
accident; and
         (c)   Five million dollars for all other types of liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000) for personal injury
and property damage for each accident;
      (3)   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident. If the utility is not providing such
insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors performing the work,
then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess or Umbrella Policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies Required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the city within ten days following receipt
of a written request therefor from the city.
   (D)   Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages. The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by
the City, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice addressed to the City Administrator of such intent to cancel or
not to renew."
Within ten days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no event,
later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and
furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under division (A), or the requirements of divisions (B), (C), and (D)
of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) of this
section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under
the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility's Liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance Companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
[All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated “A-“ or better
and of a class size “X” or higher by A.M. Best Company.]

   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and bold the city and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.

§ 53.10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non- performance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the city must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this division
(B) shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost multiplied by 110% to restore the
right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the
construction under the permit, as determined by the City Engineer, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are likely
to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the City Engineer
may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single
amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction
under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall
be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the
provisions of this division (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The city, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the 14 day notice
period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
city that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the permittee
shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in division (C) of this
section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the balance required in
division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the city with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

city may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time periods
provided in this division (C).
   (D)   Stop Work Order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the city may issue a stop work order immediately upon discovery
of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within division (A) of this
section.
   (E)   Failure or Refusal of the Permittee to Comply. If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of division (C) of this section, the city or its
designee may, at the option of the city: (1) correct the deficiencies; (2) upon
not less than 20 days notice to the permittee, remove the subject facilities or

a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of
this chapter from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance
should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to Grant Variances. The City Engineer shall decide whether a
variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for Granting of Variance. The City Engineer may authorize a
variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and

would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the City Engineer may require the utility requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of
this chapter.
   (E)   Right to Appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the City
Engineer under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to appeal to

application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the City Clerk within
30 days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or determination.
The City Council shall commence its consideration of the appeal at the
Council’s next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven days after

§ 53.99 PENALTY.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when the city will
incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this chapter. Unless
the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the city’s costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

§ 55.018 SPILL CONTAINMENT.
   (A)   Accidental discharges.  
      (1)   Each significant industrial user having the ability to cause
interference with the POTW or to violate the regulatory provisions of this
chapter shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained
at the user's own cost and expense. All significant industrial users whose
wastewater includes or could include compatible or incompatible pollutants in
amounts great enough to cause interference or upset with the POTW must have
detailed plans on file with the city showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection. Plans shall be approved by the city
before users shall complete such a plan by no later than 190 days following the
effective date of this chapter. NO user who commences contribution to or could
contribute such pollutants to the POTW after the effective date of this chapter
shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental
discharge facilities and procedures have been approved by the city and
installed by the user.
      (2)   Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall
not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Immediate notification. In the case of an accidental or deliberate
discharge of compatible or incompatible pollutants, which cause interference at
the POTW or violate requirements of this chapter, it shall be the
responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the
Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department of the incident. The notification shall
include name of caller, location and time of discharge, type of wastewater,
concentration, volume, and corrective action taken.
   (C)   Written report. Within five days following such an accidental or
deliberate discharge the industrial user shall submit to the Superintendent a
detailed written report on forms to be provided by the Lockport Sanitary Sewer
Department, describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken
by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Follow up reports may be
required by Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department as needed. Such report, or
reports, shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage or
other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage or other liability
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any
other damage to person or property; nor shall such report relieve the user of
any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by the
ordinance or otherwise. Failure to report accidental or deliberate discharges
may, in addition to any other remedies available to the Lockport Sanitary Sewer
Department; result in the revocation of the discharges wastewater discharge
permit.
   (D)   Production control. The industrial user shall control production or
all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with all
applicable regulations upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment
facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment
is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other
things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost
or fails.
   (E)   Notice to employees. A notice in English and the language of common
use shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge of a prohibitive material. Employers shall ensure that all employees
who are in a position to cause, discover, or observe such an accidental
discharge is advised of the emergency notification procedure.
   (F)   Additional remedies. In addition to remedies available to the city set
forth elsewhere in this chapter, if the city is fined by the IEPA or USEPA for
violation of the city's NPDES permit or violation of water quality standards as
the result of an industrial spill or intentional slug discharge of a compatible
or incompatible pollutant, then the fine, including all city legal, sampling,
analytical testing, and any other related costs shall be charged to the
responsible industry. Such charge shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of,
any other remedies the city may have under this chapter, statutes, regulations,
at law or in equity.
   (G)   Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two
years, the Superintendent shall evaluate whether each significant industrial
user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The Superintendent may
require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan.
Alternatively, the Superintendent may develop such a plan for every user. An
accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Superintendent of any
accidental or slug discharge, as required by division (B) of this section and §
55.046(E); and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.

permit modification does not stay any wastewater discharge permit condition.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.042 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT TRANSFER.
   Wastewater discharge permits may be reassigned or transferred to a new owner
and/or operator only if the permittee gives at least 30 days advance notice to
the Superintendent and the Superintendent approves the wastewater discharge
permit transfer. The notice to the Superintendent must include a written
certification by the new owner and/or operator which:
   (A)   States that the new owner and/or operator have no immediate intent to
change the facility's operations and processes.
   (B)   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur.
   (C)   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
wastewater discharge permit. Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer
renders the wastewater discharge permit voidable on the date of facility
transfer.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.043 CHANGE IN CONDITIONS.
   In the event the type, quality or volume of wastewater from the property for
which a discharge permit was previously granted is expected to materially and
substantially change as reasonably determined by the permittee or the LSSD, the
permittee shall give a 30 day notice in writing to the LSSD and shall make a
new application to the LSSD prior to said change, in the same manner and form
as originally made, provided that information previously submitted and
unchanged need not be resubmitted by permittee. No permittee shall materially
and substantially change the type, quality or volume of its wastewater beyond
that allowed by its permit without prior approval of the Lockport Sanitary
Sewer Department.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.044 PERMITS DURATION.
   Permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five
years. The user shall apply for permit to be reissued a minimum of 180 days
prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit. Within 90 days of
notification, the user shall apply, on a form provided by the city, for the
permit to be reissued. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to
modification by the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department during the term of the
permit as limitations or requirements identified in §§
55.010 through
55.020 are modified or as other just causes exist. The user shall be informed
of any proposed changes in his permit at least 30 days prior to the effective
date of change.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.045 PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   Detailed plans and specifications prepared by an Illinois registered
professional engineer, of the pretreatment facilities proposed to be
constructed shall be submitted to the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department for
review and must be acceptable to the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department before
construction of the facility is commenced. The review of such plans shall in no
way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying its facility as
necessary to comply with this chapter. Within a reasonable time after the
completion of the wastewater treatment facility, the user shall furnish its
operations and maintenance procedures for the Lockport Sanitary Sewer
Department to review.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.046 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITTEE.
   (A)   Baseline monitoring reports.
      (1)   Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category
determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
significant industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment
standards, and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW,
shall submit to the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department a report which contains
the information listed in division (B), below. At least 90 days prior to
commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become
industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical
standard, shall submit to the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department a report which
contains the information listed in division (A)(2), below. A new source shall
also report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
pretreatment standards. A new source shall also give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants discharged.
      (2)   The industrial user shall submit the information required by this
section including:
         (a)   Identifying information. The name and address of the facility
including the name of the operator and owners.
         (b)   Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control
permits held by or for the facility.
         (c)   Description of operations. A brief description of the nature,
average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the
operation(s) carried out by such industrial user. This description should
include a schematic process diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the
POTW from the regulated processes.
         (d)   Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily
and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process
streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
         (e)   Measurement of pollutants.
            1.   Identify the categorical pretreatment standards applicable to
each regulated process.
            2.   Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the
nature and concentration and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the
Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department, of regulated pollutants in the discharge
from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum and long term average
concentrations or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be
representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with
procedures set out in §
55.047.
            3.   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
            4.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream
formula of Section 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the
pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been
calculated in accordance with Section 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with
supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority.
            5.   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40
CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the Administrator determines that the Part 136
sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated
analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures,
including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the
Administrator.
            6.   The control authority may allow the submission of a baseline
report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides
information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment
measures.
            7.   Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set
out in §
55.047.
         (f)   Certification. A statement reviewed by the industrial user's
authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating
whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis - and, if
not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
         (g)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest schedule by which
the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule
pursuant to this schedule must meet the requirements set out in division (I) of
this section.
         (h)   All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
55.036.
   (B)   Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, within 45
days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW,
any user subject to pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements shall
submit to the Superintendent, on forms provided by the Lockport Sanitary Sewer
Department, a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants
in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment
standards and requirements. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established by the city in accordance with the procedures
in §
55.013, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term
production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include
the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. This
statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user, and
certified to by a qualified professional as defined in General Pretreatment
Regulations. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance
with §
55.036.
   (C)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance
date of such applicable pretreatment standards, or, in the case of a new
source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW shall submit to the
Superintendent during the months of July and January, unless required more
frequently in the categorical pretreatment standard a report indicating and
concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such
applicable pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a
record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the
reporting period in cases where the pretreatment standards requires compliance
with a Best Management Practice (or pollution prevention alternative), the user
shall submit documentation required by the LSSD necessary to determine the
compliance status of the user. At the discretion of the Superintendent and in
consideration of such factors as local high and low flow rates, holidays,
budget cycles, etc., the Superintendent may agree to alter the months during
which the above reports are to be submitted.
         (a)   Exceptions. Exception to this reporting requirement would be for
any significant user, who does not perform self-monitoring on their discharge.
Instead the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department performs the service of
monitoring their discharge at least twice a year. A compliance report is only
required if the significant user is regulated by mass based limitations.
      (2)   The Superintendent may impose mass limitations on users which are
using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or pretreatment
requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate. In such cases, the report required by division (C)(1) of this
section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment
standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results
of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature
and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the
Superintendent, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the
applicable categorical pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring
shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standards. All analyses
shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the
Administrator pursuant to Section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR,
Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by
the Superintendent. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques approved by the Superintendent. Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not
include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the EPA publication "Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of
Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977," analytical
procedures approved by the Superintendent.
   (D)   Late filing charge. Any user subject to the reporting requirements set
forth in the General Pretreatment Regulations 40 CFR 403 or their industrial
wastewater discharge permit as issued in accordance with § 55.032, must file
their report within 30 days after receipt of the proper reporting form and
sampling data from the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department. Extensions of this
time period may be granted by the Superintendent upon written request by the
user. Failure to comply with this provision will result in a fine of $100.
Additional fines will be issued at 30 day intervals until the report is
properly filed or a time extension is granted by the Superintendent. Repeated
or continued failure to comply with this provision is grounds for enforcement.
   (E)   Report of potential problems.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problems
for the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in §
55.010), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately
telephone and notify the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department of the incident.
This notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the
industrial user. The following procedures shall be followed:
         (a)   Accidental discharges that contain pollutants that exceed the
permitted limit by ten times shall be reported.
         (b)   Accidental discharges that may cause permanent damage to the
collection or treatment system shall be reported immediately. These discharges
include, but are not limited to, pollutants that may cause a fire or explosion
hazard in the collection system, pH of 2 or less or 12.5 or greater for longer
than ten minutes, any pollutant that will increase the concentration in the
influent to the POTW enough to have a decrease in treatment efficiency.
         (c)   During normal business hours, (7:00 a.m. - 3:30 p.m.) the
permittee shall notify the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department by telephone. At
all other times, the LSSD should be notified by leaving a message with the
LSSD's 24 hour dispatch after 3:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, or weekends and
holidays. The notification shall include the name of the person making the
call, the telephone number where said person can be reached, location of
discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, including concentration, and
volume and corrective action taken.
         (d)   The party making the call shall be available by phone for a
minimum of 15 minutes after the notification is made. This is so that a member
of the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department may contact the industry
representative for more information, if necessary.
      (2)   Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user
shall, unless waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural
resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed by this chapter.
      (3)   Failure to notify the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department of
potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this
chapter. A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (E)(1), above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur, are advised of
the emergency notification procedure.
   (F)   Reports from nonsignificant industrial users. All industrial users not
subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Lockport
Sanitary Sewer Department as the Superintendent may require.
   (G)   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by an industrial user facility indicates a violation, the industrial
user facility must notify the control authority within 24 hours of becoming
aware of the violation. The industrial user facility shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the
Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department within 30 days after becoming aware of the
violation. The industrial user facility is not required to resample if the
Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department performs monitoring at the industrial user's
facility at least once a month, or if the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department
performs sampling between the industrial user's facility initial sampling and
when the industrial user facility receives the results of this sampling.
   (H)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
      (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the city, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and estimation of the mass
of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the
following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this division need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications
of changed conditions must be submitted under §
55.043. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of divisions (A), (B) and (C)
of this section.
      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (H)(1),
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of the RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and
the state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within
90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      (5)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
   (I)   Compliance schedule progress report. The following conditions shall
apply to the schedule required by division (A)(2)(g) of this section. The
schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the
commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and
operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events including but not limited to
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, beginning and
conducting routine operation). No increment referred to herein shall exceed
nine months. The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the
Superintendent no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and if the
appropriate steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the
established schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between
such progress reports to the Superintendent.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.047 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question or where EPA determines that 40 CFR Part 136 sampling and
analyses are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses
must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
   (A)   Sample collection and frequency.
      (1)   Composite method.  
         (a)   It is recommended that influent and effluent operational data be
obtained through 24-hour flow proportional composite samples. Sampling may be
done manually or automatically, and discretely or continuously. If discrete
sampling is employed, at least 12 aliquots should be composited. Discrete
sampling may be flow proportioned either by varying the time interval between
each aliquot or the volume of each aliquot. All composites should be flow
proportional to either the stream flow at the time of collection of the
influent aliquot or to the total influent flow since the previous influent
aliquot. Volatile pollutant aliquots must be combined in the laboratory
immediately before analysis.
         (b)   Effluent sample collection need not be delayed to compensate for
hydraulic detention unless the Superintendent elects to include detention time
compensation or unless the approval authority requires detention time
compensation. The approval authority may require that each effluent sample is
taken approximately one detention time later than the corresponding influent
sample when failure to do so would result in an unrepresentative portrayal of
actual POTW operation. The detention period should be based on a 24-hour
average daily flow value. The average daily flow should in turn be based on the
average of the daily flows during the same month of the previous year.
      (2)   Grab method.
         (a)   If composite sampling is not an appropriate technique, grab
samples should be taken to obtain influent and effluent operational data. A
grab sample is an individual sample collected over a period of time not
exceeding 15 minutes. The collection of influent grab samples should precede
the collection of effluent samples by approximately one detention period except
that where the detention period is greater than 24 hours such staggering of the
sample collection may not be necessary or appropriate. The detention period
should be based on a 24-hour average daily flow value. The average daily flow
should in turn be based upon the average of the daily flows during the same
month of the previous year. Grab sampling should be employed where the
pollutants being evaluated are those, such as cyanide and phenol, which may not
be held for an extended period because of biological, chemical or physical
interaction which take place after sample collection and affect the results.
         (b)   If an industrial user monitors any regulated pollutant at the
appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the control
authority, they shall follow the procedures prescribed in this section, and the
results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (B)   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
   (C)   Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements
and documentation associated with Best Management Practices. Records shall
include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of
the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of
at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the
duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city or where the user
has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by Superintendent.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.048 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   Provision and location. The Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department shall
utilize and access monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. These
facilities shall be provided at the industrial user's expense. Where required
by the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department, additional control manholes or
sampling chambers shall be provided at the end of each industrial process
within an industrial user's facility suitable for the determination of
compliance with pretreatment standards. The monitoring facility should normally
be situated on the user's premises, but the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department
may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the
user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping, parked
vehicles, or other activities of the user.
   (B)   Sampling chamber.
      (1)   Whenever required by the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department, the
owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying non-residential
wastewater shall install a large manhole or sampling chamber for each separate
discharge in the building sewer in accordance with plans and specifications
approved by the Superintendent, installed and maintained at all times at user's
expense, which shall have ample room in each sampling chamber to permit the
Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department to take accurate composite samples for
analysis. The chamber shall be safely, easily and independently accessible to
authorized representatives of the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department.
      (2)   Each sampling chamber shall contain a flow measuring device which
is approved by the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department with a recording and
totalizing register for measurement of the liquid quantity; or at the
discretion of the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department the metered water supply
to the industrial plant may be used as the liquid quantity where it is
substantiated to the Superintendent that the metered water supply and waste
quantities are approximately the same, or where a measurable adjustment agreed
to by the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department is made in the metered water
supply to determine the liquid waste quantity.
      (3)   When required, samples shall be taken every hour or half hour, as
determined by the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department and properly refrigerated
and preserved in accordance with Standard Methods and shall be composited in
proportion to the flow for a representative 24 hour sample. Such sampling shall
be done as prescribed by the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department.
      (4)   The frequency for sampling, sampling chamber, metering device,
sampling methods and analyses of samples shall be subject, at any time, to
inspection and verification by the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department.
   (C)   Monitoring facilities. Each industrial user whose wastewater discharge
(s) has by sampling of wastewater or other means of inspection been found to
contain or have the potential to contain incompatible priority pollutants in
amounts or concentration which may cause interference with the wastewater
utility system process or operation, shall provide and maintain at all times a
monitoring facility at each applicable building sewer discharge which will
allow for inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the discharge to the
POTW sewer line. Such monitoring facility shall be provided and maintained by
the user on each building sewer discharge, which contains or has the potential
to contain incompatible priority pollutants.
      (1)   The monitoring facilities shall be located on the industrial user's
premises, provided that if such location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship to the industrial user, the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department may
allow the facility to be constructed in a public street or sidewalk area. Said
facility shall be located so that samples may be taken safely and easily and
shall not be obstructed by landscaping, parked vehicles or other activity of
the industrial user.
      (2)   Monitoring facilities located in public streets or sidewalks shall
not obstruct the flow of traffic. All monitoring facilities must meet all local
and Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department construction codes and must be approved
by the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department prior to construction.
      (3)   There shall be ample room in and near such monitoring facilities to
allow accurate sampling and monitoring equipment to be installed and to prepare
samples for analysis. Such facilities shall be accessible to authorized
representatives of the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department at all times upon
presentation of suitable identification provided that authorized
representatives of the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department personnel shall under
exceptional circumstances have access upon presentation of suitable
identification at any time discharges are occurring.
      (4)   The entrance or manhole to such monitoring facilities shall be
secured by a breakaway key type locking device installed by the Lockport
Sanitary Sewer Department. The Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department shall have
the only key to said locking device and have complete control of access to the
monitoring facility. When required during the weekday hours of 7:00 a.m. to 3:
30 p.m. by an industrial user, LSSD personnel shall be available to open the
monitoring facilities on 90 minute notice upon good cause shown. Alternative
means of adequately securing such monitoring facilities may be approved by the
Superintendent. This determination shall be made when requested by the
industrial user.
      (5)   The monitoring facilities shall contain the following equipment
installed in a permanently fixed position by the industrial user:
         (a)   A flow measuring device incorporated into the invert with
approval by the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department.
         (b)   A source of electrical power to the monitoring facilities of
sufficient voltage and amperage to operate all equipment in the sampling
chamber. An appropriate device shall be installed by user to indicate a power
failure and length of time of such failure. Such device shall be specified by
the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department and furnished by user.
      (6)   Automatic composite sampling devices provided by the Lockport
Sanitary Sewer Department shall be installed and operated in the monitoring
facility on a 24 hour basis seven days per week. Samples will be collected by
Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department personnel five days per week and analyzed on
a routine basis. The Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department will provide a split of
each sample taken from said monitoring facility upon written request of the
industrial user.
   (D)   Inspection and sampling.  
      (1)   The Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department may inspect the facilities
of any user to ascertain compliance with this chapter. Persons or occupants of
premises where a discharge source or treatment system is located or in which
records are kept shall allow the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department or its
representative ready access upon presentation of credentials at all reasonable
times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and photocopying of records required to be kept by this chapter or
in the performance of any of their duties.
      (2)   The LSSD, IEPA, USEPA shall have the right to set up on the user's
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security
measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance
before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements
with his security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department, IEPA, USEPA, will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities. Such arrangements shall be made by users with their
security guards within 30 days of the passage of this chapter.
      (3)   While performing the necessary work on private properties referred
to in this chapter, the duly authorized Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department
employees personnel shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises
established by the company, and the company shall be held harmless for injury
or death to the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department and the Lockport Sanitary
Sewer Department indemnify the user against loss or damage to its property by
Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department employees and against liability claims and
demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the company and
growing out of the gauging and sampling operation, except as such may be caused
by negligence or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions. The
Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department and industrial users shall maintain records
of all information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this
chapter and shall include:
         (a)   The date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the names
of the person or persons taking the samples;
         (b)   The dates analyses were performed;
         (c)   Who performed the analyses;
         (d)   The analytical techniques/methods used and;
         (e)   The results of such analyses.
      (4)   The Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department and industrial users shall
maintain such records for a minimum of three years. This period of retention
shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the
discharge of pollutants by the industrial user or operation of the Lockport
Sanitary Sewer Department pretreatment program or when requested by the
Regional Administrator of the Director of IEPA.
   (E)   Right of entry: inspection and sampling. The Superintendent shall have
the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is
complying with all requirements of this chapter and any wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Superintendent ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
      (1)   Where the user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Superintendent will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
      (2)   The Superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
      (3)   The Superintendent may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the Superintendent and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Superintendent access to the
user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   (F)   Search warrants. If the Superintendent has been refused access to a
building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Superintendent may
seek issuance of a search warrant from the Lockport Will County Court.
   (G)   Pretreatment.  
      (1)   Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to
comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable
pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by regulations,
statutes, and ordinances whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required
to pre-treat wastewater to a level acceptable to the Lockport Sanitary Sewer
Department shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department for review, and
shall be acceptable to the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department and IEPA before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures
shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the
facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the Lockport
Sanitary Sewer Department under the provisions of this chapter. The user shall
obtain all necessary construction and operating permits from IEPA. Such
pretreatment facilities shall be under the control and direction of an IEPA
certified industrial wastewater treatment plan operator. Within a reasonable
time after the completion of the pretreatment facility, the user shall furnish
its operations and maintenance procedures to the Lockport Sanitary Sewer
Department for review. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or
method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the Lockport
Sanitary Sewer Department prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
      (2)   All records relating to compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards shall be made available to the approval authority upon request.
   (H)   Confidential information.
      (1)   Information and data relating to an industrial user obtained from
reports, surveys, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring
programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other
governmental agencies without restriction unless the user specifically requests
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user under applicable
state law. Copies of information from Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department files
shall be provided to persons so requesting upon payment of a copy fee
established by the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department.
      (2)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, and until such
time as the information is determined not to be confidential by agreement
between the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department and the user, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, and the
pretreatment programs, provided, however, that such portions of a report shall
be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Information
and data provided to the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department which is effluent
data shall be available to the public without restriction. Wastewater
constituents and other effluent data, as defined in 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be
recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public
restriction.
      (3)   Information accepted by the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department as
confidential, shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency by the
Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department until and unless a 30-day notification is
given to the user.
      (4)   The Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department shall implement measures to
prevent the negligent release of confidential information; however, neither the
Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department nor its employees shall be held legally
responsible for release of information if they have acted in good faith.
   (I)   Publication of users in significant noncompliance. The Superintendent
shall publish annually, in the newspaper of general circulation that provides
meaningful public notice within jurisdictions served by the POTW published in
the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during
the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance
shall mean:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six month
period exceed by any magnitude a numeric pretreatment standard including
instantaneous limits for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
      (2)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant
parameter during a six month period equals or exceeds the product of the
numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as
defined by §§
55.010 through
55.013 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
      (3)   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard requirement that the
Superintendent believes has caused, along or in combination with other
discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of
POTW personnel or the general public;
      (4)   Any discharge of pollutants that have caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Superintendent's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (5)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final
compliance;
      (6)   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports,
and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
      (7)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
      (8)   Any other violation(s) which may include a violation of Best
Management Practices which the Superintendent determines will adversely affect
the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
   (J)   Sludge generated. Sludge, floats, skimmings, etc., generated by an
industrial or commercial pretreatment system shall not be placed into the POTW.
Such sludge shall be contained, transported, and disposed of by haulers in
accordance with all federal, state, and local regulations.

ENFORCEMENT
§ 55.050 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within
30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a
plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.051 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS.
   Whenever the Superintendent determines that wastewater is being or has been
discharged into the POTW, and when, in the opinion of the Superintendent, such
discharge violates this chapter, the Superintendent shall by conference,
conciliation or persuasion, make a reasonable effort to eliminate or remedy
such violation. If these efforts have been unsuccessful, the Superintendent
shall use an administrative enforcement remedy.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.052 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The Superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such document shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections of this chapter and
shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.053 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   (A)   Notice of hearing. The Superintendent may request a show cause
hearing. The city may order the hearing or may designate any of its members or
officers or employees of the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department to order the
hearing. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of
a hearing to be held by the city or its designated person regarding the
violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement
action, and directing the user to show cause before the city or its designated
person why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of
hearing shall be served personally or be mailed by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. The notice of
the hearing may be served on any agent or officer of a corporation. A show
cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
   (B)   Hearing officials. The city shall designate a hearing officer to
conduct the hearing and take the evidence to:
      (1)   Issue in the name of the city notices of hearings requested the
attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant
to any matter involved in such hearings;
      (2)   Take the evidence;
      (3)   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the City
Council for action thereon.
   (C)   Transcripts. At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter testimony
taken must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so
recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any party to
the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof.
   (D)   Issuance of orders. After the city or its designated person has
reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing either: a) that the discharge permit be revoked and the
service be disconnected or b) that following a specified time the permit shall
be revoked and sewer service discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances have been installed and operated
properly to comply with the discharge permit or c) direct the user to cease the
unauthorized discharge effective after a specified period of time or d) that
such other relief as deemed necessary by the city to abate the discharge be
granted. Further orders and directives as are necessary may be issued.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.054 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may
be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including self-
monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.055 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice
and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of
the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment.
   (A)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Superintendent
may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent may allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed,
unless the termination proceedings in §
55.058 are initiated against the user.
   (B)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under §§
55.053(D) or
55.058.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.056 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard requirement, or that
the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.057 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000 a day. Such
fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed
for each day during the period of violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance and interest shall
accrue thereafter at a rate of 10% per month. A lien against the user's
property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount with ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit,
the Superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's
appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto,
shall be returned to the user. The Superintendent may add the costs of
preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to
the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.058 REVOCATION OF WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT.

§ 55.059 HARMFUL CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, the Lockport
Sanitary Sewer Department may immediately suspend the wastewater treatment
service and/or a wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is necessary,
in the opinion of the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department, it order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present an imminent
or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, or which
presents or may present an endangerment to the environment or which threatens
to interfere with the operation of the POTW or causes the city to violate any
condition of its NPDES permit.
   (B)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service
and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event of a failure of the user to comply voluntarily with
the suspension order, the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department shall take such
steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to
any individuals. The Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department shall reinstate the
wastewater discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof
of the elimination of the non-complying discharge. A detailed written statement
submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the
Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department within 15 days of the date of occurrence.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.060 LEGAL ACTION.
   Notwithstanding any other sections of this chapter, if any user discharges
sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the sanitary sewers contrary to
the provisions of this chapter, federal or state pretreatment requirements, or
any order of the Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department, the City Attorney may
commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the Circuit
Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.061 APPEAL PROCEDURES.
   In the event a user is dissatisfied with permit conditions, enforcement
procedures, or sampling procedures established or used by the Lockport Sanitary
Sewer Department as it applies to his discharge to the sanitary sewer, except
as such dissatisfaction relates to proceeding under §§
55.050 through
55.059, that user shall seek relief through the use of the following
administrative procedures. The procedure outlined herein is voluntary, and
shall not act as a bar or condition precedent to the use of the Lockport
Sanitary Sewer Department of any remedies provided herein. In order that
problems or disputes may be resolved on the lowest practicable level; the
procedures outlined below shall be followed in order.
   (A)   Initial review of complaint. User shall contact the Lockport Sanitary
Sewer Department with his complaint or questions, and shall be referred to the
appropriate department for initial screening, where the problem is routine in
nature or requires only explanation, no further action will be taken.
   (B)   Manager's review. Where a user is not satisfied with the response
given by the appropriate department, the complaint or question shall be reduced
to writing and referred to management personnel, to be assigned by the
Superintendent for review. The management personnel so designated shall review
the file and consult with the user in an effort to resolve the problem. If the
matter can be resolved to the user's satisfaction at this level, no further
action will be required.
   (C)   Superintendent's review.  
      (1)   If the review and discussion between the management personnel and
the user do not resolve the matter, a report on the complaint, together with
the manager's recommendations, will be forwarded to the Superintendent for his
consideration and decision. If the decision of the Superintendent resolves the
matter, no further action will be required.
      (2)   In the case of a user protesting a permit condition(s), the user,
must file a petition for an appeal no later than ten days after the date of
issuance of the permit. If the appeal is timely, an informal hearing with the
Superintendent shall be scheduled. The user shall be given an opportunity to
present his case with evidence and/or expert opinion as to why the conditions
of his permit should be changed. The Superintendent shall issue a written
decision on the appeal. If the Superintendent's decision resolves the matter,
no further action will be required.
   (D)   City's review. If the findings and actions by the Superintendent do
not satisfy the user, the entire file, together with recommendations from the
Superintendent, shall be given to the City Council or its designated committee,
which, after review of the file and recommendations of the Superintendent,
shall meet with the user and review the complaint. Following the review of the
file and discussion with the user, the city will make a final decision on the
matter. In the case of a user protesting the Superintendent's decision of an
appeal of a permit condition(s), the user must file a second petition for
appeal no later than ten days after the date of receipt of the Superintendent's
written decision. The city will schedule a formal hearing after reviewing the
file and recommendations of the Superintendent. The user shall be given an
opportunity to present his case with evidence and/or expert opinion as to why
the conditions of his permit should be changed. The city shall issue a formal
decision which shall be published in the official minutes of the hearing.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.062 UPSETS.
   (A)   As a defense for noncompliance. An upset shall constitute an
affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards if the industrial user who wishes to establish the
affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the specific
cause(s) of the upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
      (3)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to the
Lockport Sanitary Sewer Department within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance.
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue.
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (B)   Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user
seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (C)   User responsibility in case of upset. The industrial user shall
control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain
compliance with all applicable regulations upon reduction, loss, or failure of
its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method
of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where,
among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is
reduced, lost or fails.
(Ord. 16-005, passed 5-18-16)
§ 55.063 BYPASS.
   Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage
to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (A)   Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provision of divisions (B) and (C) of this section.
   (B)   Notice. If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control authority, if possible at
least ten days before the date of the bypass.
      (1)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the control authority
within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass.
A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the
industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The control
authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24 hours.
   (C)   Prohibition of bypass. Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority
may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless;
      (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage;
      (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
      (3)   The industrial user submitted notices as required under division
(B) of this section.
   (D)   The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in division (C) of this section.

to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the
collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each
involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and
substantially the same type of structure.
      (2)   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the
city may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and
treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The city may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
   (F)   Duration of permits. 
      (1)   The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than
five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the
city makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified

§ 56.05 COLLOCATION REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Public safety space reservation. The city may reserve space on
municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the city's electric
utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the city reasonably determines
that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
   (B)   Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
   (C)   No interference with public safety communication frequencies. The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
      (1)   A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the
type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public
safety agency's communications equipment.
      (2)   Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency.
      (3)   If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the
wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
      (4)   The city may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based
on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the
Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy
the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
   (D)   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on
city utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission
system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric
supply zone of the pole.
      (1)   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the city utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
      (2)   For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms “communications
space,” “communication worker safety zone,” and “electric supply zone” have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
         (a)   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and
local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
         (b)   Alternate placements. 
            1.   Except as provided in this collocation requirements and
conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocate
small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility
poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility
pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small
wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the city may propose that
the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or
existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the
alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
            2.   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the city,
the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does
not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
         (c)   Height limitations. 
            1.   The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no
more than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on
which the small wireless facility is collocated.
            2.   New or replacement utility poles or wireless support
structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the
higher of:
               A.   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the city, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
city, provided the city may designate which intersecting right-of-way within
300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall
control the height limitation for such facility; or
               B.    Forty-five feet above ground level.
         (d)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a
height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations
on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a special use permit in conformance with procedures, terms and
conditions set forth in
Ch. 156 of the City's Code of Ordinances.
         (e)   Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall
comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the city and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
         (f)   Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and chapters
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
         (g)   Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply
with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding
requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of
existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the
requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests
to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do
not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.
         (h)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit
is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit,
unless the city and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a
delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack
of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the city grants an extension in

standards:
   (A)   General stealth, concealment, design and aesthetic standards.
Installations shall comply with any stealth, concealment, design and aesthetic
standards applicable to utility installations in the public right-of-way, as
set forth in
Ch. 53 (Construction of Utility Facilities in the Rights of Way) of this Code,
as well as any written design standards that are generally applicable for
decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment, design and
aesthetic requirements that are otherwise identified by the city in an
ordinance, written policy adopted by the city, in the city's comprehensive
plan, or in a written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the
rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
   (B)   Historic districts and landmarks. For areas designated as historic
districts, or on buildings or structures designated as national historic

stealth, concealment, design and aesthetic requirements referenced above, the
following additional restrictions/conditions apply to the installation of small
wireless facilities:
      (1)   Small wireless facilities shall not be mounted upon any portion of
the historic-style decorative street lighting system within the city's Historic
Preservation District;
      (2)   Small wireless facilities shall be comprised of materials that are
consistent with the surrounding elements so as to be concealed or to blend

surrounding historical landmarks and/or district in design and color.
      (3)   Small wireless facilities, to the extent allowed within the
Historic Preservation District, must be reviewed and approved for
appropriateness by the city's Heritage and Architecture Commission prior to

   (C)   Historic district or landmark limitations:
      (1)   Any stealth, concealment and design standards in a historic
district or on a historic landmark, including restrictions on a specific
category of utility poles, may not have the effect of prohibiting any
provider's technology. Such stealth, concealment and design measures shall not
be considered a part of the small wireless facility for purposes of the size
restrictions of a small wireless facility.
      (2)   This section shall not be construed to limit the city's enforcement
of historic preservation in conformance with the requirements adopted pursuant
to the Illinois State Agency Historic Resources Preservation Act or the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 54 U.S.C. Section 300101 et seq.,

from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the city
improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the wireless

privileges granted under this chapter and the act. A wireless provider has no
obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as
may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the city or its employees or
agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have
against the city with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages,
however caused, based on the theory of liability.
(Ord. 18-035, passed 7-18-18)
§ 56.14 INSURANCE.
   (A)   At all times during the period in which a wireless provider's
facilities are located in the city's infrastructure, improvements or in the
right-of-way, the wireless provider shall secure and maintain the following
liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming
the city, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and
employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in divisions (A)(1) and
(2) below:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as “X,” “C,” and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         (a)   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each person;
         (b)   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any one
accident; and
         (c)   Five million dollars for all other types of liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property damage for
each accident;
      (3)   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident. If the wireless provider is not
providing such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors
performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with
this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The wireless provider shall provide copies of any of
the policies required by this section to the city within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the city.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. 
      (1)   The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the
following endorsement:
      “It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled
nor the intention not to renew be stated until 30 days after receipt by the
city, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice addressed to the City Administrator of such intent to cancel or
not to renew.”
      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no
event, later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. The wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion
of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of
this section. The wireless provider that self-insures is not required, to the
extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of
additional insureds under division (A), or the requirements of divisions (B),
(C), and (D) of this section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure
shall provide to the city evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial
ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required
under division (A) of this section, such as evidence that the wireless provider
is a “private self-insurer” under the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on wireless provider's
liability. The legal liability of the wireless provider to the city and any
person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or
self-insurance required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance
policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.

including revocation of the permit. Maintenance and replacement of small
wireless facilities shall be performed by the wireless provider at the wireless
provider's sole cost and expense.
   (B)   In the event of an emergency involving an imminent threat to life or
property, the city may take corrective action to eliminate such emergency at
the wireless provider's expense.
(Ord. 18-035, passed 7-18-18)
§ 56.16 REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   A permit to collocate a wireless facility may be revoked for one or

restoration of the right-of-way or the property upon which the small wireless
facility is located.
      (9)   The wireless provider has failed to properly maintain the wireless
facility as required by this chapter.
      (10)   The wireless provider has failed to abate interference with public
safety communications in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC

90.675.
      (11)   The small wireless facility has been abandoned and the wireless
provider has failed to remove the wireless facilities as provided in this
chapter.
   (B)   Written notification of the permit revocation shall be sent by
certified mail or shall be personally delivered to the wireless provider
setting forth the basis for the revocation. The wireless provider shall, within
fourteen days of the notice of revocation, file a written response with the
City Administrator letting forth the reasons why the permit should not be
revoked along with such evidence in opposition to the revocation as the
wireless provider determines necessary. Failure to file a response with the
City Administrator shall be deemed an admission of the facts set forth in the
notification of written notification and shall result in automatic revocation
of the permit. The City Administrator shall render findings and a decision
within twenty-one days of the date of receipt of the wireless provider's
response, if any.
   (C)   If the City Administrator revokes the permit, the wireless provider
may file a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 21 days of the
notification of the permit revocation. Such notice shall contain a response to
the decision of the City Administrator. The City Council or a designated
hearing officer shall hear the revocation appeal and render a decision on such

as indicated in the most current registration list of the Secretary of State.
The notice shall be in the form provided in §
71.08. In the event that an out-of-state vehicle is proposed to be towed,
inquiry by computer, telephone, or letter shall be made of the Secretary of
State of the particular jurisdiction for the furnishing of the most current
registered name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and notice shall be
mailed as provided herein to the address furnished, though in no case will the
city be required to delay towing more than seven days after the date of the
mailing or personal delivery of the notice if no request for a hearing has been
received within that seven-day period.
   (B)   A notice of intent to tow sticker with the earliest date upon which
the tow may take place and the address and phone number of the city Police
Department shall be placed on the vehicle.
(`79 Code, § 71.03) (Ord. 1100, passed 1-18-88)
§ 71.04 PRE-TOW HEARING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Opportunity for hearing. The owner or person entitled to possession of
a vehicle to be towed as an inoperable vehicle shall have seven days after the
date of mailing or personal delivery of the notice to request, in writing, a
pre-tow hearing. Subsequent to this seven-day period, the vehicle may be towed,
if the owner has not filed a written hearing request within the seven-day
period, and any hearing rights under the provisions of this chapter will be
deemed waived.
   (B)   Scheduling of pre-tow hearings. The pre-tow hearing shall be scheduled
for a date within 14 days of the mailing or personal delivery of the pre-tow
notice. The city shall not be required to delay towing longer than such a 14-
day period.
   (C)   Request for pre-tow hearings. Requests for a pre-tow hearing are to be
made in person to the office indicated on the notice. Requests for hearings by
persons who reside more than 50 miles from the city may be made by mail. Forms
for such request shall be made available at the city Police Department. At the
time of making the request, the owner will be provided a hearing date and time
by mail or in person, as the circumstances require.
   (D)   Appointment of hearing officer. The city shall choose an officer or
employee of the city to serve as Hearing Officer. In no case shall that Hearing
Officer be an individual who was involved in the initial decision to tow the
vehicle. The Hearing Officer shall have the authority to require the presence
of the enforcement officer who initiated the proposed tow or any other city
personnel.
   (E)   Nature of hearing. The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the
rules of evidence shall not apply. The hearing will not be determinative of, or
adjudicate, any citation relative to any vehicle. After receiving all relevant
evidence, the Hearing Officer shall make a written decision based upon a
prepon-derance of the evidence as to whether towing of the vehicle is
authorized by the laws of the state or the ordinances of the city, with a
specific statutory or ordinance section cited in the decision. The owner shall
be provided a copy of such pre-tow hearing decision.
   (F)   Decision to tow and rates to be charged. If the preponderance of the
evidence supports towing and compliance with the provisions of this chapter,
the Hearing Officer shall direct that the vehicle be towed, with any towing and
storage costs to then be imposed upon the owner thereof. The fees to be charged
for towing and storage services shall be no more than the maximum rates set by
the Chief of Police pursuant to the provisions of §
71.05. The owner of the vehicle having had such a hearing may avoid the towing
by immediately removing the vehicle from the improper location to a proper,
lawful location and correcting any unlawful condition of the vehicle.
   (G)   Decision not to tow. If the preponderance of the evidence fails to
support towing of the vehicle, the Hearing Officer shall direct that the
vehicle shall not be towed. The city shall furnish a copy of such decision to
the owner, who may place it inside the vehicle in a location plainly visible
from the outside, such as the dashboard or rear window. No vehicle about which
such a decision has been rendered shall be towed by the city unless the
circumstances under which the decision was rendered have changed. If at some
subsequent time the village should wish to tow the vehicle from the same
location, it shall follow the same procedures required for the towing of any
other similarly-situated vehicle.
   (H)   Reports and documents to be retained; contesting decisions. Originals
or copies of all notices, pre-tow hearing decisions, towing reports, and any
associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the city Police
Department for a period of at least three years after each hearing, or after
each tow if no hearing was requested or held. The city or the owner may contest
the decision of the Hearing Officer in any manner provided by law.
(`79 Code, § 71.04) (Ord. 1100, passed 1-18-88)
§ 71.05 POST-TOW NOTICE FOR HAZARDOUS AND UNLAWFUL VEHICLES.
   (A)   Mailing or delivery of notice. Notice pursuant to this section shall
be forwarded by mail, to the address of the owner of the vehicle as indicated
in the most current registration list of the Secretary of State, unless the
notice is personally delivered to the owner, in which case, the date and time
of the delivery and the name of the police officer making the delivery shall be
noted in the city Police Department records or reports. The notice shall be in
the forms provided in §§
71.07(A) and (B) and shall be mailed or delivered within 24 hours of the tow,
as provided in §
71.02(B). In the event that the city has towed an out-of-state hazardous or
unlawful vehicle, inquiry by computer, telephone, or letter shall be made of
the Secretary of State of the particular jurisdiction for the furnishing of the
most current registered name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and
notice shall be mailed as provided herein to the address furnished.
   (B)   Posting of signs showing hearing rights. All approved towing service
operators shall prominently post at least one sign, with dimensions of at least
12 inches by 18 inches, indicating the opportunity and procedures for a hearing
to contest the validity of a towed vehicle. The sign, the form for which is set
out in §
71.07(A), shall be placed in locations readily visible to the public
transacting business at any towing facility. If a towing service operator
performs services for more than one munici-pality, the information for
contacting the various appropriate municipal offices can be listed in one such
sign, the format for which shall be substantially similar to the form set out
in §
71.07(A).
   (C)   Requests for post-tow hearings. Requests for hearings may be made in
person at the office indicated on the notice within 15 days of the mailing or
personal delivery of the notification of tow, or release of the vehicle,
whichever occurs first; otherwise, the right to a hearing shall be deemed
waived. Requests for hearings by persons who reside more than 50 miles from the
city may be made in person or by mail received by the city within the 15-day
period.
   (D)   Release of motor vehicles. Before the owner or person entitled to
possession of any impounded vehicle shall be permitted to remove same, the
owner or other person entitled to possession shall furnish evidence of his
identity, ownership of the vehicle, or his right to possession, sign a receipt
for the vehicle, and pay the amount currently owed for towing and storage fees
to the towing service operator. The Police Chief is author-ized to promulgate
regulations as to the documents or other proof necessary to establish these
facts.
   (E)   Establishment of maximum towing and storage rates.
      (1)   The owner shall pay fees to the towing service operator for towing
and storage on police-ordered tows at rates that do not exceed maximum amounts
to be administratively established by the Chief of Police and which may be
revised from time to time. The basic rates for such fees shall be shown in the
form and sign concerning vehicle release requirements set forth in §
71.07(A). However, nothing in this chapter is intended to prevent a competitive
towing service operator from charging less than the established maximum rates
for police-ordered or any other tows.
      (2)   In arriving at the maximum rates for various services, the Chief of
Police shall consider such matters as the prevalent market rates in the area
for the different types of vehicles, the types of storage and area requirements
for categories such as large trucks and commercial vehicles, relative
difficulties and amount of work required to perform various types of towing
operations.
      (3)   For particularly difficult or unusual towing jobs, such as large or
serious accidents, the Chief of Police is authorized to allow towing operators
to charge rates above those established for normal situations, which special
charges must be based upon the cost of services provided, taking into account
such matters as the man-hours and equipment time required for the job. A towing
service operator must fully itemize in writing the details of such a billing at
special rates for a particularly difficult or unusual tow, and supply a copy of
the itemized bill to the owner and to the city Police Department. Any such
special rates charged must be customary in the towing industry in the area for
the nature and extent of the services provided.
      (4)   Every towing service operator and the city Police Department shall
have available a copy of the complete current rate schedule and any special
rate policy established by the Chief of Police, for vehicle owners to view upon
request.
(`79 Code, § 71.05) (Ord. 1100, passed 1-18-88)
§ 71.06 POST-TOW HEARING PROCEDURES.

tow, by or pursuant to the authority of the city Police Department as set forth
herein, shall be provided the opportunity for a post-tow hearing to determine
the validity of such tow and any towing or storage charges. The hearing will
not be determinative of, or adjudicate, any citation issued relative to any
towed vehicle.
   (B)   Nature of the hearing and Hearing Officer. The nature of the hearing
and the appointment of the Hearing Officer shall be the same as set forth above
in §§
71.04(D) and (E).
   (C)   Scheduling of post-tow hearings. Hearings shall take place as follows:
      (1)   In those instances where the vehicle has been released upon the
deposit of the full payment currently owed for towing and storage charges, and
the owner has properly requested a hearing, the hearing shall take place within
15 days after the release of such vehicle, unless the owner requests a later
date convenient to all parties.
      (2)   In those instances where the vehicle remains impounded, the hearing
shall take place at the option of the owner:
         (a)   On the next day after the owner's demand for such hearing,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays; if such demand is made after 1500
hours (3:00 p.m.), of if the unavailability of a necessary witness or evidence
creates a particular difficulty in conducting the hearing on the next calendar
day, then a hearing shall be held on the second day following the request,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays; or
         (b)   If acceptable to the owner, within 15 days of the request on a
date convenient to all parties.
   (D)   Conduct of post-tow hearing. The Hearing Officer shall review all
evidence presented by the vehicle owner and the city Police Department or other
city employees, and shall make a finding based upon the preponderance of the
evidence presented, as to the lawful authority for the towing and storage of
the vehicle. The city must establish such authority by a preponderance of the
evidence.
   (E)   Post-tow hearing decision. For each hearing, the Hearing Officer shall
complete a post-tow hearing decision and attach such decision to the city
Police Department's original vehicle towing report, and supply a copy of the
decision to the owner by personal delivery if the owner is present, otherwise
by mail. The decision and findings shall be substantially as stated in the form
for the post-tow hearing decision, set forth in §
71.09.
   (F)   Reports and documents to be retained; contesting decisions. All
originals or copies of the notices, post-tow hearing decisions, towing reports,
and any associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the city
Police Department for a period of at least three years after each hearing, or
after each tow if no hearing was requested or held. The city or the owner may
contest the decision of the hearing in any manner provided by law.
   (G)   Towing services subject to ordinance, notwithstanding any other
ordinance or statutory provisions to the contrary, any towing service operator
authorized to perform tows on behalf of the city must perform its services
subject to the provisions of this chapter. However, the towing company shall
have the right to recover the reasonable value of its services for police-
ordered tows, which are not paid by the vehicle owner, from the city. However,
if a tow or the charge for a tow is found by a court to be illegal and the
towing service operator is required to return the charge for the tow to the
owner of the vehicle, the city shall not be liable to reimburse the operator
for the towing charges.

§ 76.04 VEHICLE POSSESSION.
   (A)   Except as provided otherwise in this chapter, a motor vehicle shall
continue to be impounded until (1) the administrative fee, plus any applicable
towing and storage charges, are paid, in which case possession of the motor
vehicles shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the
motor vehicles, or (2) the motor vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to
satisfy a judgment to enforce a lien as provided by law.
   (B)   Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner, lien
holder or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a motor

(Ord. 08-751, passed 1-9-08)
§ 76.05 PRELIMINARY HEARING.
   Whenever the owner of a motor vehicle seized pursuant to this chapter
requests a preliminary hearing, the owner must make a request for said
preliminary hearing within 72 hours of the seizure impoundment. The request
shall be made in person and in writing at the Lockport Police Department,
Monday – Friday, excluding holidays, 8:00 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. using the Tow
Hearing Request Form. If the request for a preliminary hearing is timely filed,
the Chief of Police or his designee shall conduct such preliminary hearing
within 24 hours after the request, or by a date mutually agreeable to the
parties, Monday – Friday, excluding holidays, 8:00 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. All
interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the
preliminary hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply and hearsay
evidence shall be admissible. If, after the preliminary hearing, the Chief of
Police or his designee determines there is probable cause to believe that the
motor vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this chapter,
the Chief of Police or his designee shall order the continued impoundment of
the motor vehicle, as provided in this chapter, unless the owner of the motor
vehicle posts with the village a cash bond in an amount equal to the fees as
set forth in §
76.03. The Chief of Police or his designee will then set the matter for a
hearing as set forth in §
76.07, unless the owner affirmatively waives the right to a hearing. However,
if the Chief of Police or his designee finds that no such violation occurred,
the Chief of Police or his designee shall order the return of the motor vehicle
or cash bond, but the owner shall be responsible for any towing and storage
charges.
(Ord. 08-751, passed 1-9-08)
§ 76.06 NOTICE OF HEARING.
   Unless a preliminary hearing is held pursuant to §
76.05, or the owner affirmatively waives the right to a hearing, within ten
days after a motor vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this chapter or
within ten days after the conclusion of preliminary hearing, the city shall
notify by certified mail, return receipt requested, the owner of record of the
date, time and location of a hearing that will be conducted pursuant to this
chapter. The notice shall state the fees that may be imposed, and that a motor
vehicle not released by cash bond and remaining in the city may be sold or
disposed of by the city in accordance with applicable law.
(Ord. 08-751, passed 1-9-08)
§ 76.07 HEARING.
   The hearing shall be conducted and held, unless affirmatively waived by the
owner, or continued by the owner or by order of the Hearing Officer, no later
than 45 days after the motor vehicle was seized, unless the motor vehicle was
subject to unsuccessful forfeiture proceedings, in which case the hearing shall
be conducted and held, unless affirmatively waived by the owner, or continued
by the owner or by order of the Hearing Officer, no later than 45 days after
the conclusion of the forfeiture proceedings. All interested persons shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. At any time prior to
the hearing date, the Hearing Officer may, at the request of either party,
direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules
of evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be
admissible. If, after the hearing, the Hearing Officer determines by a
preponderance of evidence that the motor vehicle, operated with the permission,
express or implied, of the owner, was used in the commission of any of the
violations set forth in this chapter, and that none of the exceptions applies,
the Hearing Office shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the
motor vehicle civilly liable to the city for an administrative fee in the
amount as set forth in §
76.03 which shall constitute a debt due and owing to the city. If the Owner of
record fails to appear at the hearing, the Hearing Office shall enter a default
order finding the owner of record of the motor vehicle civilly liable to the
city for an administrative fee in the amount as set forth in §
76.03 which shall constitute a debt due and owing to the city, and a copy of
which default order shall be sent to the registered owner via certified mail,
return receipt requested. If a cash bond has been posted the bond shall be
applied. If a motor vehicle has been impounded when such administrative fee is
imposed, the city may seek to obtain a judgment on the debt and enforce such
judgment against the motor vehicle as provided by law. However, if the Hearing
Officer finds that no such violation occurred, the Hearing Officer shall order
the return of the motor vehicle or cash bond, but the owner shall be
responsible for any towing and storage charges.
(Ord. 08-751, passed 1-9-08)
§ 76.08 FAILURE TO PAY.
   If the administrative fee and towing and storage charges are not paid within
35 days after entry of an administrative fee against an owner of record who
fails to appear at the hearing, the motor vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and
shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of
unclaimed motor vehicles. In all other cases, if the administrative fee and
towing and storage charges are not paid within 35 days after the expiration of
time at which administrative review of the Hearing Officer's determination may
be sought, or within 35 days after an action seeking administrative review has
been resolved in favor of the city, whichever is applicable, the motor vehicle
shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by
law for the disposition of unclaimed motor vehicles.

bench at the granted or proposed location would not promote the convenience of

Council and the same is not done within 30 days of the mailing of written

insurance in some company approved by the City Council naming the licensee and

theft when he or she knowingly:
      (1)   Takes possession of, carries away, transfers, or causes to be
carried away or transferred, any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered
for sale in a retail mercantile establishment with the intention of retaining

indicia of value or any other markings which aid in determining value affixed

full retail value of such merchandise; or

such, within ten days after written demand from the owner for its return. A
notice in writing, given after the expiration of the leasing agreement, by
registered mail, to the lessee at the address given by the lessee and shown on
the leasing agreement shall constitute proper demand.
   (B)   Theft by emergency exit. A person commits theft by emergency exit when
he or she commits a retail theft as defined in division (A)(1) through (8) of
this section and to facilitate the theft he or she leaves the retail mercantile
establishment by use of a designated emergency exit.
   (C)   Permissive inference.  If any person:
      (1)   Conceals upon his or her person or among his or her belongings
unpurchased merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail
mercantile establishment; and
      (2)   Removes that merchandise beyond the last known station for
receiving payments for that merchandise in that retail mercantile
establishment, then the trier of fact may infer that the person possessed,
carried away or transferred such merchandise with the intention of retaining it
or with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of the possession,
use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full retail value of such
merchandise.
   To CONCEAL merchandise means that, although there may be some notice of its

this section, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300 for property
other than motor fuel or $150 for motor fuel, is a Class A misdemeanor. A
violation of division (A)(7) of this section is a Class A misdemeanor for a
first offense and a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent offense. Theft by
emergency exit of property, the full retail value of which does not exceed
$300, is a Class 4 felony.
      (2)   A person who has been convicted of retail theft of property under
any of divisions (A)(1) through (A)(6) and (A)(8) of this section, the full
retail value of which does not exceed $300 for property other than motor fuel
or $150 for motor fuel, and who has been previously convicted of any type of
theft, robbery, armed robbery, burglary, residential burglary, possession of
burglary tools, home invasion, unlawful use of a credit card, or forgery is
guilty of a Class 4 felony. A person who has been convicted of theft, by
emergency exit of property, the full retail value of which does not exceed
$300, and who has been previously convicted of any type of theft, robbery,
armed robbery, burglary, residential burglary, possession of burglary tools,
home invasion, unlawful use of a credit card, or forgery is guilty of a Class 3
felony.
      (3)   Any retail theft of property under any of divisions (A)(1) through
(A)(6) and (A)(8) of this section, the full retail value of which exceeds $300
for property other than motor fuel or $150 for motor fuel in a single
transaction, or in separate transactions committed by the same person as part
of a continuing course of conduct from one or more mercantile establishments
over a period of one year, is a Class 3 felony. Theft by emergency exit of
property, the full retail value of which exceeds $300 in a single transaction,
or in separate transactions committed by the same person as part of a
continuing course of conduct from one or more mercantile establishments over a
period of one year, is a Class 2 felony. When a charge of retail theft of
property or theft by emergency exit of property, the full value of which
exceeds $300, is brought, the value of the property involved is an element of
the offense to be resolved by the trier of fact as either exceeding or not
exceeding $300.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 25)
   (G)   Detention; affirmative defense.
      (1)   Any merchant who has reasonable grounds to believe that a person
has committed retail theft may detain the person, on or off the premises of a
retail mercantile establishment, in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable
length of time for all or any of the following purposes:

possession unpurchased merchandise, and to make reasonable investigations of
the ownership of such merchandise;

surrender that person to the custody of a peace officer;
         (e)   In the case of a minor, to immediately make a reasonable attempt
to inform the parents, guardian or other private person interested in the

      (2)   A merchant may make a detention as permitted in this section off
the premises of a retail mercantile establishment only if such detention is
pursuant to an immediate pursuit of such person.
      (3)   A merchant shall be deemed to have reasonable grounds to make a
detention for the purposes of this section if the merchant detains a person
because such person has in his or her possession either a theft detection
shielding device or a theft detection device remover.
   (H)   Affirmative defense. A detention as permitted in this section does not
constitute an arrest or an unlawful restraint, as defined in ILCS Ch. 720, Act
5, § 10-3, nor shall it render the merchant liable to the person so detained.
   (I)   For the purposes of this section, MINOR means a person who is less

parents or legal guardian.

guardian of the minor shall be civilly liable as provided in this division;
however, that a guardian appointed pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act of 1987,
ILCS Ch. 705, Act 405, §§ 101 et seq., shall not be liable under this division.
Total recovery under this division shall not exceed the maximum recovery
permitted under the § 5 of the Parental Responsibility Law, ILCS Ch. 740, Act
115, § 5.
      (3)   A conviction or a plea of guilty to the offense of retail theft is
not a prerequisite to the bringing of a civil suit under this division.
      (4)   Judgments arising under this division may be assigned.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 27)
§ 130.62 DECEPTIVE PRACTICES.
   (A)   A person commits a deceptive practice when, with intent to defraud:

a real or fictitious depository for the payment of money, knowing that it will

the depository when the check or other order is issued or delivered is prima
facie evidence that the offender knows that it will not be paid by the
depository.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, a FINANCIAL INSTITUTION means a bank,
insurance company, credit union, savings and loan association, investment
trust, or other depository of money or medium of savings or collective

   The Mayor and City Council expressly find and declare that:
   (A)   (1)   Cigarette smoking is dangerous to human health;
      (2)   There exists substantial scientific evidence that the use of
tobacco products causes cancer, heart disease and various other medical
disorders;
      (3)   The Surgeon General of the United States has declared that nicotine
addiction from tobacco is similar to addiction to cocaine, and is the most
widespread example of drug dependence in this country;
      (4)   The Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse concluded that
the majority of the 320,000 Americans who die each year from cigarette smoking
became addicted to nicotine as adolescents before the age of legal consent;
      (5)   The National Institute on Drug Abuse found that cigarette smoking
precedes and may be predictive of adolescent illicit drug use; and,
      (6)   The present legislative scheme of prohibiting sales of tobacco
products to persons under the age of 21 has proven ineffective in preventing
such persons from using tobacco products.
   (B)   (1)   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) definition of
tobacco products includes electronic cigarettes (e-cigs), all cigars, hookah
tobacco, pipe tobacco, and nicotine gels. The FDA regulations require that any
product entering the market after February 15, 2007, will need regulatory
approval before being made available to the public.
      (2)   Courts have ruled that e-cigarettes are tobacco products and are to
be regulated as such.
      (3)   The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act allows the
FDA to regulate some tobacco products but it does not explicitly include e-
cigarettes or hookah, cigars and cigarillos and other novel tobacco products.
      (4)   Potential health risks and/or benefits associated with electronic
smoking devices, including liquid nicotine, and other toxins are subject to
further study.

any acts or conduct within the same one year period at, in, or on the same
property which could constitute any two or more of the offenses set forth in
the definition of "Criminal Public Nuisance" at §

such acts or conduct in fact constitute any of said offenses. In the event that
the Chief determines that said reports in fact described the commission of acts
or conduct which constitute any two or more of said offenses, the Chief may
take the following action:
   (A)   Notify by registered mail, return receipt requested, or by personal
service, the owners and the occupants of the property in question that said
property may be in danger of becoming a criminal public nuisance under the
provisions of this chapter, which notice shall identify the property in
question by either street address, PIN number of legal description, describe
the acts or conduct which have occurred on the property that could serve as
part of the basis for determining that the property constitutes a criminal
public nuisance, and request that the owners and occupants contact the Chief
within 14 days of the date of the letter to discuss potential courses of action
which will prevent and deter the property in question from becoming a criminal
public nuisance.
   (B)   After complying with the notification procedure set forth in division
(A) above, if the Chief of Police receives an additional report describing the
commission of acts or conduct within the same one year period as the acts or
conduct with respect to which a notification was issued in accordance with
division (A), which acts or conduct were committed at the same property
described in said notice and which could constitute the commission of one or
more of the offenses set forth in the definition of "Criminal Public Nuisance"
at §
135.02, then the Chief shall review such report and determine whether or not
such acts or conduct in fact constitute one or more of the said offenses, and,
in the event that the Chief determines that such acts or conduct do constitute
one or more of the said offenses, then the Chief shall, by registered mail,
return receipt requested, or by personal service, and, in addition of either of
the foregoing, by posting on the property itself, provide the owners and
occupants of the property in question with a second notice, which notice shall

in fact a criminal public nuisance under §
135.01, describe all in the acts and conduct forming the basis for the
determination that the property in question is a criminal public nuisance, and

exclusive, such as the location, surrounding neighboring properties, prior
complaints, or length and duration of the abandonment, vacancy or un-occupancy.
The determination shall be in writing and shall state the basis and findings
for the determination. For buildings the building official or his or her
designee determines to the property to be a nuisance property, she/he shall,
within 14 days of making that determination, send a notice of determination
with the findings to the last taxpayer of record listed on the most recent Will
County tax roll. Said notice of determination shall be sent certified mail,

determination sent.

for the code compliance inspection of the interior of the building on the

does appeal, the owner shall either confirm the tentative date for the
inspection or shall request a reschedule for a new date and time for same,
which shall be set by the building official or his or her designee within 30
days of the date of the determination. If the owner fails to confirm the

governed by
Chapter 38 of the city's Code of Ordinances.

designee's determination, shall set forth specific facts in support thereof,

   (C)   The hearing officer shall decide the appeal on the basis of facts
presented by the owner in his or her written appeal and the building official's
or his or her designee's written determination. The burden is upon the owner to

likely than not that the subject building is not a "nuisance property" within
the meaning of this chapter. The hearing officer shall send written notice of
his or her decision to the owner within 30 days of his or her receipt of the
appeal. The hearing officer may, but is not required to. Seek additional
information from the owner. The hearing officer may, upon written notice
thereof to the owner, take no more than 30 additional days to decide the appeal

the factual basis for the determination. Following such determination,
inspection, notices, and the appeals process shall be the same as provided in §
135.22.
   (B)   Nuisance abatement plan. Following receipt of the inspection the owner
shall submit a vacant building plan. The building official or his or her
designee may prescribe a form for the plan. If the owner fails to submit the
plan as provided for by this chapter, the building official or his or her
designee may determine the plan.
   (C)   The plan shall contain the following as a minimum:
      (1)   A plan of action to repair any doors, windows, or other openings
which are boarded up or otherwise secured or covered by any means other than
conventional methods used in the design of the building or permitted for new
construction or similar type. The proposed repair shall result in openings
being secured by conventional methods used in the design of the building or by
methods permitted for new construction of similar type with board removed. The
owner shall maintain the building in an enclosed and secure state until the
building is reoccupied or made available for immediate occupancy. If the owner
demonstrates that securing of the building will provide adequate protection to
the public, the building official or his or her designee may waive the
requirement of an enclosure.
      (2)   A time schedule identifying a date of commencement of repair and
date of completion of repair for each improperly secured opening and nuisance
identified by the building official or his or her designee.
      (3)   If the owner proposes to demolish the vacant building, then the
owner shall submit a plan and time schedule for such demolition.

premises, and grounds thereof in conformance with applicable city codes.
      (5)   A plan of action, with a time schedule, identifying the date the
building will be habitable and occupied or offered for occupancy or sale. The
time schedule shall include date(s) of commencement and completion of all
actions required to achieve habitability. No plan which fails to provide for
compliance with this chapter or, which will not, as determined by the building
official or his or her designee, achieve such compliance, within three months,
in the case of a vacant boarded building, and two years, in the case of a
vacant, un-boarded, and code compliant building will be approved, except that
the building official or his or her designee may approve an extension of the
time during which the building will be unoccupied beyond two years to a date
certain but then only based upon clear and documented evidence of good cause
shown by the owner as determined by the building official or his or her
designee.

and elsewhere in the City Code, including but not limited to, an action to
compel correction of health or fire code violations.
(Ord. 18-053, passed 12-19-2018)

§ 135.99 PENALTY.
   In the event that the city establishes in any judicial action instituted in
accordance with
Chapter 93 that a property within the corporate limits of the city constitutes
a criminal public nuisance, the court shall, in addition to any other powers
granted by the provisions of the Code of Ordinances or applicable law, have the

§ 150.30 REVIEW CRITERIA FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS (COA).
   (A)   In making a determination whether to issue or deny a certificate of
appropriateness, the Commission shall consider, among other things, the effect
of the proposed construction, alteration, removal or demolition upon the
historic, aesthetic or architectural value, characteristics and significance of
the property, structure or improvements within the historic district. The
criteria to be used by the Commission in making its determination shall
include, but not be limited to the following:
      (1)   The maintenance of the significant original qualities or character
of the property, structure, or improvements, including, if significant, its
landscape. The removal or alteration of any historic or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided whenever possible.
      (2)   The compatibility of the architectural style and design detailing
of the proposed construction, alteration, addition or repair with the original
architecture of the property or structures;
      (3)   The compatibility of the general design, arrangement, scale,
texture, or materials of the construction or alteration or addition, with
historic, aesthetic, or architectural values, characteristics and significance
of the historic district;
      (4)   The relationship of the location of the construction, alteration,
or removal to the streets, public or semi-public ways and any other structures
or property within the historic district;
      (5)   Construction, alteration, and demolition shall be undertaken only
in accordance with the following standards:
         (a)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to minimize alteration of
the property, structure, or site and its environment.
         (b)   All property and structures shall be recognized as products of
their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
         (c)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a property, structure, or site and
its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own
right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected.
         (d)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship which characterize a property, structure, or site shall be
treated with sensitivity.
         (e)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather
than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the
new material need not be identical to but should match the material being
replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities.
Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on
accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or
pictoral evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of
different architectural elements from other structures.
         (f)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
         (g)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
(Ord. 23-005, passed 3-1-23)
§ 150.31 NEW CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Contemporary design for new construction, alterations, and additions
to existing properties or structures shall not be discouraged when such
construction, alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical,
architectural, or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the
size, scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood, or
environment.
   (B)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in
the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would not be
impaired.
(Ord. 23-005, passed 3-1-23)
§ 150.32 STAFF APPROVALS.

rehabilitation or reuse of the existing structure or improvement on the

      (5)   The Commission may adopt procedural rules concerning the types of
information, evidence or expert testimony that it considers necessary to make a
determination on an application for a certificate of economic hardship.
      (6)   Upon a finding by the Commission that without approval of the
proposed work all reasonable use of, or return from, a property within the

VACANT AND FORECLOSED PROPERTY REGISTRATION
§ 151.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
It is the purpose and intent of the City Council of the City of Lockport to
establish a process to address the deterioration, crime, and decline in value
of City neighborhoods caused by vacant property with foreclosing or foreclosed
mortgages and rental property located within the City. It has been determined
that Owner-occupied structures are generally better maintained when compared to
vacant structures, even with a diligent off-site property Owner. Vacant
structures or rental property are often not properly or diligently maintained,
which contribute to blight, declined property values, and have a negative
impact on social perception of the residential areas where they are located. It
is the City Council's further intent to establish a registration program as a
mechanism to help protect neighborhoods from becoming blighted through the lack
of adequate maintenance of vacant properties that are in Foreclosure or
Foreclosed and rental properties.
(Ord. 20-010, passed 5-6-20)

REGISTRATION OF RENTAL PROPERTY
§ 151.25 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose and intent of the City Council of the City of Lockport to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the city and to ensure owners and

ensure that such properties afford tenants a safe and decent place to dwell,

governmental interests.

§ 153.10.010 TITLE.
   This Chapter 153, Appendix A shall be known and may be cited and referred to
as “The Development Code of the City of Lockport.”
(Ord. 18-008, passed 2-7-2018)
§ 153.10.020 PURPOSE.
   In an era of increasing complexity in urban life, the subdivision and
development of private land can have a profound impact upon the cost and
efficiency of sanitary sewer and water services, vehicular and pedestrian
circulation systems, stormwater runoff control, educational and recreational
facilities, and upon environmental qualities conducive to the well-being of
citizens. Therefore, the following regulations and standards applicable to the
subdivision and/or development/redevelopment of land within the jurisdiction of
the City of Lockport are hereby adopted to:
   (A)   Advance the public health, safety and welfare in an era of
increasingly rapid improvements of vacant land.
   (B)   Encourage the use of the best planning and engineering practices by
private developers in an age when sophisticated technology in building and
design is available.
   (C)   Promote the growth of the City of Lockport in a manner that will not
only provide its citizens with a safe, healthy and beneficent environment, but
will also protect property values, thereby securing the fiscal base for public
services.
   (D)   Ensure adequate and economical provisions of necessary public services
caused by and attributable to improvement of vacant land.
   (E)   Promote those qualities in the environment that bring value to the
community, to foster the attractiveness and functional utility of the community
as a place to live and work, to protect investments in the community, and to
raise the level of community expectations for the quality of its environment.
   (F)   Prescribe the standards for the preparation and submission of
preliminary and final subdivision plats and development plans; to specify the
types of development or land use for which submissions shall be required; to
define and establish the responsibilities and standards for processing, review
and approval of such plats and plans; and to designate the reviewing and
approving authorities for the city.
   (G)   Diminish threats to public health, safety and welfare caused by
excessive stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment. Excessive
stormwater runoff may result in the inundation of damageable properties, the
erosion and destabilization of downstream channels, and the pollution of
valuable stream and lake resources. The cause of increases in stormwater runoff
volume and flow rate, and impairment of water quality, is the development and
improvement of land. As such, this chapter regulates these activities to
minimize or prevent adverse impacts.
   (H)   Ensure that new development does not increase the threat of stormwater
damage or flood hazards to others or create unstable conditions susceptible to
soil erosion.
   (I)   Protect new buildings or major improvements to buildings from flood
damage due to increased stormwater runoff.
   (J)   Protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding
on a watershed basis.
   (K)   Lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs
to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, correction of channel erosion
problems, and flood rescue and relief operations caused by increased stormwater
runoff from new development.
   (L)   Protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources.
   (M)   Preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
watercourses and flood plains and to protect water quality and aquatic
habitats.
   (N)   Preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to
moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil
erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational
opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits, and enhance community and economic
development.
   (O)   Safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the
environment, and promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating and
controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or
other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the
movement of earth on land situated in the city. It is the intention of this
ordinance that the delivery of sediment from sites affected by land-disturbing
activities be limited, as closely as practicable, to that which would have
occurred if the land had been left in its natural and undisturbed state.
(Ord. 18-008, passed 2-7-18; Am. Ord. 21-021, passed 8-18-21)

§ 153.20.010 PREAMBLE.
   This section establishes the procedure to be followed by any person who
proposes to subdivide or develop any land subject to the requirements of this
chapter. Although separate requirements are specified for subdivisions and
developments regulated by this chapter, to the extent feasible, applicants are
urged to consolidate petitions for subdivision, development, zoning relief or
annexation in one proceeding. This section identifies the contents of
preliminary plats and plans, final plats and plans and supporting
documentation. It also establishes a review process and enumerates standards
governing decision making hereunder.

§ 153.20.020 PRE-APPLICATION MEETING.
   Prior to filing an application for review and approval of a concept plan,
preliminary development plan or subdivision plat, or final development plan or
subdivision plat, the developer or subdivider shall request a pre-application
meeting to informally discuss the proposed subdivision or development of land
with the various representatives involved with the review of the development
proposal (including planning, building, fire districts, engineering, etc.).
   Purpose. The purpose of the pre-application meeting is to afford the
subdivider or developer and their consultants an opportunity for the advice and
the assistance of the city concerning the procedures, standards,
specifications, and other documentation required by this chapter for the
preparation of a concept plan, preliminary development plan or plat and final
development plan or plat. The pre-application meeting is intended, but not
limited, to provide clarification of interpretations, avoidance of
misunderstandings, and development of liaison in order to expedite the
development of land in the city, while minimizing the expenditure of time and
financial resources of the subdivider or developer and the city.
   Request for pre-application meeting. The request for a pre-application
meeting shall be made to the Director of Community and Economic Development or
authorized designee not less than one week prior to the date of the scheduled
meeting. If the applicant has any maps, data or other information which may be
helpful to illustrate or describe the characteristics of the proposed
development, the developer shall deliver to the Director of Community and
Economic Development or authorized designee copies of such information, either
in hard copy form or electronically. The Director of Community and Economic
Development or authorized designee will determine how the information is to be
provided based on the size and scope of the proposal.
(Ord. 18-008, passed 2-7-18)
§ 153.20.021 CONVENTIONAL SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (A)   Authority. 
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator and Site Plan Review Committee shall
perform a conventional site plan review approval for development projects that:
         (a)   Do not include subdivision or consolidation of land, which are
subject to the Development Code;
         (b)   Propose uses permitted in the district in which the property
resides;
         (c)   Are not requesting special uses, variances, rezoning, annexation
or a development agreement, all of which are subject to public hearings and
their associated approval processes.
      (2)   Applications for conventional site plan review approval may be
brought by the owner of a property, or persons with a contractual interest in a
property, and having authorization of the owner. Any project located in the
Historic District must first be granted a certificate of appropriateness prior
to submittal.
   (B)   Purpose. Conventional site plan review addresses uses and developments
appropriate for a zoning district, but considers that there may be potential
adverse impacts for how a site is designed or used, and that require a more
detailed evaluation than is otherwise incorporated into building permit, life
safety, and related considerations. The standards and procedures in this
section are designed to provide a thoughtful and efficient evaluation of such
development applications.
   (C)   Procedure.
      (1)   Conventional site plan review required. The Zoning Administrator
shall lead the site plan review process as outlined in this section for
multiple-family and nonresidential development applications, where no
variations, special uses, rezonings or subdivisions are required, located in
the following zoning districts:
         (a)   R-3 Multiple-Family Residential District.
         (b)   R-4 Multiple-Family Residential District.
         (c)   C-l Neighborhood Commercial District.
         (d)   C-2 Community Commercial District.
         (e)   C-3 Highway Commercial District.
         (f)   C-4 Downtown Commercial District.
         (g)   O-1 Limited Office District.
         (h)   O-2 General Office District.
         (i)   M-l Limited Manufacturing District.
         (j)   M-2 General Manufacturing District.
      (2)   Conventional Site Plan Review Committee. Applications for proposed
development subject to site plan review shall be considered by a committee
consisting of: the Zoning Administrator (serving as chair), a representative of
the PZC, a representative of the City Council, a representative of the Public
Works Department, a representative of the Police Department, a representative
of the Community and Economic Development Department, a representative of the
Lockport Township Fire Prevention District, and others as may be determined
necessary by the Zoning Administrator on an ad hoc basis.
      (3)   Conventional Site Plan Review Committee approvals.
         (a)   Application. Applications for site plan approval by the
Conventional Site Plan Review Committee will be considered filed with the city
as part of a complete application for properties.
         (b)   Intake meeting. Following submittal of a completed application,
the Director of Community and Economic Development, or their designee, will
schedule an intake meeting with the Committee and the applicant to review the
project and make initial recommendations to the applicant related to the
standards for approval. The purpose of the intake meeting is to give the
applicant information that will assist them prior to expending funds to prepare
final submittal documents.
         (c)   Final submittal action by the city.
            1.    Based on review of the final submittal application, the Site
Plan Review Committee, by consensus decision (or formal vote if consensus is
not reached), will either:
               a.    Approve the site plan as submitted;
               b.    Approve it subject to conditions based on the standards
noted below, with a written explanation to the applicant; or
               c.    Deny approval of the site plan, with written findings
provided to the applicant pursuant to the standards below.
            2.   The failure of the Site Plan Review Committee to act within 60
days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, will be deemed to
be a decision approving the site plan as submitted.
            3.   In reviewing a submitted site plan regarding the standards
below, the Site Plan Review Committee may suggest alternative site plan or
design approaches that could address specified deficiencies, or may note that
such deficiencies that cannot be avoided would have a minimal adverse impact on
the property or nearby properties.
         (d)   Effect of city action. Approval of a site plan by the Site Plan
Review Committee, acceptance of required modifications by the applicant, or
agreement by the applicant and Zoning Administrator on an approach to address
required modifications will constitute final action regarding site plan review.
All other city building permit and City Code requirements must still be met for
the proposed construction. An approval letter listing any applicable conditions
will serve as an official approval of the project.
         (e)   Appeals. If the Site Plan Review Committee denies a site plan
review application and the applicant wishes to appeal that denial, the
applicant may file the request as an appeal to a determination of the Zoning
Administrator in accordance with this chapter. The appeal will be heard by the
PZC and subsequently the City Council.
         (f)   Time constraints. Unless an extension is granted by the Zoning
Administrator as a result of written request by the applicant showing good
cause and external factors necessitating an extension, no site plan or design
approval will be valid for a period longer than six months unless a building
permit is issued. Within one year of site plan review approval, construction
must have begun and (if not completed) must be actively pursued to completion.
   (D)   Standards for site plan review. In considering a site plan submitted
for review pursuant to this section, the Site Plan Review Committee will
consider the following standards.
      (1)   The application must be complete as specified in this chapter,
other city regulations, or other requirements specified by the city.
      (2)   Any other application for approval by the city or other
jurisdiction relevant to items considered under conventional site plan review
must be successfully secured.
      (3)   The proposed site plan or design is internally logical and safe,
and facilitates clear understanding of travel and circulation within the
property, as well as to and from the site, by vehicles, pedestrians and
bicyclists.
      (4)   The proposed site plan and design do not interfere with easements
or rights-of-way, or create traffic hazards or congestion on surrounding public
streets.
      (5)   The proposed site plan or design does not adversely impact use and
enjoyment of surrounding properties.
      (6)   Outdoor storage is adequately screened.
      (7)   The proposed site plan, or design, does not create adverse impacts
related to stormwater management, drainage or erosion for the subject site or
nearby properties, and complies with all local, county, state and federal
requirements.
      (8)   The proposed site plan or design should not place undue burden on
the city’s ability to provide adequate facilities or other utility systems
serving the site or area. The site plan should integrate site utilities into
the overall existing and planned utility systems serving the city.
      (9)   The proposed site plan or design must provide for required public
improvements as may be directed in this chapter, the comprehensive plan, city
planning documents, or other aspects of the City Code.
      (10)   The proposed site plan or design shall not adversely impact the
public health, safety or general welfare of the community.
      (11)   The site plan and designs shall meet or exceed city design
guideline standards.
   (E)   Modifications.
      (1)   During development of the site.  During development of the site,
the Zoning Administrator may authorize an adjustment to the approved site plan
if such change could been have authorized in the course of the original review.
      (2)   Amendments to site plan following completion of development. After
a site is developed in accordance with an approved site plan, the site plan may
be altered, if, in the determination of the Zoning Administrator and based on
the standards for review, in the same manner and subject to the same
limitations as provided for the original approval of site plans.
   (F)   Submittal requirements. Every application submitted will include, but
is not limited to, the following:

§ 153.30.010 INTRODUCTION.
   The development of land, including the arrangement, character, extent,
width, grade and location of all streets, alleys, or other land to be dedicated
for Public use shall conform to the comprehensive plan and official map of the
city. This chapter establishes guidelines in order to ensure the orderly
development and improvement of land within the jurisdiction of the city.
(Ord. 18-008, passed 2-7-18)
§ 153.30.020 LAND OR CASH CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PUBLIC PARKS.
   As a condition of approval of a final plat of a residential subdivision, or
of a final plat of other residential development, each subdivider or developer
will be required to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes to serve
the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, or cash
contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at
the option of the city, in accordance with the following requirements:
   (A)   Criteria for requiring park and recreational land dedication.
      (1)   Amount of land required. The ultimate population density to be
generated by a subdivider or development shall bear directly on the amount of
land required to be dedicated for park and recreation sites. The acreage of
land dedication requirements shall be determined by obtaining the total
population of the development times the number of required acres per 1,000
population. The total requirement shall be ten acres of park or recreational
land, or cash in lieu of land, per 1,000 of ultimate population.
      (2)   Time of conveyance of land. Previous to, or at the time of
execution of the final plat, the Developer must dedicate the total amount of
park land as required in division (1) above. The developer shall maintain the
property to be donated until all improvements in the subdivision are built,
and/or until accepted by the Lockport Township Park District (the Park
District). The Park District shall inspect the land to be dedicated and shall
receive title to the land upon written approval of all improvements determined
under division (E).
   (B)   Criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of park and recreations
sites. Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be
practical or when the available land is geologically and topographically
inappropriate for park and recreational purposes as determined by the corporate
authorities, the corporate authorities shall require the subdivider or
developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required.
The cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land as hereinbefore
classified, will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the
residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of other
existing local park and recreation land needs and not however to include
operational expenses.
      (1)   Time conveyance of payments. The total cash contribution in lieu of
land dedication shall be determined prior to the time of final subdivision plat
approval. The cash contribution shall be calculated based on a prorated basis
using the table of population density developed by the Illinois School
Consulting Service/Associated Municipal Consultants, Inc. of Naperville,
Illinois, dated 1996 or as updated from time to time by the same consulting
firm. Payment shall be made prior to or concurrent with submission of the
application for certificate of occupancy for the residential unit. Payment
shall be made directly to the park district and evidence of payment shall be
presented to the city at the time of the application for certificate of
occupancy.
      (2)   Fair market value. The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be
based on the “fair market value” of the acres of fully improved park land in
the area after development. Because of the diversity of lands within the city,
a single determination of “fair market value” is not possible. The “fair market
value” for any particular parcel shall be recommended by the Park District.
This valuation recommended by the Park District shall be used unless any
subdivider, developer, or public body files a written objection thereto. In the
event of any such objection, the subdivider, developer, or public body shall
submit an appraisal showing the “fair market value” of such improved park land
in the area of development or other evidence. Final determination of said "fair
market value" per acre of such improved land shall be made by the corporate
authorities based on such information submitted by the subdivider or developer
and from other sources as may be submitted to the corporate authorities by
affected parties.
      (3)   Criteria for requiring dedication and a fee. There will be
situations in subdivisions or developments when a combination of land
dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These
occasions will arise when:
         (a)   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a park site. That portion of the land within the subdivision
falling within the park location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and
a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be dedicated;
         (b)   A major part of the local park or recreation site has already
been acquired and only a small portion of the land is needed from the
development to complete the site. The remaining portion shall be required by
dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.
   (C)   Density formula. In the event a subdivider or developer files a
written objection to the most current edition of the population density
provided by the Illinois School Service, he shall submit his own demographic
study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the
subdivision or development and in that event, final determination of the
density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the corporate
authorities, based upon such demographic information submitted by the
subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the
corporate authorities, park districts or others. It is recognized that
population density, age distribution and local conditions may change over time,
and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in
lieu thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment if
necessary.
   (D)   Combining with adjoining development. Where the subdivision or
development is less than 40 acres and public open area space is to be
dedicated; the land shall, where practicable, be combined with dedicated land
from adjoining developments in order to produce useable recreation areas
without undue hardship on a particular developer.
   (E)   Improved sites. All sites to be dedicated shall have access to
electricity, gas, water, sewer, streets, storm drainage and curb and gutter, as
applicable. All sites to be dedicated shall be unencumbered by floodplains,
wetlands or stormwater detention facilities. All improved sites shall be seeded
and blanketed or mulched, and a healthy stand of grass shall be established
prior to acceptance by the Park District.
   (F)   Shape, topography and grading. The shape, topography and geology of
the dedicated site, as well as its surroundings, shall be suitable for its
intended purpose(s).
(Ord. 18-008, passed 2-7-18)
§ 153.30.021 LAND OR CASH CONTRIBUTIONS FOR SCHOOLS.
   As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, or a final plat
of a planned unit development or an application for a special use permit for a
mobile home park, each subdivider, developer, or builder will be required to
dedicate land within the school district boundaries for school sites, to serve
the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, or make a
cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both,
in accordance with the following criteria and formula:
   (A)   Criteria for requiring school dedication.
      (1)   Requirement and population ratio. The ultimate number of students
to be generated by a subdivision, planned unit development or mobile home park
shall bear directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school
sites. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the
ratio of:
         (a)   Estimated children to be served in each school classification as
determined in accordance with the data for the estimated number of children
entering school per type of dwelling unit seen in the latest edition of the
Illinois School Consulting Service Reports;
         (b)   Maximum recommended number of acres of land needed to have
sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increased number of
children in each such school classification. The recommended number of acres of
land needed for school sites shall be obtained from the most current
Recommendations for Elementary and High School Spaces, published by the State
of Illinois, Springfield, Illinois. If cash contribution is required, the
following formula shall be used:
            Cost of land as determined in accordance with division (B)(2)
hereof multiplied by the number of square feet per pupil per school
classification as determined in accordance with division (A)(2) hereof equals
the cost per child.
      (2)   School classification and size of school site.
         (a)   School classifications and size of school sites within the city
shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria:
 
School Classificati on by Maximum Number of Students Minimum Size in Acres for
Grades                    for each such School       each School Site of such
                          Classification             Classification
Elementary Schools        600 students               11 acres
Junior High Schools       900 students               29 acres
Senior High Schools       1,500 students             45 acres
 
         (b)   The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted by
the affected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites.
   (B)   Criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of a school site.
      (1)   Where the development is small and the resulting school site is too
small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for a school
site, the city with the recommendation of the board of education of the school
districts, affected, shall require, at the discretion of the school district,
the subdivider, developer or builder, to pay a cash contribution in lieu of
land dedication required. The word small in this section is defined as a total
number of proposed dwelling units that will produce less than the maximum
number of students for one school of each school classification as set forth in
division (A)(2).
      (2)   The determination of whether available land is appropriate for a
school site shall be made by the local school board. Notwithstanding the
previous provision, a high school district may recommend more than one
valuation which shall correspond and be identical to the valuations within the
elementary feeder districts the high school district serves. Any builder,
subdivider or developer affected may request a hearing before the corporate
authorities on the question of whether the proposed land is appropriate as a
school site. Any builder, subdivider or developer affected as well as the local
school board may present evidence at said hearing and in addition, the
corporate authorities, in its discretion, may hear evidence from other
interested persons.
         The approved fair market value of an improved acre accepted by the
city for each school district prior to this amended ordinance shall be in
effect as of the date that this chapter becomes effective. For purposes of this
chapter, an improved acre shall be defined as an acre of land that is fine
graded and made ready for construction with utilities, sewer, water and
streets, including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter, brought along the
entire street frontage of the land. Said multiple acre parcel to be defined in
the same manner as an improved acre is defined above.
         For every year thereafter, if a school district wishes to recommend an
increased valuation, it must submit an updated appraisal to the corporate
authorities. The valuation(s) determined by the corporate authorities shall be
used unless the subdivider, developer or builder files a written objection with
the corporate authorities prior to final plat approval. At the time of the
filing of the written objection, the objector shall also file an appraisal or
other evidence relating to the fair market value at the objector's expense.
Upon the filing of a written objection, and upon written notice to the objector
and the school district, a hearing shall be held before the corporate
authorities. At said hearing, the objector and the school district shall be
permitted to present valuation evidence to the corporate authorities. After the
hearing the corporate authorities shall determine the fair market valuation of
an improved acre of property to be used in calculating the cash contribution.
If there is any change in the fair market value as determined by the corporate
authorities after an appeal, it shall be used solely as to the land which is
the subject of the objection.
   (C)   Criteria for requiring dedication and a fee. There will be situations
in a subdivision, planned unit development or mobile home park when a
combination of land dedication and a cash contribution is necessary. These
occasions will arise when:
      (1)   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a school site. That portion of the land within the subdivision,
planned unit development or mobile home park falling within the school
locations shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution
shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be
dedicated.
      (2)   A major part of the school site has already been acquired and only
a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site.
Dedication of the remaining portions of the school site and a cash contribution
shall be required.
   (D)   Density formula. 
      The amount of required dedication of land or the cash contributions in
lieu thereof shall be calculated based on a prorated basis using the table of
population density developed by the Illinois School Consulting Service/
Associated Municipal Consultants, Inc. of Naperville, Illinois, dated 1996 or
as updated from time to time by the same consulting firm, unless a written
objection is filed thereto by the subdivider, developer, builder, or school
district with the corporate authorities. Said objection shall be filed by a
subdivider, developer, builder or school district prior to final plat approval.
      In the event a subdivider, developer, builder, or school district files a
written objection to the table of population density, it shall submit its own
demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated
from the subdivision planned unit development. In that event, final
determination of the density formula to be used in such calculation shall be
made by the corporate authorities after a hearing. At such hearing the builder,
subdivider, developer, school district, and other interested persons, in the
discretion of the corporate authorities, may present demographic information.
If there is any change in the density formula as determined by the corporate
authorities after an appeal, it shall be used solely as to the land which is
the subject of the objection.
   (E)   Dedicated sites. In addition to the requirements listed in division
(B)(2) of this chapter, all dedicated sites shall be improved in accordance
with all other requirements of the City of Lockport Development Code.
   (F)   Time of conveyance or payment. The subdivider or developer shall
convey to the respective school districts the land required under this
agreement within thirty days after any subdivision plat or final plat or a
planned unit development is recorded in the Recorder's Office of Will County,
Illinois, or special use permit is granted by the corporate authorities. All
improvements to the site shall be completed within such time as required by the
city. A subdivider, developer, or builder shall make any cash contributions
required under this chapter upon the issuance of any building permit by the
city. Payments shall be made directly to the school district or districts
wherein the development, subdivision or building is located and evidence of
said payment shall be made at the time of application for the building permit.
The amount of each payment of cash shall be determined by the city at the time
of the approval of the final subdivision plat, or final plat of a planned unit
development.
   (G)   Expenditure of monies. 
      (1)   The monies collected pursuant to this chapter are intended for
school land acquisition costs or school facility costs. School land acquisition
costs means a school district's costs of acquisition of school land, by
purchase, lease, or other contractual arrangement. School land acquisition
costs may include:
         (a)   The planning, design, and legal costs incurred by a school
district in connection with the formulation or adoption of a school land
acquisition program; and
         (b)   The reasonable title and survey expenses, brokerage fees,
attorneys' fees, architect fees, engineering fees, and environmental
investigation fees, and any other costs incurred by a school district in
connection with the acquisition of school lands.
      (2)   School facility costs means those costs attributable to the
projected increase in student population resulting from the development of a
proposed subdivision, planned unit development or mobile home park, including
the following:
         (a)   The costs incurred by a school district that are directly
associated with the construction of school facilities, including expenditures
for equipment.
         (b)   The costs incurred in the renovation or improvement of school
facilities.
         (c)   The costs incurred by a school district that are directly
related to construction of additions.
         (d)   The costs incurred by a school district that are directly
associated with the acquisition of buildings that are to be devoted to use as a
school building.
         (e)   Expenditures made by a school district for installment payments
or lease payments on contracts or agreements that have a defined term and that
result in the acquisition or leasing of a school building by the school
district or in the leasing of temporary classrooms by the school district.
         (f)   Special assessments payable by a school district for capital
improvements such as streets, curbs, and drains.
         (g)   The architectural, engineering, and legal costs incurred by a
school district in constructing school facilities.
   (H)   Accounting of expenditures. All monies collected pursuant to this
chapter shall be maintained in a separate bank account or other fund by the
receiving school district.
   (I)   Failure to convey or contribute. Failure to provide sufficient
evidence of the required conveyance or cash contribution to the city shall
result in denial of the application for a building permit or, when a building
permit has already been issued, revocation of the building permit.
   (J)   Indemnification. Any public body designated by the city to receive the
cash contribution required hereunder or to be the grantee of any conveyance
required hereunder shall agree to indemnify and hold the City of Lockport
harmless from any cash payments or land conveyances required by any court of
competent jurisdiction if any part of this chapter is held invalid.

§ 153.30.070 RESIDENTIAL BLOCK STANDARDS.
   Residential blocks shall have a maximum length of 1,000 feet when the
average lot size is less than one acre, and when no other reasonable
alternative exists. Blocks over 800 feet in length shall require a pedestrian
way or bikepath within an easement or public right-of-way at the approximate
center of the block. Additional pedestrian ways or bikepaths to provide safe
and convenient access to schools, parks, or other similar destinations may be
recommended by the Plan and Zoning Commission and required by the Corporate
Authorities.
   No specific rule concerning the shape of residential blocks is made, but
blocks must fit easily within the platted area and their alignment must
accommodate traffic flow and pedestrian access to public areas. Blocks shall
have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth,
unless in the opinion of the Plan and Zoning Commission, it is not feasible due
to unusual topography or other physical conditions.
(Ord. 18-008, passed 2-7-18; Am. Ord. 21-021, passed 8-18-21)
§ 153.30.080 LOT STANDARDS.
   (A)   All side lot lines shall be at approximate right angles to straight
street lines and radial to curved street lines, unless a modification to this
requirement will give a better street and lot plan. Double frontage lots shall
be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential
development from major streets. All residential lots shall abut a public
street.
   (B)   All lots shall be equal to or larger than the minimum lot areas
required by the Lockport Zoning Ordinance. The minimum lot size shall apply to
that portion of a lot outside the limits of any flood plains, wetlands, creeks,
streams, or open bodies of water.
   (C)   All residential lots shall be equal to or wider than the minimum lot
widths required by the Lockport Zoning Ordinance.
   (D)   Where lots front upon a cul-de-sac or curved road or street having a
radius of 200 feet or less, the minimum width of the frontage of the lot shall
be measured at the building set back line; but only if the width at the right-
of-way line is not less than 50% of the width required by the zoning ordinance,
the width being measured on the arc of the street right-of-way line.
   (E)   The areas of the street right-of-way, whether dedicated to the public
or a private street or an easement for street purposes, shall not be included
in calculating the area of the lot to be in accordance with the minimum lot
area requirements of the zoning district in which the lot is located. The lot
shall also have a width and a depth entirely adequate to provide the necessary
yard requirements of the lockport zoning ordinance.
   (F)   Lots having frontage upon major street intersections, and at acute
angle intersections, shall have a lot line radius approved by the Director of
Public Works and Engineering or authorized designee. On business lots, a chord
may be substituted for a circular arc with the approval of the Director of
Public Works and Engineering or authorized designee. Where grade separation
structures are proposed at an intersection with a major street, the lots and
required improvements shall be arranged to make adequate provision for such
structures.
(Ord. 18-008, passed 2-7-18)
§ 153.30.090 IMPROVEMENT OF CERTAIN ACCESS ROADS AND APPURTENANCES.
   (A)   Required improvements. Where any parcel of land fronts on or abuts any
existing or proposed major or collector street as shown on the official map of
the city, and where any subdivision or improvement of such parcel will be
served by any such streets, and where any such streets have not been opened and
improved in accordance with its designation on the official map or if existing,
is not improved in accordance with the standards and specifications contained
and prescribed in this chapter for such designation, then the applicant shall
be required to improve such street for its entire length and width adjacent to
such parcel in accordance with the standards and specifications of this chapter
pertaining to such street as it is designated on the official map. Such
required improvement shall include the base course and surface courses of the
roadway pavement, curbs, gutters, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers,
street lights and appurtenant facilities constructed in accordance with the
terms of these regulations.
   (B)   Optional payment in lieu of improvements. Any applicant required to
improve a street pursuant to division (A) hereof, may, at the city's option,
agree to pay to the city, for the cost of such improvement as part of a
coordinated program, an amount determined by the following formula:
   Amount paid to the city = (a/b) x c, where
      a = total cost of the city program to improve the roadway
      b = total length in feet of the roadway being improved
      c = length in feet of the roadway adjacent to the development
   (C)   Right to reimbursement from a later adjacent developer (recapture). An
applicant required to improve a roadway pursuant to division (A) hereof shall
be entitled to reimbursement for a portion of his expenses of such improvement,
or payments pursuant to division (B) attributable thereto, from any applicant
who shall subsequently seek to subdivide or improve any parcel of land adjacent
to said roadway and fronting upon any part of said roadway which has been
previously improved either by the former applicant pursuant to division (A) or
with funds paid by him pursuant to division (B).
   (D)   Amount of reimbursement (recapture fee). Any reimbursement due
pursuant to division (C) shall be computed on the basis of the following
formula:
   Amount of reimbursement = (a/b) x c, where
      a = total cost to the first applicant to improve the roadway
      b = total length in feet of the roadway being improved
      c = length in feet of the roadway improved by the first applicant which
is adjacent to the parcel of the subsequent applicant together with interest on
such amount at the interest rate of the U.S. Treasury 30-year note on the date
of completion of the improvement, compounded annually, from the date of the
completion of the improvement by the prior applicant (or his payment to the
city pursuant to division (B)), to the date of payment hereunder by the
subsequent applicant; provided, however, that such interest shall in no event
exceed 33% of the original principal amount.
   (E)   Duty to reimburse prior applicant. When any Applicant should be
required to improve any street pursuant to division (A) hereof, but for the
fact that such street has been previously improved by a prior applicant
pursuant to division (A) hereof, such subsequent applicant shall pay to the
city, solely for the purpose of reimbursing such prior applicant, an amount as
determined by the formula set out in division (D).
   (F)   Duty of city to pay over. Whenever the city shall receive any funds
pursuant to division (E), it shall receive them solely for the benefit of the
applicant entitled thereto and shall promptly pay the funds over to such
applicant or his designated agent.
   (G)   Duty to reimburse city. When any applicant would be required to
improve any street pursuant to division (A) hereof except for the fact that
such street has previously been improved by the city, such applicant shall pay
to the city, solely as reimbursement for such improvement, an amount equal to
50% of the cost to the city for improving the street for the length of the
applicant's parcel fronting on and abutting the street, together with interest
on such amount at the interest rate of the U.S. Treasury 30-year Note on the
date of completion of the improvement, compounded annually, from the date of
the completion of such improvement to the date of payment by the applicant
hereunder; provided, however, that such interest shall in no event exceed 33%
of the original principal amount.
   (H)   Applicant's prior right to reimbursement. When any roadway subject to
this section has been improved as part of a coordinated program through the use
of city funds and funds paid by one or more applicants pursuant to division
(B), any funds received by the city as reimbursement from any subsequent
applicant pursuant to division (G) shall be paid over to any former applicant
contributing to the coordinated program, up to one-half of their payments
pursuant to division (B). Such payments to any such applicant shall be computed
in accordance with the following formula:
   Amount Paid to Applicant = (a/b) x c, where
      a = amount contributed by the specified applicant
      b = the amount contributed by all applicants
      c = the amount available for payment
      Any such payment to any applicant shall reduce, dollar for dollar, the
reimbursement to which it might otherwise be entitled under the terms of this
section and by such payment the city shall be subrogated, dollar for dollar, to
the right of such applicant for reimbursement. In interpreting this section, it
shall be assumed to be the intent of the corporate authorities that each
applicant which is, or might become, entitled to a reimbursement pursuant to
this article shall receive such reimbursement in full before the city shall
receive any reimbursement to which it is, or might become, entitled in
connection with the improvement of any roadway subject to this section.
   (I)   Sewer connection permit required. In addition to any other
requirements or prohibitions of these regulations, no applicant, owner,
subdivider, or developer, nor any contractor, agent or other representative
thereof, shall connect to any storm drain or sewer constructed in whole or in
part by the city or any applicant pursuant to the provisions and requirements
of this section without first securing a permit for such connection from the
city.
      The application for such permit shall be accompanied by proof of
compliance with all applicable terms of this section, including payment of any
monies due hereunder or provision for such payment satisfactory to the city.
Any connection made without such permit shall be subject to disconnection by
the city at the expense of the applicant, owner, subdivider or developer
responsible for compliance with the terms of this section. Nothing herein shall
be taken to relieve the applicant, owner, subdivider or developer of liability
for violations of this section.
   (J)   Nothing in this section shall be taken nor construed in any manner to
vest in any person, firm or corporation any proprietary rights to any roadway
presently owned by the city; nor to relieve or excuse any applicant, owner,
subdivider or developer from the provisions of these regulations pertaining to
the dedication of any street or roadway, whether or not such street or roadway
is subject to the provisions of this section.

§ 153.30.100 IMPROVEMENT OF DOWNSTREAM FACILITIES AND APPURTENANCES.
   Because there are areas in the City of Lockport where existing storm sewers,
sanitary sewers and water mains and appurtenances may not be sized to
adequately accommodate upstream development, the corporate authorities may
require the subdivider or developer to make or contribute toward the
construction of downstream improvements to accommodate the proposed
development. The determination of the type and need for such improvements shall
be made by the Director of Public Works and Engineering or authorized designee
after analysis of the impact of the proposed development on the capacity of the
existing downstream facilities. The nature of such improvements and the
distribution of costs of the improvements will be determined on an individual
basis.
(Ord. 18-008, passed 2-7-18)
§ 153.30.120 IMPROVEMENTS OF PUBLIC FACILITIES RELATED TO RESUBDIVISIONS.
   In case of resubdivisions or areas to be resubdivided, where required
improvements meeting the provisions of this chapter are already installed, no
duplication of such improvements shall be required; provided however, that
where such improvements have become worn, broken, outdated, defective or do not
meet city standards, the owner or developer shall be required to repair and
correct such defects or deficiencies.
   If property for which an application to resubdivide has been presented abuts
on or contains an existing public street which has a pavement width less than
that required by this chapter, the owner or developer shall dedicate additional
land sufficient to provide the additional pavement to bring the street width
into compliance with the minimum standards listed in this chapter, and
including the relocation of any water mains, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, or
other existing public utilities, prior to final city approval of the property
for resubdivision. The necessary dedication and required improvements shall be
located on the same side of the street that the proposed resubdivision is

(Ord. 18-008, passed 2-7-18)
§ 153.50.020 SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard persons, protect property,
prevent damage to the environment, and promote the public welfare by guiding,
regulating and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any
development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil and other
conditions allowing the movement of sedimentation with the city.
   (A)   The stormwater runoff from the disturbed areas of any subdivision or
development shall not leave the development site without first passing through
sediment control facilities. This requirement shall apply to all phases of
construction and shall include an ongoing process of implementation of measures
and maintenance of those measures during both the construction season and any
construction shut down periods.
   (B)   Sediment and erosion control measures shall meet the requirements of
Article 3 of the Will County Stormwater Management Ordinance, latest edition.
Specifications for sediment and erosion control measures shall be in accordance
with the latest edition of the Illinois Urban Manual. Sediment and erosion
control measures planning and design shall be in accordance with Procedures and
Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois (the
Green Book). Where the Illinois Urban Manual conflicts with the Green Book, the
Illinois Urban Manual shall prevail.
   (C)   The objectives of sediment and erosion control requirements are to
control soil erosion and sedimentation caused by any development activities,
whether a site development permit is required or not, and to control erosion
and sedimentation caused by runoff from vacant land. The following principles
shall be incorporated into the design of any proposed development or into the
maintenance plan for undeveloped property:
      (1)   A development shall be designed to take into account the topography
and soils of the site, to create the least practicable potential for erosion.
Areas of steep slopes with high cuts and fills should be avoided wherever
possible. Natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.
      (2)   Natural vegetation shall be retained and protected wherever
possible, especially in areas adjacent to a natural watercourse.
      (3)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the
shortest practical time during development. This may require project phasing.
      (4)   Areas which have been graded during development shall be protected
with temporary vegetation, erosion blanket or mulch (when appropriate) as soon
as practicable. Vegetation within public rights-of-way shall be kept eight
inches tall or shorter by periodic mowing.
      (5)   Sediment basins shall be provided and shall be designed and sized
in accordance with Article 300.5 of the Will County Stormwater Management
Ordinance, latest edition.
      (6)   Provisions shall be made in the design to accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development.
   (D)   All subdivisions and developments that result in the disturbance of
one or more acres total land area, or a disturbance less than one acre of total
land that is part of a larger common plan that will ultimately disturb one or
more acres total land area, shall meet the requirements of the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency's (IEPA) General NPDES Permit No. ILR10,
Stormwater Discharges from Construction Site Activities. A Notice of Intent
(NOI) and a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) must be submitted to
the IEPA at least 30 days prior to the start of construction. Weekly
sedimentation and erosion control inspections are required for the duration of
construction, until disturbed areas are stabilized with permanent vegetation. A
copy of the NOI, SWPPP and weekly inspection reports shall be kept on site
during construction, and an additional copy shall be provided to the Director
of Public Works and Engineering or authorized designee.
(Ord. 18-008, passed 2-7-18; Am. Ord. 21-021, passed 8-18-21)
§ 153.50.030 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWER SYSTEMS.
   (A)   General. All developments, whether public or private, where curb and
gutter is required and at other locations determined by the Director of Public
Works and Engineering or authorized designee, shall include provisions for the
construction of storm sewers and appurtenances designed in accordance with this
chapter. Storm sewer systems and pipe culverts shall be designed accordance
with the IDOT Bureau of Design and Environment Manual and installed in
accordance with the IDOT Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction, latest edition.
   (B)   Service areas. All storm sewers, culverts and open channels shall be
designed to accommodate all areas which naturally flow to the area of the
development and also any additional areas which are planned to contribute in
the future to the drainage area, as identified by the Director of Public Works
and Engineering or authorized designee. If extending the ultimate service area
beyond the natural drainage area limits served by the proposed subdivision
results in additional construction costs within the subdivision, a written
agreement may be made with the corporate authorities for the recapture by the
owner or developer of the additional cost when future system extensions are
made. Recapture payments will be made to the owner or developer only after the
person benefitting from the drainage area adjustment has made payment to the
city.
   (C)   System extensions. The location of proposed extensions to the existing
storm sewer system shall be approved by the Director of Public Works and
Engineering or authorized designee.
   (D)   Basic design standards. Unless otherwise approved by the Director of
Public Works and Engineering or authorized designee, the following basic design
calculations shall utilize the following methods and criteria:
      (1)   Hydrology (design flows). Design runoff rates for conveyance shall
be calculated using the rational method for watersheds of ten acres or less.
Design runoff rates for conveyance shall be calculated using an event
hydrograph method for watersheds greater than ten acres. Design runoff rates
shall be calculated using the requirements of the Will County Stormwater
Ordinance, latest edition, or Illinois State Water Survey Bulletin 75 Northeast
Sectional rainfall statistics, whichever is most recent. The elapsed duration
time used in determining rainfall intensity shall be equal to the time of
concentration (inlet time) plus the time of flow between the most distant inlet
and the point in the system under consideration (travel time). Inlet time shall
be calculated using TR-55 or similar methodology, but shall not be less than
ten minutes. For the rational method, the composite runoff coefficient shall be
calculated using 0.95 for all impervious areas and 0.35 for all pervious areas.
      (2)   Hydraulics (conveyance capacity). Storm sewers and open channels
shall be designed to provide adequate capacity using Manning's formula.
Culverts shall be designed using inlet control and outlet control culvert
design hydrographs, HY-8 or a similar program. Design mean velocity for pipes
and open channels shall be at least 2.5 feet per second but shall not exceed
ten feet per second, while flowing full.
      (3)   Storm sewer criteria. Storm sewers serving inlets shall not be less
than 12 inches in diameter. Storm sewers serving sump pumps, roof drains and
service lines shall not be less than six inches in diameter. Storm sewers shall
be designed to convey the runoff from a 10% annual probability (ten-year) storm
while flowing full (not surcharged); and shall be designed to convey the runoff
from a 1% annual probability (100-year) storm in a surcharged condition,
provided that the hydraulic gradeline is not more than six inches above the rim
grade at each structure. Storm sewers shall be laid straight in both horizontal
and vertical planes between manholes. Storm sewers of different diameters shall
join only at structures, and to maintain a uniform energy gradient, invert
elevations shall be adjusted to match the pipes at their 80% depth.
      (4)   Culvert criteria. Culverts shall not be less than 15 inches in
diameter. Culverts shall be designed to convey the runoff from a 2% annual
probability (50-year) storm with a HW/D value of 1.5 or less.
      (5)   Inlet criteria. Surface drainage inlets shall be provided so that
surface water is not conveyed across any street intersections or parking lot
driveways. Surface runoff shall not extend a distance of more than 400 feet
along the surface of the ground and shall not create a design flow rate of more
than two cubic feet per second for a 10% annual probability (ten-year) storm
before being intercepted by drainage inlets. Inlets shall discharge into storm
sewers, which shall not discharge into side lot or rear lot drainage ditches or
swales. Inlets shall be provided at all low points.
      (6)   Lot drainage. Tops of foundation shall be six inches above the
adjacent grade. The lot grade shall fall six inches within the first ten feet
of the building line or lot line, whichever distance is less. Sump pumps shall
be connected to the storm sewer system and the point of discharge for sump
pumps shall be shown on the subdivision plan for each building served having a
basement or crawl space. The overland flow route of stormwater runoff away from
each building into swales and storm sewers, and to the location where it leaves
the site, shall be shown on the subdivision plan. Positive drainage shall be
established for each lot whether or not it is the intention to construct a
building on that lot.
      (7)   Manhole placement. Manholes shall be located at the following
locations:
         (a)   At the termination of all sewers which do not terminate at a
catch basin or inlet.
         (b)   Changes in direction, horizontal or vertical.
         (c)   Changes in pipe shape or pipe size.
         (d)   Junctions with other storm sewers.
         (e)   A storm structure (manhole, inlet or catch basin) shall be
located contiguous, abutting or within five feet of the rear lot line of each
residential lot unless that lot is contiguous to a detention facility or swale
that is at least three feet lower than lowest point on the lot.
         (f)   Maximum manhole spacing:
            1.   For six inch to 24 inch pipes, maximum structure spacing
equals 350 feet;
            2.   For 27 inch to 36 inch pipes, maximum structure spacing equals
400 feet; and
            3.   For 42 inch or larger pipes, maximum structure spacing equals
500 feet.
      (8)   Estate residential zoning districts. In E-R zoning districts, storm
sewers are not required. Culverts shall be reinforced concrete pipe (RCP). The
length of culverts shall be at least the width of the pavement crossed plus
eight feet plus eight times the depth of the ditch.
      (9)   Swale criteria. All swales shall be sodded and limited to a maximum
water depth of 12 inches. Side slopes of swales shall not be steeper than four
horizontal to one vertical.
      (10)   Open channel criteria. Open channels may be provided on an
optional basis in lieu of enclosed storm sewer pipe when the channel will drain
an area 80 acres or larger, or in the E-R Estate Residential District when
located in the public right-of-way, and as hereinafter specified:
         (a)   All open channels located within a subdivision or located on
public property or easements to the subdivision and other open channels within
150 feet of the subdivision, in the E-R Estate Residential District, shall be
improved as follows:
            1.   Maximum slopes shall be six horizontal to one vertical.
            2.   A six inch diameter underdrain shall be constructed with a
minimum cover of six inches along the flowline of all open channels.
            3.   An easement for drainage, access and municipal utilities,
shall be provided along the open channel with a width adequate to include the
area covered by the runoff from a 1% annual probability (100-year) storm.
         (b)   All open channels located within a subdivision classified in the
R-1 Single Family Dwelling District shall be improved as follows:
            1.   Maximum slopes shall be four horizontal to one vertical.
            2.   Minimum ditch gradient shall be 0.50%.
            3.   Minimum ditch depth shall be 24 inches below the adjacent
street pavement centerline.
   (E)   City of Lockport standard drawings. Storm sewer system structures
shall meet the requirements shown on the City of Lockport standard drawings.

aggregate exceeds 25,000 square feet.
      (4)   Roadway developments in rights-of-way under the ownership or
control of a unit of local government when the contiguous area of new roadway
construction (excluding previously paved areas) exceeds two acres.
      (5)   Exemptions from site runoff storage requirements (stormwater
detention) shall be granted under the circumstances listed in Article 200.3 of
the Will County Stormwater Management Ordinance, latest edition.
   (B)   Drainage plan submittal requirements. 
      Each applicant shall submit the following information, depending on
development size, to ensure that the provisions of this ordinance are met. The
submittal shall include sufficient information to evaluate the environmental
characteristics of the property, the potential adverse impacts of the
development on water resources both on-site and downstream, and the
effectiveness of the proposed drainage plan in managing stormwater runoff. The
applicant shall certify on the drawings that all clearing, grading, drainage,
and construction shall be accomplished in strict conformance with the drainage
plan. The following information shall be submitted for both existing and
proposed property conditions.
      Properties smaller than ten acres shall be required to submit only the
basic drainage plan. Properties which are ten acres or larger shall comply with
the submittal requirements of both the basic drainage plan and the advanced
drainage plan.
      (1)   Basic drainage plan shall include:
         (a)   Topographic map. A topographic survey of the property, with one-
foot elevation contours under existing and proposed conditions, including areas
upstream and downstream of the subdivision or development, necessary to
determine off-site impacts of the proposed drainage plan. The map datum shall
be NAVD 88, correlated to a FEMA reference mark by differential leveling or
GPS.
         (b)   Drainage system. Mapping and descriptions, where relevant, of
existing and proposed drainage system features of the property and immediate
vicinity including:
            1.   The banks and centerline of streams and channels;
            2.   Shoreline of lakes, ponds, and detention basins;
            3.   Farm drains and tiles;
            4.    Sub-watershed boundaries within the property;
            5.   Watershed soils classifications;
            6.   The property's location within the larger watershed;
            7.   Location, size and slope of stormwater conduits and drainage
swales;
            8.   Sanitary or combined sewers;
            9.    Depressional storage areas;
            10.    Delineation of upstream and downstream drainage features and
watersheds which might be affected by the development;
            11.    Stormwater detention facilities;
            12.   Roads and streets and associated stormwater inlets;
            13.   Base flood elevation, regulatory floodway, and base
floodplain limit delineation based on topography and the FEMA Flood Insurance

            2.   Advanced drainage plan. In addition to the requirements for
the basic drainage plan, the advanced drainage plan shall also include:
               A.    Elevations and maps of 100-year flooding;
               B.    Cross-section data for open channel flow paths and
designated overland flow paths;
               C.    Direction of overland stormwater runoff;
               D.   Flow rates and velocities at representative points in the
drainage system; and
               E.   A statement by the design engineer of the proposed drainage
system's adequacy for safely handling runoff from storm events greater than the
1% annual probability (100-year) design storm.
               F.   The city reserves the right to request that the IDNR-OWR
review all drainage plan submittals.
   (C)   Minimizing runoff volumes and runoff rates. In the selection of a
drainage plan for a development, the applicant shall evaluate and implement,
where practicable, site design features which minimize the increase in runoff
volumes and rates from the site. The applicant's drainage plan submittal shall
include evaluations of site design features which are consistent with the
following hierarchy:
      (1)   Minimize impervious surfaces on the property, consistent with the
needs of the project;
      (2)   Attenuate flows by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions and preserve existing natural stream channels;
      (3)   Infiltrate runoff on-site;
      (4)   Provide stormwater retention structures;
      (5)   Provide stormwater detention structures; and
      (6)   Construct storm sewers. In developments where the city requires the
installation of curb and gutter, storm sewers are preferred. The city may also
modify the above hierarchy as required based on an evaluation of the site
conditions.
   (D)   Water quality and alternate uses. The drainage system shall be
designed to minimize adverse water quality impacts downstream and on the
property itself. Detention basins shall incorporate design features to capture
stormwater runoff pollutants. In particular, designers shall give preference to
wet bottom and wetland designs in locations adjacent or near existing wetlands
or in other areas where they are suitable and acceptable to the city and all
flows from the development shall be routed through the basin (i.e., low flows
shall not be bypassed). Dry basins with low flow bypasses may be preferred in
certain developments to enhance multiple uses where suitable and acceptable to
the city. Retention and infiltration of stormwater shall be promoted throughout
the property's drainage system to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and to
reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants.
      The drainage system shall incorporate multiple uses where practicable.
Uses considered compatible with stormwater management include open space,
aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (boating, trails, playing fields),
wetlands and water quality mitigation. The applicant shall avoid using portions
of the property exclusively for stormwater management wherever practicable.
   (E)   Design criteria, standards and methods. Site runoff storage facilities
(stormwater detention basins) shall be designed and constructed in accordance
with Section 203 of the Will County Stormwater Management Ordinance, latest
edition, and as specified herein.
      (1)   Detention release rates.
         If a release rate is not specified in an adopted watershed plan, and
if a development is not exempted from storage requirements, then sufficient
flood storage shall be provided so that the maximum site discharge will not
exceed 0.15 cfs per acre of development for the one percent annual probability
(100-year) storm; and will not exceed 0.04 cfs per acre of development for the
fifty percent annual probability (two-year) storm.
         For sites where the undeveloped release rate is less than the maximum
release rate described above, the developed release rate and corresponding site
runoff storage volume shall be based on the existing undeveloped release rate
for the development.
      (2)   Detention basin outlet design. All hydrologic and hydraulic
computations shall utilize appropriate assumptions for downstream water surface
elevations, from low flow through the base flood, considering the likelihood of
concurrent flood events.
      (3)   Detention storage requirements. The minimum site runoff storage
volume to be provided in a detention basin shall be based on the runoff from
the 100-year, critical duration event. The design of all detention basins shall
be by Runoff Hydrograph Methods described in Section
153.50.040(E)(5); or where development sites are less than five acres, the unit
area site runoff storage nomograph from the "Investigation of Hydrologic Design
Methods for Urban Development in Northeastern Illinois," dated December 1991
and prepared by the Northeastern Illinois Plan and Zoning Commission (now known
as CMAP) may be used in lieu of modeling.
      (4)   Drainage system design and evaluation. The following criteria shall
be used in evaluating and designing the drainage system. The underlying
objective is to provide capacity to pass the 10% annual probability (ten-year)
peak flow in the minor drainage system, and to provide an overland flow path
for the one percent annual probability (100-year) peak flow.
         (a)   Design methodologies. Major and minor conveyance systems for
areas up to ten acres may be designed using the rational formula. The rational
formula may also be used in sizing the minor drainage system for larger sites.
Runoff Hydrograph methods as described in §
153.50.040(E)(5) must be used for major drainage system design for all systems
with greater than ten acres of drainage area. All drainage system design shall
be in accordance with Part 708 Rules.
         (b)   Positive drainage. Whenever practicable, all areas of the
property shall be provided an overland flow path that will pass the peak 100-
year flow at a stage at least one foot below the lowest foundation grade in the
vicinity of the flow path. Overland flow paths designed to handle flows in
excess of the minor drainage system capacity shall be provided in drainage
easements, which shall not be obstructed. Street ponding and flow depths shall
not exceed six (6) inches at the crown. For flow over a new roadway or parallel
to a new roadway, the product of the flow depth (in feet) and velocity (in feet
per second) shall not exceed four for the base flood condition.
      (5)   Methods for generating runoff hydrographs. Runoff hydrographs for
detention pond design shall be developed using event hydrograph routing
methods. Acceptable and preferred programs are TR-20 and HEC-HMS. If an
existing regulatory model uses HEC-1, then HEC-1 may be used for the proposed
facility. Continuous simulation models are only acceptable for very complex
projects and their use must be approved by the Director of Public Works and
Engineering or authorized designee. No other models, including the modified
rational method, are acceptable.
         Unless a continuous simulation model is used, all design rainfall
events shall be based on the requirements of the Will County Stormwater
Ordinance, latest edition, or Illinois State Water Survey Bulletin 75,
whichever is most recent. A critical duration analysis for the design storm of
one, two, three, six, 12, 18, 24 and 48 hours duration shall be prepared in
accordance with generally accepted engineering principles. The first quartile
Huff rainfall distribution shall be used for storms with durations of one, two
or three hours. The second quartile Huff rainfall distribution shall be used
for storms with durations of six or 12 hours. The third quartile Huff rainfall
distribution shall be used for storms with durations of 18, 24 or 48 hours.
Computations of runoff hydrographs which do not rely on a continuous accounting
of antecedent moisture conditions shall assume an antecedent moisture condition
of two.
      (6)   Wet-bottom detention basin design. Wet detention basins shall be
designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically
pleasing, and where practicable, to be available for recreational use.
Permanent ponds shall be designed in accordance with the City of Lockport
standard drawings. Ponds shall have a two-foot horizontal to one-foot vertical
side slope from a point one and one-half feet above normal water level, down to
a point three feet below normal water level. This two to one sloped area shall
be blanketed with geotechnical fabric to prevent weeds. The fabric shall then
be covered with a layer of natural stones, having a minimum diameter of
eighteen inches. The surface of the stones on the two to one slope shall be
arranged in such a manner so as to enable a person to climb out of the pond
over the stones.
         The area between the top of the two to one slope and the high water
level shall be protected by sodding in order to prevent soil erosion. The first
twelve feet of the sodded area at the top of the two to one slope shall be
sloped at 2% towards the pond. At the toe of the two to one slope, a twelve
foot wide safety ledge sloped toward the shore at 4% shall be provided. Beyond
the safety ledge, the pond bottom shall slope at two horizontal to one vertical
down to the pond bottom elevation.
         Points of inflow to the ponds shall be accessible to construction
equipment for dredging as necessary. If retention facilities are designated for
recreational purposes, appropriate consideration shall be reflected in the
design for maintenance of fish life, boating, and safety.
         (a)   Aeration. All wet-bottom ponds shall be provided with aeration
equipment.
         (b)   Wet-bottom detention basin depth. Wet basins shall be at least
three feet deep, excluding nearshore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat
is to be provided, they shall be at least ten feet deep over 25% of the bottom
area to prevent winter freeze-out.
         (c)   Permanent pool volume. The permanent pool volume in a wet-bottom
detention basin at normal water level (NWL) shall be equal to the runoff volume
from its watershed for the two-year event.
         (d)   Inlet and outlet orientation. The distance between detention
pond inlet and outlet pipes shall be as large as practicable, but shall be at
least 50 feet.
         (e)   Overflow weirs. Detention basins shall provide at least twelve
inches of freeboard between the design High Water level (HWL) and the top of
berm. Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency overflow weir at or
above the HWL near the outlet pipe. The weir shall be designed to have the
capacity to convey a flow of one cfs per tributary acre with a flow depth no
greater than six inches, and shall be armored from the overflow point down to
the outside toe of slope to prevent soil erosion.
      (7)   Dry-bottom detention basin design. In addition to the other
requirements of this ordinance, dry-bottom basins shall be designed to remove
stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and to be
available for multiple uses wherever practicable.
         (a)   Dry-bottom detention basin design. In order to prevent soil
erosion and invasive weeds, dry-bottom detention basins shall be landscaped,
including the establishment of a ground cover over all unpaved areas, through
sodding or other means which result in a quality of ground cover comparable to
that obtained through sodding. Dry-bottom detention facilities shall be usable
as active recreational areas during dry weather conditions. Dry-bottom
detention facilities shall be designed so that the bottom has a slope of at
least 2%. The bottom of the facility shall be provided with an underdrain
(minimum six-inch diameter perforated PVC drain tile) covered on all sides with
a minimum of six inches of crushed stone conforming to IDOT Gradation CA-7.
Dry-bottom detention facilities shall have side slopes not steeper than four
feet horizontal to one foot vertical.
         (b)   Overflow weirs. Detention basins shall provide at least 12
inches of freeboard between the design high water level (HWL) and the top of
berm. Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency overflow weir at or
above the HWL near the outlet pipe. The weir shall be designed to have the
capacity to convey a flow of one cfs per tributary acre with a flow depth no
greater than six inches, and shall be armored from the overflow point down to
the outside toe of slope to prevent soil erosion.
         (c)   Velocity dissipation. Velocity dissipation measures shall be
incorporated into dry-bottom basin designs to minimize soil erosion at inlets
and outlets and to minimize the resuspension of pollutants.
         (d)   Stilling/sedimentation basins. A stilling/sedimentation basin
shall be constructed at each major inlet to a wetland-bottom or dry-bottom
basin. The volume of the basins shall be at least 500 cubic feet per acre of
impervious surface in the tributary watershed. Side slopes of the sedimentation
basins shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical and basin
depths should be at least three feet to minimize resuspension of accumulated
sediment.
      (8)   Minimum detention pond outlet size. Where a single pipe outlet or
orifice plate is to be used to control discharge, the minimum desirable
diameter is four inches. If this minimum orifice size permits release rates
greater than those allowed, and regional detention is not a practical
alternative, outlet structures resistant to clogging such as perforated risers
or flow control orifices shall be used to protect the smaller restrictor.
      (9)   Detention in flood plains. The placement of stormwater detention
facilities in the regulatory flood plain is strongly discouraged due to
questions regarding their operation during major floods. Site runoff storage
facilities in the flood plain shall meet all of the requirements of Sections
203.7 and 203.8 of the Will County Stormwater Management Ordinance, latest
edition.
         The placement of a detention basin in a flood plain shall require
compensatory storage for 1.5 times the volume below the base flood elevation
occupied by the detention basin, including any berms. All floodplain storage
lost below the ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the ten-year
flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood
elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All
compensatory storage excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse.
         Detention volume provided by enlarging existing regulatory flood plain
storage without providing a structure controlling discharge (on-stream
detention) will be allowed only as a variance, requiring a public hearing. The
variance will be considered only after applicant demonstrates that flood
damages are not increased and the development will not increase flood flows for
both the two-year and 100-year floods on the stream with the site fully
developed.
         City approval of the variance request will be contingent on the
applicant showing by detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the
proposed design will provide a net watershed benefit not otherwise realized by
strict application of the above design standards.
      (10)   Protection of wetlands and depressional storage areas. Wetlands
and other depressional storage areas shall be protected from damaging
modifications and adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated
with land developments. In addition to the other requirements of this chapter,
the following requirements shall be met for all developments whose drainage
flows into wetlands and depressional storage areas.
         (a)   Army Corps of Engineers coordination. Any applicant proposing a
subdivision or development which will impact an existing wetland or waters of
the U.S. shall obtain a permit or a letter of no objection from the Army Corps
of Engineers.
         (b)   Detention in wetlands and depressional storage areas. Existing
wetlands shall not be modified for the purposes of stormwater detention unless
it is demonstrated that the existing wetland is low in quality and the proposed
modifications will maintain or improve its habitat and ability to perform
beneficial functions. Existing depressional storage and release rate
characteristics of wetlands and other depressional storage areas shall be
maintained and the volume of detention storage provided to meet the
requirements of this section shall be in addition to this existing storage.
         (c)   Sediment control. The existing wetland shall be protected during
construction by appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures and
shall not be filled. All runoff from the development shall be routed through a
preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture the two-year, 24-
hour event and hold it for at least 24 hours, before being discharged to the
wetland. The sedimentation basin shall be constructed before site grading
commences. In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined in §
153.50.040(C) shall be utilized to minimize runoff volumes and rates being
discharged to the wetland.
         (d)   Alteration of drainage patterns. Site drainage patterns shall
not be altered to substantially decrease or increase the existing area
tributary to the wetland.
         (e)   Vegetated buffer strip. A buffer strip of at least 75 feet in
width, vegetated with plant species native to Illinois, shall be maintained or
restored around the periphery of the wetland.
      (11)   Ponding on streets and parking lots.
         (a)   Streets. If streets are to be used as part of the minor or major
drainage system, ponding depths shall not exceed six inches on the pavement at
the crown and shall not remain flooded for more than eight hours for any event
less than or equal to the 100-year critical duration event.
         (b)   Parking lots. The maximum stormwater ponding depth in any
parking area shall not exceed nine inches, and the parking lot shall not remain
flooded for more than eight hours for any event less than or equal to the 100-
year critical duration event.
      (12)   Infiltration best management practices.
         To effectively reduce runoff volumes, infiltration practices including
basins, trenches, and porous pavement should be located on soils in Hydrologic
Soil Groups "A" or "B" as designated by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service.
Infiltration basins and trenches designed to recharge groundwater shall not be
located within seventy-five feet of a water supply well or a building
foundation. A sediment settling basin shall be provided to remove coarse
sediment from stormwater flows before they reach infiltration basins or
trenches. Stormwater shall not be allowed to stand more than 72 hours over
eighty percent of a dry basin's bottom area for the maximum design event to be
ex-filtrated. The bottom of infiltration facilities shall be a minimum of four
feet above seasonally high groundwater and/or bedrock.
         To effectively filter stormwater pollutants and promote infiltration
of runoff, sites should be designed to maximize the use of vegetated filter
strips and swales. Wherever practicable, runoff from impervious surfaces shall
be directed onto filter strips and swales before being routed to a storm sewer
or detention basin.
      (13)   Safety considerations. The drainage system components, especially
all detention basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of children and
adults coming in contact with the system during runoff events.
         (a)   Side slopes. The side slopes of all detention basins at the HWL
shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the basin and
for stability and ease of maintenance.
         (b)   Safety ledge. All wet detention basins shall have a flat safety
ledge at least 12 feet in width three feet below the normal water level,
sloping towards the shore at a 4% gradient.
         (c)   Velocity. Velocities throughout the surface drainage system
shall be controlled to safe levels taking into consideration flow rates and
depths of flow.
         (d)   Overflow structures. All stormwater detention basins shall be
provided with an overflow structure capable of safely passing excess flows at a
stage at least one foot below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of
the detention basin. The design flow rate of the overflow structure shall be
equivalent to one cfs per acre of all tributary areas.
      (14)   Maintenance considerations. The stormwater drainage system shall
be designed to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turf grass side slopes
shall be designed to allow mowing equipment to easily negotiate the grade. Pre-
sedimentation basins shall be included where feasible, for localizing sediment
deposition and removal. Access for heavy maintenance equipment shall be
provided.
   (F)   Accommodating runoff from upstream tributary areas.
      (1)   Upstream areas not meeting storage requirements. When there are
areas not meeting the storage and release rate requirements of this chapter
that are tributary to the applicant's property, regionalized stormwater
detention on the applicant's property shall be considered by the applicant and
the city. The following steps shall be followed:
         (a)   The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his
property alone.
         (b)   Areas tributary to the applicant's property that do not meet the
storage and release rate requirements of this ordinance shall be identified.
         (c)   Using the off-site areas determined above plus the applicant's
property area, total storage needed for the combined properties shall be
computed. Allowable release rates shall be computed using the combined property
areas. If off-site tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable fully-
developed land cover, based on local zoning, shall be assumed for the purposes
of computing storage requirements.
         (d)   Once the necessary combined storage is computed, the city may
choose to require oversizing the applicant's detention basin to accommodate the
regional flows or minimize downstream impacts. Additional costs shall be
subject to recapture by the applicant in accordance with §
153.50.030. If the applicant is the owner of portions of upstream areas,
recapture will not be allowed for his share of the upstream area. The
applicant's responsibility will be limited to the storage for his property as
computed in division (a) above plus any upstream property owned by the
applicant. If regional storage is selected by the city, then the design
produced in division (c) above shall be implemented. If regional storage is not
selected by the city, the applicant shall bypass all tributary area flows
around the applicant's basin, in pipe or open channel, whenever practicable. If
the applicant must route upstream flows through his basin, the applicant must
demonstrate that sufficient additional storage volume has been added for
conveyance through the basin so that the maximum release rate from the facility
does not exceed the allowable release rate for the site plus the bypass flow.
      (2)   Upstream areas meeting storage requirements. When there are areas
which meet the storage and release rate requirements of this ordinance,
tributary to the applicant's property, the upstream flows shall be bypassed
around the applicant's detention basin, or be routed through the applicant's
detention basin if this is the only practicable alternative. Storage needed for
the applicant's property shall still be computed. However, if the city decides
to route tributary area flows through an applicant's basin, the final design
stormwater release rates shall be based on the combined total of the
applicant's property plus the tributary areas. Supporting calculations must
demonstrate that at no time will the runoff rate from the applicant's property
exceed the allowable release rate for his/her property alone.
   (G)   Construction staging of storage facilities. Where detention,
retention, or depressional storage areas are to be used as part of the drainage
system for a property, they shall be constructed as the first element of the
initial site grading. Any eroded sediment captured in these facilities shall be
removed by the applicant before project completion in order to maintain the
design volume of the facilities. Pre-sedimentation basins shall be included,
where feasible, for localizing sediment deposition and removal. Access for
heavy equipment shall be provided. Stormwater facilities shall be functional
prior to the issuance of building permits.
   (H)   Fee in lieu of detention. In instances where regional benefits and
economics of scale can be achieved, it will be permissible for adjacent
properties to utilize a common regional detention basin. The city shall have
the option to require paying a fee calculated based on the documented costs for
each acre foot of detention required so that the City of Lockport can build
regional facilities or the applicants can jointly build the necessary
facilities themselves.
   (I)   Maintenance responsibilities. Maintenance of stormwater drainage
facilities located on private property shall be the responsibility of the owner
of the property, or a designated Home Owners Association (HOA). Before a
building permit is obtained from the City of Lockport, the applicant shall
execute a maintenance agreement with the City of Lockport guaranteeing that the
applicant and all future owners of the property will maintain the portions of
the stormwater management system located on private property. The maintenance
agreement shall also specifically authorize representatives of the city to
enter onto the property for the purposes of inspections and maintenance of the
stormwater management system. Such agreement shall be recorded with the Will
County Recorder of Deeds. The maintenance agreement shall include a schedule
for regular maintenance of each aspect of the property's stormwater drainage
system and shall provide for access to the system for inspection by authorized
personnel of the City of Lockport. The maintenance agreement shall also
stipulate that if the city notifies the property owner or HOA in writing of
maintenance problems which require correction, the property owner or HOA shall
make such corrections within 30 (thirty) calendar days of such notification. If
the corrections are not made within this time period, the city may have the
necessary work completed and assess the cost of such work to the property owner
or HOA.
      The City of Lockport has the option of requiring a bond to be filed by
the property owner or HOA for maintenance of the stormwater management system.
   (J)   Construction supervision requirements.
      (1)   Registered professional engineers. The applicant shall provide an
Illinois registered professional engineer, or person working under his direct
control and authority, to provide construction stake out and construction
observation periodically as required when work is being performed. The
applicant's registered professional engineer shall provide weekly construction
progress reports to the Director of Public Works and Engineering or authorized
designee, if requested.
      (2)   Professional landscape architect or environmental scientist/
ecologist. The applicant shall provide a professional landscape architect or
environmental scientist/ecologist, or persons working under their direct
control and authority, to provide construction stake out and construction
observation periodically as required when landscaping work is being performed.
The applicant's professional landscape architect or environmental scientist/
ecologist shall provide detailed weekly reports to the Director of Public Works
and Engineering or authorized designee, if requested.
   (K)   Conflicts. In the event that there is a conflict in the requirements
of this section and other sections of the development code, the most
restrictive interpretation shall prevail.
(Ord. 18-008, passed 2-7-18)
§ 153.50.045 BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   All developments, including subdivisions and planned unit developments,
whether public or private, within the area of the city's jurisdiction as
identified on the official map, shall incorporate permanent best management
practices for water quality, to treat stormwater runoff for pollutants of
concern, in accordance with the United States Clean Water Act.
(Ord. 18-008, passed 2-7-18)
§ 153.50.050 SANITARY SEWER SYSTEMS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   All developments, including subdivisions and planned unit
developments, whether public or private, within the area of the city's
jurisdiction as identified on the official map, shall include provisions for
the construction of sanitary sewers and appurtenances designed in accordance
with this chapter.
      (2)   All sanitary sewer improvements shall be installed in accordance
with the “Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in
Illinois,” latest edition, and city details unless otherwise modified in this
section.
      (3)   All developments including subdivisions and planned unit
developments, whether public or private, within the area of the city's
jurisdiction, as identified on the official map shall obtain sewage treatment
services by connection to a mechanical wastewater treatment plant operated in
accordance with a valid NPDES permit issued by the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency, except in single-family subdivisions with lot sizes of
30,000 sq. ft. or more.
   (B)   Service areas. All sanitary sewers shall be designed to accommodate an
ultimate service area as defined by the Director of Public Works and
Engineering or authorized designee. If extending the ultimate service area
beyond the limits of the proposed subdivision results in additional
construction cost in conjunction with the subdivision, a written agreement may
be made with the corporate authorities for the recapture by the owner or
developer of the additional cost when future system extensions are made.
Recapture payments will be made to the owner or developer only after the person
benefiting from the extended service area has made payment to the city.
   (C)   System extensions. The locations of proposed extensions to the
existing sanitary sewer system shall be to the limits of the developed
property.
   (D)   Design standards.
      (1)   Design flows.
         (a)   Design flows for residential subdivisions or developments,
single and multiple family, shall be based upon full development of the service
area with the population served, estimated as follows:
 
Type of Dwelling Unit Number of Persons
Studio                1
1 Bedroom             2

tested in accordance with this chapter. The Contractor shall coordinate with
city Water Department staff to fill and flush the new water main. Only City
Water Department staff is authorized to operate existing water valves.
      (2)   All newly laid pipe shall be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure of
150 pounds per square inch. Duration of each pressure test shall be for a
period of not less than two hours. Each valved section of pipe shall be filled
with water and the specified test pressure shall be applied by means of a pump
connected to the pipe.
      (3)   Before applying the specified test pressure, all air shall be
expelled from the pipe. All leaks shall be repaired until tight. Any cracked or
defective pipes, fittings, valves, or hydrants discovered in consequence of
this pressure test shall be removed and replaced and the test repeated until
satisfactory results are obtained.
      (4)   All testing shall be done after the installation of service lines.
Suitable means shall be provided for determining the quantity of water lost by
leakage under the specified test pressure. Leakage is defined as the quantity
of water required to be supplied to the newly laid pipe necessary to maintain
the specified test pressure. Allowable leakage shall not be greater than that
computed as follows:
      L = (N)(D)(P)/7,400
   Where:
   L = Allowable leakage in gallons per hour
   N = Number of joints in the pipeline being tested
   D = Nominal diameter of the pipe in inches
   P = Average test pressure during the test in pounds per square inch
   (I)   Preliminary flushing, disinfection, and testing. Refer to the City of
Lockport Standard Detail 60-7.
   (J)   All water valves shall be opened and closed as part of the final

§ 153.50.125 LANDSCAPING AND TREE PRESERVATION.
   (A)   Purpose. This section creates uniform landscape, screening and tree
preservation standards for development of property in Lockport to ensure that
the city remains attractive, safe and comfortable. These landscape regulations
are established to:
      (1)   Promote, protect and preserve the general health and safety of
residents, and support aesthetic compatibility among land uses within the city;
      (2)   Reduce soil erosion and stormwater runoff, provide oxygen
regeneration to enhance air quality, and minimize the effects of urban heat
islands;
      (3)   Minimize any harmful effects of noise, dust, debris, motor exhaust,
headlight glare, artificial light intrusions, objectionable sights or
activities, or similar adverse impacts conducted or created by nearby land use;
      (4)   Safeguard the environmental quality and aesthetic character of
Lockport by limiting removal and ensuring replacement of trees;
      (5)   Preserve existing vegetation and topographical features by limiting
unnecessary clearing and modification of land, encouraging retention of
existing mature trees, and requiring replacement of indigenous trees with
approved species; and
      (6)   Encourage energy efficiency in the city.
   (B)   Authority. The City Planner is authorized to act on behalf of the
Director of Public Works and Engineering in exercising authority to require
and/or grant permission for planting and maintaining trees and other
landscaping on public streets and municipal and other properties, including
private property, when such trees and landscaping are installed or maintained
pursuant to this section.
   (C)   Tree removal permit required. Unless otherwise permitted by the terms
of this section, no developer of property or property to be annexed that is
greater than or equal to three acres in size, shall, directly or indirectly,
cut down, destroy, remove, move, destroy through damaging or authorize cutting
down, destroying, removing, moving or damaging, any tree of four inches or more
in diameter at breast height (DBH), without first obtaining a permit as herein
provided. No city official shall issue a permit in violation of the
requirements of this section. Permits for removal, relocation or replacement of
trees covered herein shall be obtained by submitting an application on a form
prescribed by the Public Works Department pursuant to the standards set forth
herein.
   (D)   Heritage trees. Some species of trees are native to the area, are
sound, strong species, and have existed naturally for decades or centuries. The
city recognizes that these trees are a key component to its heritage, and
therefore they will bear a higher level of preservation requirement.
      (1)   The following trees are classified as the city’s heritage trees:
         Oaks         20" or greater in DBH
         Hickories      20" or greater in DBH
         Hackberries      20" or greater in DBH
         Ironwoods      10" or greater in DBH
         Walnuts      20" or greater in DBH
         All of the above must be determined to be in healthy condition
according to the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) standards.
      (2)   Every practicable measure shall be undertaken in attempting to
preserve heritage trees in the planning phase. Alternatives to development that
may threaten these trees shall be explored in detail. Should the merits of
development outweigh the benefits of preservation; an appeal may be made to the
corporate authorities. The corporate authorities shall have discretion
regarding preservation of specific trees, and may request, utilize and review
any materials, reports, consultant opinions, and the like, when making their
decision. Any costs incurred by the city in such investigation shall be paid by
the applicant.
      (3)   A heritage tree may be removed without approval of the corporate
authorities if a certified arborist provides an ISA report stating the tree is
in poor condition, i.e., that it is declining significantly in health and/or
structure. In such cases, a penalty will not be incurred for removal, but tree
replacement as identified herein will be required.
   (E)   Tree preservation plan.
      (1)   Maximize tree preservation. The developer shall make every effort
to save all healthy trees where feasible and practical.
      (2)   Tree preservation plan required. The developer of any lot equal to
or greater than three acres in size shall submit to the city a survey, prepared
by a certified arborist, of all trees four inches or greater in diameter at
breast high (DBH). The tree survey shall include notations of intent to
preserve trees so identified and the preservation techniques to be implemented.
         (a)   A tree preservation plan shall be submitted as part of the
preliminary plan. The tree preservation plan shall include all trees plotted to
scale on a plat of survey, with the size and species identified. The plan shall
also include accurate placement of buildings, easements, utilities,
infrastructure wetlands and temporary storage locations in relation to existing
trees. Any changes from the concept plan must be expressed clearly in writing.
         (b)   All proposed tree removals shall be clearly identified on the
plan with “Xs” and clearly identified at the project site with ribbons or
paint.
         (c)   A list of all trees four inches in DBH or greater, including
size, species, and identification of heritage trees, shall be provided by the
applicant. Additionally, a listing of all trees proposed for removal shall be
submitted on a separate sheet than the plat of survey. Information shall
include species, size, reason for removal, and a reference back to the mapped
location for ease of review. Heritage trees shall be labeled as such. Tree
protection areas shall be clearly shown on the plan.
         (d)   A grading plan shall be submitted showing existing trees that
are proposed to be removed and those that are proposed to be saved.
         (e)   The developer’s proposed methodology for saving or removing
existing trees shall be reviewed by the City Planner. If, in the opinion of the
City Planner, the developer has not provided for necessary precautions in
preserving the existing trees, it will be recommended by the City Planner that
the preliminary plan approval not be granted until such time as the developer
satisfactorily amends their plan for the preservation of existing trees. If the
developer and the City Planner cannot agree on a satisfactory plan, the
developer can appeal the decision of the City Planner to the Plan and Zoning
Commission (PZC).
         (f)   A tree preservation plan shall also be submitted as part of the
final development plan review process. In addition to the previous
requirements, the tree preservation details shall be clearly shown, including
all preservation requirements as stated in this section. Proposed replacement
trees shall be indicated on the final landscape plan.
      (3)   Trees exempt from replacement requirements:
         (a)   Dead, structurally unsound, fatally diseased or declining trees;
         (b)   Ailanthus, buckthorn, willows and box elder trees.
   (F)   Tree replacement.
      (1)   Heritage tree replacement. Heritage tree removal replacement
requirements will require inch-for-inch replacement. For every DBH inch of a
heritage tree that is removed, an equal number of caliper inches is required in
new tree planting. However, if a certified arborist agrees that the heritage
tree is in poor health, the certified arborist shall calculate the value of the
heritage tree, as determined by the “Guide for Establishing Values of Trees and
Other Plants,” by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA). The number
of replacement caliper inches then required will be calculated using a unit
value of one inch diameter representing $150. For example, a tree valued at
$5,000 would require 33.3 inches of tree replacement. Replacement options may
include eleven three-inch caliper trees or eight four-inch caliper trees.
      (2)   Other tree replacement. Where healthy trees with a DBH of six
inches or greater are intended to be removed, are unintentionally removed, or
damaged during construction, they shall be replaced as follows:
         (a)   Trees designated for removal. If trees are designated for
removal on the tree preservation and removal plan or landscape plan, they shall
be replaced with new trees in accordance with the following schedule.
 
Size of Tree         Number of Replacement Trees
To Be Removed*
30 inches or greater 10
13-29 inches         8
8-12 inches          6
6-7 inches           4
*Size refers to the tree diameter measured at breast height (DBH).
 
         (b)   Trees designated for preservation. If trees designated for
preservation are destroyed, damaged or removed during the construction process,
they shall be replaced with new trees in accordance with the following
schedule.
 
Size of Tree         Number of Replacement Trees
To Be Removed*
30 inches or greater 20
13-29 inches         16
8-12 inches          12
6-7 inches           8
*Size refers to the tree diameter measured at breast height (DBH).
 
         (c)   Subject to a fine. For each tree designated for preservation
that is destroyed, damaged or removed, the permit applicant shall be subject to
a fine as specified in §
153.50.125(G)(3).
         (d)   Prohibited or nuisance trees. When a tree designated for removal
is one of the species on the list of prohibited trees as maintained by the
city, each such tree shall be replaced with one new tree (rather than the
number of additional trees required in the above tables).
         (e)   Replacement tree requirements.
            1.   All replacement shade trees shall have a minimum caliper of
three inches.
            2.   All replacement coniferous trees shall have a minimum height
of six feet. If a replacement coniferous tree has a height of ten feet or more,
it shall count as two replacement trees.
            3.    Replacement trees may not include any tree on the list of
prohibited trees in the appendices.
            4.   A variety of tree species are encouraged to promote a diverse
tree canopy and to minimize the impact from disease and infestation. Thus, when
20 or more replacement trees are required, no more than 20% of the replacement
trees shall be of one species type.
         (f)   Should the City Planner determine that full replacement would
result in unreasonable crowding upon the lot, the permittee shall be required
to offset the environmental loss by paying a loss fee to the city. The loss fee
will be based upon $150 per caliper inch of loss, based upon the formula noted
above. This loss fee will account for the proposed environmental losses and
shall be used to provide reforestation in other areas of the city. This fee
shall be paid prior to the issuance of a development permit.
      (3)   Where trees are to be saved, provision shall be made for erection
of appropriate, temporary, protective fencing, such as snow fence or chain-link
fence, at the periphery of the dripline to keep construction from damaging or
killing the tree from physical trunk and branch damage, or compacting soil and
damaging shallow feeder roots. The developer shall be responsible for the
supply, erection and maintenance of temporary fencing, in accordance with the
conditions of the building permit, around the tree preservation areas.
         (a)   The fencing shall be placed at the dripline for protection of
the roots, trunk and branches.

within the drip zone of the tree(s) (trenching shall not be allowed within the
drip zone).
         (g)    Attachments, signs, fences or wires, other than that approved
for bracing, guying or wrapping, shall not be allowed to be attached to trees
during the construction period.
         (h)   To improve the survival rate of trees, root pruning and/or
thinning should be performed in accordance with the latest edition of the
American National Standards Institute for Tree, Shrub and Other Wood Plant
Management - Standard Practices Pruning (ANSI A300 part 1). Trees to be pruned
must also be indicated on the plan or on an accompanying sheet, and approved by
the Director of Public Works and Engineering or his or her representative.
         (i)   No soil shall be removed or added within the root zone/dripline
of any tree that is to remain.

cover the cost of required follow-up inspections of the replacement tree
installations and subsequent site reviews.
         (c)   Violations in this code may result in inspections by the city
arborist or a consulting certified arborist. All related costs of a consulting
certified arborist will be charged back to the applicant as stated in §
153.70.070. The applicant shall also pay for the arborist’s subsequent or
follow-up inspection fees.
         (d)   Trees removed, destroyed or damaged without a tree removal
permit must be replaced with trees whose diameter equals the diameter of the
trees affected, regardless of condition or species.
         (e)   Additional bonds will be collected at the time of violation at
$150 per inch of the tree's DBH for required replacement trees, until the trees
have been installed and have thrived for at least two years. Bonds will be
returned upon a satisfactory review after the two-year guarantee period.
         (f)   Each subsequent act in violation of this section by the same
person or entity shall result in a 50% increase in fines over the previous fine
levy.
      (4)   Violation of protected trees. Violation of the tree protection plan
and required tree preservation techniques will result in a $100-per-tree-per-
day fine. Subsequent violations will result in the stoppage of all work until
corrections have been made to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works
and Engineering, or authorized designee or his or her representatives.
         (a)   Additional fees will be incurred at the time of violation to
cover the cost of required follow-up inspections of the replacement tree
installations and subsequent site reviews.
         (b)   Violations of this code may result in inspections by the city
consulting, certified arborist. All related costs will be charged back to the
applicant as stated in §
153.70.070. The applicant shall also pay for the arborist’s subsequent or
follow-up inspection fees.

   (N)   Landscape regulations for single-family attached dwellings, multi-
family buildings and any nonresidential building.
      (1)   Scope of regulations. The provisions of this section shall apply to
developments occurring after the effective date of this section and any
development that has not yet received preliminary or final site development
plan approval.
         (a)   With the construction of single-family attached dwellings(s),
new multi-family building(s), any other nonresidential building (excluding
accessory buildings) or the construction of a parking lot of more than ten
vehicles.
         (b)   If an existing parking lot serving the uses in division (N)(1)
(a) is expanded by more than ten spaces, the regulations would apply to the
area only being expanded, unless the expansion is 100% or more than the size of
the existing lot, then the entire lot shall comply with the regulations.
         (c)   For any conforming or nonconforming building or use in existence
on the effective date of this section that is subsequently damaged or destroyed
by fire, collapse, explosion or other cause, and that is reconstructed,
reestablished or repaired at a cost that exceeds 75% of the value of the
building or use, landscaping shall be provided as required by this section.
(See division (O) for special provisions in the C-4 Downtown Commercial
District.)
      (2)   Landscape plan review. 
         (a)   The Plan and Zoning Commission and City Council shall review and
approve landscape plans in accordance with this section and other city
ordinances for any development activity that would require a development plan
review by the two bodies.

chapter shall typically be prepared by a registered or professional landscape
architect. Others preparing such plans shall provide evidence to the City
Planner showing equivalent experience or competencies to prepare a landscape
plan that meets city standards.
         (d)   The city recognizes the variety of developments and site
configurations may warrant flexibility in applying standards set forth in this
section. In instances where (1) unique site conditions, (2) visibility of
businesses, (3) safe-site access, and (4) limitations on availability of plant
material create a practical difficulty in meeting the standards of this
section, the city may authorize deviations of not more than 25% from the
requirements set forth in this chapter. Whenever such deviations are allowed or
required, the city shall find that the intent of this chapter is met and the
least amount of relief necessary shall be allowed. When a deviation is granted,
it shall be noted on the face of the landscape plan the reasons for allowing or
requiring deviation from the requirements of the divisions specified here.
      (3)   Natural landscape areas. The city encourages the establishment of
public/private natural landscape areas managed for the purpose of prairie,
reforestation, stormwater management, and/or wildlife habitat. Specifically,
natural landscape areas provide a positive public benefit by reducing
maintenance costs (no or limited mowing, pesticide applications, or
irrigation), providing aesthetic variety in the community landscape, protection
of local rare plant species, and encouraging a diversity of wildlife. The city
encourages landscape plans that enhance and protect these areas from
development. Plans shall include establishment and maintenance specifications
for natural and no-mow areas that include a minimum of three years of
maintenance by a certified natural landscape specialist with at least five
years of experience maintaining similar installations.

or collector streets.
               d.    A minimum-30-foot, landscape buffer shall be provided
along the perimeter lines of any neighborhood, when such line abuts a public
street, unless fronted by residences from the development. Planting plans shall
consider the use proposed within the neighborhood, either increasing the
density of plantings when residential lots back to a perimeter road, or
controlling the density of plants when ponds or other desirable open space
abuts the perimeter road.
               e.    In manufacturing districts, a minimum of a 15-foot-wide,
landscape strip shall be provided along all street frontages consisting of a
berm and dense landscaping.
            2.   The screening of 100 linear feet of transition yard should
have a minimum of three shade trees, nine ornamental or evergreen trees, and 21
deciduous or evergreen shrubs, and 200 square feet of native or ornamental
grasses. In areas where native seeding is the predominate ground cover, the
shrubs and perennials shall be replaced by an additional three ornamental or
evergreen trees. Appropriate tree types shall be selected for the native
environment.
            3.   Methods of screening should include:
               a.   An earthen berm;
               b.   Mass plantings of native or ornamental grasses of a species
that can normally be expected to reach a height of six feet, having a minimum
height of three feet at the time of planting;
               c.    Evergreen trees having a minimum height of six feet at the
time of planting;
               d.    Ornamental trees having a minimum of two and one-half
inches diameter, as measured six inches above the established ground level, or
six feet tall as a clump species.
               e.    Shade trees having a minimum of two and one-half inches
diameter, as measured six inches above the established ground level.
               f.    Fencing may also be approved by the City Planner for
required screening.
         (e)   Foundation plantings for commercial properties.
            1.   Where a building is located adjacent to a right-of-way, the
foundation areas of the building shall include a mulched landscape area. This
landscape area can be in planter boxes constructed of the same material as the
adjacent portion of the building.
            2.   Building walls adjacent to a right-of-way shall contain
foundation plantings for a minimum of 50% of the length of the building wall
(except for entrances), and shall contain landscaping in an area a minimum of
ten feet in depth.
            3.   Building walls that are not adjacent to a right-of-way that

IMAGES/0-0-0-7554.png]
 
            4.   When an outdoor use is located adjacent to the right-of-way,
the entire length of the use area shall be landscaped per the building
foundation requirements.
            5.   Where any screen wall or fence is required, the landscaped
area shall be located between the property line and the wall or fence.
         (f)   Screening of refuse-disposal areas.
            1.   All refuse-disposal and grease-storage containers shall be
fully screened on all four sides to a height of six feet. The enclosure shall
be used strictly for the confinement of refuse and grease containers, and shall
not be used for the outside storage of any other materials or equipment. No
refuse screening areas shall be constructed of chain link. Commercial-grade
wood fence, masonry wall or equivalent material may be used. When the enclosure
is designed to serve a new or reconstructed principal building, the enclosure
shall be a solid wall constructed of wood or masonry, using materials, colors
and patterns consistent with the exterior of the principal building. Single-
family, attached and detached residences, utilizing curbside service, are
exempt from the above screening requirements.
            2.   Certain lots within the city, particularly lots within the
downtown area, may lack sufficient space for such enclosures. In cases where
there are unique circumstances that make their installation impractical,
including but not limited to, the lack of useable area on the zoning lot, or a
location being completely hidden from public view, the Zoning Administrator may
grant a waiver of the requirement, upon receipt of the owner’s written request
and explanation of the hardship. Prior to granting a waiver, the Zoning
Administrator shall determine that all reasonably feasible measures have been
taken to mitigate any negative impacts caused by the placement of dumpsters,
grease containers, or any other solid waste-disposal receptacles.
            3.   Section 52.07(R), Location of storage facilities, of the City
Code regulates where storage facilities shall be stored on a lot.
         (g)   Outside storage areas. All outside storage areas shall be
screened by a solid fence, and shall have:
            1.    Continuous landscaping across 100% of the fencing, and shall
be consistent with a transition yard screening described in this chapter. If
the fence is located more than 100 feet from the side or rear property line,
then the transition yard screening shall be provided along the property line,
and the landscaping along the fence shall be as otherwise specified in this
chapter.
            2.   Storage or parking of vehicles or equipment. Where vehicles or
equipment are being stored or parked in an area where the vehicle or equipment
would extend higher than the top of the fence that is providing screening to
the adjacent parcel or right-of-way, then additional trees shall be provided to
screen the top(s) of the vehicles or equipment that extend higher than the
fence.
   (O)   Downtown Commercial District. The C-4 Downtown Commercial District is
unique in that it contains historic buildings and structures, small narrow
lots, buildings with no setbacks, and a pedestrian zone. Because of these
factors, landscape treatment will differ from other parts of the city and
within the downtown district itself.
      (1)   Pedestrian zone/parkways. The area between the fronts of buildings
and the street shall be considered as the pedestrian zone. Recommendations in
the latest edition of the streetscape plan shall be used as a guide in
determining the landscape treatment of the pedestrian zone in the Downtown
Commercial District.
      (2)   Parking lots. Because of the small narrow lots in the Downtown
Commercial District, the creation of parking lots may not always be able to
provide the desired landscaping provided for in this chapter. Since parking
spaces are important to the Downtown Commercial District, all parking lots
should be designed towards achieving the maximum number of parking with proper
traffic circulation. Landscaping of parking lots shall be required for the
areas not needed for parking spaces or circulation. If possible, the
landscaping of these areas should be in accordance with this chapter. If the
landscaping cannot be installed according to this chapter, a variance will not
have to be obtained, provided that the landscaping proposed is the most
appropriate and beneficial to the area, as determined by the City Planner.
   (P)   Alternative landscaping. If, in the sole determination of the Zoning
Administrator, certain requirements of this section cannot be met because of
specific site or layout conditions, the applicant may, in coordination with the
City Planner, or their designee, provide an alternative landscaping plan. The
alternative plan shall provide appropriate landscape treatments of equal or
greater aesthetic quality in order to meet the intent of this code, as will be
determined by the Zoning Administrator.
   (Q)   Change to approved landscape plan. Any change to, or deviation from,
an approved landscape plan, that is in conformance with this chapter, shall
require the approval of the Zoning Administrator. If the Zoning Administrator
finds the change to be substantial or significantly different than the original
approval, the Zoning Administrator may refer the decision to the Department or
Commission that approved the plan (e.g., the Department of Community/Economic
Development or the Plan and Zoning Commission). Changes that do not conform to
this chapter shall be subject to the procedures for a variance as established
in §
153.10.050.
   (R)   Landscape maintenance. The owner, tenant or their agent shall be
responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping located on the site required
by the provision of this section, or by any approved development plan for the
site. Landscaping shall be maintained in good condition to present a healthy,
neat and orderly appearance, and shall be kept free from refuse and debris. Any
dead or severely damaged or diseased plant shall be replaced by the owner,
tenant or their agent no later than the next planting season for the plant or
plants in question. An alternative plant species for the replacement planting
may be permitted if approved by the City Planner.
   (S)   Landscaping assurance. With the understanding that certain reasonable
conditions (e.g., season, unavailability of landscape materials, inclement
weather, and the like) may not allow required landscaping to be completed prior
to the issuance of the first occupancy permit, landscaping assurances shall be
required in accordance with the provisions of this division.
      (1)   The developer/owner shall provide, in writing, the reasons why the
required landscaping cannot be completed prior to the issuance of the first
occupancy permit, and the date all landscaping will be completed.
      (2)   The protective ground cover shall be installed within 60 days, once
the first occupancy permit is issued. The Director of Public Works and
Engineering, or designee, can grant an extension if inclement weather exists.
Occupancy permits issued over the winter months shall require that the
protective ground cover is installed by June 15.
      (3)   The landscape installer shall provide an itemized cost estimate of
all the landscaping to be completed.
      (4)   Prior to the issuance of the first occupancy permit, the developer/
owner shall provide assurance via a signed affidavit that the required
landscaping will be completed.
      (5)   The developer/owner can deposit with the city a cash escrow,
performance bond, or a letter of credit in the amount of 115% of the cost
estimate of the approved landscape plan. If the developer/owner does not
complete the landscaping by the stated date it was to be completed, the city
may use the cash escrow or call the surety bond or letter of credit to contract
with a landscaping company to complete the landscaping to meet city standards,
or take legal action against the developer/owner.
      (6)   All landscape material shall be guaranteed for a period of one year
after initial planting.
      (7)   Natural and no-mow areas shall meet the establishment and
maintenance requirements included in the landscape plan at the end of three
years. If the areas do not meet the specifications, the developer, if in
existence, will be required to amend the area to meet the requirements. If the
developer is no longer in business, the successor business is responsible. If
neither party exists, the city will require that the homeowners association
make the required amendments.
   (T)   Definitions. The definitions noted below apply uniquely to this

§ 153.50.135 GRADING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   No structure shall be erected, moved or substantially improved or
parcel of land filled or excavated within the city, without first obtaining a
grading permit.
   (B)   Grading permit. A grading permit will be required (and shall
necessitate) the submission of grading plans. The grading plans must be
approved by the Director or Public Works and Engineering or authorized designee
and a grading permit issued by the city before the following activities can
commence:
      (1)   Construction of a new structure in a subdivision or planned unit
development where an overall grading plan has been approved by the corporate
authorities or a parcel subject to the overall grading plan.
      (2)   Construction of a new structure in an established subdivision or
planned unit development that does not have an approved overall grading plan.
      (3)   Structure being moved where a parcel is affected by a structure
being moved, including the parcels from which the structure is moved, and the
parcel to which it is being moved.
      (4)   Parcel filled or excavated, where the fill or excavation could
affect stormwater drainage on the parcel being improved or on adjoining parcels
as determined by the Director of Public Works and Engineering.
      (5)   The damming, altering, obstructing or the changing of the natural
terrain or a waterway or watercourse carrying natural drainage from upstream
properties.
      (6)   Any change to an existing structure, an addition or alteration to
an existing structure that could affect stormwater drainage to the parcel being
improved or to the adjoining properties.   
   (C)   Grading permit exceptions. A grading permit may not be required for
filling or excavation improvements that do not adversely affect stormwater
drainage on the parcel being improved or on adjoining parcels as determined by
the Director of Public Works and Engineering or authorized designee. Such
improvements may include:
      (1)   Additions or alterations to an existing structure;
      (2)   Final landscaping; and/or
      (3)   Construction of sheds, shelters, fences, in-ground pools and
retaining walls having a finished height of less than 36 inches.
   (D)   Contents of grading plans. Any proposed grading plan submitted
pursuant to the requirements of this chapter shall contain the following:
      (1)   Location of proposed or existing foundation with respect to
property lines.
      (2)   Foundation elevation, including the top of foundation and any
openings below top of foundation on all new or existing structures or portions
thereof. Proposed or existing top of foundation elevation of structures on all
adjacent parcels.
      (3)   Existing and proposed spot grades. Proposed contours at a one foot
interval.
      (4)   Parcel drainage shall be designed to flow away from the top of
foundation. In the event that conditions dictate that some parts of the lot be
higher than the structure foundation, the grading plan must show the specific
drainage configurations for the parcel specifying that all drainage is to be
directed to flow away from the foundation.
      (5)   Structures, walkways, driveways and landscaping shall be installed
so that the construction of same will not interfere with drainage. All
sidewalks, driveways, patios, and other flat work shall be at an elevation
relative to the foundation wall so that water will drain away from the
structure on all sides and off the lot in a manner which will provide
reasonable freedom from erosion and permanently pocketed surface water.
      (6)   All overflow routes for the 100-year storm and for accumulated
storm water runoff from several lots or form off-site catchment areas must be
clearly designated on the grading plan with the total width of the flow route
contained within an easement for drainage purposes.
      (7)   Original signed and sealed copy of plan shall be provided. Plan
shall be signed and sealed by an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer.
   (E)   Procedures. 
      (1)   A grading plan shall be submitted and a grading permit obtained for
all development activities in division (B) above.
      (2)   A written request for a grading permit determination shall be
submitted to the Director of Public Works and Engineering prior to commencing
with the development activities in division (B) above.
      (3)   After the foundation has been completed, a top of foundation spot

requirements and approved grading plan.
      (4)   After the structure on the parcel has been substantially completed,
the Director of Public Works and Engineering or authorized designee will
inspect the site to determine if the grading has been performed in substantial
conformance with the approved grading plan. No final occupancy permit will be
issued unless and until final grading has been performed in compliance with the
approved grading plan.
   (F)   Issuance of a building permit. No building permit shall be issued
without a concurrent application for the issuance of a grading permit. In the
case of an internal building change, that is a change occurring completely
within a building, or as provided in division (C), grading permit exceptions
above, a grading permit will not be required. The issuance of a building permit
and the grading permit shall be concurrent.
   (G)   Issuance and administration of grading permits.
      (1)   The Director of Public Works and Engineering or authorized designee
will be responsible for the issuance of all grading permits, and shall be
responsible for the administration of this section.
      (2)   If the work described in the grading permit has not been
substantially completed within one year of the date of issuance, the permit
shall be expired and be cancelled by the Director of Public Works and
Engineering. No work shall proceed on the cancelled permit until a new grading
permit has been issued by the city.
   (H)   Final grade survey. Immediately after the final grading has been
accomplished, but before seeding, sodding or landscaping takes place, the
permittee shall conduct a final rough grade survey to determine if the grading
has been done in conformity with the approved grading plan. The final grade
survey must be submitted and approved by the Director of Public Works and
Engineering or authorized designee prior to the issuance of a final occupancy.
   (I)   Easements. Whenever a natural watercourse, waterway, drainage, swale
or the like draining five tributary acres or more, crosses through a parcel of
any part of a parcel, a drainage easement will be required before a grading
permit or a building permit will be issued. The Director or Public Works and
Engineering will verify the total tributary area draining through the subject
parcel or part thereof, and the expected runoff to determine the required
capacity of the natural watercourse and make recommendations on size of
permanent easements.
   (J)   Protective ground cover; specifications. Immediately after final
grading has been accomplished and approved by the city, protective groundcover
shall be installed. The protective groundcover shall be installed within the
growing season in which the occupancy permit is to be issued. If weather does
not permit the installation of protective groundcover, a cash bond in an amount
sufficient to guarantee the completion of installation of the protective
groundcover shall be furnished; however in no case shall the completion of the
installation of the protective groundcover be more that the current growing
season, or June 15 of the next growing season. Alternative protective
groundcover other that grass or sod must secure approval of the Director of
Public Works and Engineering at the time the grading plan is reviewed.
   (K)   Seeded areas. All portions of the parcel not having pavement,
sidewalks or other similar type materials placed thereon are to be provided
with protective groundcover. If the protective groundcover is seed, seed
blanket, and/or hydro-seed, the following suggestions are made in preparing the
area:
      (1)   Place top soil on area to be graded an average depth of six inches
and grade as required to finished grades established on the approved grading
plan.
      (2)   Prepare a firm seed bed free of clods or stones.
      (3)   Apply fertilizer in sufficient rates of application to establish
satisfactory growth in the seeded area.
      (4)   Select a suitable seeding mixture that will produce permanent
groundcover within a reasonable time.
      (5)   Broadcast the seed uniformly over the parcel.
      (6)   Apply mulch on all sites where slopes exceed ten feet in length and
where slopes are steeper than four feet horizontal to one foot vertical.
      (7)   On grassed waterways, where sod is not used, a fibrous or synthetic
erosion control netting shall be applied. The fibrous or synthetic erosion
control netting shall be secured with six inches long metal staples or No. 8
wire along all edges at 12 inches on center. All joints are to overlap in the
netting a minimum of four inches and secured with staples a minimum of four
inches apart.
   (L)   Sodded areas. Where protective groundcover is to consist of sod, it is
suggested the permanent lawn areas to be sodded be prepared in the following
manner:
      (1)   All areas shall be provided with adequate top soil having an
average thickness of six inches and graded as required to finished grades
established on the approved grading plan. Top soil shall be scarified as
required.
      (2)   A dense cultivation sod of bluegrass, bromegrass or rescue shall be
installed. Only moist, fresh sod shall be used.
      (3)   Sod should be installed in Spring or Fall or as moisture
requirements are met and when the ground is not frozen.
      (4)   Sufficient irrigation shall be provided to insure the growth of
newly installed sod. The obligation to furnish irrigation when sprinkling
restrictions are in effect remain the responsibility of the permittee.
   (M)   Approval of ground cover. The Director of Public Works and Engineering
may approve a ground cover of a substance other than grass, as long as the
groundcover maintains the proposed storm water runoff capabilities of the area
to be so landscaped in substantial conformity with the degree of groundcover
that would be accomplished if grass were installed so long as the substance
other than grass is not injurious to the health, safety and welfare of the
surrounding residents.
   (N)   Conditional occupancy permit. 
      (1)   If a parcel cannot be final graded because of adverse weather
conditions or other conditions beyond the control of the permittee, the
building official, with concurrence from the Director of Public Works and
Engineering may issue a conditional occupancy permit. The conditional occupancy
permit shall be effective for only the reasonable number of days sufficient to
sustain the adverse weather conditions or the other conditions that were beyond
the permittee's control. In those instances where a conditional occupancy is to
be issued, the permittee shall furnish a cash bond in an amount sufficient to
guarantee the installation and successful growth of the protective groundcover.
In no case shall the cash bond be in excess of the total cost to the city to
have the work done by an outside contractor.
      (2)   At the time of issuance of a conditional occupancy permit, the
permittee, builder or owner shall sign a document informing them of the
provisions necessary to obtain a final occupancy permit. The document referred
to herein shall be signed by the permittee, builder or owner prior to the time
the conditional occupancy permit is issued. At the time of application for a
conditional occupancy permit, the building official shall determine the
reasonable number of days for permittee's compliance with the requirements of a
final occupancy permit based upon the weather conditions or other conditions
that made the issuance of a final occupancy unreasonable because of the
conditions.
   (O)   Non-conformity with approved plans. Any deviation from the approved
grading plans as attached to the grading permit shall require the following:
the resubmission of a grading plan indicating what changes are necessary as a
result of the noncompliance with the approve grading plans. The revised grading
plan application shall include the same information as required in the case of
application for the original grading permit. All work on the parcel shall
terminate until the time as new grading plans are submitted by the permittee
and approved by the city. All persons aggrieved by a decision of decisions of
the Director of Public Works and Engineering shall have the right of appeal to
the corporate authorities by serving a seven days' written notice on the
corporate authorities. A hearing on the appeal shall be conducted with notice
given to adjoining property owners in all cases involving appeals that may have
a substantial adverse effect on adjoining property.
   (P)   Final occupancy permit. Upon completion of the final grading and the
installation of protective groundcover in substantial conformity with the
approved plans, a final occupancy permit shall be issued to the holder of the
grading permit; however, in those cases where nonconformity with the city
ordinances do not permit the issuance of a final occupancy permit, the permit
shall not be issued. Determination of conformity with the approved grading
plans shall be made by the Director of Public Works and Engineering.
   (Q)   Grading permit fees.
      (1)   Review and inspection. The fee for a grading permit shall be $500
for an attached or detached single-family home, and $185 per unit for a multi-
unit building. The fee shall be considered to cover the city’s expenses related
to the review of the proposed grading plan, top of foundation spot survey,
final grade survey and the inspection of the final grade and landscaping.
      (2)   Re-reviews/re-insp ections. The permittee shall be required to pay
a fee of $150 for the third and all subsequent re-views of grading surveys and
inspections. Re-reviews and re-inspections will not be performed until all fees
have been paid.
      (3)   Plan preparation/surveys. All costs for providing grading plans,
grading surveys or any other material required to be furnished by this section
shall be underwritten by the permittee at the permittee’s expense.
      (4)   Reimbursement of additional fees. At its discretion, the city may
elect to hire a professional consulting firm to complete grading plan or survey
reviews and/or inspections. The permittee shall reimburse the city any and all
engineering review and inspection fees incurred that exceed the amounts
collected in divisions (1) and (2) above.
   (R)   Vacant property. Vacant property shall be graded and maintained in
conformity to the established streets grades at curb level. The lot shall be
maintained free from the accumulation of rubbish and all other unsafe of
hazardous conditions which endanger the life, safety or health of the public.
Provision shall be made to prevent the accumulation of water or damage to any
adjoining property. The lot shall be properly maintained with suitable
groundcover to prevent soil erosion or accumulation of weeds.

§ 153.50.140 PUBLIC UTILITIES.
   (A)   All lines for electronic sounds and signals, telephone, and electric
services shall be placed in easements and entirely underground. Where
electronic sounds and signals, telephone, and electric service lines are placed
underground entirely throughout a developed area, the conduits or cables shall
be placed within easements or dedicated public ways in a manner which will not
conflict with other underground services. All transformer and terminal boxes
shall be located so as to not be unsightly or hazardous to the public.
   (B)   All underground electrical sounds and signals, telephone and
electrical service lines to a single-family home or to a two-family dwelling

(Ord. 21-021, passed 8-18-21)
§ 153.50.160 PROTECTION AND RESTORATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Introduction. A portion of the proposed construction required in
connection with a subdivision or development is often located in or adjacent to
areas with existing surface or underground improvements. The intent of this
section is to codify city requirements relative to construction affecting
existing and future improvements and the restoration of existing improvements.
Plans and specifications presented for city approval shall provide for the
implementation of the requirements of this section.
   (B)   Hand excavation. Where working space will permit, trenches may be
excavated by machine provided that by so doing, public and private improvements
will not be subjected to damage. If, however, excavation by machine methods
cannot be made without material damage being done, hand excavation shall be
employed.
   (C)   Bracing and sheeting. Open-cut trenches shall be sheeted and braced as
required by any governing Federal or state laws and as may be necessary to
protect life, property and the work.
   (D)   Trench side slopes. The contractor may, where working conditions and
right-of-way permit, excavate pipeline trenches with sloping sides above the
top of the conduit only.
   (E)   Short tunnels. Trees, fire hydrants, sidewalks and other obstructions
may be encountered, the proximity of which may be a hindrance to open-cut
excavation. In such cases, the contractor shall excavate by means of short
tunnels in order to protect such obstruction against damage.
   (F)   Piling excavated material. All excavated material shall be piled in a
manner that will not endanger the work and that will avoid obstructing
sidewalks and driveways. Fire hydrants under pressure, valve pit covers, valve
boxes, curb stop boxes, or other utility controls shall be left unobstructed
and accessible until the work is completed. Gutters shall be kept clear or
other satisfactory provisions made for street drainage. Natural watercourses
shall not be obstructed.
   (G)   Structure protection. Temporary and permanent support, adequate for
protection and maintenance of all underground and surface structures, drains,
sewers, water mains, service lines, and other obstructions encountered in the
progress of the work shall be required. Structures which have been disturbed
shall be restored.
   (H)   Protection of property and surface structures. Trees, shrubbery,
fences, poles and all other property and surface structures shall be protected
during construction operations. Any fences, poles or other man made surface
improvements which are moved or disturbed shall be restored to their original
condition after construction is completed. Any trees, shrubbery or other
vegetation which are approved for removal shall be removed completely,
including stumps and roots. Responsibility for any damage or claims for damage
caused by construction operations to shrubbery or other landscape improvements
which were not authorized for removal shall be assumed by the developer.
Settlement of any damage or claims for damage shall be made by the developer as
soon as possible and in a manner satisfactory to Director of Public Works and
Engineering or authorized designee.
   (I)   Interruption to utilities and damage to surface improvements. All
reasonable precautions shall be taken against damage to existing utilities. In
the event of a break in an existing water main, gas main, sewer or underground
cable, the developer shall immediately notify a responsible official from the
organization operating the utility interrupted. The developer shall lend all
possible assistance in restoring service and shall assume all costs, charges or
claims connected with the interruption and repair of such services. In the case
of city utilities, the cost of such work will be billed to the developer as
follows:
      (1)   Wages will be billed at 2.5 times the wages expended.
      (2)   Equipment rates will be charged based directly upon the most
current published rental rates of the Illinois Department of Transportation.
      (3)   A flat service fee of $200 will be charged on each and every
emergency call as a mobilization fee. All other emergency repair work by the
city, as well as any other work that may be performed by the city at the
request of the developer, will be performed at the above rates.
   (J)   Traffic control. All work within public rights-of-way shall conform to
the requirements of the manual on uniform traffic control devices. The
provisions of this manual will be enforced when:
      (1)   An opening is made into the existing pavement.
      (2)   Construction takes place adjacent to the edge of the existing
pavement.
      (3)   A utility crossing is made beneath the existing pavement.
      (4)   It is necessary to close a lane of traffic due to construction
operations.
         A full lane closure will be required whenever construction is underway
or whenever a vehicle is parked in the lane normally used for through traffic,
(even if this facility is on a four-lane roadway). Written permission for such
a lane closure must be obtained from the Director of Public Works and
Engineering or authorized designee prior to commencing construction. Signage
will be required in accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices. No construction operation shall commence until such time that all
required signs and barricades have been erected.
         Unless written authorization is obtained from the Director of Public
Works and Engineering or authorized designee, all openings in any pavement or
traveled way will be backfilled prior to the end of each working day. All
excavations shall be backfilled with FA-6 sand, and a temporary asphalt surface
patch of at least two inches in thickness shall be constructed. In lieu of an
asphalt patch, a steel plate (minimum of one inch of thickness) over the
excavation may be approved by the Director of Public Works and Engineering or
authorized designee upon request by the developer.
   (K)   Pavement crossings. Unless otherwise specifically approved by the
Director of Public Works and Engineering or authorized designee, all conduits
crossing existing pavements shall be installed by tunneling, jacking or
auguring. When the carrier pipe is a conduit intended to operate under internal
pressure, a casing pipe of adequate strength for all applied loads shall be
used. The nearest face of pits or other open excavations on each side of a
traveled pavement shall be at least ten feet from the edge of the pavement.
   (L)   Restoration of existing improvement surfaces. The contractor shall
restore all permanent-type pavements, sidewalks, driveways, curbs, gutters,
trees, shrubbery, lawns, fences, poles, and other property and surface
structures removed or disturbed during or as a result of construction
operations to a condition which is equal in appearance and quality to the
condition that existed before the work began. The surface of all improvements
shall be constructed of the same material and match in appearance the surface
of the improvements which were removed. All pavement and restoration limits are
per the discretion of the Director of Public Works and Engineering and will be
determined and based on logical termini regardless of actual disturbance area.
   (M)   Removal of pavement, sidewalks, driveway and curb. When a conduit is
located along or across an improved surface, the width of the trench at the top
of the excavation shall be held as nearly as possible to the maximum width
indicated in the standard specifications for water and sewer main construction
in Illinois. Where concrete pavements, sidewalk, driveway or curbing is cut,
the width of the cut shall exceed the actual width of the top of the trench at
subgrade by 12 inches on each side. Exposed surfaces of Portland cement
concrete or asphalt shall be cut with a pavement saw before breaking. Care
shall be taken in cutting to ensure that a straight joint is secured.
   (N)   PCC pavement surface. Where the existing pavement surface is Portland
cement concrete, the pavement replacement shall match existing pavement
thickness except the pavement thickness shall not be less than that shown on
the City of Lockport Standard Detail #70-12.
   (O)   Hot-mix asphalt pavement surface with flexible base. Where the
existing pavement surface is asphalt and the base consists of a flexible
material such as aggregate, asphalt, pozzolanic materials or soil cement, the
pavement replacement shall be installed in accordance with the City of Lockport
standard details.
   (P)   PCC sidewalks, driveways, curbs and gutters. Where necessary to remove
and replace Portland cement concrete sidewalk, driveways, curb, and combination
curb and gutter, replacement items shall be constructed or patched in
accordance with the City of Lockport standard details.
   (Q)   HMA Driveways. Where necessary to remove and replace asphalt
driveways, the pavement replacement shall be installed in accordance with the
City of Lockport standard details.
   (R)   Cultivated lawns. When cultivated lawns are damaged, the areas so
damaged shall be restored by furnishing and placing top soil and furnishing and
placing sod as detailed in this section.
      (1)   Top soil shall be furnished and placed to a depth of six inches in
accordance with Section 211 of IDOT's Standard Specifications for Road and
Bridge Construction. The work to be done includes preparing the subgrade,
removal of surplus earth, filling all irregularities or depressions in the
planting area due to settlement, weathering or other causes, furnishing,
placing, raking, and rolling top soil, and all incidental work. The furnished
top soil shall consist of loose, friable, loamy, non-acid soil, rich in organic
matter, and free from clay, and/or other objectionable matter. Before top soil
is placed, the area to be covered shall be shaped, trimmed and finished so that
the specified amount of top soil shall bring the area to the proper grade. If
the existing surface has become hardened or crusty, it shall be raked or
otherwise loosened to provide a suitable bond with the top soil. The top soil
shall be deposited and spread over the planting surface, left with a smooth
surface and carefully rolled.
      (2)   Furnishing and placing sod shall include preparing the ground
surface and furnishing, transporting and placing the sod and other materials
required in the sodding operation, all in accordance with Section 252 of IDOT's
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction. The sod shall be
well-rooted Kentucky Bluegrass on private property and salt-tolerant sod within
the public rights-of-way. Each piece of sod shall be well covered with turf
grass, shall be free from noxious weeds and other objectionable plants, and
shall not contain substances injurious to growth. The grass shall be cut to a
length of not less than two inches, nor more than four inches before the sod is
cut. The consistency of adherent soil shall be such that it will not break,
crumble, or tear during handling and placing of the sod. The sod shall be cut
in square or rectangular pieces with its shortest side not less than 12 inches
nor more than 18 inches long. The cut sod shall be not be less than two inches
thick. Sod which has been cut more than 36 hours prior to placing shall not be
used without the approval of the Director of Public Works and Engineering or
authorized designee. All sod in stacks shall be kept moist and protected from
exposure to the sun and wind, and from freezing. Agricultural ground limestone
and fertilizer nutrients shall be included as required. Regular watering shall
be provided until the sod is well established.
   (S)   Cleanup. Before acceptance of subdivision or development improvements,
all pipes, manholes, catch basins, inlets, valve vaults, fire hydrants, and
other appurtenances shall be cleaned of all debris and foreign material and all
fire hydrants shall be field painted.
   (T)   Saw cutting. When necessary to remove sections of existing pavement or
sidewalk, the edges of the portion to be removed shall be cleanly cut to full
depth with a wet concrete saw.

      (6)   To protect the pedestrians and motorists from damage or injury
caused by the distractions, obstructions and hazards created by certain signs.
      (7)   To protect the public by reducing distractions that may increase
traffic accidents.
      (8)   To protect the public investment in services and infrastructure by

public safety information (for example, signs that use the words "Stop,"
"Yield," "Caution," or "Danger," or comparable words, phrases, symbols or
characters in such a manner as to imply a safety hazard that does not exist);
      (2)   Text or graphics of an indecent or immoral nature harmful to
minors;
      (3)   Text or graphics that advertise unlawful activity; or
      (4)   Text or graphics that are obscene, fighting words, defamation,
incitement to imminent lawless action, or true threats.
   (E)   Lights. A light band of a single string of bulbs or row of tubes that
runs around the perimeter of a building or canopy is not considered as a sign.
   (F)   Signs permitted before effective date. If a permit for a sign has been
issued in accordance with all city ordinances in effect prior to the effective
date of this chapter, and provided that sign construction is begun within three
months of the effective date of this chapter and diligently pursued to
completion, the sign may be completed in accordance with the approved plans for
which the permit has been issued. The sign shall be subject to the provisions
of this chapter regarding nonconforming structures (§
155.10(E)).
   (G)   Number of signs. For the purpose of determining the number of signs, a
sign shall be considered to be a single display surface or display containing
elements organized, related and composed to form a unit. Where an element is
displayed in a random manner without an organized relationship to elements, or
where there is reasonable doubt as to the relationship of elements, each
element shall be considered to be a single sign.

ingress and egress of vehicles and pedestrians.
   (B)   Wall signs.
      (1)   Wall signs shall be made as either:
         (a)   A FLAT SIGN, where the sign is painted directly onto the
building surface;
         (b)   A DIMENSIONAL-SURFACE SIGN, with three-dimensional letter forms
applied to or raised from a separate, flat background, applied to a separate
flat background applied to the building wall. The sign display area may be in
relief, or may be depressed by means of carving, etching routing, and may be a
positive or negative cut;

to the wall;
         (d)   A CHANNEL-LETTER SIGN, where letters or words are mounted
directly to the wall and are internally illuminated;
         (e)   A REVERSE-CHANNEL-LETTER SIGN, where letters are lit from behind
the sign (halo lit);
         (f)   A RACEWAY SIGN, where letters or words are attached to a raceway
mounted to the wall. The raceway shall be the same color as the wall to which
it is mounted; or
         (g)   A CABINET SIGN, a sign placed on a cabinet panel attached to the
structure. Cabinet signs may or may not be illuminated, and should conform to
the shape of the business’s brand, logo, or readily available corporate logo.
Cabinet signs may deviate from this standard if part of a unified shopping
center in which signs are of a consistent design throughout the property.
      (2)   Wall signs within a multiple-tenant building (excluding the
Historic District) shall be of common vertical height, elevation and
architecture.
      (3)   Lighting of wall signs shall be in keeping with §
155.05(D) below.
   (C)   Monument signs.
      (1)   Monument-style signs must be ground-mounted and shall have a
masonry, stone or brick base, with at least five feet of landscaping at the
base.
      (2)   Signs must complement the design of the principal structure,
including the use of corresponding materials.
      (3)   No portion of a monument sign may extend over a property line.
      (4)   Monument signs shall be located a minimum of five feet from any
front or corner side lot line, and ten feet from any interior side lot line.
      (5)   Lighting of monument signs shall be in keeping with §
155.05(D) below.
      (6)   Base. 
         (a)   The sign base shall be a minimum of 2.5 feet in height.
         (b)   The sign base of any monument sign shall be a minimum of 100% of
the width of the sign.
   (D)   Lighting.
      (1)   When signs are illuminated, the light source must be located or
shielded in such a way that the glare does not reach the street or adjacent
property. In no event shall the illumination of any sign, resulting from any
internal or external light source, exceed one foot-candle at any commercial
property line or exceed 50 foot-candles, when measured with a standard light
meter held perpendicular to the sign face at a distance of four feet from the
sign.
      (2)   Illuminated signs shall be turned off between the hours of 11:00
p.m. and 7:00 a.m., or 30 minutes after close of business, whichever is later.
No sign may be illuminated past the hour of 1:00 a.m.
      (3)   No temporary sign shall be illuminated.
      (4)   Signs not located in the Historic District may be lit through
internal illumination or indirect lighting, or back-lit.
   (E)   Maintenance, inspection and removal.
      (1)   Maintenance. The routine maintenance or changing of parts is
permissible without permit, provided that the change does not alter the surface
area, height, copy or otherwise make the sign nonconforming.
      (2)   The owner, tenant or their agent shall be jointly and severally
responsible for the maintenance of all components comprising a sign. All
signage shall be maintained in good, readable condition to present a neat and
orderly appearance.
      (3)   Illuminated signage shall be functional, and all sign structures
shall be free of damage, rust or discoloration.
      (4)   An owner, tenant or their agent shall address any identified
maintenance issue(s) within 20 days after receiving written notification from
the city.
      (5)   All signs, support structures, and the required landscaped area
immediately adjacent shall be maintained in a manner consistent with the
approved plans, safe, secure, and not a danger or nuisance to the public.
      (6)   Unsafe signs. Any sign that is found by the Zoning Administrator to
pose an immediate peril to persons or property shall be removed or repaired by
the property owner within the time frame provided from the Zoning
Administrator. If the property owner fails to act in the manner and time frame
specified by the Zoning Administrator, the sign may be removed by the city,
without further prior notice to the owner thereof. The cost of sign removal or
other actions deemed necessary by the city in regard to the unsafe sign will be
the responsibility of the property owner.
      (7)   Abandoned signs.
         (a)   The sign face of any signs associated with a use that vacates a
premises shall be removed within 30 consecutive calendar days of the vacation.
Any remaining sign structure shall be maintained in a safe and tidy manner.
         (b)   Should any sign associated with a use that vacates a premise be
nonconforming per the standards of this chapter, and should the use of the
business location be discontinued for a period of 90 consecutive calendar days,
regardless of any intent to resume the use, the sign shall not be reestablished
or continued, and shall be immediately removed from the premises or brought
into conformity with this chapter.
      (8)   Paint and finishes.  Paint and other finishes shall be maintained
in good condition. Peeling finishes shall be repaired. Signs with running
colors shall be repainted, repaired or removed. Rust areas that are not an
integral part of the design shall be repaired once they cover 10% of the
surface on which it is located.
   (F)   Exemption for addressing. The posting of building addresses in
locations visible from the street is necessary for the effective delivery of
public safety services; and the efficient and timely delivery of emergency
services is a compelling governmental interest. Accordingly, the city requires
that street addresses shall be posted so as to be readily visible from adjacent
rights-of-way. Because address signs are required, numbers and letters used for
addresses are not included in the calculation of sign area if they are not more
than 14 inches in height, or as otherwise approved by the Fire Chief, based on
visibility and fire safety concerns.
(Ord. 21-020, passed 8-18-21) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.06 GENERAL DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR SIGNS IN ALL DISTRICTS.
   It is the intent of this chapter that the uses, architecture, activities and
building fixtures should provide and define the character of the city, and that
this character is not subservient to large, inappropriate and obtrusive signs.
With that intent, the following guidelines are required in the design of signs
to be installed in the city. The intent of these requirements is outlined in
this section, and whether that intent has been met shall be determined by the
Zoning Administrator in determining whether a permit shall be issued for
regulated signs.
   (A)   The city recognizes that signs are a valuable marketing and
identifying element. It is not the intent of this chapter to limit the
effectiveness of this method of advertising; rather, through the reduction of
competition among signs, it is the purpose of this chapter to allow messages to
be conveyed more effectively and at the same time emphasize the distinct
character the city possesses.
   (B)   High quality in design and construction will enhance the entire area.
Signs can be colorful, decorative, distinguished, and can add character to the
scene.
   (C)   Imagination in design is encouraged. Rather than a flat sign, perhaps
a three-dimensional figure like the familiar boot hanging in front of a shoe
repair shop or store, or the figure of a steer suspended before the door of a
butcher shop, is an aid in identifying the type of service or business offered
within.
   (D)   Materials allowed.
      (1)   Signs not located within the Historic District may be constructed
of aluminum, steel, wood, glass, plastic, canvas or fiberglass-coated wood.
      (2)   Restraint and simplicity in selection of materials, method of
attachment, and the like are urged. Materials and design used should be in
keeping with the architecture of a building and must conform to all building
codes. When fastening a sign to a building, it is important to be respectful of
the building’s decorative elements, and to avoid impeding them through sign
location, or destroying them through fastener attachment.
   (E)   Lettering. As the purpose of signage is to advertise a business to
pedestrian and automotive traffic, the primary concerns in choosing a font for
lettering should be legibility and proper spacing. Appropriate fonts can
include both serifed and block-type styles.
   (F)   Projecting signs. Where feasible and in keeping with the character of
the structure and surrounding area, projecting signs shall be designed to use
ornamental ironwork in their hanging hardware.
   (G)   Lighting. In most cases, back-lit lettering is the preferred type of
illumination. When internally illuminated, the non-illuminated portion of the
sign should contain an opaque background. When externally illuminated, the
light source should not be visible when viewed from the surroundings, unless
the light source is decorative and integrally designed.
(Ord. 21-020, passed 8-18-21) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.07 TEMPORARY SIGNS IN ALL DISTRICTS.

      (8)   Feather signs. Feather signs maybe located on properties in
nonresidential districts a total of 16 times per calendar a year; except that
they are not allowed in the C-4 District or the Historic District,
   (B)   Temporary signs in residential zoning districts. Temporary signs on
residential properties in residential zoning districts shall meet the following
requirements (no permit or fee required).
      (1)    In residential districts, yard signs shall not exceed six square
feet in area per sign, and six feet in height.
      (2)   Two yard signs are allowed per street frontage.
      (3)   Yard signs shall be a minimum of five feet from any property line
      (4)   Yard signs shall not create a hazard for any person or property.
      (5)   Yards signs placed in reference to construction work on premises
must be in connection with an active, approved building permit, and shall be
removed no later than ten days after expiration of the final approval
inspection, or issuance of an occupancy permit, whichever occurs first.
      (6)    Yard signs placed subject to the sale or rental of a property
shall be removed no later than seven days after a sale, rental or lease
agreement has been signed for the subject property.
      (7)   Individual yard signs shall not be displayed or assembled together
as a means to display a larger sign display area.
      (8)   Political signs shall be exempt from quantity and display time
restrictions.

         (d)   The sign permits shall be issued only once an active building
permit is issued for the site, and shall be removed prior to issuance of a
certificate of occupancy.
         (e)   Illumination is prohibited.
   (E)   Subdivision monument signs.  In residential zoning districts, two
monument signs are allowed per subdivision or development access at each major
entry point, located on commonly owned private open space or in right-of-way
areas as approved by City Council. The sign(s) (not including a decorative
wall) shall not exceed 64 square feet. The maximum sign height is six feet on
private property, and 42 inches in the median.
   (F)   Directional signs. Two directional signs, no greater than 3.5 square

be authorized by the Zoning Administrator through the conventional site plan
review process, upon evidence from the applicant that they are necessary for
the convenience and safety of those accessing and using the property.
   (G)   Service station canopy.  Automobile service station canopy shall be
allowed to have one sign on three sides of the canopy. The gross surface area
of the sign shall not exceed 20% of the gross surface area of the face of the
canopy to which it is to be affixed. The sign shall not extend above the top or
below the bottom of the canopy.
   (H)   Secondary signage. Uses in commercial, office and manufacturing zoning
districts will be allowed two secondary wall signs per street frontage, whose
square feet for each sign cannot exceed 25% of the length of the building
frontage. A business with over 50,000 square feet will be allowed up to four
secondary signs per street frontage. In no case shall a secondary sign be
larger than 75% of the area of the principal sign.
   (I)   Movie theaters. In addition to a marquee sign, may have an additional
wall sign for each theater in the facility. Additional wall signs may by no

that display area for the electronic message display.
      (5)   Dominance. The electronic message center must be integrated into
the design of the sign and shall not be the dominant element. Therefore, the
electronic display area shall occupy no more than 50% of the overall sign,
including base and other sign elements. For example, a sign with a 16-square-
foot electronic message display requires a total minimum sign area of 32 square
feet, including the base.
      (6)   Setback from residential zoning districts. The leading edge of the
sign must be a minimum distance of 100 feet from an abutting residential zoning

manufacturer or sign contractor that the sign has an automatic dimmer control,
and that the light intensity has been programmed to meet the allowable levels.
   (K)   Signs that do not require a sign permit. Signs are approved by
issuance of a sign permit. However, there are some signs that do not require a
sign permit. The following signs do not require a sign permit, but may require
a building, electrical or other related permit (if subject to building or

§ 155.09 SIGN STANDARDS: SIZE AND TYPE BY DISTRICTS.
   The following signs, with their specific sizes, are allowed in each
district.
   (A)   Historic District.
      (1)   Residential.
         (a)   Single-family, attached dwelling unit.  One dimensional surface
sign is allowed for each unit, not to exceed five square feet in area, attached
to the building or freestanding.
         (b)   Multiple-family dwellings.  One dimensional surface sign, not to
exceed five square feet in area, is allowed.
      (2)   Business: number of signs.
         (a)   Each commercial building shall be permitted either one monument
sign on the property or one projecting sign at the street entrance of each
commercial unit.
         (b)   Each commercial unit is allowed to have one dimensional surface
sign.
         (c)   Each commercial unit is allowed one awning sign over the
entrance and upper-story windows.
         (d)   Each unit/tenant is allowed to have one window sign.
         (e)   If the unit has frontage on two streets, a second sign is
permitted and may be either a flat sign, a dimensional surface sign or a
projecting sign.
         (f)   If a unit possesses a rear entrance or an additional entrance on
a secondary frontage, the unit is allowed one awning sign and a dimensional
surface sign or a projecting sign.
      (3)   Business: sign sizes.
         (a)   A flat sign may not be located higher than the bottom of the
windowsills of the second floor, nor conceal other architectural features of
the building, nor should it extend above or below the historic signboard if
still in existence above the storefront. The sign area shall occupy only the
center 70% of the facade on which it is located, and shall not extend within
two feet of the edge of the wall.
         (b)   A secondary flat sign may be located on the sides of a building,
but may not exceed dimensions of 10' by 16'.
         (c)   A dimensional surface sign may not project more than 12 inches
from the wall, nor be located less than nine feet, and no higher than 15 feet,
from the sidewalk. The sign shall not project higher than the bottom of the
windowsills of the second floor, nor conceal other architectural features of
the building, nor should it extend above or below the historic signboard if
still in existence above the storefront. The sign area shall occupy only the
center 70% of the commercial unit frontage, and shall not extend within two
feet of the edge of the wall. The dimensional lettering may be affixed directly
to the building or to a material that is then mounted to the building; in
either case, the sign projection must be less than 12 inches.
         (d)   A projecting sign may not be more than 12 square feet in area,
and no exterior dimension shall be more than four feet. The sign and mounting
system shall not project more than seven feet from the building wall, and no
portion of the sign shall be lower than nine feet above the sidewalk, and no
more than 13 feet above grade (as “grade” is defined in § 156.003 of the Zoning
Ordinance). The sign's mounting system shall not extend beyond the building's
parapet, nor impede or destroy any architectural element or ornament on the
building. Projecting signs are not restricted to a particular shape, allowing
for creativity in sign design, such as an object or symbol for a type of
business, or in the mounting system.
         (e)   The entire structure of a monument sign shall be inside the
property line of the premises in which the business is conducted. The display
area of the monument sign shall not exceed 32 square feet, and no part of its
structure shall be more than six feet above the grade immediately below.
         (f)   Window signs shall be permanently affixed or painted and/or a
similar treatment directly on the glass, suspended in the window, or back-
supported and placed in the window. The sign shall not occupy more than 20% of
the total window area. Temporary window signs are not to be exhibited more than
14 days, and may be shown in addition to those regularly displayed.
      (4)   Awnings and awning signs.
         (a)   General intent of awnings. Traditionally awnings did not serve
as a primary means of advertising. They were used for practical purposes,
including protecting pedestrians from the weather, protecting items displayed
in the window from sun damage, and conserving energy.
         (b)   General design of awnings.  An awning may be placed above
windows and doors and not cover more than one-third of the opening, and should
not distract from the architecture of the building or the business inside.
Awning(s) over first-story windows and doors should not extend above the first
story. The number of awnings should be determined by the design of the
building. A single storefront without divisions between windows will typically
require one awning. On properties with divisions between windows and doors,
multiple awnings should be used, each designed to fit one window. Awnings
should mimic the shape of the opening, and should not extend across bays or
beyond the opening.
         (c)   Clearance. Awnings shall be at least 7.5 feet above the
sidewalk.
         (d)   Valance.  Awnings shall contain a valance. The valance is the
only portion of the awning that may include a sign. The valance should not be
fixed or rigid; it should be free hanging, but can be integrated as a separate
component of the overall awning to reduce the cost of replacement or cleaning.
The height of the valance shall be no less than ten inches and no greater than
12 inches.
         (e)   Projection.  Awnings shall project no less than three feet from
the building.
         (f)   Type and shape.  Fixed or retractable awnings are permitted.
Standard sloped/shed awnings, with either closed or open ends, are permitted.
Boxed, curved and odd shapes, such as bull nose and bubble awnings, should not
be used in the Historic District, unless there is evidence that historically
this type of awning was used on the building.
         (g)   Signage. All signage on the awning shall be located on the
valance and shall not exceed eight inches in height, nor shall it occupy more
than 70% of the valance length.
         (h)   Lettering. Lettering may be painted, appliqued or silk-screened
on the valance.
      (5)   Sidewalk signs. Each business shall be allowed to have one sidewalk
sign. The sign may only be displayed during business hours and must be removed
at the close of the business day.
         (a)   Size. The area of the sidewalk sign or object cannot exceed:
            1.   Four feet high, as measured from the sidewalk;
            2.   Two feet in width; and
            3.   Three feet in depth.
         (b)   Materials. Material usage is limited to wood, fiberglass-coated
wood, slate or any combination. A weight system to anchor the sign must be
included in the design of the sign and be used at all times. Electricity may
not be incorporated into the sign, nor any indirect or direct lighting. The
Zoning Administrator may reject the permit for a sidewalk sign if it is not of
an appropriate material that would withstand the elements and/or would cause
harm to pedestrians or vehicles. Signs may also be rejected if the construction
and lettering are not of professional quality.
         (c)   Appearance. Lettering must be of a professional quality and
consistent with the lettering examples identified in the Appendix to this
chapter.
         (d)   Location. The sign shall be placed so that a minimum of a five-
foot, unobstructed pedestrian walkway is maintained at all times (not including
the step-curb). A five-foot clear zone shall be maintained at corner locations
of two sidewalks.
      (6)   Electronic message centers.  Electronic message centers shall be
prohibited in the Historic District.
      (7)   Illumination signs. All signs in the Historic District must be
lighted indirectly only by a shaded flood spotlight or a gooseneck lamp, with
the exception of neon lighting. Neon lighting is allowed within the Historic
District, provided that it is not used as a means of illumination to transmit
light through the faces of signs, which is commonly referred to as
backlighting, but rather is utilized in a form of externally exposed tubing as
part of the external elements that make up a sign, itself, that is historically
and architecturally appropriate. Halo-lit signs accenting individual letters or
a logo are allowed if the lighting source is entirely hidden behind an opaque
face.
      (8)   Illumination awnings. Awning shall not be internally illuminated as
an attention-getting devise. Illumination may occur from separate fixtures that
light the top surface of the awning. Light fixture design and illumination
patterns shall be complementary to the building's architectural design and
materials.
      (9)   Colors.  Earth tones and one primary color shall be used on signage
and awnings in the Historic District, where feasible and in keeping with the
character of the structure and surrounding area. This color combination is to
highlight the unique usage of limestone in multiple commercial buildings. In
order to promote legibility in signage, not more than three colors shall be
used on any one sign, excluding white, black or gilding, and awning signs.
      (10)   Lettering.  As the purpose of signage is to advertise a business
to pedestrian and automotive traffic, the primary concern in choosing a font
for lettering should be legibility and proper spacing. Within the Historic
District, lettering should be similar in style to the examples in the Appendix.
      (11)   Materials allowed. Unless otherwise noted, signs within the
Historic District can only be constructed of aluminum, wood or fiberglass-
coated wood, and should be attached to the building using fasteners appropriate
to the sign. Awning signs should be constructed of a soft cloth, such as
canvas, to allow movement. Shiny finishes are generally not appropriate unless
consistent with the building architecture.
      (12)   Signs on designated historical structures.  On designated
historical structures, an additional sign of not more than five square feet
display surface is allowed to be located anywhere on the exterior wall, or on a
historical pediment above the cornice. Additional signs on historic structures
signs larger than five square feet shall be allowed, when the Heritage and
Architecture Commission determines that it is consistent with the historical
character of the building, and issues a certificate of appropriateness for the
sign.
   (B)   City residential (excluding the Historic District).
      (1)   Single-family, attached dwelling unit. One dimensional surface sign
is allowed for each unit, not to exceed five square feet in area, attached to
the building or freestanding.
      (2)   Multiple-family dwellings.  One dimensional surface sign, not to
exceed five square feet in area, is allowed.
      (3)   For apartment complexes containing more than one apartment
building, an additional sign, not to exceed five square feet in area, may be
allowed for each building.
      (4)   The sign shall not be illuminated.
   (C)   City business areas (excluding Historic District).
      (1)   Number of signs.
         (a)   Each commercial unit/tenant shall be permitted either one

         (c)   A second monument sign is permitted if the commercial unit has
frontage on two streets.
         (d)   Each commercial unit/tenant is allowed one secondary wall sign
on each rear or side wall, when the wall has frontage on an access drive or
customer parking area.
         (e)   Secondary wall signs are prohibited along side or rear walls
contiguous to a residence or residential zoning lot.
         (f)   Each unit/tenant is allowed to have a one window sign.
      (2)   A wall sign is allowed, provided it does not project higher than
the bottom of the windowsills of the second floor or other architectural
features of the building. The sign area shall not exceed 1.25 times the width
in feet of the building wall relative to the occupancy, nor shall it extend
within two feet of the edge of the wall. The sign area of a secondary sign
shall not exceed one square foot for each linear foot of the building wall
relative to the occupancy, nor shall it extend within two feet of the edge of
the wall.
      (3)   A dimensional surface sign is allowed, provided it does not project
more than 12 inches from the wall, and its lowest part is not less than nine
feet above grade elevation at the point immediately below; nor shall it project
higher than the bottom of the windowsills of the second floor or other
architectural features of the building. The sign area shall not exceed one time
the width in feet of the building wall relative to the occupancy, nor shall it
extend within two feet of the edge of the wall. The sign area of a secondary
sign shall not exceed one square foot for each linear foot of the building wall
relative to the occupancy, nor shall it extend within two feet of the edge of
the wall.
      (4)   An awning sign can be placed above windows and doors. The signage
on the awning must not exceed 20% of the total canopy area. The awning upon
which the sign is located shall be a traditional canvas design. Awning and sign
colors should complement the building to which it is attached. Metal or plastic
awnings are not permitted.
      (5)   A projecting sign is allowed, provided that each face shall not be
more than 18 square feet in area, and no exterior dimension shall be more than
six feet. The sign shall not project more than seven feet from the building
wall, and no portion of the sign shall be lower than nine feet above grade, and
no more than 14 feet above grade. No projecting sign, or any part of its
support structure, shall be permitted to extend above the parapet of the
building. For buildings over one story, no part of the sign shall be over 15
feet above grade.
      (6)   A monument sign is allowed, provided that its entire structure is
inside the property lines of the premises on which the business is conducted.
On outlots within a development, a monument sign shall not exceed 60 square
feet in display area, and no part of the structure shall be more than six feet
above the grade immediately below. On lots other than outlots, a monument sign
shall not exceed 64 square feet in display area, and no part of the structure
shall be more than ten feet above the grade immediately below.
      (7)   A permanent window sign shall not occupy more than 25% of the
window area. A temporary window sign is allowed in addition to the permanent
window sign, but may be displayed for no more than 14 days.
      (8)   Signs associated with a drive-up window facility shall be permitted
when authorized by the special use permit for the drive-up window. The sign can
be a dimensional surface sign or a monument sign, or a pole sign (as an
exception to other provisions of this chapter). The sign shall not exceed 24
square feet in size, nor seven feet in height. Up to two signs adjacent to
drive-through lanes are allowed per drive-through lane. The signs may be
internally illuminated and include an electronic screen to display information
to customers.

            2.   Two feet in width; and
            3.   Three feet in depth;
         (b)   Materials. Materials for the sidewalk sign are limited to iron,
steel, wood, plastic, fiberglass-coated wood, or a specific article or object
that would identify the type of service or business offered within the store. A
weight system to anchor the sign must be included in the design of the sign and
be used at all times. Electricity may not be incorporated into the sign, nor
any indirect or direct lighting. The Zoning Administrator may reject the permit
for a sidewalk sign if it is not of an appropriate material that would
withstand the elements, and/or would cause harm to pedestrians or vehicles.
Signs may also be rejected if the construction and lettering are not of
professional quality.
         (c)   Appearance.  Lettering must be of a professional quality and
consistent with the lettering examples identified in the Appendix.
         (d)   Location. The sign must be located no more than one foot from
the building wall of the unit or business for which the sign is intended, but
it may not touch the building in any manner. The sign shall be placed so that a
minimum of a five-foot, unobstructed pedestrian walkway is maintained at all
times (not including the step-curb). A five-foot clear zone shall be maintained
at corner locations of two sidewalks.
   (D)   Industrial areas.
      (1)   Each business shall be permitted one wall sign on each exterior
wall of the building containing such business. Display area of the wall sign

   (B)   Zoning maps.  The boundaries of the district are shown upon the map
attached to Ordinance No. 21-016 and made a part of this chapter, which map is
designated as “the zoning map”. The zoning map and all the notations,
references and other information shown thereon are a part of this chapter, and
have the same force and effect as if the zoning map and all the notations,
references, and other information shown were all fully set forth or described

   (D)   Zoning of streets, alleys, public ways, and railroad rights-of-way.
All streets, alleys, public ways, and railroad rights-of-way; if not otherwise

the intended boundaries of the various districts as shown on the zoning map,
the following rules shall apply.
      (1)   The district boundaries are the centerlines of the streets or

the street or alley shall be construed to be the boundary of the district.
      (2)   Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of
streets or alleys, but do coincide with lot lines, the lot lines shall be
construed to be the boundary of the district.
      (3)   Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of
streets, alleys or lot lines, the district boundary shall be determined by the
use of the scale shown on the zoning map.
      (4)   When a lot held in one ownership on the effective date of this
chapter is divided by a district boundary line, the entire lot shall be
construed to be within the less restrictive district.

chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the
public health, safety, morals and welfare.
      (2)   Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this zoning code
open the use of land or buildings or upon the bulk of buildings are either more
restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other
provisions of this code or of any other law, ordinance, resolution, rule or
regulations of any kind, the regulations that are more restrictive (those that
impose higher standards or requirements) shall govern.
      (3)   This code is not intended to abrogate any easements, covenant or
any other private agreement, provided that where the regulations of this code
are more restrictive (or impose higher standards or requirements) than such
easements, covenants or other private agreements, the requirements of this code
shall govern.
   (G)   Platted building and setback lines.  If a recorded subdivision plat
imposes a building or setback line for a lot that is less than the minimum yard
required by the applicable section of this chapter, notwithstanding the
recorded plat, the minimum yard shall be the same required by the applicable
section of this chapter.

NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES AND USES
§ 156.060 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   This section regulates uses, structures and lots that do not conform
to the regulations of this chapter, and specifies the terms and conditions
under which such nonconforming uses and structures lawfully existing upon the
adoption of this chapter may be permitted to continue. The inappropriate
continuation of nonconforming uses and structures and the use of nonconforming
lots can impact the orderly development of the city, property values, and the
community's character.
   (B)   However, the historic portion of Lockport may have the greatest
occurrence of nonconformities, as it is by definition the oldest part of the
city. Yet, this area has a development pattern that reflects a desirable
character for that historic area. Likewise, development near the historic area
may have similar desirable development patterns and nonconforming situations.
Accordingly, imposing reasonable conditions on the existence and continued
operation of nonconforming uses and structures is necessary.
(Ord. 21-016, passed 8-18-21)
§ 156.061 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   General requirement. Building permits may be issued for any principal
or accessory structure (allowed in the subject zoning districts) without being
brought into conformance with lot area or lot width. However, the property
shall conform to all other bulk regulations.
   (B)   Continuation and use of substandard lots of record. A principal
structure may be constructed and maintained if it is on a lot not less than 50
feet in width, meets the yard requirements specified in division (C) below, and
the property is comprised entirely of one tract of land that meets all of the
following standards:
      (1)   Has less than the prescribed minimum lot area, width or both
(excepting that lot width in the R-O District may not be less than 50 feet for
this standard to apply);
      (2)   Is shown by a recorded plot or deed to have been owned separately
and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the creation of a
lot of that size or width at that location would not have been prohibited by
any zoning code; and
      (3)   Has retained in separate and individual ownership from adjoining
tracts of land continuously during the entire time that the creation of the lot
has been prohibited by the applicable zoning code.
   (C)   Yard requirements for nonconforming lots in R-O and R-1 Zoning
Districts. Construction permitted under division (A) shall comply with all the
regulations, except the following yard requirements may apply in place of the
front and side yard requirements otherwise applicable.
      (1)   The front yard setback line shall be established as the mean of the
front yard setback of the buildings on the adjacent lots. However, in no case
shall a detached accessory structure be built closer to the front property line
than the front of an existing principal structure; nor shall a new principal
structure be built closer to the front property line than the front of a
previous principal structure destroyed (or removed) and being replaced.
      (2)   On a corner lot, there shall be a minimum setback equal to the
setback on the adjacent lot, but not less than 20 feet.
      (3)   The garage for a residence should have a minimum front yard or
corner side yard setback of 20 feet.
      (4)   In residential and commercial zones (except for C-4), required side

area or width is within 95% of the established standard.
   (E)   Construction on lots less than 50-feet wide. Construction on any lot
having a width less than 50 feet may be permitted only upon securing a
variation for the proposed development. As part of the variation process, the
Zoning Administrator shall review proposed designs for construction to confirm
that plans are reflective of the context of the surrounding area and the unique
and historic character of the nearby area and the city. Review of exterior
design would only be considered as part of PZC deliberations should the
applicant wish to appeal the determination of the Zoning Administrator, or if
the Zoning Administrator determines that a determination about appropriate
design is best addressed by considering such a variation. The PZC shall
consider and establish as conditions any appropriate design guidelines as
provided in this chapter as it may find necessary for the variation request to
be in keeping with the standards for a variation and the character of the
surrounding area.

§ 156.062 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Continuation of nonconforming structures. Any structure, devoted to a
use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, that does not
comply with the applicable bulk, height or floor area requirements, or that is
located on a lot that does not comply with the applicable lot or yard
requirements, or both, may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful
subject to the restrictions in this section.
   (B)   Enlargement, alteration and repair of nonconforming structures. Any
structure described in division (A) may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or
remodeled; provided, however, that no enlargement, maintenance, repair or
remodeling shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the
degree of the existing nonconformity of all or part of the structure.
      (1)   For structures located on a lot that does not comply with the
applicable lot size requirements, the front and side yard requirements shall be
as specified in §
156.061(B).
      (2)   An addition may be constructed to a principal structure that is
lawfully nonconforming with respect to the required yard setbacks, provided the
addition maintains the same or a greater yard setback than the principal
structure, and does not increase the extent of the nonconformity.
      (3)   A multi-dwelling building that is nonconforming with regard to
quantity of units may not be expanded to add additional dwelling units.
   (C)   Damage or destruction of nonconforming structures. In the event that
any principal structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to an extent
that repair or replacement does not exceed 75% of the cost of replacement at
the time of damage or destruction (as determined by the Zoning Administrator),
it can be rebuilt without conforming to all the regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located, provided the restoration:
      (1)   Does not increase any previously-existing nonconformity;
      (2)   Meets all other zoning requirements;
      (3)   Begins within one year after the date of damage; and
      (4)   Is diligently pursued to completion within the time frames
established by building permits, subject to extension upon proof of project
construction effort.
   (D)   Determining values and costs related to damage or destruction to
nonconforming structures. The value of a nonconforming structure shall be
determined based on the county-established equalized assessed value (EAV) in
place at the time of the damage or destruction. In establishing the cost of
replacement or repairing damage, the Zoning Administrator shall determine which
independent, third-party information source is most appropriate to apply, based
on the specific circumstances of the site and the damage or destruction. These
may include, but may not be limited to, use of Dodge Data and Analytics or
insurance adjustment reports.
   (E)   Replacing nonconforming accessory structures. At the determination of
the Zoning Administrator, nonconforming accessory structures described in this
section may be replaced in their nonconforming location, upon finding that,
because of its shape, size, topography or established trees, the property
affords no alternative location or arrangement for conformity.
   (F)   Moving nonconforming structures. No structure described in division
(A) shall be moved, in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any
other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire structure shall
conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after
being moved.
(Ord. 21-016, passed 8-18-21)
§ 156.063 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Continuation of nonconforming uses.
      (1)   A lawfully established use that becomes nonconforming with respect
to this chapter on its effective date, or as a result of any subsequent
amendment, may be continued, except as otherwise provided in this section.
      (2)   A use illegal at the time of the adoption of this chapter, or a
subsequently established illegal use, shall not become a nonconforming use by
reason of the adoption or amendment of this code, but shall remain an illegal
use, except where it is allowed in the zoning district in which it is located.
   (B)   Change of nonconforming use.  A nonconforming use shall not be changed
to any use other than a use permitted in the zoning district in which the use
is located. When a nonconforming use has been changed to any permitted use, it
shall not be changed back to a nonconforming use. For purposes of this section,
a use shall be deemed to have been so changed, when an existing nonconforming
use shall have been terminated and a permitted use shall have commenced and
continued for a period of seven days.
   (C)   Enlargement of a nonconforming use. No structure devoted, in whole or
in part, to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner,
unless the use conducted in the added area shall conform to the regulations of
the district in which it is located.
   (D)   Repairs, alterations and maintenance of structures containing
nonconforming uses.
      (1)   No structure devoted, in whole or in part, to a nonconforming use
shall be altered in any way unless the entire structure and use shall conform
to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. Alterations
designed to increase the intensity of a nonconforming use, or to introduce new
nonconforming uses, are prohibited.
      (2)   Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement may be
performed on any structure that is devoted, in whole or in part, to a
nonconforming use, provided such work is in keeping with this section.
      (3)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of a structure in accordance
with an order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public
safety, declares the structure to be unsafe, and orders its restoration to a
safe condition. Such work shall not increase the extent of any nonconformity,
unless necessary to establish a safe condition, in which case the least
possible increase of a nonconformity shall be allowed.
   (E)   Damage or destruction to structures containing nonconforming uses. In
the event that any structure devoted, in whole or in part, to a nonconforming
use is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to an extent that repair or
replacement does exceed 75% of the cost of replacement at the time of damage or
destruction (as determined by the Zoning Administrator), the structure shall
not be restored unless the use conforms to the zoning district in which it is
located. When the damage or destruction is 75% or less of the cost of
replacement new, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless zoning
certification is obtained, restoration is begun within one year after the date
of damage, and is diligently pursued to completion within the time frames
established by building permits, subject to extension upon proof of project
construction effort.
   (F)   Determining values and costs related to damage or destruction to
nonconforming structures. The value of a nonconforming structure shall be
determined based on the county-established equalized assessed value (EAV) in
place at the time of damage or destruction. In establishing the cost of
replacement or repairing damage, the Zoning Administrator shall determine which
independent, third-party information source is most appropriate to apply, based
on the specific circumstances of the site and the damage or destruction, These
may include, but may not be limited to, use of Dodge Data and Analytics or
insurance adjustment reports.
   (G)   Moving nonconforming uses.  No structure devoted, in whole or in part,
to a nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, for any distance
whatsoever to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the
entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to regulations of
the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved. No
nonconforming use of land shall be moved, in whole or in part, for any distance
to any location on the same lot or any other lot, unless the use shall
thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is
located after being so moved.
   (H)   Discontinuance or abandonment of nonconforming uses.
      (1)   Nonconforming use of land. When a nonconforming use of land, not
involving a structure, or involving only a structure that is accessory to the
nonconforming use of land, is discontinued or abandoned for a period of two
consecutive months (regardless of any reservation of an intent not to abandon
or to resume the use), the use shall not thereafter be reestablished or
resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of the land shall comply with the
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
      (2)   Nonconforming uses in structures.  When a nonconforming use of part
or all of a structure is discontinued or abandoned for a period of one year
(regardless of any reservation of an intent not to abandon or to resume the
use), the use shall not be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or
occupancy of the structure shall comply with the regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located.
      (3)   Nonconforming accessory uses.  No use accessory to a principal
nonconforming use shall continue after the principal use shall have ceased or
been terminated.

chapter shall be so operated as to comply with the performance standards
established hereinafter. No use lawfully established on the effective date of
this chapter shall be so modified or altered as to conflict with the
performance standards established herein.
   (A)   Noise. The volume of sound inherently and recurrently generated shall
be controlled so as not to become a nuisance to adjacent uses. Noises shall not
exceed 60 dBA at or beyond the adjacent lot line, as measured with a sound
level meter and impact noise analyzer meeting the applicable standards of the
American National Standards Institute (ANSIS 1.4-1971 and ANSIS 1.11-1966). The
instrument shall be set to the A-weighted response scale, and the meter to the

Notes:
*    Lot area "per unit" is calculated by taking all land dedicated to
the portion of the subdivision dedicated to multi-unit development, not
including stormwater or required landscape outlots, and dividing by the
total number of units.
**   Lot width is applicable to single-family unit buildings, not for
attached units.
***    If the two adjacent properties are less, the average of the two
determines the minimum for the subject lot.
**** Reductions in lot area and lot width (combined) are available if
additional open space is added to the plan in 15% intervals.
^   Lot area in this category equals the average size of all lots in that
district.

§ 156.074 PERMITTED USES.
   No principal building, structure or land use shall be permitted except in
the zoning districts indicated and for the purposes permitted in the following
tables. Each use is mutually exclusive and does not encompass other uses listed
in the table. A principal use listed in the table in any district denoted by
the letter "P" is permitted by right, provided all other requirements of state
law, this chapter, and all other applicable ordinances and regulations have
been met. A principal use listed in the table in any district denoted by the
letter "S" is a special use and permitted only subject to the provisions of §
156.124. A principal building structure or use not indicated by either "P" or
an "S" is not permitted in that district. When classification of a use is not
clear, the determination of the closest comparable use rests with the Zoning
Administrator. A use that is not listed or is not denoted by the letter "P" or
"S" shall be prohibited unless lawfully established as a nonconforming use.

§ 156.075 LOCATION OF SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESSES.
   (A)   Restriction.  No person shall operate or cause to be operated a
sexually-oriented business within 1,200 feet of a preexisting:
      (1)   Public or private elementary or secondary school;
      (2)   Licensed day care center;
      (3)   Public park;
      (4)   Religious institution;
      (5)   Boundary of a residential district or C-1, C-2, C-2T and C-
4 Commercial District, and O-1 and O-2 Office District as defined by the city
zoning ordinance; or
      (6)   Sexually-oriented business.
   (B)   Measurement. For the purpose of division (A), measurement shall be
made in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects,
from the nearest portion of the building or structure used as a part of the
premises where a sexually-oriented business is conducted, to the nearest
property line of the other specified use.
   (C)   Amortization of existing sexually-oriented businesses. Any sexually-
oriented business, lawfully operating on the effective date of this chapter,
that is in violation of division (A) of this section shall be deemed a
nonconforming use. The nonconforming use shall be permitted to continue for a
period not to exceed three years, unless terminated sooner for any reason, or
voluntarily discontinued for a period of 30 days or more. Such nonconforming
uses shall not be increased, enlarged, extended or altered, except that the use
may be changed to a conforming use. If two or more sexually-oriented businesses
are within 500 feet of one another and otherwise in a permissible location, the
sexually-oriented business that was first established and continually operating
at a particular location is the conforming use, and the later-established
business is nonconforming.
   (D)   Exemption from location restrictions.  Any person desiring to locate a
sexually-oriented business at a location prohibited under this section or other
regulation of the zoning ordinance, or any other provision thereof, shall be
required to seek a variation of use in accordance with the provisions of the
zoning ordinance. In addition to the general criteria that must be established
for a variation of use, the person seeking the variation shall also establish
the following to be eligible for the variation of use:
      (1)   That the location of the proposed sexually-oriented business will
not have a detrimental effect on nearby properties or be contrary to the public
safety or welfare;
      (2)   That the location of the proposed sexually-oriented business will
not downgrade the property values or quality of life in the adjacent areas or
encourage the development of urban blight; and
      (3)   That the location of a sexually-oriented business in the area will
not be contrary to any program of neighborhood conservation, nor will it
interfere with any efforts of urban renewal or restoration.

§ 156.076 STAR INNOVATION DISTRICT OVERLAY.
   (A)   Purpose. The City of Lockport intends the Star Innovation District
Zoning Overlay regulations to focus future land use, community activity, and
economic development actions to be in keeping with community goals and values
as defined in the Star Innovation District Master Plan and other city
objectives. In that regard, the purpose of the Overlay is consistent with and
drawn from the vision and mission defined in the plan:
      (1)   Vision. The Star Innovation District Zoning Overlay will help to
incorporate this unique property into the fabric of Lockport and its greater
downtown area. The distinctiveness of the area provides benefit to the city
even if it remains undeveloped, providing open space and eliminating potential
adverse effects on the area with traffic (particularly trucks) or otherwise
impactful development. To that extent, if the area does develop, it is expected
to transform a legacy refinery site into one of the region's premier locations
for sustainable manufacturing, food production, maker activities, research and
education as well as host the community's largest festivals - all within the
context of a sweeping native prairie landscape and Lockport's history as an I &
M Canal Town.
      (2)   Mission. Maintain the area as an ongoing asset to the residents of
Lockport. This is done with patience and thoughtful decision making by city
leaders. This area need not be developed, so not just any development should be
pursued. City leaders are committed to controlling the site and its potential
future reuse with this Overlay so as to clearly benefit the community. Any
development should attract and retain jobs that support Lockport's vibrant
community, curating a business environment focusing on a core group of
financially viable sectors to build a brand and identity for the district and
the city.
   (B)   Applicability and scope.
      (1)   The Star Innovation District Zoning Overlay (SID) is hereby
established and includes all properties within the boundaries designated on the
City of Lockport, IL Zoning Official Map. The purpose statement of this
district is as specified in §
156.070(Q): Establishment of Zones: Star Innovation District Zoning Overlay.
      (2)   The SID is divided into three subdistricts to reflect different
conditions and anticipated land use across the site. Areas 1 and 2 generally
are divided by 2nd Street extended and located east of the BNSF rail line. SID
3 is located west of the rail line. These subareas are depicted graphically in
Figure 1. The formal boundaries for the SID Overlay and subdistricts are as
depicted on the City Zoning Map. Different regulations for SID Area 1, 2 and 3
apply as specified in this section.

ensure compliance with the commercial and/or industrial design guidelines set
out in
Chapter 156 - Appendix B - Design Guidelines for the City of Lockport.

the city as part of any zoning entitlement request or conventional site plan
review approval process as required for the Overlay.
      (1)   Existing roadways within the Overlay can remain or be relocated as
part of any development. If roads are to change to private roads, appropriate

its history. The canal and I & M Canal Trail run through the Star Innovation
District. It is the intent of this Overlay District to prevent adverse impacts
from the property on the canal, the trail, and users of the trail. This
includes possible impacts from effects such as storm water, noise, and
objectionable views. To ensure protection of this important resource, impact on
the canal and trail, any proposed development shall be evaluated by the city as
part of any zoning entitlement or site plan review process, and shall include
but not be limited to:
         (a)   Building orientation. Structures that include loading docks
shall be oriented such that the dock areas are not directly visible from the I
& M Canal and Trail. The city will consider approval of loading docks partially
visible from the canal and trail if such facilities can be adequately screened
so as not to adversely impact views from the trail, as considered though the
development review process.
         (b)   Transition yard. No principal or accessory structure may be
located closer than 100 feet from the closest property line identifying the
boundary of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources ownership.
         (c)   Parking lot landscaping. Where a parking lot abuts the canal or
trail, perimeter parking lot landscaping shall be provided as required in §
153.50.125(N)(6)(b)3.
         (d)   Four sided architecture. Where principal structures are visible
from the canal and trail, concepts of four sided architecture shall be applied,
as described in the Design Guidelines for the City of Lockport.
   (L)   Landscaping and tree preservation. 
      (1)   Any application for development plan as defined in §
153.10.030.D of the Lockport City Code, shall be evaluated to ensure compliance
with the landscaping and tree preservation requirements set out in §
153.50.125, Landscaping and Tree Preservation of the Lockport City Code. The I
& M Canal Transition Yard shall be treated consistent with transition yard
requirements found in §
153.50.125.
         (2)   In keeping with the City of Lockport Development Code as
required per §
153.50.045, all development in the SID Overlay shall incorporate Best
Management Practices (BMP) and include native and regenerative landscapes to
ensure water quality and treat stormwater runoff for pollutants of concern, in
accordance with the United States Clean Water Act.
   (M)   Off-street parking and loading. Any application for development plan
as defined in §
153.10.030.D of the Lockport City Code, shall be evaluated to ensure compliance
with the Off-Street Parking and Loading regulations in
Chapter 156: Zoning, of the Lockport City Code. The amount of parking required
may be considered for reduction by the city per zoning ordinance procedures
related to Shared Parking (§
156.095), Landbanking Future Parking (§
156.097) or Variation (§
156.122).
   (N)   Signage. Any application for a sign permit in the SID Overlay shall be
evaluated to ensure compliance with the signage regulations in Chapter 155:
Signs of the Lockport City Code. Signage on cargo container structures is
regulated by division (K)(7)(d) above. Because of the regionally visible
location of the SID from State Street, the 9th Street bridge and the Sanitary
and Ship Canal, signage intended to advertise or highlight the district or city
as a whole will be evaluated on a case by case basis as a part of the overall
planned development and will not need to follow the requirements of the
Lockport City Code, upon evaluation and approval by the City Council. The
review will include the quality of the graphic design, size, and materiality.

OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
§ 156.090 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this section is to alleviate or prevent congestion of public
streets, and to promote public safety and welfare by establishing minimum
requirements for off-street parking and loading. This section also promotes
logically designed and safe parking areas, and seeks to minimize the amount of
land devoted to impervious surfaces for parking. Creative, site-specific, and
environmentally-sensitive mechanisms are outlined to facilitate matching the
parking required by code with the parking required for users, rather than
creating large areas of unused parking.
(Ord. 21-016, passed 8-18-21)
§ 156.091 GENERAL PROVISIONS; PARKING AND LOADING.
   (A)   Scope of regulations. The off-street parking and loading provisions of
this chapter shall apply as follows.
      (1)   For all buildings and structures lawfully constructed or all uses
lawfully established prior to the effective date of this chapter, or its
subsequent amendments:
         (a)   Accessory parking and loading facilities may continue as
required by the regulations of the zoning district in which an existing
building or use is located at the time a building permit was issued;
         (b)   Where a permit has been issued prior to the effective date of
this chapter or its subsequent amendments, and provided that construction is
begun within one year of the effective date, and diligently prosecuted to
completion, parking and loading facilities shall be provided in keeping with
the requirements in place at the time the building permit was issued;
         (c)   When an existing use is replaced with another use having a
greater parking demand, based on the intensity measures defined in the Schedule
of Parking Requirements (§
156.102), no additional parking shall be required so long as the building,
structure or premises is not increased in size (square footage);
         (d)   When an existing building, structure or premises is increased in
size (square feet) or intensity (number of dwellings), the parking and loading
facilities as required in this chapter shall be provided for the total increase
as if for a new use, except that:
            1.   No additional parking or loading shall be required, unless and
until the aggregate increase in units of measurement exceeds 15% of such
existing units of measurement;
            2.   In cases where additional parking is required, the requirement
may be met through alternative means, such as shared parking, land banking, fee
in lieu, or zoning variation.
      (2)   For all buildings and structures lawfully constructed after the
effective date of this chapter or its subsequent amendments, accessory parking
and loading facilities shall be provided as required for the use located in
them by the regulations of this section, and the zoning district in which they
are located.
   (B)   Existing parking and loading facilities.  Accessory off-street parking
or loading facilities that are located on the same lot as the building or use
served, and that were in existence on the effective date of this chapter or its
subsequent amendments, shall not be reduced below, or if already less than,
shall not further be reduced below, the requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Damage or destruction of conforming or legally nonconforming building
or use.
      (1)   For any conforming or legally nonconforming building or use in
existence on the effective date of this chapter or its subsequent amendments,
which is subsequently damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or
other cause, and is reconstructed, re-established or repaired, off-street
parking or loading facilities equivalent to any in place at the time of such
damage or destruction shall be restored and continued in operation.
      (2)   Should damage or destruction by fire or other cause exceed 75% of
the value of the building or use, off-street parking or loading facilities
shall be provided equal or greater than as required by this chapter. If the new
use or building is consistent with the previously-existing primary structure or
use, it shall not be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading
facilities in excess of those required by this chapter.
   (D)   Control of off-site parking facilities. When required parking
facilities are provided off-site on land other than the zoning lot on which the
building or use served by the off-site facilities is located, both properties
shall be and remain under the same ownership and continue as such at all times
during the life of the proposed use or building. Evidence of such ownership
shall be provided to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator and shall be
recorded against both properties at the County Recorder of Deeds.
   (E)   Submission of plat plan. Any application for a building permit or
certificate of occupancy where no permit is required, shall include a plot
plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any parking or loading
facilities to be provided in compliance with this chapter.
   (F)   Parking on vacant lots. Parking of vehicles on a vacant residential
lot is prohibited unless it is necessary to meet the off-street parking
required for an adjacent property. Such parking shall be located on a paved
surface. No other parking shall be permitted on the vacant lot. Parking may be
shared as long as the primary uses are all within 250 feet of the parking area.
   (G)   Parking surfaces. Parking on the grass or unimproved surfaces is not
permitted.

facilities accessory to residential uses shall not be used for storage of
commercial vehicles, or parking of automobiles belonging to employees, owners,
tenants, visitors or customers of any business or manufacturing establishments.
   (B)   Joint parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities for different
buildings, structures or uses, or for mixed uses, may be provided collectively
in any zoning district in which separate parking facilities for each
constituent use would be permitted, provided that the total number of spaces so
located, together, shall not be less than the sum of the separate requirements
for each use, unless authorized under §
156.095, Shared Parking.
   (C)   Size.
      (1)   Required off-street parking spaces and aisles shall meet the
dimensional standards specified below in Table 092-1 and Figure 092-1.

   The location of off-street parking spaces in relation to the use served
shall be as follows.
   (A)   R0, R1, R2, R3, and R4 Residential Zoning Districts.  Parking spaces
accessory to dwelling units, including driveways, shall be located on the same
zoning lot as the use served, except as specified in §
156.091(F), Parking on vacant lots. Parking spaces accessory to uses other than
dwellings may be located on a lot adjacent to, or directly across a street or
alley from, the lot occupied by the use served, but in no case may be more than
300 feet from the principal structure or use. Parking serving multi-story
residential buildings, where parking is aggregated together, may also be
located on a lot adjacent to, or directly across a street or alley from the lot
occupied by the use served, but shall be no more than 300 feet from the
principal structure.
   (B)   C1, C2, C2T and C3 Zoning Districts.
      (1)   All required parking spaces accessory to nonresidential uses shall
be within 500 feet of the principal building or use served, whether on the same
or an adjacent lot.
      (2)   All required parking spaces accessory to dwelling units shall be
within 300 feet of the principal building or use served, whether on the same or
an adjacent lot.
      (3)   Private, free, off-street parking accessory to business uses or
serving as municipal parking lots may be allowed in a residential zoning
district if it is within 200 feet of and adjacent to a business or industrial
district, and approved by the city as a special use, in accordance with the
standards and procedures specified for special use permits in §
156.124.
   (C)   C-4 Downtown Commercial District.
      (1)   All required off-street parking spaces shall be not more than 1,000
feet from the use served.

special use in accordance with the standards and procedures specified for
special use permits in §
156.124.
(Ord. 21-016, passed 8-18-21)
§ 156.095 SHARED PARKING.
   (A)   Description. Shared parking is an arrangement whereby two or more
owners of nonresidential properties, or users sharing a parking lot and having
different peak-hour parking demands use the same off-street parking spaces to
satisfy their off-street parking requirements.   
   (B)   General. The Zoning Administrator may approve shared parking
facilities between two properties, subject to the following conditions.
      (1)   Eligible uses. Shared parking is allowed among different use types
or among uses with different hours of operation.
      (2)   Ineligible parking. Accessible parking spaces (for persons with
disabilities) may not be shared and must be located on-site.
      (3)   Location. Shared parking spaces shall be located within 750 feet of
the primary entrance of all uses served, unless shuttle bus service is provided
to the parking lot.
      (4)   Shared parking study.  Applicants wishing to use shared parking as
a means of satisfying parking requirements shall submit a shared parking
analysis to the Zoning Administrator that clearly demonstrates the feasibility
of shared parking. It shall address, at minimum, the size and type of the
proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of
parking turnover, and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all
uses that will be sharing parking spaces.
       (5)   Agreement. Applicants must provide a shared parking agreement in a
form approved by the City Attorney, and executed by the parties using the
shared parking spaces and the city. Shared parking privileges will continue in
effect only as long as the agreement, binding on all parties, remains in force.
Should the agreement cease to be in force, parking must be provided as
otherwise required within this article. Shared parking agreements shall be
recorded as part of the development approval.
    (C)   Shared parking within shopping centers.  Cumulative parking
requirements for mixed-use occupancies may be reduced where it can be
determined that the peak requirement of the several occupancies occurs at
different times during the day. For a shared parking arrangement, the Zoning
Administrator may make an administrative adjustment that reduces the off-street
parking requirements for each participating commercial property.
       (1)   To approve such an administrative adjustment, the Zoning
Administrator shall find that:
         (a)   The collective parking facility is located within 750 feet
walking distance of each of the uses, as measured from the entrance of each use
to the nearest parking space in the collective parking facility;
         (b)   Convenient, safe, accessible and visible pedestrian connections
are located between the facilities and all of the shared properties;
         (c)   The tenants do not have the same hours of operation or peak
hours of operation, i.e., there is some substantial difference in business
hours; an example follows:
            1.   Business 1: Monday to Friday: open 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.,
closed Saturday, Sunday;
            2.   Business 2: Monday to Saturday: open 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.,
closed Sunday.
      (2)   Applicants must provide a shared parking agreement in a form
approved by the City Attorney, and executed by the property owner, the parties
using the shared parking spaces, and the city.
(Ord. 21-016, passed 8-18-21)
§ 156.096 BICYCLE PARKING.
   (A)   No development, except single-family, attached and detached
development for which bicycle parking is not required, shall have fewer than
three bicycle parking spaces. No development shall be required to exceed a
maximum of ten such spaces.
   (B)   All nonresidential developments that provide automobile parking
facilities shall provide bicycle parking facilities (bike racks) at a ratio of
at least one bicycle parking space for every ten automobile parking spaces.
   (C)   Multi-family developments shall provide interior bicycle parking
facilities for building residents at a ratio of at least one bicycle parking
space for every three dwelling units. The bicycle parking facilities must be
provided near the building entrance accessible to the street. Multi-family
developments shall also provide bicycle parking facilities for visitors and/or
the public at a ratio of at least one bicycle parking space for every 20
automobile parking spaces provided.   
   (D)   Bicycle parking facilities for nonresidential developments and bicycle
parking facilities provided for visitors and/or the public shall be located a
maximum distance of 50 feet from the building entrance, or shall be located at
least as close as the closest automobile space.     
   (E)   Each bicycle parking facility shall be securely anchored to the ground
and designed to secure the bicycle frame when used in conjunction with a user-
supplied lock.
(Ord. 21-016, passed 8-18-21)
§ 156.097 LAND-BANKED FUTURE PARKING.
   (A)   The City Council may grant relief from city parking requirements to
allow land banking up to 25% of the required parking spaces. In O-2, M-1 and M-
2 Zoning Districts, land-banking requests shall be determined on a case-by-case
basis. In all cases, approval for land banking shall be granted, provided that:
   
      (1)   Sufficient evidence is provided by the applicant that supports the
reduced parking needs;
      (2)   The area proposed for land banking of parking spaces shall be an
area suitable for parking at a future time;
      (3)   Landscaping of the land-banked area shall be in full compliance of
the zoning regulations and, at a minimum, landscaped with turf. As a result of
site plan review, additional landscaping of the land-banked area may be
required;
      (4)   The land-banking area will not be used for any other use. The land-
banked parking area cannot be used to fulfill other landscaping requirements
within this chapter;
      (5)   As part of the site plan review process, the applicant shall show
the area to be banked on the site plan and marked as "Land-Banked Future
Parking".
   (B)   The Zoning Administrator, at their sole discretion, on the basis of
increased parking demand for the use, or provided parking proving to be
inadequate, may require the conversion of all or part of the land-banked area
to off-street parking spaces. The owner may convert the land-banked area to
parking prior to city notification, subject to all required permits.
(Ord. 21-016, passed 8-18-21)
§ 156.098 ACCESSIBLE PARKING.
   (A)   ADA compliance. All off-street parking facilities must comply with the
State Accessibility Code and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)
concerning the number and design of accessible vehicle parking spaces required
in parking lots and structures. Any update to state or national regulations
regarding accessible parking shall supersede these requirements.
   (B)   Required spaces. Parking spaces for persons with disabilities shall be
provided in all off-street parking facilities where parking is provided for
employees, visitors or both, with the exception of single-family, detached and
single-family, attached uses. The number of accessible parking spaces shall be
included in the total number of required parking spaces, and shall be in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the State Accessibility Code, as
amended from time to time, and all additional governing codes and applicable
laws.
   (C)   Dimensions and design. Such spaces shall comply with the design
standards presented in the State Accessibility Code, provided that in no
instance shall the width of any one space be less than 16 feet, nor the length
less than 20 feet. Such spaces shall be identified by a sign and pavement
markings indicating parking for persons with disabilities only. Such spaces
shall be those closest to the entrance of the building or structure, and shall
be connected by a paved surface designed to provide safe and easy access. Such
spaces shall otherwise be in accordance with the Illinois Vehicle Code.

   Except for extraction uses to which this section shall not apply and for
which the City Council may establish conditions, the following shall apply.
   (A)   Location. All required loading berths shall be located on the same
zoning lot as the use served. No loading berth for vehicles over two tons
capacity shall be closer than 50 feet to any property in a residential
district, unless completely enclosed by building walls, or a uniformly painted
solid fence or wall, or any combination thereof, not less than six feet in
height. No permitted or required loading berth shall be located within 25 feet
of the nearest point of intersection of any two streets.
   (B)   Size. Unless otherwise specified, a required loading berth shall be at
least 12 feet in width, at least 50 feet in length, exclusive of aisles and
maneuvering space.

notice of appeal has been filed with him or her, that, by reasons of facts
stated in the certificate, a stay would, in their opinion, cause imminent peril

record upon application following notice to the Zoning Administrator, and upon
due cause shown.

      (1)   The Plan and Zoning Commission (PZC) and the Zoning Administrator
may authorize variations from the terms of this chapter, as specified in this
section, so long as the relief is in harmony with the purpose and intent of
this chapter, and will not be contrary to the public interest.
      (2)   Variations may be authorized only on those specific instances
enumerated in this section, and then only as indicated that the PZC or the
Zoning Administrator has the authority to grant the variation requested, and
has made findings of fact based upon the standards set out in this section.
Such determinations shall reflect that, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will, in an individual case,
result in practical difficulties or particular hardship for the owner, lessee
or occupant of land or a structure.
      (3)   Final determination of all variations shall be made by the Plan and
Zoning Commission for a PZC variation, or the Zoning Administrator for an
administrative variation for which no appeal is made.

regulations of this chapter may cause practical difficulties or a particular
hardship relating to construction or alteration of buildings or structures. In
such instances the Plan and Zoning Commission may grant variations from strict
application of the terms of this chapter.
   (C)   Application procedure for variation. A complete application for a
variation shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning
Administrator shall determine based on division (E), Authorized variations,

requested is to be heard through PZC or Zoning Administrator procedures. All
submittals shall contain the information specified on the variation application
form provided by the city or additional information as deemed necessary by the
Zoning Administrator.

property owners within one property radius of the subject property, including

         (c)   The notice shall include the street address or common
description of the property involved, and a description of the variation
requested.
         (d)   A signature line shall be provided on the notice and those
property owners to whom notice was sent must communicate to the Zoning
Administrator regarding their support of or opposition to the proposed
variation. If all property owners to whom notice was sent do not provide such
agreement, the variation shall be heard by the PZC.
   (E)   Authorized variations.
      (1)   Plan and Zoning Commission authorized variations. Variations from
the regulations of this chapter may be granted by PZC, only in accordance with
the standards set out in division (F), Standards for variations, and may be

requirements governed by §§
156.090 et seq., provided that:
            1.   Reductions in the front and corner side yard setbacks in
nonresidential districts to accommodate off-street parking spaces may be
approved only when it is the finding of the PZC that ample green space along
roadways is provided to maintain a character consistent with surrounding
properties, and that specific unique existing hardships require the requested
relief; and
            2.   Landscaping is provided at all property lines and for a
minimum of seven feet from all property lines;
         (d)   To vary the regulation relating to the restoration of damaged or
destroyed nonconforming structures contained in §

chapter may be granted by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with the

the following limitations:
            1.   Up to 20% from the existing condition as built for existing
structures for:
               a.   Lowland yards (such as wetlands or floodplain). The
required yard adjacent to a lowlands maintenance easement cannot be varied;
               b.   The minimum, lot-area-per-dwelling-unit requirement for
multiple-family dwellings shall not be reduced to permit more than one dwelling
unit in addition to the number that would be permitted by strict application of
minimum-lot-area requirements.

structures or permitted obstructions governed by §
156.023(E), General and bulk regulations for accessory structures and uses

156.102, Schedule of Parking Requirements, by no more than 10% or two spaces,
whichever is greater.
   (F)   Standards for variations.
      (1)   Standards.  The PZC or Zoning Administrator shall not vary the
regulations of this chapter without making positive findings of fact based upon
the evidence as presented that:
         (a)   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return, if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations of
the district in which it is located;
         (b)   The proposed variation will not merely serve as a convenience to
the applicant, but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship that
will result if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out, which are
not generally applicable to property within the same district;
         (c)   The alleged hardship has not been directly created by any person
presently having a proprietary interest in the premises;
         (d)   The proposed variation will not be materially detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood;
         (e)   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion in the
public streets, increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety;
         (f)   The proposed variation will not alter the essential character of
the locality;
         (g)   The proposed variation is in harmony with the spirit and intent
of this chapter.
      (2)   Conditions and restrictions on variations. The PZC, or the Zoning
Administrator in the case of administrative variations, may impose conditions
and restrictions that include, but are not limited to: location, size, height,
construction, berming, screening, landscaping, or other similar means to buffer
or protect nearby property and designate standards for installation and
maintenance thereof; and design and use of the property benefitted by a
variation as may be necessary or appropriate to comply with the foregoing
standards, and to protect adjacent property and property values.
   (G)   Decisions and variations.
      (1)   Plan and Zoning Commission decisions.
         (a)   Action by the Plan and Zoning Commission. Within 35 days of the
close of the public hearing, the Plan and Zoning Commission shall make a final
decision. Failure to do so within 35 days, or longer period if agreed to by the
applicant, shall be deemed a decision for denial of the variation by the Plan
and Zoning Commission.
         (b)   If the variation application is denied, a similar application
for relief may not be brought before the city for a period of one year.
         (c)   A variation shall be granted by means of a conclusion or
statement of relief granted, supported by findings of fact, which statement and
findings shall be transmitted to the applicant not less than 35 days from the
date of the decision.
            1.   The findings of fact shall specify the reason or reasons for
granting the variation, and shall refer to any exhibits containing plans and

   (A)   Authority.  The regulations established, and the districts created by
this chapter may, from time to time, be amended by an ordinance passed by the
City Council, upon receiving a recommendation from the Plan and Zoning
Commission (PZC). Amendments for a text amendment or a map amendment (rezoning)
may be filed by the City Council, PZC or Zoning Administrator. In addition, the
owner of a property or an individual or entity with a contractual interest in a
property (with the authorization of the owner) may file for an amendment to the
zoning map, and any interested person may propose an amendment to the text of
this chapter.
   (B)   Purpose. Amendments to this chapter are intended to revise or refine
the zoning ordinance or zoning map as needed to keep it a current and effective
tool for development regulation. Amendments should reflect new conditions or
newly identified situations, technologies, business approaches or unexpected
conditions. The amendment process is not appropriate solely to relieve a
particular inconvenience for an individual applicant, as such changes affect
other aspects of the chapter and/or surrounding properties.
   (C)   Application procedure for amendments.
      (1)   An application for an amendment shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator. All submittals shall contain all the information specified on
the zoning amendment application form provided by the city or as deemed
necessary by the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   The completed application for amendment shall be forwarded by the
Zoning Administrator to the PZC within 30 days for the purpose of conducting a
public hearing, to be held not more than 90 days from the date of the receipt
of the application by the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   Following receipt of a recommendation by the PZC, the City Council
will either approve the application, approve the application with modifications
or conditions, deny the application, or refer the matter back to the PZC for
further deliberation.
      (4)   If a proposed zoning amendment application is rejected by the City
Council, that application, or one substantially similar, may not be resubmitted
within 12 months of the date of rejection by the City Council.
   (D)   Hearing and notice.
      (1)   The PZC shall hear the application for amendment at a public
hearing on an established meeting or other date it may set.
      (2)   Notification shall adhere to the published notice and written
notice requirements as contained in §
156.120(E)(3), Notification requirements.
      (3)   The PZC may give any additional notice as it may, from time to
time, by rule provide.
      (4)   Any party of interest may appear and be heard at the hearing in
person, by an agent or by an attorney.
   (E)   Protest against map amendment.
      (1)   A written protest regarding a proposed map amendment may be filed
with the City Clerk, signed and acknowledged by property owners, individually
or collectively, representing one or more of the following:
         (a)   Twenty percent of the block frontage on which a subject property
is located;
         (b)   Twenty percent of the block frontage directly opposite a street
from where the subject property is located; or
         (c)   Twenty percent of the block frontage directly opposite an alley
from where the subject property is located.
      (2)   Where a protest against a proposed map amendment has been properly
filed and found valid by the Zoning Administrator, it shall not be passed
except by the favorable vote of two-thirds of all members of the City Council.
      (3)   Protests by such property owners shall be deemed valid only if:
         (a)   The protest is made only after an authorized representative of
the affected property owner(s) has considered the evidence in the case;
         (b)   The protest is made in writing and submitted to the City Clerk
not earlier than the first day after the public hearing has concluded, and not
later than six days following the public hearing, and provided that the written
protest is circulated by first class mail by the protesting party to the
applicant and their representative, if any, identified in the application for
the proposed amendment and/or all other represented parties, if any;
         (c)   An authorized representative of the protesting property owner(s)
shall be required, on request of any party in the case, including the city, to
give oral testimony under oath to support the protest;
         (d)   The protest is directly related to the evidence presented during
the public hearing and upon which the Plan and Zoning Commission may base their
respective findings of fact.
   (F)   Standards for map amendments.  The wisdom of amending the zoning map
of this code is a matter committed to the legislative discretion of the City
Council and is not dictated by any set standard. However, in determining
whether a proposed amendment should be granted or denied, the City Council
should be guided by the principle that its power to amend this code is not an
arbitrary one, but one that may be exercised only when the public good demands
or requires the amendment to be made. In considering whether that principle is
satisfied in any particular case, the City Council should weigh the following
factors, which the applicant is required to address:
      (1)   The extent to which property values of nearby properties may be
diminished by the particular zoning restriction;
      (2)   The extent to which the proposed amendment promotes the health,
safety, morals or general welfare of the public;
      (3)   Relative gain to the public compared to the hardship imposed upon
the property owner;
      (4)   The suitability of the subject property for the zoned purposes;
      (5)   The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned,
considered in the context of land development in the vicinity;
      (6)   The need and demand for the change in uses allowed by a new zoning
district;
      (7)   The extent to which the proposed amendment conforms to the
comprehensive plan.
   (G)   Standards for text amendments. The wisdom of amending the text of this
code is a matter committed to the legislative discretion of the City Council
and is not dictated by any set standard. However, in determining whether a
proposed amendment should be granted or denied, the City Council should be
guided by the principle that its power to amend this code is not an arbitrary
one, but one that may be exercised only when the public good demands or
requires the amendment to be made. In considering whether that principle is
satisfied in any particular case, the City Council should weigh the following
factors, which the applicant is required to address:
      (1)   Potential impacts of the proposed text amendment on the overall
zoning district purpose, value of impacted properties, or intent of a code
section proposed for amendment;
      (2)   The extent to which the proposed amendment promotes the health,
safety, morals or general welfare of the public;
      (3)   Relevant physical or market conditions that may have changed to
make the proposed text amendment necessary for this chapter, and to be in
keeping with the desirable development of the city;
      (4)   Amendments should be consistent with the city's comprehensive plan,
official map, and all other plans and policies adopted by the city;
      (5)   The need and demand for the change in standards, and the extent to
which uses of properties that may be relevant are diminished by the current
zoning standards, and how those standards are no longer suitable for regulating
development.
   (H)   Fees. Fees for applications and processes related to this section
shall be as found in §
156.126, Fees.

is necessary or desirable to provide a service or a facility in the public
interest, and will contribute to the general welfare of the neighborhood or
community;
      (2)   The proposed building or use will not have a substantial adverse
effect upon the adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood, traffic
conditions, utility facilities and other matters affecting the public health,
safety and general welfare;
      (3)   The proposed building or use will be designed, arranged and
operated so as to permit the development and use of neighboring property in
accordance with the applicable district regulations;
      (4)   The other standards and criteria as are established by this chapter
for particular special uses as set forth in district (G) below, and as applied

§ 156.125 ZONING CERTIFICATION.
   (A)   Authority. Prior to review of any application for a building permit
(or any application for an occupancy permit if no building permit is required),
the Zoning Administrator shall determine that the application conforms with the
regulations of this chapter, and certify as such on the building permit
approval. Any application for a building permit that contains the information
required by division (C) below shall be deemed to be an application for a
zoning certification.
   (B)   Purpose.  Implementation of city plans, policies and ordinances
related to the built environment depends, in part, on compliance with city
development regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that
land uses are located appropriately per the city zoning map, that parking and
loading standards are met, and that zoning bulk standards are met. To support
this objective, the zoning certification process ensures that property owners
making improvements do so in a manner that is in keeping with the regulations
of the city and do not adversely impact neighboring properties or the community
at large. This process allows for consideration of such matters prior to
commencement of construction and seeks to prevent owners from inadvertently
undertaking construction contrary to the standards of this chapter.
   (C)   Zoning certification required. No building permit pertaining to the
construction, remodeling, moving or reconstruction of any structure shall be
issued by the city, unless an application for a building permit has been made
to and a signature has been obtained from the Zoning Administrator.
      (1)   Applicable standards.  The following standards shall apply to
zoning certification, as well as others that may be specified in the city code:
         (a)   Construction, building, moving, remodeling or reconstruction of
any structure shall not be commenced without valid zoning certification;
         (b)   Improvement of land preliminary to any use of the land shall not
be commenced without valid zoning certification;
         (c)   Permits pertaining to the use of land or structures shall not be
issued by any official, officer, employee, department, board or bureau of the
city without valid zoning certification;
         (d)   Any zoning certification issued in conflict with the provisions
of this chapter shall be null and void, unless previously approved by ordinance
or as a condition of the permit.
      (2)   Application procedure for zoning certification. Every application
for zoning certification shall be accompanied by the following:
         (a)   The certificate of a registered architect or registered
structural engineer licensed by the state, or of an owner-designer, that the
proposed construction, remodeling or reconstruction complies with all of the
provisions of this chapter;
         (b)   A plat, in duplicate, of the piece or parcel of land, lot or
lots, block or blocks, or parts or portions thereof, drawn to scale, showing
the actual dimensions of the piece or parcel, lot or lots, block or blocks, or
parts or portions thereof, according to the recorded plat of the land;
         (c)   A plot plan, in duplicate, drawn to scale, and in a form as may
from time to time be prescribed by the Zoning Administrator, showing the
locations, ground area, height and bulk of all present and proposed structures,
drives and off-street parking and loading spaces, the building lines in
relation to lot lines, waste disposal areas, the use to be made of present and
proposed structures on the land, and other information as may be required by
the Zoning Administrator for the proper enforcement of this chapter. One copy
of the plat and the plot plan shall be retained by the Zoning Administrator as
a public record;
         (d)   All applications for zoning certification for the construction,
moving, remodeling or reconstruction of any structure to be located in an
industrial district shall be accompanied by sufficient information to enable
the Zoning Administrator to determine that there will be compliance with all of
the applicable performance standards of §
156.072, Performance Standards, at all times. At the request of the Zoning
Administrator, the applicant shall provide the following:
            1.   A description of the activity to be conducted, in sufficient
detail to indicate the extent to which the proposed operation will produce
waste products, conditions or external effects regulated or otherwise limited
by §
156.072;
            2.   A description of the type and location of any abatement
devices or recording instruments used to control or measure conformity with any
of the standards set forth in §
156.072;
            3.   Any other data and certificates as may reasonably be required
by the Zoning Administrator to reach a determination with respect to whether
the proposed use or structure will comply with the requirements of §
156.072;
            4.   All information and evidence submitted in an application for
zoning certification to indicate conformity with the performance standards set
forth in §
156.072 shall constitute a certification and an agreement on the part of the
applicant that the proposed structure or use can and will conform to such
standards at all times.
      (3)   Zoning certification. Zoning certification shall be either issued
or refused by the Zoning Administrator within 14 days of the receipt of an
application, or within a further period of time as may be agreed to by the
applicant, provided, however, the Zoning Administrator shall have 21 days to
issue or refuse zoning certification on all applications, as required by
division (C)(1) above. When the Zoning Administrator refuses to issue zoning
certification, the applicant shall be advised in writing of the reasons for
that refusal.
      (4)   Period of validity. Zoning certification shall become null and void
six months after the date on which it is issued unless construction, moving,
remodeling or reconstruction of a structure is commenced and progressing, or a
use is commenced within that six-month period.
   (D)   Occupancy certificate required. No structure or addition constructed,
moved, remodeled or reconstructed after the effective date of this chapter
shall be occupied or used for any purpose, and no land vacant on the effective
date of this chapter shall be used for any other use, unless an occupancy
certificate shall first have been obtained from the Zoning Administrator,
certifying that the proposed use or occupancy complies with all the provisions
of this chapter.
      (1)   Application for an occupancy certificate.
         (a)   General requirement. Every application for an occupancy
certification for a new or changed use of land or structures, where no zoning
certification is required, shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator, and be
in such forms and contain information as the Zoning Administrator shall
provide.
         (b)   Application for occupancy certificates for industrial uses. All
applications for an occupancy certificate for any use to be located in an
industrial district, where no zoning certification is required, shall be
accompanied by sufficient information to enable the Zoning Administrator to
determine that there can and will be compliance at all times with all
applicable performance standards of §
156.072. At the request of the Zoning Administrator, the applicant shall
provide such information as is specified in division (C)(2)(d) above.
      (2)   Issuance of an occupancy certificate.
         (a)   No occupancy certificate for a structure or addition
constructed, moved, remodeled or reconstructed after the effective date of this
chapter, shall be issued until such work has been completed, including off-
street parking and loading spaces, and the premises has been inspected by the
Building Inspector and determined to be in full and complete compliance with
the plans and specifications upon which the issuance of the zoning
certification was based. Any modifications from the approved plan must be
remedied prior to zoning certification being issued.
         (b)   No occupancy certificate for a new use of any construction or
land shall be issued until the premises has been inspected by the Zoning
Administrator, or their designee, and determined to be in full and complete
compliance with all the applicable regulations for the zoning district in which
it is located.
         (c)   An occupancy certificate shall be issued, or written notice
shall be given to the applicant stating the reasons why a certificate cannot be
issued, within 14 days of the receipt of an application therefor, or after the
Zoning Administrator is notified, in writing, that the structures or premises
are ready for occupancy, provided, however, that the Zoning Administrator shall
have 21 days to issue or refuse an occupancy certificate on all applications
required to comply with the provisions of division (C)(2)(d).
      (3)   Conditional occupancy certificate.    
         (a)   In no event shall a conditional occupancy certificate be issued
from March 15 to December 1 of each year when weather conditions allow for
completion of exterior improvements as determined by the city's Director of
Public Works.
         (b)   When weather conditions do not allow for the completion of
exterior improvements, the city agrees to issue conditional occupancy
certificates (commonly known as temporary occupancy certificates) upon the
completion of temporary winter lot improvements, which shall consist of a
temporary stone driveway and apron consisting of compacted CA6 stone.
         (c)   A sidewalk across the frontage of a residential lot shall not be
considered a temporary winter lot improvement and shall not be required for the
issuance of a conditional occupancy certificate.
         (d)   Prior to the issuance of any conditional occupancy certificates,
the developer shall deposit with the city:
            1.   Bond(s) or other acceptable surety in amounts as determined by
the city's Director of Public Works to secure completion of outstanding private
improvements the following spring; and
            2.   An executed indemnification by the owner in a form approved by
the City Attorney for each residential building for which a conditional
occupancy certificate has been requested.
         (e)   The bonds shall be individual bonds for each unit, and cash
bonds shall not be required.
         (f)   No such certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless the
Director of Public Works approves of the issuance of the conditional occupancy
certificate, and unless the developer provides a schedule by March 10 for the
completion of all outstanding items for the city's Director of Public Works to
consider.
         (g)   If so approved by the Director of Public Works, the developer
shall meet the time frame as set forth within schedule or the city shall have

PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
§ 156.140 PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS; INTRODUCTION.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/4c8b716648ab3dc207c7c5f0368cfb031efc69f7/
IMAGES/0-0-0-7687.png]
 
   A planned development may be located in any zoning district through the
issuance of a special use permit, subject to the standards and procedures set
forth in this chapter, when authorized by City Council upon recommendation from
Plan and Zoning Commission. The development and execution of zoning regulations
is based upon the division of the city into districts in which the use of land
and buildings, and the bulk requirements and location of buildings and
structures in relation to the land are specifically defined. The city
recognizes that approaches in development forms and procedures that support
mixing of uses and relief from bulk regulations within districts can produce
very satisfactory, desirable and lasting results, if properly designed and
planned; and can be done without adverse influence upon surrounding property.
This subchapter establishes standards and procedures to provide flexibility and
encourage sound and imaginative design. While a higher quality of outcomes for
planned developments may include areas of increased height or density, simply
allowing such intensification is not its sole, intended purpose.
(Ord. 21-016, passed 8-18-21)
§ 156.141 PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS; PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The planned development is intended to encourage improved design in the
development of land by providing relief from traditional zoning requirements
designed for conventional development, but which may not facilitate desirable
unconventional development, and to establish standards and procedures for the
issuance of a special use permit for a planned development in order to obtain
the following objectives.
   (A)   Environmental design in the development of land that is of a higher
quality than is normally possible through the strict application of general
zoning ordinance requirements. The city desires environmentally-conscious and
green development in order to enhance public welfare and create a more
sustainable community. Higher quality environmental design expected in planned
developments should encourage resource conservation, mitigate a development's
impact on the environment, reduce waste generated by construction projects,
increase energy efficiency, and promote public health.
   (B)   Diversification in the uses permitted and variety in the relationship
of uses, structures, open spaces and heights of structures in developments
conceived as cohesive unified projects.
   (C)   Provision for functional and beneficial use of open space.
   (D)   Preservation, to the greatest extent possible, of the archeological
and historic resources and natural landscape features and amenities of a
development site, and utilization of those features in a harmonious fashion in
the development.
   (E)   Provision for a safe and desirable environment characterized by a
sensitive and unified building and site development program.
   (F)   Rational and economic development in relation to public services.
   (G)   Creation of a variety of uses, in compatible arrangements, to provide
a greater choice of living, employment and shopping environments.
   (H)   Efficient use of land resulting in more economic networks of
utilities, streets and other facilities.
   (I)   Coordination of architectural styles, building forms and
relationships, graphics and other private improvements.
(Ord. 21-016, passed 8-18-21)
§ 156.142 APPLICATION PROCEDURES FOR PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   A four-step procedure is prescribed for planned developments. Prior to
beginning the planned development review process, the applicant is encouraged
to obtain a copy of the city zoning ordinance, a copy of the development code,
and relevant application forms. Applications shall be made on forms supplied by
the city, and shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter
relating to special uses, except as specifically provided here to the contrary.
The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to combine stages of the
review process. However, combining stages does not eliminate the applicant's
responsibility to pay application and staff review fees for each stage.
   (B)   Planned developments to be considered by the city shall be in keeping
with the following circumstances:
      (1)   There shall be no minimum acreage requirement for a planned
development;
      (2)   Planned development required. Any development meeting the following
conditions shall be permitted only if approved as a planned development in
accordance with this chapter:
         (a)   Any development of ten acres or greater. Development of this
size and scale can have a greater impact on the community than small
developments and should be developed in an integrated manner that can be
accommodated through planned development regulations.
         (b)   Any development requesting two or more variations from this
chapter.
      (3)   Each planned development shall be presented and judged on its own
merits. It shall not be sufficient to base justification for an approval upon
an already existing planned development.
      (4)   The burden of establishing that a planned development is necessary,
desirable, and meets all the standards of this chapter shall in all cases be
the responsibility of the applicant.
   (C)   Step 1: Pre-application meeting. Before submitting an application for
a planned development, the applicant shall meet with city staff to informally
discuss the proposed planned development, to obtain information and guidance
before entering into binding commitments regarding the property, or incurring
substantial expense in preparation of a development. The request for a pre-
application conference shall conform with the provisions of §
153.20.020.
   (D)   Step 2: Concept plan review. The concept plan review step shall be
conducted at the sole discretion of the Director of Community and Economic
Development, upon determining that the scale, complexity or potential adverse
impacts merit this review step. The concept plan review provides an informal,
pre-application process to assist an applicant's appraisal of the feasibility
of a development concept according to the city comprehensive plan, other city
development policies, existing and projected development plans, and other
development activities. The process encourages discussion of basic interests,
concerns and questions related to the development proposal, prior to incurring
the expenses associated with a formal submission, and allows that work to be
conducted more efficiently and effectively. This step also allows for citizen
participation to also assist the developer and the city in defining the
conditions under which permanent changes in land use may occur with minimal
disruption of the natural and economic resources of the city. A determination
whether to proceed with concept plan review shall be at the discretion of the
Zoning Administrator, based on the completeness of the application, and whether
the complexity of the project requires further information from the application
or analysis by staff.
      (1)   Concept plan review submittals shall include the following items.
         (a)   Maps. Maps that are part of the concept development plan may be
in general form, and shall contain the proposed land uses, the natural features
of the site, the character and approximate density of dwellings, and the
approximate location of proposed thoroughfares and water, sewage and drainage
systems.
         (b)   General statement.  A written statement shall contain a general
explanation of the size and character of the planned development, including a
statement of the present ownership of all the land within the planned
development, and an anticipated start date of construction.
         (c)   Current aerial photograph.  Aerial photography (preferably at a
scale of one inch equals 400 feet), showing existing features within the
proposed development's area of influence (not less than one-half mile),
including the subject property, school, park, wastewater facility and fire
protection district boundaries, municipal boundaries, and planning jurisdiction
limits, national and local historic district boundaries, and sewer and water
lines.
         (d)   Existing conditions.  The existing conditions plans should be a
professionally-drawn, site analysis plan, at a scale of one inch equals 100
feet, showing the boundaries of the site and the existing natural and man-made
conditions on and within 150 feet of the site. It shall also include the
following:
            1.   General information, including but not limited to, a graphic
scale, north point, date of preparation, the name of the proposed development,
and the name of the land surveyor, land planner or professional engineer who
prepared the site analysis;
            2.   Natural features shall include topography (significant slopes
designated), soils, wooded areas, natural areas, areas subject to flooding,
bodies of water, wetlands, creeks, fens, springs and seeps, rock outcroppings,
drainage patterns, vegetation, and wildlife habitat; and
            3.   Existing man-made features shall include interior and adjacent
streets (with surface width and material noted), buildings, barns, bridges,
historical and architectural sites, agriculture drain tile, underground
utilities, rights-of-way, easements, neighborhood land uses, political
boundaries, present zoning and planned land uses, the names of adjacent
property owners, and any conditions of adjacent property that may affect the
proposed development.
         (e)   Concept site plan.  A professionally-drawn concept plan, at a
scale of one inch equals one 100 feet, showing existing topography and
vegetation, and the proposed general pedestrian and vehicular circulation,
general land uses, open spaces and natural areas, and storm water control
facilities. Concept site plan shall include a small location map, showing the
relationship of the proposed development to the existing road network.
         (f)   Evidence of ownership of the land proposed to be developed or
subdivided.  Where the developer does not own the land, written notarized
permission from the owner shall be provided, authorizing the development of the
land under the provisions of this chapter.
         (g)   Tentative engineering proposals.  Tentative engineering
proposals for water supply, wastewater facilities, storm drainage and street
improvements.
         (h)   Completed application for concept plan review.  A completed
concept plan review application as provided by the city.
      (2)   Following the submission of all material required by §
156.142(D)(1), the Zoning Administrator shall distribute such documents to city
departments, consultants or other persons as may be necessary. City staff will
review each concept plan application, and any accompanying drawings, supporting
documentation and statements, in order to determine the extent to which the
application is consistent with all city requirements, and the standards for a
planned development and a special use.
      (3)   After city staff has reviewed the submittal, the Zoning
Administrator shall schedule the project on the next available Plan and Zoning
Commission agenda and shall submit a staff report to Plan and Zoning Commission
and to the applicant. The staff report will analyze the plan’s compliance with
the requirements of this chapter; raise any concerns that arise throughout the
review process, and advise of any city plans, policies or projects that may
affect the proposed subdivision or development.
      (4)   The Plan and Zoning Commission shall review the concept plan at a
public meeting and provide feedback to city staff and the applicant as to items
noted in the staff report, other potential benefits or concerns noted about the
concept plan, and any additional information it considers useful and suggests
being provided for the preliminary development plan review should the applicant
proceed to that stage.
   (E)   Step 3: Preliminary development plan review. The preliminary
development plan review step provides formal, first consideration of the
planned development application. Plans considered at this stage shall reflect a
significantly complete development plan that indicates clearly what form of
development is proposed, and how it might impact surrounding properties and the
community in general. The applicant shall provide enough information and detail
about the proposal to allow the staff, the PZC, the City Council and residents
to make a sound determination regarding the extent to which the proposed
development meets the standards for approval specified in this chapter.
      (1)   Preliminary development plans shall include the following items.
         (a)   All items required for a preliminary development plan as
described in §
153.20.041 of the city development code.
         (b)   A development schedule indicating the approximate dates each
phase of the planned development will commence and conclude. Phase information
should indicate what development is included in each phase, including open
space, site amenities, landscaping and utilities.
         (c)   Proposed agreements, by-laws, provisions or covenants that
govern the use, maintenance and continued protection of the planned
development, and any of its planned open space or other facilities referred to
in division (E)(1)(b).
         (d)   A list of all modifications from the district regulations that
will be necessary for the proposed planned development.
         (e)   Statements of conformity, ownership and proposed use.
            1.   STATEMENT OF CONFORMITY is a statement by the applicant(s)
demonstrating how the planned development conforms with the purpose and the
standards and criteria of this subchapter.
            2.   STATEMENT OF OWNERSHIP is a statement and documentation by the
applicant(s), verifying their ownership or control of all land included in the
proposed development. If the property is held in a trust, the statement of
ownership shall disclose the name of the trustee and beneficiaries of the
trust.
            3.   STATEMENT OF PROPOSED USE is a statement of the applicant’s
(or applicants’) intention with regard to the future selling or leasing of all
portions of the land areas or structures, and the proposed use thereof.
         (f)   Additional information as may have been directed by the Plan and
Zoning Commission as part of the concept plan review process or as may be
required by the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   Following the submission of all required material, the Zoning
Administrator shall distribute that information to city departments,
consultants or other persons as may be necessary. City staff will review each
preliminary development plan application, and any accompanying drawings,
supporting documentation and statements, in order to determine whether the
application is consistent with all city requirements, and the relevant
standards and criteria contained in this subchapter.
      (3)   After city staff has reviewed the submittal, the Zoning
Administrator shall schedule the application for a public hearing (in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter) at the next available Plan
and Zoning Commission meeting. The staff report analyzing the proposed plan's
compliance with the requirements of this chapter shall be provided to the Plan
and Zoning Commission, and copy of that report shall be provided to the
applicant.
      (4)   Hearing.  The Plan and Zoning Commission shall hold a public
hearing on the application for a preliminary development plan. Notice and
hearing procedures shall be followed as set forth in §
156.120(E)(3), Notice and hearing procedure, of this chapter.
      (5)   Decisions by the Plan and Zoning Commission.  Following the public
hearing and review of the preliminary development plan and supporting materials
for conformity to this chapter, the Plan and Zoning Commission shall, within 60
days from date of public hearing (unless agreed to otherwise with the
applicant), recommend approval, modification or disapproval, and the reasons
therefor, to the City Council; the recommendation shall include the Plan and
Zoning Commission's findings of fact in regard to the standards for findings in
this article.
      (6)   No application for preliminary development plan shall be approved
without a satisfactory finding regarding the following standards. The Plan and
Zoning Commission shall submit to the City Council a written recommendation and
findings of fact for each matter it hears based on these standards.
         (a)   The standards for special use, as outlined in §
156.124(E) shall be met by all planned developments.
         (b)   In what respects the proposed plan is or is not consistent with
the stated purpose of the planned development regulations.
         (c)   The extent to which the proposed plan departs from the zoning
and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property,
including but not limited to, the density, dimension, area, bulk and use; and
the reasons why such departures are or are not in the public interest.
         (d)   The extent to which the proposed plan meets the requirements and
standards of the planned development regulations.
         (e)   The physical design of the proposed planned development, and the
manner in which the design does or does not make adequate provision for public
services, provide adequate control over vehicular traffic, provide for and
protect designated planned open space and schools, and further the amenities of
light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment.
         (f)   The compatibility of the proposed planned development with the
adjacent properties and neighborhood.
         (g)   The desirability of the proposed planned development to physical
development and economic well-being of the entire community.
         (h)   The proposed development plan's conformity with the
recommendations of the comprehensive plan of the city.
      (7)   Decisions by the City Council.  After receipt of the preliminary
development plan from the Plan and Zoning Commission, the City Council shall
approve, modify or disapprove the plan. In the case of approval, or approval
with modifications and/or conditions, the City Council shall pass an ordinance
approving the preliminary plan, incorporating findings of fact as recommended
by the Plan and Zoning Commission, and as my be amended by the City Council.
      (8)   Effect of preliminary development plan approval. Approval of a
preliminary development plan shall not constitute approval of the final plan.
It is an approval to the layout submitted on the preliminary plan as a guide to
the preparation of the final plan. The final plan shall be approved as the
final development plan if it substantially conforms with the preliminary
development plan. No plats shall be recorded and no building permits issued
until a final development plan has been approved by the City Council.
      (9)   Preliminary plan approval shall be effective for no more than one
year from the date of approval unless, upon written request by the applicant,
the City Council grants an extension of time for one additional year, provided
the applicant makes the request for the extension within the initial one-year
period.
         (a)   When the preliminary plan approval is no longer effective,
either by exceeding the one-year period or not receiving a time extension, the
special use permit for the planned development shall lapse, upon written notice
to the applicant from the Zoning Administrator, and shall be of no further
effect.
         (b)   The expired preliminary plan may be considered and approved by
the City Council upon written request from the applicant, only if the requested
approval is for the same approved planned development, with no changes to that
plan.
   (F)   Step 3A: Concurrent review. An applicant for planned development may
request concurrent review of preliminary and final development plans. The
request shall be approved at the sole determination of the Zoning
Administrator. If concurrent review is authorized, the process shall include
the public hearing required by this subchapter, and all materials required in
for final development plan approval shall be provided prior to scheduling the
hearing.
   (G)   Step 4: Final development plan.
      (1)   Within one year following the approval of the preliminary
development plan, unless an extension was granted as described above, the
applicant shall submit a final development plan for the first stage of
development. Final development plans shall contain the following items.
         (a)   All items required for a final development plan as enumerated in
§
153.20.052.
         (b)   All items required for a final development plan as enumerated on
the city's application for planned development, or as may be required by the
Zoning Administrator to provide clarifying information.
         (c)   Note of any proposed changes to or impacts from the approved,
preliminary planned development submittal.
         (d)   A final land use plan, suitable for recording with the County
Recorder of Deeds. The purpose of the final development plan is to designate
the land subdivided into lots, as well as the division of other lands not so
treated into planned open areas and building areas, and to designate and limit
the specific internal uses of each building or structure, as well as of the
land in general.
         (e)   If the planned development includes subdivided lands, a
subdivision plat of all subdivided lands, in the same form and meeting all the
requirements of a normal subdivision. To the extent that compliance with
Chapter 153 may be required, public hearings for such purposes shall be held at
the same time as the hearings required under the provisions of these planned
development regulations.
         (f)   An accurate legal description of each separate unsubdivided use
area, including planned open space.
         (g)   Designation of the location of all buildings to be constructed,
and a designation of the uses for which each building is designed.
         (h)   Final agreements, by-laws, provisions or covenants that govern
the use, maintenance and continued protection of the planned development, and
any of its planned open space or other facilities, conveyed to a homeowners'
association or similar organization.
         (i)   A detailed, final development and construction schedule,
indicating when each phase is expected to commence and conclude. Detailed phase
information shall include open space, site amenities, landscaping and
utilities.
      (2)   Following the submission of all materials required above, the
Zoning Administrator shall distribute such documents to city departments,
consultants or other persons as may be necessary. City staff will review each
final development plan application and any accompanying drawings, supporting
documentation and statements, in order to determine whether the application is
consistent with all city requirements and the standards and criteria for final
development plans as contained in §
156.142(E)(6).
      (3)   After city staff has reviewed the submittal, the Zoning
Administrator shall schedule the project at the next available Plan and Zoning
Commission meeting, and shall submit a staff report to Plan and Zoning
Commission and provide a copy to the applicant. The staff report will analyze
the final development plan's compliance with the requirements of this chapter,
and report items of nonconformity or noncompliance. If the final plan does not
substantially conform to the preliminary plan, a public hearing (with required
notice) shall be held for the PZC to consider approval of the revised final
plan.
      (4)   The Plan and Zoning Commission shall review the final development
plan and shall make a recommendation to the City Council. When making its
recommendation to City Council, the Plan and Zoning Commission can recommend
approval, approval subject to modifications and/or conditions, or denial.
         (a)   The Plan and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval of the
final development plan if it is in substantial compliance with the approved
preliminary development plan. The Plan and Zoning Commission shall certify to
the City Council that the final development plan is in conformity with the
previously filed preliminary development plan, and meets all the requirements
for a final development plan.
         (b)   A final plan is in substantial compliance with the approved
preliminary plan if it includes, but is not limited to, the following:
            1.   Development density and intensity have not materially changed,
in that:
               a.   The number of buildings has not increased by more than 10%;
               b.   The number of stories is the same or fewer;
               c.   The height of the building(s) has not increased by more
than 5%;
               d.   The number of units is the same or fewer;
               e.   The lot coverage and floor area ratio are the same or less;
               f.   The number of bedrooms and corresponding parking spaces
have increased or decreased by as much as 10%, based on the entire plan,
provided the plan complies with all other requirements of this subchapter and
of this chapter; and
               g.   The floor area ratio may have been transferred from one
building to another or from one stage of development to another, provided that
the total floor area ratio has not changed;
            2.   Design has not materially changed, in that:
               a.   The roadway patterns, particularly ingress-egress points,
are in the same general location as shown on the original plans, and are no
closer to the rear or interior side property lines than shown on the original
plans;
               b.   The parking area is in the same general location and
configuration;
               c.   The building setbacks are the same or a greater distance
from perimeter property lines, except that the building setbacks for detached,
single-family development; zero-lot-line, row-house, townhouse and cluster
development may also have decreased; provided that the decrease is limited so
that the resulting setback distance will be the greater of either the
underlying zoning district regulations, or any condition or restrictive
covenant regulating the setback for which a substantial compliance
determination is sought;
               d.   The landscaped open space is in the same general location,
is of the same or greater amount, and is configured in a manner that does not
diminish a previously intended buffering effect;
               e.    The proposed perimeter walls and/or fences are in the same
general location and of a comparable type and design as previously approved;
               f.   Elevations and renderings of buildings have substantially
similar architectural expressions as those shown on the approved plans;
               g.   Recreational facilities, if shown on plans approved by a
prior zoning action, either remain the same or have been converted from one
recreational use to another;
               h.   If recreational facilities were not shown in the approved
plans, they may be added; provided there is no increase in lot coverage or
decrease in required open space, and they are located internally within the
proposed development;
               i.   Signage is no greater in number or size, and is placed in
the same general location on the site as approved by zoning action;
                  i.   However, changes in the size or number of signs, when
they are not used for advertising, but are used for direction or to facilitate
services of the development, is permitted;
                  ii.   An entrance sign location may be moved the same
proportional distance as a relocated entrance drive;
               j.   The proposed changes do not have the effect of creating any
noncompliance or nonconformity with the strict application of the zoning code
that was not previously approved at a public hearing, or of expanding the scope
of existing variations, alternative, site-development options, or other
approvals pursuant to alternative development standards, such that they would
differ to a greater degree from the strict application of the zoning code;
               k.   Additional out-parcels may be added where there is no
increase in the project's total floor area ratio or lot coverage, there is no
reduction in the total amount of landscaped open space, and the addition of the
out-parcel does not result in noncompliance with any other provision of this
division on any other portion of the subject property;
               l.   Reductions in the number of parking spaces on the site are
permitted, if sufficient parking spaces are provided to satisfy the
requirements of this code.
            3.   If the Plan and Zoning Commission finds that the final
development plan does not substantially conform to the preliminary development
plan, or that it does not meet the requirements for a final development plan,
it shall so notify the applicant and the City Council in writing,
      (5)   After receiving a recommendation from the Plan and Zoning
Commission, the City Council shall approve, approve with modifications or
disapprove the preliminary development plan, or refer the matter back to the
PZC for further deliberation.
         (a)   The City Council shall approve the final development plan if it
is in conformity with the preliminary development plan and meets all the
requirements for a final development plan.
         (b)   The City Council may approve a final development plan the PZC
does not find to be substantially concurrent with the preliminary plan, upon a
finding that final plan is in keeping with the required standards for a planned
development. The approval shall be considered a concurrent review of the plan,
as described in §
156.142(F) of this chapter. City Council shall approve final development plans
by resolution.
   (H)   Within five years of a planned development being approved, outlots
subject to the conditions of the planned development and the review procedures
set forth in Chapter 153.20, can be granted approval of one variation by Plan
and Zoning Commission without amending the planned development, as long as the
variation requested from the underlying zoning district was not addressed or
specifically approved during approval of the planned development.
      (1)   Notification requirements for the public hearing must adhere to §
156.120(E)(3).
      (2)   If two or more variations are requested or if the request is to
vary something specifically approved in the planned development, then a public
hearing to amend the planned development is required before the Plan and Zoning
Commission.
      (3)   This division does not apply to an individual residential lot owner
requesting variations after a residence has been constructed. Such variations
are subject to §
156.122.
(Ord. 21-016, passed 8-18-21)
§ 156.143 MODIFICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS FOR PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   Except as modified by and approved in the documents authorizing the planned
development, a planned development shall be governed by the regulations of the
district or districts in which it is located.
   (A)   (1)   A planned development may provide for exceptions from the
district regulations governing:
         (a)   Use;
         (b)   Density;

      (2)   No modifications of the district requirements or the subdivision
design standards may be allowed when the proposed modification would result in:
         (a)   Inconvenient or unsafe access to the planned development;
         (b)   Unsafe traffic conditions;
         (c)   An undue or disproportionate burden on public parks,
recreational areas, schools, fire and police protection, and other public
facilities that serve, or are proposed to serve, the planned development;
         (d)   A development that will be incompatible with the purpose of this
chapter, and the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan of the city;

§ 156.144 GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   Planned development shall be authorized based on the standards specified in
§
156.142(E)(6). To further define those standards and convey in more detail the
city's expectations for planned development, the guidelines below present city
development goals.
   (A)   The proposed development will not injure or damage the use, value and
enjoyment of surrounding property, nor hinder or prevent the development of
surrounding property in accordance with the comprehensive land use plan of the
city.
   (B)   The proposed development can be substantially completed within the
period of time specified in the schedule of development submitted by the
applicant.
   (C)   The entire tract or parcel of land to be occupied by the proposed
development shall be held in a single ownership, or if there are two or more
owners, the application for the proposed development shall be filed jointly by
all the owners.
   (D)   The development plan shall contain the proposed covenants, easements
and other provisions relating to the bulk and location of buildings, uses and
structures and public facilities as are necessary for the welfare of the
planned development, and are not inconsistent with the best interest of the
city. The covenants, easements and other provisions, if part of the development
as finally approved, may be modified, removed or released only with the consent
of the City Council, after a public hearing before, and recommendation by, the
Plan and Zoning Commission as provided in this subchapter.
   (E)   Sanitary sewers, storm sewers and water supply to service the
development are adequate to serve the proposed development, and will not reduce
existing capacity below that necessary to serve existing developments, or
overload local facilities beyond design capacity.
   (F)   The location and arrangement of structures, parking areas, walks,
lighting and appurtenant facilities is compatible with the surrounding land
uses, and any part of a proposed development not used for structures, parking
and loading areas, or accessways, is landscaped or otherwise improved.
   (G)   The project area is adaptable to unified development, and shall have
within or through the area no physical features that will tend to destroy the
neighborhood or community cohesiveness.
   (H)   The uses proposed in the development are necessary or desirable, and
the need for the uses is clearly demonstrated by the applicant.
   (I)   Any modifications of the zoning or other regulations that would
otherwise be applicable to the site are warranted by the design of the
development plan.
   (J)   All proposed streets and driveways are adequate to serve the
residents, occupants, visitors or other anticipated traffic of the planned
development, as assured by:
      (1)   Entrance points or locations of streets and driveways to
previously-existing public roadways shall be subject to approval by the city;
      (2)   Traffic controls on public roadways within or adjacent to the
development will be provided by the city, as and where determined necessary by
the City Council. The City Council may require, as a condition of approving a
proposed planned development, that the cost of installing the traffic controls
be borne by the applicant;
      (3)   The installation of traffic control devices shall be done in
accordance with installation schedules and standards as ordinarily applied on
all public streets;
      (4)   If traffic control devices are required to prevent or relieve
hazards or congestion on adjacent streets, and the proposed control device is
not within the normal or scheduled sequence of installations, the devices may
be provided by the developer upon permission by the City Council.
(Ord. 21-016, passed 8-18-21)
§ 156.145 ADDITIONAL STANDARDS FOR PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   Intent. A planned development is intended to encourage innovative
designs in the development of land.
   (B)   Additional standards and criteria for planned developments.  In
addition to the standards and criteria set forth in §
156.142(E)(6), planned developments shall comply with the following standards
and criteria.
      (1)   Modifications from district regulations.  Modifications from
district regulations shall adhere to §
156.143, Modification of District Regulations for Planned Developments, and
comply with the following standards.
         (a)   Lowland yards, as required by §
156.073 of the zoning code, shall not be varied.
         (b)   Lot coverage can exceed the amount required by §
156.073, up to 5%, provided the Plan and Zoning Commission and the City Council
find that the development has incorporated environmentally-sensitive design and
energy-efficient practices that will mitigate the increased coverage.
      (2)   Design standards.
         (a)   Design guidelines.
            1.    Design guidelines, as contained in
Appendix B, shall apply to the planned development, unless an applicant chooses
to establish their own set of guidelines as part of the planned development,
establishing more creative and site-specific standards.
            2.   When guidelines are created for a planned development, the
city's guidelines will be used as a baseline for review, and similar or better
standards are expected.
            3.   The Plan and Zoning Commission will make recommendation on,
and the City Council may approve, such guidelines.
            4.   Planned developments following the city's design guidelines
may deviate from the recommendations, provided it is determined that the
deviation is justifiable and does not alter the intent of the guidelines.
         (b)   Exterior building materials.  Deviations from the standards
contained in
Appendix A are permitted if justified by the applicant. Structures or buildings
that demonstrate exceptional architectural merit and/or an intention to reflect
the historic character of the city may deviate from the provisions of
Appendix A, Exterior Building Materials, to allow the use of different
materials, or to allow the use of a different percentage or proportion of the
materials otherwise required in the exterior finish of a structure or building.
      (3)   Standards for open space. Open space provided in a planned
development may be as proposed by the applicant, required under standards of
the city code, or as a condition of city approval of the planned development.
No open space may be delineated or accepted under the provisions of this
subchapter unless it is in keeping with the following standards.
         (a)   All land shown on the final development plan as planned open
space must either be:
            1.   Conveyed to a public body, if the public body agrees to accept
conveyance, to maintain the planned open space and any buildings, structures or
improvements that have been placed in it; or
            2.   Conveyed to a homeowners' association or similar organization
organized for the purpose, among others, of owning and maintaining common
buildings, areas and land within the planned development. The planned open
space must be conveyed, subject to covenants to be approved by the city, which
restrict the planned open space to the uses specified on the final development
plan, and which provide for the maintenance of the planned open space in a
manner that assures its continuing use for its intended purpose.
         (b)   No portion of a planned development shall be conveyed or
dedicated by a developer, or any other person, to any public body or a
homeowners' association, unless the Plan and Zoning Commission has determined
that the character and quality of the tract to be conveyed make it suitable for
the purposes for which it is intended. When making its determination, the Plan
and Zoning Commission shall consider the size and character of the dwellings to
be constructed within the planned development, the topography and existing
trees, ground cover, and other natural features; the manner in which the open
area is to be improved and maintained for recreational or amenity purposes; and
the existence of public parks or other public recreational facilities in the
vicinity.
      (4)   Signs.  The city may require, as a condition of the special use
permit, more restrictive sign regulations than otherwise permitted by the city
code.
      (5)   Additional standards for residential planned developments.
Densities recommended by the city comprehensive plan need not be strictly
adhered to, provided the development will not negatively impact neighboring
development, is sufficiently buffered from adjacent properties, and closely
applies the city’s design principles included in the comprehensive plan.
      (6)   Additional standards for planned developments with commercial uses.
For commercial uses located within a planned development, regulations other
than those of the underlying district may be applied, subject to the following
restrictions.
         (a)   Structures and uses shall be located, designed and operated so
as to have direct pedestrian access to residential areas, if applicable.
         (b)   Layout of parking and loading areas, service areas, entrances,
exits, yards, courts, landscaping and the control of signs, lighting, noise and
other potentially adverse influences shall be mitigated to avoid impact on the
residential areas within or adjoining the development.
         (c)   The structures and uses, by reason of their location,
construction, manner of timing of operation, shall not have adverse effects on
residential uses within or adjoining the development, or create traffic
congestion or hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
         (d)   Design standards shall be as set forth in division (B)(2) above.

§ 156.146 ZONING ADMINISTRATION; PERMITS FOR PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   The Zoning Administrator may approve the issuance of permits for site
or building construction for that part of the development plan that has been
approved, in the area covered by the approved final development plan, for work
in conformity with the approved final development plan, and with all other
applicable ordinances and regulations.
   (B)   The Zoning Administrator shall not approve an occupancy permit for any
building or structure shown on the development plan of any stage of the planned
development, unless the planned open space and public facilities allocated to
that stage of the development have been conveyed to the proper authorities. A
certificate of occupancy for any completed building or structure located in an
area covered by the approved final development plan may be issued, if the
completed building or structure conforms to the requirements of the approved
final development plan and all other applicable regulations and ordinances of
the city.
(Ord. 21-016, passed 8-18-21)
§ 156.147 FAILURE TO BEGIN DEVELOPMENT; ENFORCEMENT OF DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULES
FOR PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   The Zoning Administrator shall review as necessary all permits issued
for the planned developments, and examine construction that has taken place, to
compare actual development with the approved development schedule.
   (B)   If the Zoning Administrator finds any of the following, they shall
notify City Council in writing.
      (1)   The planned development has failed to meet the approved
construction schedule.
      (2)   When no development schedule was approved with the planned
development, and no substantial construction has begun based on he submitted
construction schedule, or no use established within one year from the date
final plans were approved.
      (3)   Construction has not commenced or been completed in accordance with
the terms of the development schedule and/or phasing plan.
      (4)   The rate of construction of dwelling units is greater than the rate
at which planned open space and public and recreational facilities have been
constructed and provided.
      (5)   The planned development has failed to follow the requirements of
the planned development.
   (C)   Within 30 days of the notice from the Zoning Administrator, the City
Council may revoke the special use permit, and the land shall revert to its
former classification, unless the landowner shows good cause for why the
development schedule may revised. The City Council may approve a revised
development schedule extending existing approvals for a specified time frame.
As part on this consideration by the City Council:
      (1)   Written notice shall be sent to the address of the applicant listed
in the planned development application by first class mail, notifying the
applicant of the meeting;
      (2)   At the meeting, the applicant shall be permitted to respond and
present evidence on the applicant's own behalf.

§ 156.148 AMENDING THE PLANNED DEVELOPMENT FINAL PLAN.
   (A)   Application required.  No changes may be made to the approved final
development plan except when processed under the procedures set forth as
follows.
      (1)   If either the developer or owner of the planned development wishes
to change the planned development by deviating from the approved final
development plan, they shall make written application to the city for approval
of the change.
      (2)   The application shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator, who
will then make a written determination of whether the change is major or minor.
      (3)   Any deviations without the necessary approval shall serve
automatically to revoke the original approval and to void future action
pursuant to the planned development.
   (B)   Minor changes. If the Zoning Administrator determines that the changes
are minor, the Zoning Administrator may approve such minor changes, errors or
omissions in the planned unit development.
      (1)   MINOR CHANGES are defined as all changes other than those that
qualify as a major change.
      (2)   At their sole discretion, the Zoning Administrator may refer minor
changes to Plan and Zoning Commission for review and action.
      (3)   If heard by the Plan and Zoning Commission, a minor change to the
planned unit development does not require a public hearing.
      (4)   Approved minor changes shall be reported to the City Council and
filed with the City Attorney.
   (C)   Major changes.  If the Zoning Administrator finds proposed alterations
to an approved final development plan are major changes, then such changes
shall require approval by the City Council, upon recommendation from Plan and
Zoning Commission, who shall make a determination of their recommendation under
the procedure defined by this chapter for approval of the special use permit,
including a public hearing at Plan and Zoning Commission. Each of the following
shall be deemed a MAJOR CHANGE:

landscaping;
      (11)   Changes in the development schedule;
      (12)   Changes in use;
      (13)   Modifications in the proportion of housing types;
      (14)   Altering roadways;
      (15)   Changes in the final governing agreements, provisions or
covenants, or other changes that change the concept or intent of the
development.
   (D)   Changes recorded as amendments.  Any changes approved shall be
recorded as amendments to the recorded copy of the final development plan.
