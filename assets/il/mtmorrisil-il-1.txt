other than storage; residential use, conducting retail sales of any kind,
servicing or repair of vehicles, industrial use, or any other occupation shall
not be permitted. The storage of flammable liquids, highly combustible or

light the parking lot; provided, that such fixtures shall be shaded wherever
necessary to comply with Section 10-10-1 of this Code.”

The Village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the

Administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
Local Tax Administrator that the payment is fourteen (14) days delinquent, the

years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   C.   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
Village, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the
calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was filed,
whichever occurs later.
   D.   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was

1-9-14: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
Local Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
Local Tax Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. Except for the amount of tax and interest due
under this section, a taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application
may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period
before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the
underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the Local Tax
Administrator, whichever is longer. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the Local Tax Administrator, whichever is longer. (2017 Code)
1-9-15: PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES; COPIES:
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the Village
Clerk's Office. (2017 Code)
1-9-16: REVIEW OF LIENS:
The Local Tax Administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the Local Tax Administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the Local Tax Administrator shall:
A. Timely remove the lien at the Village's expense;
B. Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
C. Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (2017 Code)

2-2-5: SPECIAL USES:
   A.   Purpose: The development and execution of the zoning ordinance is based
upon the division of the Village into districts, within any one of which the
use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings or structures,
as related to the land, are essentially uniform. It is recognized, however,
that there are special uses, which, because of their unique character, cannot
be properly classified in any particular district or districts without
consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring lands
and upon the public need for the particular use or the particular location.
Such special uses fall into the following categories:
      1.   Uses operated by a public agency or publicly regulated utilities, or
uses traditionally affected with a public interest.
      2.   Uses entirely private in character, but of such a nature that the
operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon
neighboring property or public facilities. (1979 Code § 2-6-5)
   B.   Authority:
      1.   Special uses shall be authorized or denied by the Village Board in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and title 10 of this Code,
applicable to amendments of this chapter, or title 10 of this Code, and the
regulations and conditions set forth in this chapter, and title 10 of this
Code, for special uses.
      2.   No application for a special use shall be acted upon by the Village
Board until after:
         a.   A written report is prepared and forwarded to the Village Board
by the Plan Commission in a manner prescribed herein for amendments to this
chapter, or title 10 of this Code; and
         b.   A public hearing has been held by the Plan Commission after due
notice by publication as prescribed herein, for amendments, and the findings
and recommendations of the Plan Commission have been reported to the Village
Board. (1979 Code § 2-6-5; amd. 2017 Code)
   C.   Initiation: An application for a special use may be made by any person,
firm or corporation, or by any office, department, board, bureau or commission
requesting or intending to request a building permit or occupancy certificate.
   D.   Processing:
      1.   An application for a special use, in such form and accompanied by
such information as shall be established from time to time by the Plan
Commission, shall be filed with the Village Clerk and thereafter processed in
the manner prescribed heretofore for applications and amendments. (1979 Code §
2-6-2)
      2.   The Plan Commission shall hold the public hearing and forward its
recommendations in the form of a written report to the Village Board within
thirty (30) days following the date of public hearing on each application,
unless it is withdrawn by the petitioner. During its review of the special use
application, and in formulating its recommendations, the Plan Commission shall
take the following into consideration: (1979 Code §
2-6-2; amd. 2017 Code)
         a.   That the proposed use at that particular location requested is
necessary or desirable to provide a service or a facility which is in the
interest of public convenience and will contribute to the general welfare of
the neighborhood or community; and
         b.   That such use will not under the circumstances of the particular
case be detrimental to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of persons
residing or working in the vicinity or injurious to property values or
improvement in the vicinity; and
         c.   That the proposed use will comply with the regulations and
conditions specified in this chapter for such use, and with the stipulation and
conditions made a part of the authorization granted by the Village Board of
Trustees.
   E.   Decisions: The Village Board, upon report of the Plan Commission and
without further public hearing, may grant or deny any proposed amendment in
accordance with applicable statutes of the State of Illinois, or may refer it
back to the Plan Commission for further consideration. (1979 Code § 2-6-5)

This lien is superior to all other liens and encumbrances, except tax liens and
as otherwise provided in subsection D of this section.
   C.   To perfect a lien under this section, the Village must, within one (1)
year after the removal cost is incurred, file notice of lien in the Office of

sent the tax bill for the general taxes on the property for the taxable year
immediately preceding the removal activities. The notice must be delivered or
sent after the removal activities have been performed, and it must: 1) state

implementing this section; 2) identify the underlying parcel, by common
description; and 3) describe the removal activity.

as in case of mortgages or mechanics' liens. An action to foreclose a lien
under this section must be commenced within two (2) years after the date of
filing notice of lien.
   G.   Any person who performs a removal activity by the authority of the
Village may, in his or her own name, file a lien and foreclose on that lien in
the same manner as the Village under this section.
   H.   A failure to file a foreclosure action does not, in any way, affect the
validity of the lien against the underlying parcel.
   I.   Upon payment of the lien cost by the owner of the underlying parcel
after notice of lien has been filed, the Village (or its agent under subsection
G of this section) shall release the lien, and the release may be filed of

replacement of the utility pole or wireless support structure at the cost of
the provider.
   The Village shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific
code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is based, and
send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the Village denies
an application.
   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the Village and
resubmit the revised application once within thirty (30) days after notice of
denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee.
The Village shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30)
days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved.
Failure to resubmit the revised application within thirty (30) days of denial
shall require the application to submit a new application with applicable fees,
and recommencement of the Village's review period.
   The applicant must notify the Village in writing of its intention to proceed
with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be submitted
with the revised application.
   Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies
cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not apply if the

Master Small Wireless Facilities Attachment Agreement contains additional
requirements that are applicable to the wireless provider and the small
wireless facility.
D.   Application Approval: Within thirty (30) days after receiving an
application, the Village shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the Village must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the Village fails to provide notification to the applicant within
thirty (30) days after all documents, information and fees specifically
enumerated in the Village's permit application form are submitted by the
applicant to the Village.
   Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the Village sends the notice
of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information.
E.   Tolling Period: The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
   1.   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the Village; or
   2.   A local, State or federal disaster declaration or similar emergency
that causes the delay.
F.   Consolidated Applications: An applicant shall be allowed to file a
consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation of up
to twenty-five (25) small wireless facilities if the collocations each involve
substantially the same type of small wireless facility and substantially the
same type of structure.
   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the Village
may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat
separately small wireless collocations for which incomplete information has
been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment or that are
denied. The Village may issue separate permits for each collocation that is
approved in a consolidated application.

7-4-6: COLLOCATION REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS:
A.   Public Safety Space Reservation: The Village may reserve space on
municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the Village's
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably
determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
B.   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
C.   No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The wireless
provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not interfere with
the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
   A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and
frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety
agency's communications equipment.
   Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance
with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable
interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a
public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such interference,
and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by
the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall
remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and
resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established
by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672
through 47 CFR 90.675.
   The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on
such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code
of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the
interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
D.   Prohibited Areas: The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless
facilities on Village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution
or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole
or the electric supply zone of the pole.
   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility
may be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on
the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
   For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
E.   Compliance With Applicable Law: The wireless provider shall comply with
all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern
public safety.
F.   Design Standards: The wireless provider shall comply with written design
standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or
reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth
in a Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, a comprehensive
plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the
rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district. At a
minimum, the wireless provider shall screen or conceal, as applicable, all
pole-mounted and ground-mounted equipment in the public right-of-way with
aesthetic features, such as canisters, paint, screen walls and landscaping, as
approved by the Village with each permit. Concealing and screening shall blend
with or enhance the surrounding area with the use of artistic and/or
architectural detail and shall take into account scale, form, texture,
materials and color and shall conceal the equipment. Concealing and screening
features shall be noted on the site survey and construction drawings submitted
with each application.
G.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this Collocation Requirements
and Conditions Section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocate
small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility
poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility
pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small
wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the Village may propose
that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or
existing wireless support structure within one hundred (100) feet of the
proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to
use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the
alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional
material costs as determined by the applicant.
   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
H.   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall
be no more than ten (10) feet above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
   New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which
small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
   1.   Ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other
than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on
the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred (300) feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed
utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation
for such facility; or
   2.   Forty-five (45) feet above ground level.
I.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height for a
new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the
small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply
for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth
in this chapter. A request for variance shall be processed by the Village as
follows:
   1.   The Village building official shall decide whether a variance is
authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the variance
request on an individual basis.
   2.   The Village Building Official may authorize a variance only if the
applicant requesting the variance has demonstrated that: (a) one or more
conditions not under the control of the applicant (such as terrain features or
an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would make
enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be
achieved by the provision; and (b) all other designs, methods, materials,
locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a
variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   3.   Any applicant aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or
determination, including denial of a variance, made by the building official
under the provision of this chapter shall have the right to appeal to the
Village Board, or such other board or commission as it may designate. The
application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the Village clerk
within thirty (30) days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or
determination. The Village Board shall commence its consideration of the appeal
at the board's next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven (7)
days after the filing of the appeal. The Village Board shall timely decide the
appeal.
J.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply with
requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a private
property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to
utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
K.   Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: The wireless provider shall comply with
applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning
the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way if the
requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses wireless
provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit granting of
such exceptions or variances.
L.   Under Grounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with local
code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that
prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles
in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a waiver,
zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new utility
poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the replacement
of utility poles.
M.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is granted
shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance of the
permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend this
period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or
by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided
the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after
the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the
additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty
(360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void
unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant. (Ord. 07-
01-18, 7-10-2018)
7-4-7: ANNUAL FEE:
A wireless provider shall pay to the Village an annual fee to collocate a small
wireless facility on a Village utility pole according to the following
schedule:
A.   Located On The Right-Of-Way: If the small wireless facility is collocated
on a Village utility pole located in the right-of-way, the wireless provider
shall be charged an annual fee that equals the greater of (i) two hundred
dollars ($200) per year; or (ii) the actual, direct and reasonable costs
related to the wireless provider's use of space on the Village utility pole.
B.   Located Outside The Right-Of-Way: If the small wireless facility is
collocated on a Village utility pole located outside the right-of-way, the
wireless provider shall be charged an annual fee that equals the actual, direct
and reasonable costs related to the wireless provider's use of space on the
Village utility pole.
   If the Village has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs,
the fee shall be two hundred dollars ($200) payable on the first day after the
first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to
collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter. (Ord. 07-01-18, 7-
10-2018)
7-4-8: MISCELLANEOUS:
A.   Exceptions To Applicability: Nothing in this chapter authorizes a person
to collocate small wireless facilities on:
   1.   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by
the Village or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
   2.   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
   3.   Property owned by a rail carrier registered under section 18(c)-7201 of
the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter

service, or electric utility. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to an
electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the
facilities are being used, developed and maintained consistent with the
provisions of subsection (i) of section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act.
   For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given
to that term in section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this
chapter shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement (a) to
obtain a franchise or a state-issued authorization to offer cable service or
video service or (b) to obtain any required permission to install, place,
maintain, or operate communications facilities, other than small wireless
facilities subject to this chapter.
B.   Pre-Existing Agreements: Existing agreements between the Village and
wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities
in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on
Village utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for
all small wireless facilities collocated on the Village's utility poles
pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before June 1, 2018, subject
to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this chapter.
   A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the Village on the
effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the Village
makes available under this chapter for the collocation of small wireless
facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of
small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two
or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying the Village that
it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing agreement remains in
effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small wireless
facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the Village's utility poles
pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before the wireless provider
provides such notice and exercises its option under this paragraph.
C.   Abandonment: A small wireless facility that is not operated for a
continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned. The
owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within ninety
(90) days after receipt of written notice from the Village notifying the
wireless provider of the abandonment.
   The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, by the Village to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety
(90) days of such notice, the Village may remove or cause the removal of such
facility pursuant to the terms of its Master Small Wireless Facilities
Attachment Agreement or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of
nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery.
   A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the Village if it sells
or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village.
Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless

effective under State or Federal pretreatment regulations, compliance with the
more stringent requirements will be mandatory for industries discharging to
Village sewers.
   E.   Disposition Of Wastes Containing Prohibitive Substances:
      1.   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in subsection D of this section, and/or which
are in violation of the standards for pretreatment provided in chapter 1, EPA
Rules and Regulations, subchapter D, Water Programs Part 128- Pretreatment
Standards, Federal Register Volume 38, No. 215, Thursday, November 8, 1973, and
any amendments thereto, and which in the judgment of the Village may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the Village may:
         a.   Reject the wastes;
         b.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
         c.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/
or
         d.   Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges, under the provisions
of section
8-2-1 of this chapter.
      2.   If the Village permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Village, and subject to the requirements of
all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.
   F.   Grease, Oil And Sand Interceptors: Grease, oil, and sand interceptors
shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Village, they are necessary for
the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or
any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Village, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection.
   G.   Maintenance Of Pretreatment Facilities: Where preliminary treatment or
flow equalizing facilities are provided, they shall be maintained continuously
in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   H.   Control Manhole: Each new industry shall be required to install a
control manhole and, when required by the Village, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Village. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and
shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   I.   Measurements, Tests, Analyses: All measurements, tests, and analyses of
the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this
chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard
Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater", published by the American
Public Health Association and shall be determined at the control manhole
provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event
that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the
point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and
property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24 hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from 24 hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples.)
   J.   Special Agreements And Arrangements: No statement contained in this
chapter shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement
between the Village and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of
unusual strength or character may be accepted by the Village for treatment,
subject to payment therefor, in accordance with section
8-2-8 of this chapter, by the industrial concern. (1979 Code § 7-5-5)
8-2-6: PROTECTION OF SEWAGE WORKS FROM DAMAGE:
No unauthorized person shall maliciously, wilfully, or negligently break,
damage, destroy, or tamper with any structure, appurtenance, or equipment which
is a part of the sewage works. Any person violating this provision shall be
subject to immediate arrest under charge of disorderly conduct. (1979 Code § 7-
5-6)
8-2-7: POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTORS:
   A.   Inspections Authorized: The Village and other duly authorized employees
of the Village, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, bearing reasonable identification, shall be
permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of inspection, observation,

chapter.
   B.   Easement Rights: The Village and other duly authorized employees of the
Village bearing reasonable identification shall be permitted to enter all
private properties through which the Village holds a duly negotiated easement
for the purpose of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of the sewage works lying
within said easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on said easement,
shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement
pertaining to the private property involved. (1979 Code § 7-5-7)
8-2-8: WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES, BILLING AND ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Basis For Wastewater Service Charges: The wastewater service charge for
the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the Village
shall consist of a basic user charge for operation and maintenance plus
replacement; and, if applicable, a debt service charge and/or a surcharge.
      1.   The debt service charge shall be computed by dividing the annual
debt service of all outstanding revenue bonds by the number of users. Through
further divisions, the monthly debt service charge can be computed.
      2.   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal
concentrations:
         a.   A five (5) day, twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l); and
         b.   A suspended solids (SS) content of two hundred forty milligrams
per liter (240 mg/l).
         c.   It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus
replacement and shall be computed as follows:
            (1)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the next
fiscal year, for all works categories.
            (2)   Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility
categories by volume, suspended solids and BOD.
            (3)   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of BOD5 and pounds of SS
to be treated.
            (4)   Compute unit treatment costs for volume (dollars per 1,000
cubic feet) for BOD5 (dollars per pound) and for SS (dollars per pound).
            (5)   Compute costs per one thousand (1,000) cubic feet for volume,
BOD5 and SS at normal sewage strength. Add these costs to determine the charge
for operation and maintenance including replacement.
            (6)   Adjust the unit treatment rate per one thousand (1,000) cubic
feet to the actual billings ratio to provide adequate income to operate the
system.
      3.   A surcharge will be levied to all users whose wastewater exceeds the
normal concentrations for BOD (200 milligrams per liter) and SS (240 milligrams
per liter). The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water
meters and/or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the two hundred
milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) and two hundred forty milligrams per liter (240
mg/l) concentration for BOD and SS respectively. Subsection F of this section
specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.
The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by
certified public accountants for the Village in their annual audit report. The
wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in
debt service or a change in operation and maintenance costs including
replacement costs.
   B.   Measurement Of Flow: The volume of flow used for computing basic user
charges and surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the
lowest even increments of ten (10) cubic feet. (1979 Code § 7-5-8)
      1.   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
may be required by the Committee on Water and Sanitary Sewers to install and
maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the Committee on
Water and Sanitary Sewers for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from these other sources.
      2.   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the Committee on Water and Sanitary Sewers if these volumes cannot otherwise
be determined from the metered water consumption record.
      3.   Meter devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned, and maintained by the person. The period between meter
calibration shall not exceed two (2) years. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the Committee on Water and Sanitary Sewers. (1979 Code §
7-5-8; amd. 2017 Code)
   C.   Debt Service Charge: Effective May 1, 2015, each user shall be assessed
a monthly debt service charge which shall be equal to one hundred fifty four
percent (154%) of the basic user rate charged to such user for the same month.
The Village shall review the debt service charge annually in accordance with
subsection A1 of this section and modify or eliminate the debt service charge
as Village obligations, in respect of the wastewater facilities, are satisfied
or retired. (Ord. 04-02-15, 4-14-2015)

      1.   The surcharge per person shall be computed by the following formula:
S = V (0.06238) [ (A (BOD5 - 200) ) + (B (SS - 240) ) ]
Where:      
 S       = Amount of surcharge in dollars.
 V       = Wastewater volume in thousand cubic feet units.
 0.06238 = Unit weight of water x 10-6 per thousand cubic feet.
 A       = Unit charge for BOD5 per pound (subsection E of this section).
 BOD5    = 5 day biochemical oxygen demand, milligrams per liter.
 200     = Allowable BOD strength.
 B       = Unit charge for SS per pound (subsection E of this section).
 240     = Allowable SS, milligrams per liter.
 
      2.   The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges shall be
established by waste sampling. Waste sampling shall be performed as often as
may be deemed necessary by the Committee on Water and Sanitary Sewers and shall
be binding as a basis for surcharge.
   G.   Computation Of Wastewater Service Charge: The wastewater service charge
per person shall be computed by the following formula:
W = D + M + ( V - 1,000) R+S
     1,000
Where:
    
 W = Amount of wastewater service charge in dollars per billing period.
    
 D = Debt service charge.
    
 M = Minimum charge for operation, maintenance and replacement (subsection D
      of this section).
    
      Wastewater volume in cubic feet, per billing period to the lowest
 V = increments of 10 cubic feet. For a wastewater volume less than 1,000
      cubic feet per billing period, this part of the formula equals 0.
    
 R = Basic user rate for operation, maintenance and replacement (subsection D
      of this section).
    
 S = Amount of surcharge (subsection F of this section).
 
   H.   Bills:
      1.   For the purpose of the operation of the sewerage system of the
Village, all residential, commercial, industrial and other establishments in
the Village shall pay the charges and rates hereinabove provided for sewer
service, and such charges shall be made monthly after the expiration of the
monthly period for which the service has been supplied, and such charge shall
be payable within fifteen (15) days after rendition of the monthly sewer bill.
In the event such bills are not paid within said fifteen (15) day period, a
penalty of ten percent (10%) shall be added thereto.
      2.   Every application for sewer service shall be made by and signed by
the owner of the premises to be served. Every premises served shall constitute
a separate account in the owner's name. All bills for sewer service shall be
the responsibility of, and sent to, the owner of the premises served. The owner
of the premises served, included successors in title, shall be deemed to be the
applicant, customer, consumer and user for sewer service provided to the
premises regardless of whether such owner or successor in title is the end-user
of the sewer service provided or whether such owner or successor has signed the
service application.
      3.   Every application for sewer service shall constitute an agreement by
the applicant to pay for all water used on the premises through said service
and to comply with all ordinances, rules, regulations and policies of the
Village then in effect or that may thereafter be adopted. The application shall
be on forms provided by the Village Clerk. The Village reserves the right to
deny sewer service when an application is incorrect or incomplete.
      4.   The Village may deny sewer service to any applicant when such
applicant owes the Village a delinquent bill for service to another premises.
      5.   It shall be the duty of the purchaser of any premises within the
Village (including by deed into trust or deed in lieu of foreclosure) to first
ascertain from the Village any delinquent sewer service bill which may have
accrued before purchasing the premises. The purchaser shall notify the Village
in writing of the intention to purchase the property at least five (5) days
prior to the closing date
   I.   Nonpayment Of Bills; Notice Of Delinquency; Shutoff: In the event the
charges for sewer service are not paid within fifteen (15) days after the
rendition of the bill, then such service charges shall be deemed and are hereby
declared to be delinquent. If the delinquency and payment of the sewer charges
continues for a period of more than fifteen (15) days, the sewer service may be
discontinued; provided, however, that prior to such shutoff, a written notice
shall be mailed or delivered to the persons liable for such bill, notifying
them of their right to request an administrative hearing before the Village
President or his designee within ten (10) days of the date of the notice, and
at the hearing, present their objections to such actions. The sewer service
shall not be shut off until the hearing has been held and the Village President
or his designee has made a decision on the basis of the evidence presented at
the hearing. When the sewer service has been discontinued by reason of a bill
remaining unpaid for thirty (30) days after it is rendered, connection for
restoring use of the sewer system shall not be made except upon compliance with
this provision. In addition, a lien claim may be filed with the Recorder of
Deeds at the Ogle County Courthouse, Oregon, Illinois, by the Village Clerk for
any bill for sewer service which remains unpaid for thirty (30) days after it
has been rendered by the Village Clerk. The lien shall contain the legal
description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill and a notice
that the Village claims a lien for this amount as well as for all charges for
sewer services subsequent to the period covered by the bill. Notice of the lien
shall be mailed to the owner of such premises as shown on the real estate tax
records of the Assessor's Office at the Ogle County Courthouse, Oregon,
Illinois.
   J.   Foreclosure Of Lien: Property subject to a lien for unpaid sewer
charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of such sale

   I.   Whenever a building or structure used or intended to be used for
dwelling purposes, because of dilapidation, decay, damage or faulty
construction or arrangement is unsanitary or unfit for human habitation and is

   A.   When a building or structure within the Village is found to be a
"dangerous building" or contains an unsafe condition, the Village Clerk shall
issue and cause to be served a notice thereof upon all owners of record or
persons having an interest therein as shown by documents recorded in the Office
of the County Recorder of Deeds and upon persons in apparent possession of the
premises.
   B.   The notice shall briefly and concisely specify the conditions and
factors of the building or structure which renders it dangerous or unsafe. The
notice shall further specify that the owners make the building safe (by
complete elimination of any unsafe conditions) or commence demolition at
owner's costs within fifteen (15) days of such notice. The notice shall further
specify that demolition shall commence no later than fifteen (15) days of such
notice, and a date for completion of demolition. The date for completion shall
be reasonably set in light of the nature of the building, weather conditions,
and other related factors. The fifteen (15) day time period shall commence
three (3) days after the notice is mailed or upon personal service of the
notice.

personal service or by mail. Personal service may be made by a Police Officer
of the Village or other person designated by the Village President and Board of
Trustees.
   D.   Where, upon diligent search, the identity or whereabouts of the owner
or owners of any such building, including the lienholders of record, are not
ascertainable, notice mailed to the person or persons in whose name such real
estate was last assessed for general real estate taxes is sufficient notice
under this section.
   E.   In the event the owner fails to comply with any time period set forth
in the notice, the Village Attorney is authorized to commence a civil action in
the Circuit Court of the County seeking a court order authorizing demolition or
repair of the building or structure subject to the notice provided by this
section and to create the lien described in this chapter. It shall not be a
defense to this cause of action that the building is boarded up or otherwise
enclosed. It further shall not be a defense that the building is put in a safe
condition during the pendency of the civil action.
   F.   Joined as defendants in such cause shall be the owner of record and
other parties having an interest in the property as shown by documents recorded
in the Office of the County Recorder of Deeds on the date of the filing of the

Upon the commencement of the civil action set forth in subsection 9-3-4E of
this chapter, a lis pendens designating the property upon which the subject
building is located shall be filed with the Recorder of Deeds. Failure to file
or the improper filing of the lis pendens does not, however, affect the civil
action for demolition. Any person obtaining or recording in such office an
interest in the property after such filing may become party to the civil action
only if he intervenes by order of the court. (Ord. 12-01-13, 12-10-2013, eff.
12-10-2013)
9-3-6: DEMOLITION LIEN; PERSONAL JUDGMENT:
   A.   The cost of demolition or repair incurred by the Village, including
court costs, attorney fees and other costs related to the enforcement of this
chapter is recoverable from the owner or owners of the real estate and is a
lien thereon, which lien shall be superior to all prior existing liens and
encumbrances, except taxes; provided, however, that within sixty (60) days
after completion of the demolition or repair, the Corporation Counsel shall
file a notice of lien for the cost and expense incurred by the Village, in the
Office of the Recorder of Deeds of the County. Upon payment of such cost of
demolition by the owner or any person who has an interest in the property, the
lien shall be released by the Corporation Counsel.
   B.   The lien may be enforced by proceedings to foreclose as in case of
mortgages or mechanic's liens or any procedure allowed by law.
   C.   If payment of the Village's cost of demolition is not paid to the
Village within fifteen (15) days of the filing of the notice of lien, the
Village Attorney may commence proceedings in the Circuit Court seeking a
personal judgment from the owner of the subject property at the time the
complaint for demolition was filed with the Circuit Clerk in the amount of such
costs. The action authorized by this subsection shall be in addition to, and
without waiver of, any other remedies. (Ord. 12-01-13, 12-10-2013, eff. 12-10-

title in harmony with their general purpose and intent, but only in the
specific instances hereinafter set forth. In order to vary the zoning
regulations, the Plan Commission shall make a finding of fact based upon the
standards hereinafter prescribed, that there are practical difficulties or
particular hardships involved in the application of the strict letter of the
regulations of this title.
   B.   Application: Application for a variation shall be filed in the same
manner as an application for a special use permit as provided in this Code.
   C.   Hearings: Public hearings shall be held pursuant to this Code.
   D.   Standards: Standards for variations are as follows:
      1.   The Plan Commission shall not vary the regulations of this title,
unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each
specific case that:
         a.   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances;
         b.   The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the locality.
      2.   In determining whether the strict application of this title creates
practical difficulties for, or imposes a particular hardship on, an applicant
for a variation, the Plan Commission shall consider the extent to which the
following facts have been established by the evidence:
         a.   The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
condition of the specific property involved would result in a particular
hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the
strict letter of the regulations were carried out;
         b.   The conditions upon which the petition for a variation are based
are unique and would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the
same zoning classification;
         c.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to obtain a higher financial return on the property;
         d.   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any
person presently having an interest in the property;
         e.   The granting of the variation will not be materially detrimental
to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located; and
         f.   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in
the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public
safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the
neighborhood.
      3.   The Plan Commission may impose such conditions and restrictions upon
the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to reduce or minimize
the injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood,
and better to carry out the general intent of this title.
   E.   Variations: Variations from regulations of this title may be granted
only in the following instances, and in no others:
      1.   To permit any setback or yard less than the setback or yard required
by this title;

imposed by this title but not more than twenty five percent (25%) of the
allowable height;
      3.   To permit the use of a lot for a use otherwise prohibited solely
because of insufficient area of the lot, but in no event shall the area of the
lot be less than eighty percent (80%) of the required lot area;
      4.   To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two (2) or more uses, provided the substantial use of
such facility by each use does not take place at approximately the same hours
of the same days of the week;
      5.   To reduce the applicable off-street parking by not more than one (1)
parking space or twenty percent (20%) of the number of spaces required,
whichever number is greater; and
      6.   To increase by not more than twenty five percent (25%) the maximum
distance that required parking spaces may be located from the use served. To
exceed any of the authorized variations allowed under this section, when a lot
of record of a zoning lot, vacant or legally used on the effective date hereof
is by reason of the exercise of the right of eminent domain by an authorized
governmental body or by reason of a conveyance under threat of an eminent
domain proceeding, reduced in size so that the remainder of said lot of record
or zoning lot or structure on said lot does not conform with one (1) or more of
the regulations of the district in which said lot of record or zoning lot or
structure is located.
      7.   To permit a commercial radio and television transmitting antenna
tower and other electronic equipment requiring outdoor towers and including
microwave relay towers and antenna towers for the dispatching of private
messages to exceed the height limitations imposed by this title.

application as provided by this Code.
   G.   Time Period Of Variation Granted: No order of the Village Board
granting a variation shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months

10-17-1: INTRODUCTION:
   A.   This chapter details requirements for planned unit development. A
special use permit for a planned unit development allows an innovative and
imaginative design and provides that each case is considered individually.
   B.   Different types of planned unit developments are possible: cluster
developments of single-family dwellings on reduced sized lots with common open
space and developments combining two (2) or more land uses in a coordinated
whole.
   C.   The unique and substantially different character of planned unit
developments requires their administrative processing as a "special use" in
this title. Planned unit developments are more complex and of a different
character than other special uses requiring the establishment herein of
specific and additional procedures, standards and exceptions to guide the
recommendations of the Plan Commission and the action of the Village Board.
(1979 Code § 5-17-1)
10-17-2: BASIC PROVISIONS AND REQUIREMENTS:
The basic provisions and requirements concerning planned unit development are
as follows: The subdivision, development and use of land containing fifteen
(15) or more acres as an integral unit, which may combine more than one (1)
primary land use and which may provide for one-family residential, multiple-
family residential, education, limited commercial, recreational, park and
common use areas may be described as planned unit development.
   A.   In its establishment and authorization as a special use, in addition to
the foregoing provisions, the following procedures, requirements, restrictions,
standards and conditions shall be observed.
   B.   The planned unit development may be excluded from the provisions of the
subdivision regulations of title 11 of this Code to the extent specified in the
final authorization of the planned unit development.
   C.   Any commercial or business use to be combined with a residential or
multiple-family residential use shall be limited as follows:
      1.   The commercial or business use must be confined to a community use
building located within the development.
      2.   The commercial or business use may not exceed twenty percent (20%)
of the total square footage of the community use building.
      3.   The commercial or business use must be available for the general
public's use.
      4.   The proposal shall provide for sufficient off-street parking for the
commercial or business uses. (1979 Code § 5-17-2)
10-17-3: LOCATION OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:
A planned unit development may be located in any district zoned for a use which
is a component of that planned unit development. No planned unit development
may be located in a district which is not zoned for one (1) component of that
planned unit development. (1979 Code § 5-17-3)
10-17-4: PRELIMINARY PLAN:
The applicant shall request the special use permit, by letter addressed to the
Village Board, to be placed on the agenda of the meeting of the Plan Commission
