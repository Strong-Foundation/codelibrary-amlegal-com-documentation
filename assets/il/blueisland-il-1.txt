   (A) Continuances. No continuances shall be authorized by the Hearing Officer

notice, the Ordinance Enforcement Administrator shall send or cause to be sent
notices by first class mail postage prepaid to the person who received the
notice; or the violation of the city motor vehicle code, the registered owner
or operator of the “cited vehicle” at the address as is recorded with the
Secretary of State, and shall be sent to the lessee of the “cited vehicle” at
the address last known to the lessor of the “cited vehicle” at the time of the
lease. Service of notices sent in accordance herewith shall be complete as of
the date of deposit in the United States mail.
      (4)   A Hearing Officer may set aside any judgment entered by default and
set a new hearing date, upon a petition filed within 21 days after the issuance
of the order of default, if the Hearing Officer determines that the
petitioner’s failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause or at any time
if the petitioner establishes that the municipality did not provide proper
service of process. If any judgment is set aside pursuant to this division (D)
(4), the Hearing Officer shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing

one day of paid leave per year to any city employee.
(Ord. 2023-043, passed 12-12-2023)
§ 34.07 POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   Prohibition on sexual harassment. It is unlawful to harass a person
because of that person’s sex. The courts have determined that sexual harassment
is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of
1964, as amended in 1991 by Pub. Law No. 102-166, and being 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e
et seq. and 42 U.S.C. § 1981. All persons have a right to work in an
environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable
misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. It
is a policy of city to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal
official, municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal agency or office on
the basis of sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal agents,
municipal employees and municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from
sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship or
lack thereof.
   (B)   Definition of sexual harassment. This policy adopts the definition of
sexual harassment as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, 775 ILCS 5/1-101,
which currently defines SEXUAL HARASSMENT as:
      (1)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment;
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      (2)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
         (a)   Verbal. Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor
and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature;
         (b)   Non-verbal. Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, “catcalls”, “smacking”
or “kissing” noises;
         (c)   Visual. Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites;
         (d)   Physical. touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault; and
         (e)   Textual/electronic. “Sexting” (electronically sending messages
with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (email, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line
postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and
Twitter).
      (3)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a “reasonable person”.
   (C)   Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment.
      (1)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes
herself or himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the
incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her or
his position to the offending employee, and her or his immediate supervisor. It
is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the
report.
      (2)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following.
         (a)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her or his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
         (b)   Contact with supervisory personnel.
            1.   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person
making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics
officer, the city manager or administrator, or the chief executive officer of
the municipality.
            2.   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
         (c)   Resolution outside municipality.
            1.   The purpose of this policy is to establish prompt, thorough
and effective procedures for responding to every report and incident so that
problems can be identified and remedied by the municipality. However, all
municipal employees have the right to contact the Illinois Department of Human
Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for
information regarding filing a formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR
complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is
a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must be filed within 300 days.
            2.   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report
(what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
            3.   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted
and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
   (D)   Prohibition on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment
allegations.
      (1)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:
         (a)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy;
         (b)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy; or
         (c)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
      (2)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
      (3)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
      (4)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein,
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
         (a)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a
public body an activity, policy or practice of any officer, member, state
agency or other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes is
in violation of a law, rule or regulation;
         (b)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state
employee; or
         (c)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
      (5)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer
may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
      (6)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it
is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to
conspire, to retaliate against a person because he or she has opposed that
which he or she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment
in employment, because he or she has made a charge, filed a complaint,
testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or
hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.
      (7)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge, due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of the
alleged retaliation.
   (E)   Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual harassment.
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the
prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject
to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or discharge by
the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to
local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each violation may constitute a
separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate
and distinct from any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or
penalties imposed by a court of law or a state or federal agency.
   (F)   Consequences for knowingly making a false report.
      (1)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
      (2)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the state police, a
State’s Attorney, the Attorney General or any other law enforcement official is
guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An Ethics Commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.
   (G)   Reporting and independent review of allegations of sexual harassment
against an elected official by an elected official.
      (1)   Pursuant to the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS
430/70-5), City Council members and other elected city officials are encouraged
to promptly report claims of sexual harassment by a Council member or other
elected official. Every effort should be made to file such complaints as soon
as possible, while facts are known and potential witnesses are available. If
the official or Council member feels comfortable doing so, he or she should
directly inform the individual that the individual’s conduct or communication
is offensive and must stop.
      (2)   City Council members and other elected officials should report
claims of sexual harassment against a City Council member or other elected
official to the City’s Judiciary Committee for investigation. If the report is
made to the Mayor, the Mayor shall promptly notify the Judiciary Committee.
Reports of sexual harassment will be confidential to the greatest extent
possible.
      (3)   When a complaint of sexual harassment is made against a City
Council member or other elected city official by another City Council member or
another elected city official, the judiciary committee shall initiate an
investigation into the matter, and if necessary, shall appoint a qualified law
firm that has experience in workplace investigations to conduct an independent
review of the allegations. The independent investigator shall prepare a written
report and submit it to the Judiciary Committee and the other elected
officials.
      (4)   If the investigator concludes that a City Council member or other
elected city official has engaged in sexual harassment, the matter will be
addressed in accordance with the authority of the City Council.
      (5)   City Council members and other elected officials who perform acts
of sexual harassment under this code section, may be held personally liable for
the cost of any city investigation if the alleged sexual harassment claims are
substantiated.

   (A)   Public property.
      (1)   The Mayor shall have the authority to enter into contracts that
grant to one or more persons, subject to the conditions set forth in the
contract and this section, the privilege of installing and maintaining pay
telephones in the public way. Any such contract must be approved as to form and
legality by the City Attorney. In the administration of this section, the Mayor
shall consult and cooperate with all appropriate city departments. The Mayor
may at any time cause to be advertised a request for proposals relating to such
contracts.
      (2)   Such contracts and the method of awarding such contracts shall, to
the greatest extent possible, be designed to:
         (a)   Discourage illegal drug sales and other criminal activity that

         (g)   Generate revenue for the city.
      (3)   Any contract entered into pursuant to this section shall provide
that the privileges granted by the contract are subject to the City Council’s
authority to order the removal of a pay telephone pursuant to division (A)(6)
below. Any such contract shall also permit the City Council or the Mayor to
require pay telephones in the public way to have special features designed to
reduce criminal activity. In addition, the contract must provide that the
Aldermen must be notified of the location of any pay telephone that is to be
situated in the public way in his or her ward pursuant to this section. No
person shall be awarded a contract under this section unless the person has a
valid certificate of service authority to provide pay telephone service granted
by the State Commerce Commission where required by law.
      (4)   No person may install a pay telephone in the public way on or after
the effective date of this section unless installation is made pursuant to a

      (6)   The City Council may at any time after 10-1-1993, or at any time
after the effective date of this section if pursuant to a contract under this
section, by ordinance order the removal of a particular pay telephone that is
in the public way. Such an ordinance must identify the location of the
telephone to be removed. Any pay telephone that is not removed within 14 days
after an ordinance ordering its removal is adopted shall be subject to
immediate removal at the owner’s expense by the city.
      (7)   Any pay telephone removed by the city pursuant to this section may
be reclaimed by its owner within 30 days after its removal. The owner must
reimburse the city for its removal and storage costs before any such telephone
may be reclaimed. Such costs shall also include the costs of removing any
installation ancillary to the pay telephone, and the costs of restoring the
public way to its original condition. Any telephone not so reclaimed may be
disposed of as unclaimed property.
      (8)   Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be

of such outdoor public telephone.
      (2)   The City Clerk shall only issue a permit to install or continue
maintenance of an outdoor public telephone upon the direction of the Judiciary
Committee of the City Council made after it has conducted a hearing to
determine whether such a permit should be issued.
      (3)   The Judiciary Committee of the City Council shall conduct a hearing
to determine whether a permit allowing installation or continued maintenance of
an outdoor public telephone shall be issued. This hearing will be conducted
within 30 days of receipt of an application by the office of the City Clerk
requesting a permit to install or continue maintenance of an outdoor public
telephone. The City Clerk shall prepare an application form which shall include
appropriate information identifying the applicant, the applicant’s business
address, telephone number and the proposed or existing location of the public
telephone. The City Clerk will give all filed applications to the Chairperson
of the Judiciary Committee who shall then immediately notify the Aldermen of
the ward where a permit is sought that an application has been made.

after hearing and determining, by a majority vote, that:
         (a)   The placement and location of the public telephone will not be
detrimental to the public welfare;
         (b)   The placement and location of the public telephone will not be
injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which it is
or will be located; and
         (c)   The public telephone is not or will not be located outside of or

impede or restrict the movement or access of the public on or about any public
way.

within 30 days of the date the application for permit is made in the office of
the City Clerk, said permit shall be considered to be granted.

Judiciary Committee denying a permit to install or continue maintenance of an
outdoor public telephone, the applicant may do so by filing a written notice of
appeal with the office of the City Clerk within ten business days of the date
of the decision of the Judiciary Committee. The appeal shall be to the entire
City Council and shall be heard within 30 days after the date the notice of
appeal is filed. The City Clerk shall prepare an appropriate notice of appeal
form.
         (b)   The City Council may reverse or affirm the decision of the
Judiciary Committee by a majority vote. The Mayor shall vote to break all ties.
         (c)   The decision of the City Council shall be final.
      (7)   (a)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no
outdoor public telephone may be installed on or after the effective date of
this section unless a permit has been obtained for the telephone pursuant to
this section.
         (b)   Any outdoor public telephone installed prior to the effective
date of this section for which a permit has not been obtained must be removed
no later than October 1, 1993, unless application for a permit and a permit
allowing continued maintenance of the outdoor public telephone has been issued
pursuant to the terms of this section.
      (8)   (a)   Any permit issued pursuant to this section shall be subject
to revocation if the Judiciary Committee makes a determination, after written
notice and a hearing, that:
            1.   The public telephone is detrimental to the public welfare;
            2.   The placement and location of the public telephone is
injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which it is
located; or
            3.   The public telephone is located outside of or attached to a
building or structure in such a manner as to impede or restrict the movement or
access of the public on or about any public way.

shown in the permit application for the location in question. The hearing shall
be conducted in accordance with the provisions of division (B)(3) above. A
right of appeal shall exist and any appeal shall be conducted in accordance
with the provisions of division (B)(6) above.
      (9)   (a)   Every application for a permit filed pursuant to this section
shall be accompanied by a fee of $50 for each property affected if the
application is filed on or before 10-1-1993, and $100 for each property

suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
by reason of the fact that such person is or was an elected or appointed
official, employee or agent of the city against expenses (including attorney
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if
such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the city, and with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe his or her
conduct was unlawful, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect
to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged
to be liable for willful and wanton negligence or misconduct in the performance
of such person’s duty to the city.
   (B)   Any indemnification under division (A) above shall be made by the City
Council upon receipt of a determination by legal counsel for the city that

conduct set forth in division (A) above have been met. Such authorization shall

Mayor and City Council.
   (C)   The city reserves the right to select legal counsel in defending

or appointed officials, employees or agents for the city in any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,

or appointed official, employee or agent choose to select other legal counsel
for their defense, the city shall have no obligation to indemnify, defend or
pay for the legal costs and expenses to defend and represent such elected or
appointed official, employee, or agent. In this instance the city may select
legal counsel of its choice to defend and represent the city’s interests.

or representation shall cooperate fully and completely with any legal counsel
selected by the city to represent their interests. Failure to cooperate may
result in the loss of indemnification by the city if the City Council
determines, by a majority vote of a quorum of its members consisting of the
Mayor and City Council, that the failure to cooperate was intentional. No such
revocation or termination of indemnification and defense shall be made until
the person or persons refusing to cooperate in their defense have been notified
of the possible revocation and termination and have been allowed a public
hearing by the City Council for the purpose of determining if their failure to
cooperate was intentional.

warrant and only as authorized by § 7(e) of the Illinois Open Meetings Act, 5
ILCS 120/1 et seq.
      (2)   To the extent that this policy and rules conflict with any other
rule of the City Council, this policy will control during a disaster and while

committees and commissions unless and until such boards, committees and
commissions adopt their own rules for remote meetings or hearings held during a
disaster and/or pursuant to the Illinois Open Meetings Act.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

jurisdiction of the public body is covered by the disaster area.
      (2)   Upon such a declaration by the Governor or the Director of the

modifications that may be necessary during the period of the disaster may be
declared by the Mayor from time to time. The City Council may approve, by

the limitations of the Act and parameters of this policy.
      (3)   Once this policy is activated, the City Council shall convene open
and closed meetings subject to the parameters of this policy and the Act for

be physically present at the regular meeting location, the following rules

meeting may be limited based on the nature of the disaster and any such
limitations shall be stated on the meeting notice as discussed herein.

meetings will be its elected and appointed officers choosing or otherwise
required to attend in person. If the in-person attendance maximum is not met,
the next person(s) to be admitted shall be one member of the Associated or
Local Press. To ensure eligibility for entry, the member of the press must
email City Clerk, Randy Heuser, at rheuser@cityofblueisland.org. The first
email received will determine the press member admitted to any City Council
meeting held during the disaster period where this policy is in place.
Thereafter, if the in-person attendance maximum is not met, members of the
public shall be admitted. Admittance will be determined by which member of the
public emails City Clerk, Randy Heuser, at rheuser@cityofblueisland.org and
requests admittance on a first-come, first-serve basis. If no person requests
admittance via email, admittance shall be granted on a first-come, first serve
basis.

any applicable health or other requirements that may be ordered.
         (d)   Members of the public attending in-person at the regular meeting
location of the city must be able to hear all discussion and testimony and all
votes of the City Council.
      (8)   When in-person attendance at the regular meeting location is not
feasible, in whole or in part, due to the disaster, the city shall make
alternative arrangements, and provide notice of such alternative arrangements
on the meeting notice, as discussed herein, whereby the members of the public
must be able to contemporaneously hear all discussion, testimony and roll call
votes. Such alternative access may include, but is not limited to, offering an
alternative physical location with a video and audio feed of the meeting, a
telephone conference number, or a web-based access link.
      (9)   In addition to providing any in-person comments, any person
desiring to make public comment may also email their public comment to City
Clerk, Randy Heuser, at rheuser@cityofblueisland.org by 4:00 p.m. on the day
upon which the City Council holds a meeting during the time when this policy is
activated. Public comments received by email will be read during the public
comment section and will be noted in the meeting minutes. Emailed public
comments must be limited to 200 words, must identify the commenter, and are
limited to one comment per person. If the remote meeting platform allows for
live public comment, then the rules applicable to public comment with respect

otherwise attempt to conduct city business unless otherwise recognized and
allowed by the City Council.

hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax determination, audit
or assessment. The strict rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings

the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty of 5% of the amount of tax required to be shown as due on a return
shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of 5% of the tax due shall be
imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided by the
controlling tax ordinance and prior to the city issuing a notice of tax
delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be
assessed equal to 25% of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period
for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty
shall not apply if a failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling
ordinance.

   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not

local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the filing
of the application but not more than four years before the date of filing the
application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not
be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for any period before the
date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined
and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid
tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.

§ 38.01 POLICY.
   It is the policy of the city to prudently invest public funds in a manner
which will provide the highest investment return with the maximum security
while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the city and conforming to all
state statutes governing the investment of public funds.   
(Prior Code, § 38.01) (Ord. 99-286, passed 12-14-1999)
§ 38.02 SCOPE.
   (A)   This investment policy applies to all financial assets of the city.
The financial assets of the Police and Firefighter’s Pension Funds are subject
to the orders of their respective Boards of Trustees. The following funds are
accounted for in the city’s comprehensive annual financial report and include:
2.1 Funds
   2.1.General Fund
   2.1.Special Revenue Funds
   2.1.Capital Project Funds
   2.1.Debt Service Funds
   2.1.Enterprise Funds
   2.1.Trust and Agency Funds

          exempt)
 
(Prior Code, § 38.02) (Ord. 99-286, passed 12-14-1999)
§ 38.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AGENCIES. Informal name that refers to securities issued by the United
States government and U.S. government-sponsored agencies.
   ASKED. The trading price proposed by the prospective seller of securities.
Also called the offer or offered price.
   BANKER’S ACCEPTANCE (BA). A short-term financial instrument that is the
unconditional obligation of the accepting bank.
   BASIS POINT (BP). A unit of measurement for interest rates or yields that
are expressed in percentages. (One hundred basis points equal 1%.)
   BID. The trading price acceptable to a prospective buyer of securities.
   BOND EQUIVALENT YIELD (BEY). An annual yield, expressed as a percentage,
describing the return provided to bond holders. The BEY is a way to compare
yields available from discount securities such as treasury bills and BAs with
yields available from coupon securities.
   BROKER. A party who brings buyers and sellers together. BROKERS do not take
ownership of the property being traded. They are compensated by commissions.
They are not the same as dealers; however, the same individuals and firms that
act as brokers in some transactions may act as dealers in other transactions.
   CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT (CD). A deposit of funds, in a bank or savings and
loan association, for a specific term that earns interest at a specified rate
or rate formula. CDs may be secured or unsecured, may be in negotiable or
nonnegotiable form and may be issued in either physical or book entry form.
   COLLATERAL. Securities, evidence of deposit or other property which a
borrower pledges to secure repayment of a loan. Also refers to securities
pledged by a bank to secure deposits of public monies.
   COMMERCIAL PAPER (CP). Unsecured, short-term promissory notes issued by
corporations for specific amounts and with specific maturity dates.
   COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT (CAFR). The official annual report for
the city. It includes five combined statements and basic financial statements

also includes supporting schedules necessary to demonstrate compliance with
finance-related legal and contractual provisions, extensive introductory
material and a detailed statistical section.
   COUPON.
      (1)   The annual rate of interest that a bond’s issuer promises to pay
the bondholder on the bond’s face value.
      (2)   A certificate attached to a bond evidencing interest due on a
payment date.
   DEALER. A firm or individual who buys and sells for their own account.
Dealers have ownership between a purchase from one party and a sale to another
party. Dealers are compensated by the spread between the price they pay and the
price they receive.
   DEBENTURE. A bond secured only by the general credit of the issuer.
   DELIVERY VERSUS PAYMENT (DVP). The simultaneous exchange of securities and
cash. The safest method of settling either the purchase or sale of a security.
In a DVP settlement, the funds are wired from the buyer’s account and the
security is delivered from the seller’s account in simultaneous independent
wires.
   DISCOUNT. The amount by which the price for a security is less than its par.
   DISCOUNT SECURITIES. Securities that do not pay periodic interest. Investors
earn the difference between the discount issue price and the full face value
paid at maturity. Treasury bills, banker’s acceptances and zero coupon bonds
are DISCOUNT SECURITIES.
   DIVERSIFICATION. Dividing investment funds among a variety of securities
offering independent returns.
   FEDERAL CREDIT AGENCIES. Agencies of the federal government set up to supply
credit to various classes of institutions and individuals, such as, S & L’s,
small business firms, students, farmers, farm cooperatives and exporters.
   FEDERAL DEPOSIT OF INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC). A federal agency that
insures bank deposits, currently up to $250,000 per deposit.
   FEDERAL FUNDS RATE. The rate for which overnight federal funds are traded.
   FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS (FHLB). The institutions that regulate and lend to
savings and loan associations. The federal home loan banks play a role
analogous to that played by the federal reserve banks vis-a-vis member
commercial banks.
   FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (FNMA or FANNIE MAE). FNMA is a
federal corporation working under the auspices of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, HUD. It is the largest single provider of residential
mortgage funds in the United States. Fannie Mae, as the corporation is called,
is a private stockholder- owned corporation. The corporation’s purchases
include a variety of adjustable mortgages and second loans in addition to
fixed-rate mortgages. FNMA assumes and guarantees that all security holders
will receive timely payment of principal and interest.
   FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE (FOMC). Consists of seven members of the
Federal Reserve Board and five of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents. The
President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank is a permanent member while the
other presidents serve on a rotation basis. The Committee periodically meets to
set Federal Reserve guidelines regarding purchases and sales of government
securities in the open market as a means of influencing the volume of bank
credit and money.
   FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. The central bank of the United States created by
Congress and consisting of a seven-member Board of Governors in Washington,
D.C., 12 regional banks and about 5,700 commercial banks that are members of
the system.
   GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (GNMA or GINNIE MAE). GNMA, like
FNMA, was chartered under the Federal National Mortgage Association Act of
1938. Securities guaranteed by GNMA and issued by mortgage bankers, commercial
banks, savings and loan associations and other institutions. Security holder is
protected by full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Ginnie Mae
securities are backed by FHA, VA or FMHM mortgages. The term passthroughs is
often used to describe Ginnie Maes.
   INTERNAL CONTROLS. Must be designed to ensure that the assets of the city
are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal control structure should
be designed to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met. The
concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of a control should
not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and the valuation of costs and
benefits requires estimates and judgments by management. Internal controls
should address the following points.
      (1)   Control of collusion. Collusion is a situation where two or more
employees are working in conjunction to defraud their employer.
      (2)   Separation of transaction authority from accounting and record
keeping. By separating the person who authorizes or performs the transaction
from the people who record or otherwise account for the transaction, a
separation of duties is achieved.
      (3)   Custodial safekeeping. Securities purchased from any bank or dealer
including appropriate collateral (as defined by state law) shall be placed with
an independent third party for custodial safekeeping.
      (4)   Avoidance of physical delivery securities. Book-entry securities
are much easier to transfer and account for since actual delivery of a document
never takes place. Delivered securities must be properly safeguarded against
loss or destruction. The potential for fraud and loss increases with physically
delivered securities.
      (5)   Clear delegation of authority to subordinate staff members.
Subordinate staff members must have a clear understanding of their authority
and responsibilities to avoid improper actions. Clear delegation of authority
also preserves the internal control structure that is contingent on the various
staff positions and their respective responsibilities.
      (6)   Written confirmations or telephone transactions for investments and
wire transactions. Due to the potential for error and improprieties arising
from telephone transactions, all telephone transactions should be supported by
written communications and approved by the appropriate person. Written
communications may be via fax if on letterhead and if the safekeeping
institution has a list of authorized signatures.
      (7)   Development of a wire transfer agreement with the lead bank or
third party custodian. The designated official should ensure that an agreement
will be entered into and will address the following points: controls, security
provisions, and responsibilities of each party making and receiving wire
transfers.
   LIQUIDITY. A liquid asset is one that can be readily converted to cash
through sale in an active secondary market.
   LOCAL GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT POOL (LGIP). Pools through which governmental
entities may invest short term cash. Examples of LGIP’s are the Illinois Funds,
administered by the Illinois State Treasurer and the Illinois Metropolitan
Investment Fund.
   MARKET VALUE. The price at which a security could presumably be purchased or
sold.
   MARK TO MARKET. The process of restating the carrying value of an asset or
liability to equal its current market value.
   MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENT. A written contract covering all future
transactions between the parties to repurchase - reverse repurchase agreements
that establishes each party’s rights in the transactions. A MASTER AGREEMENT
will often specify, among other things, the right of the buyer-lender to
liquidate the underlying securities in the event of default of the seller-
borrower.
   MATURITY. The date upon which the principal or stated value of an investment
becomes due and payable.
   MONEY MARKET. The aggregation of buyers and sellers actively trading money
market instruments.
   OFFER OF OFFERED PRICE. The trading price proposed by the prospective seller
of securities (also called the asked or asking price).
   OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS. Purchases and sales of government and certain other
securities in the open market by the New York Federal Reserve Bank as directed
by the FOMC in order to influence the volume of money and credit in the
economy. Purchases inject reserves into the bank system and stimulate growth of
money and credit; sales have the opposite effect. OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS are
the Federal Reserve’s most important and most flexible monetary policy tool.
   PORTFOLIO. Collection of financial assets belonging to a single owner.
   PREMIUM. The amount by which the price for a security is greater than its
par amount.
   PRIMARY DEALER. A group of government securities dealers that submit daily
reports of market activity and positions and monthly financial statements to
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and are subject to its informal oversight.
Primary dealers include Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-registered
securities broker-dealers, banks and a few unrelated firms.
   PRUDENT PERSON RULE. An investment standard. In some states, the law
requires that a fiduciary, such as a trustee, may invest money only in a list
of securities selected by the state - the so-called legal list. In other
states, the trustee may invest in a security if it is one which would be bought
by a prudent person of discretion and intelligence who is seeking a reasonable
income and preservation of capital.
   QUALIFIED PUBLIC DEPOSITORIES. A financial institution which does not claim
exemption from the payment of any sales or compensating use or ad valorem taxes
under the laws of this state, which has segregated for the benefit of the
commission eligible collateral having a value of not less than its maximum
liability and which has been approved by the Public Deposit Protection
Commission to hold public deposits.
   RATE OF RETURN. The yield obtainable on a security based on its purchase
price or its current market price. This may be the amortized yield to maturity
on a bond or the current income return.
   REINVESTMENT RISK. The risk that all or part of the principal may be
received when interest rates are lower than when the security was originally
purchased, so that the principal must be reinvested at a lower rate than the
rate originally received by the investor.
   REPURCHASE AGREEMENT (RP or REPO). A holder of securities sells these
securities to an investor with an agreement to repurchase them at a fixed price
on a fixed date. The security “buyer” in effect lends the “seller” money for
the period of the agreement, and the terms of the agreement are structured to
compensate him or her for this. Dealers use RP extensively to finance their
positions. Exception: When the Fed is said to be doing RP, it is lending money,
that is, increasing bank reserves.
   SAFEKEEPING. A service rendered by banks whereby securities and valuables of
all types and descriptions are held by the bank.
   SEC RULE 15C3-1. See UNIFORM NET CAPITAL RULE.
   SECONDARY MARKET. Markets for the purchase and sale of any previously issued
financial instrument.
   SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). The federal agency with
responsibility for regulating financial exchanges for cash instruments.
   SPREAD OVER TREASURIES. The difference between the bond equivalent yield for
any investment and the bond equivalent yield for a treasury investment with the
same maturity.
   TREASURY BILLS (T-BILLS). Short-term obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury
for maturities of one year or less. They do not pay interest but are issued on
a discount basis instead.
   TREASURY BOND (T-BONDS). Long-term obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury
with initial maturities of more than ten years.
   TREASURY NOTES (T-NOTES). Medium-term obligations issued by the U.S.
Treasury with initial maturities of from one to ten years.
   UNIFORM NET CAPITAL RULE. Securities and Exchange Commission requirement
that member firms as well as non-member broker dealers in securities maintain a
maximum ratio of indebtedness to liquid capital of 15 to 1; also called net
capital rule and net capital ratio. Indebtedness covers all money owed to a
firm including margin loans and commitments to purchase securities, one reason
new public issues are spread among members of underwriting syndicate. Liquid
capital includes cash and assets easily converted to cash.
   YIELD. Loosely refers to the annual return on an investment expressed as a
percentage on an annual basis. For interest-bearing securities, the yield is a
function of the rate, the purchase price, the income that can be earned from
the reinvestment of income received prior to maturity, call or sale. Different
formulas or methods are used to calculate YIELDS.
(Prior Code, § 38.03) (Ord. 99-286, passed 12-14-1999)
§ 38.04 PRUDENCE REQUIRED.
   (A)   Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances
then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence
exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for
investment, considering the probable safety of their capital, as well as the
probable income to be derived.
   (B)   The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be
the “prudent person” standard and shall be applied in the context of managing
an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written
procedures and the investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be
relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a
timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
(Prior Code, § 38.04) (Ord. 99-286, passed 12-14-1999)
§ 38.05 OBJECTIVES.
   The primary objectives, in priority order of the city’s investment
activities shall be:
   (A)   Legality. Investments of the city will be made in conformance with
federal and state laws, as well as complying with local ordinances and internal
policies.
   (B)   Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the
investment program. Investments of the city shall be undertaken in a manner
that seeks to insure the preservation of capital in the portfolio.
      (1)   Credit risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss due to the failure of
the security issuer or backer. Credit risk may be mitigated by:
         (a)   Limiting investments to the safest types of securities;
         (b)   Pre-qualifying the financial institutions, broker/dealers,
intermediaries and advisers with which the city will do business; and
         (c)   Diversifying the investment portfolio so that potential losses
on individual securities will be minimized.
      (2)   Interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that the market
value of securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in general
interest rates. Interest rate risk may be mitigated by:
         (a)   Structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature
to meet cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to
sell securities on the open market prior to maturity; and
         (b)   By investing operating funds primarily in shorter-term
securities.
   (C)   Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid
to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is
accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent
with cash needs to meet anticipated demands. Furthermore, since all possible
cash demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should consist largely of
securities with active secondary markets.
   (D)   Return on investments. Return on investment is of tertiary concern
when compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above. The
investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market
rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account
the investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. Investments are limited to
very low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to
the risk being assumed. Securities shall not be sold prior to maturity with the
following exceptions:
      (1)   A declining credit security could be sold early to minimize loss of
principal;
      (2)   A security swap would improve the quality yield or target duration
in the portfolio; or
      (3)   Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold.
(Prior Code, § 38.05) (Ord. 99-286, passed 12-14-1999)
§ 38.06 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
   Authority to manage the city’s investment program is derived from the
following: the establishment of investment policies is the responsibility of
the City Council. Management and administrative responsibility for the
investment program is hereby delegated to the Finance Director who, under the
direction of the Chief of Staff, shall establish written procedures for the
operation of the investment program consistent with this investment policy.
Procedures should include references to: safekeeping, delivery vs. payment,
investment accounting, repurchase agreements, wire transfer agreements,
collateral/depository agreements and banking service contracts. Such procedures
shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons responsible for
investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures
established by the Finance Director. The Finance Director shall be responsible
for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to
regulate the activities of subordinate officials. The Finance Director may from
time to time amend the written procedures in a manner not inconsistent with
this policy or with state statutes.
(Prior Code, § 38.06) (Ord. 99-286, passed 12-14-1999)
§ 38.07 ETHICS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   Individuals involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal
business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management
of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial
decisions. Individuals involved in the investment process shall disclose any
interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business. In
addition, such individuals shall disclose any personal financial/investment
positions that could be related to the performance of the investment portfolio.
Individuals involved in the investment process shall refrain from undertaking
personal investment transactions with the same individual with whom business is
conducted on behalf of the city.
(Prior Code, § 38.07) (Ord. 99-286, passed 12-14-1999)
§ 38.08 AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL DEALERS AND INSTITUTIONS.
   (A)   The Finance Director will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services. In addition, a list will also be
maintained of approved security broker/dealers. These may include “primary”
dealers or regional dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15C3-1 (uniform net capital rule). No public deposit shall be
made except on qualified public depository as established by state statutes.
   (B)   All financial institutions and broker/dealers who desire to become

with the following:
      (1)   Audited financial statements;
      (2)   Proof of National Association of Security Dealers (NASD)

time;
   (E)   Short-term discount obligations of the Federal National Mortgage
Association (FNMA) or in shares of other forms of securities legally issued by
savings and loan associations incorporated under the laws of this state or any
other state or under the laws of the United States. Investments may be made

certificates are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC);
and
   (F)   Consistent with the GFOA Recommended Practice on Use of Derivatives by

(Prior Code, § 38.09) (Ord. 99-286, passed 12-14-1999)
§ 38.10 COLLATERALIZATION.
   (A)   It is the policy of the city and in accordance with the GFOA’s
recommended practices on the collateralization of public deposits, (see
Appendix C), that the city requires that funds on deposit in excess of FDIC
limits be secured by some form of collateral. The city will accept any of the
following assets as collateral:
      (1)   Government securities;
      (2)    Obligations of federal agencies;
      (3)   Obligations of federal instrumentalities; and
      (4)   Obligations of the state.
   (B)   The city reserves the right to accept/reject any form of the above
named securities.
   (C)   The city also requires that all depositories that hold city deposits
in excess of the FDIC limit must agree to utilize the city’s collateralization
agreement, (see Appendix C).
   (D)   The amount of collateral provided will not be less than 110% of the
fair market value of the net amount of public funds secured. The ratio of fair
market value of collateral to the amount of funds secured will be reviewed
monthly, and additional collateral will be required when the ratio declines
below the level required and collateral will be released if the fair market
value exceeds the required level. Pledged collateral will be held in
safekeeping, by an independent third party depository, or the Federal Reserve
Bank of Chicago, designated by the city and evidenced by a safekeeping
agreement. Collateral agreements will preclude the release of the pledged
assets without an authorized signature from the city. The city realizes that
there is a cost factor involved with collateralization and the city will pay
any reasonable and customary fees related to collateralization.
(Prior Code, § 38.10) (Ord. 99-286, passed 12-14-1999)
§ 38.11 SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY.
   All security transactions, including collateral for repurchase agreements,

§ 38.13 MAXIMUM MATURITIES.
   (A)   To the extent possible, the city will attempt to match its investments
with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific
anticipated expenditure, the city will not directly invest in securities

(Prior Code, § 38.13) (Ord. 99-286, passed 12-14-1999)
§ 38.14 INTERNAL CONTROLS.
   (A)   The Finance Director is responsible for establishing and maintaining
an internal control structure designed to insure that the assets of the city
are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal control structure shall
be designed to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met. The
concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of the control should
not exceed the benefits likely to be derived; and the valuation of costs and
benefits require estimates and judgments by management.
   (B)   Accordingly, the Finance Director shall establish a process for annual
independent review by an external auditor to assure compliance with policies

§ 38.15 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Generally. The investment portfolio will be managed in accordance with
the parameters specified within this chapter. The portfolio should obtain a
market average rate of return during a market/economic environment of stable
interest rates. Portfolio performance should be compared to appropriate
benchmarks on a regular basis.
   (B)   Market yield (benchmark). The city’s investment strategy is passive.
Given this strategy, the basis used by the Finance Director to determine
whether market yields are being achieved shall be the three-month U.S. Treasury
Bill.
(Prior Code, § 38.15) (Ord. 99-286, passed 12-14-1999)
§ 38.16 REPORTING.
   (A)   Generally. The Finance Director shall prepare an investment report at
least monthly, including a succinct management summary that provides a clear
picture of the status of the current investment portfolio. This management
summary will be prepared in a manner which will allow the city to ascertain
whether investment activities during the reporting period have conformed to the
investment policy. The report should be provided to the Chief of Staff, City
Council and available for review by the general public. The report may include
the following:
      (1)   A listing of individual securities or accounts held at the end of
the reporting period;
      (2)   Listing of investments by maturity date;
      (3)   The percentage of the total portfolio which each type of investment
represents;
      (4)   The percentage of the total portfolio which each institution is

maturity periods; and
      (6)   Principal and type of investment by fund.
   (B)   Marking to market. A statement of the market value of the portfolio
shall be issued at least quarterly. This will ensure that the minimal amount of
review has been performed on the investment portfolio in terms of value and
subsequent price volatility. Review should be consistent with the GFOA
Recommended Practice on Mark-to-Market Practices for State and Local Government
Investment Portfolios and Investment Pools (see Appendix F).
(Prior Code, § 38.16) (Ord. 99-286, passed 12-14-1999)
§ 38.17 INVESTMENT POLICY ADOPTION.
   The city’s investment policy shall be adopted by resolution of the city.
This chapter shall be reviewed on an annual basis by the Finance Director and
any modifications made thereto must be approved by the City Council.

APPENDIX B: USE OF DERIVATIVES BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
   GOVERNMENT FINANCE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION
   Recommended Practice
   Use of Derivatives by State and Local Governments
   A derivative is a financial instrument created from or whose value depends
on (is derived from) the value of one or more underlying assets or indexes of
asset values. The term “derivative products” refers to instruments or features
such as collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO’s), interest-only (IOs) and
principal-only (POs), forwards, futures, currency and interest swaps, options,
floaters/inverse floaters and caps/floors/collars. State and local governments
are potential users of derivatives in their roles as debt, cash and pension
fund managers.
   The Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) urges government finance
officers to exercise extreme caution in the use of derivative instruments and
to consider their use only when they have developed a sufficient understanding
of the products and the expertise to manage them. Because new derivative
products are increasingly complex, state and local governments considering
derivatives should use these instruments only if they can evaluate the
following factors, among others, to determine the appropriateness of derivative
use for their jurisdiction:
   1.   Government entities must observe the objectives of sound asset and
liability management policies that ensure safety, liquidity and yield. Because
of the risks involved, the use of derivatives by government entities should
receive particular scrutiny. Certain derivative products may not be appropriate
for all government investors. Characteristics of such products can include:
      •   High price volatility;
      •   Illiquid markets;
      •    Products that are not market-tested;
      •    Highly leveraged products;
      •    Products requiring a high degree of sophistication to manage; and
      •    Products that are difficult to value.
   2.   Government entities should understand that state and local laws may not
specifically address the use of derivatives. Therefore, analysis should include
an examination of considerations, such as:
      •    The constitutional and statutory authority of the governmental
entity to execute derivative contracts;
      •    The potential for violating constitutional or statutory provisions
limiting the entity’s authority to incur debt resulting from the transaction;
and
      •    The application of the government entity’s procurement statutes to
derivative transactions.
   3.   Government entities should be aware of the risks incurred as a result
of use of derivatives. These include, in addition to legal risk, counter party
credit risk, custodial risk, market risk, settlement risk and operating risk.
   4.   Government entities should establish internal controls for each type of
derivative in use to ensure that these risks are adequately managed. Examples
include:
      •   The entity should provide a written statement of purpose and
objectives for derivative use.
      •    Written procedures should be established that provide for periodic
monitoring of derivative instruments.
      •    Managers should have sufficient expertise and technical resources to
oversee derivative programs. Periodic training should be provided.
      •    Recordkeeping systems should be sufficiently detailed to allow
governing bodies, auditors and examiners to determine if the program is
functioning in accordance with established objectives.
      •    Managers should report regularly on the use of derivatives to their
governing body, and appropriate disclosure should be made in official
statements and other disclosure documents.
      •    Reporting on derivative use should be in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principals. Because use of these instruments is a complex
matter, early discussion with public accountants is essential. Specialized
reporting may be required.
   5.   Government entities should be aware if the broker or dealer with whom
they are dealing is merely acting as an agent or intermediary in a derivative
transaction or is taking a proprietary position. Any possible conflict of
interest should be taken into consideration before entering into a transaction.
   6.   Government entities should be aware that there may be little or no
pricing information or standardization for some derivatives. Competitive price
comparisons are recommended before entering into a transaction.
   7.   Government entities should exercise caution in their selection of
brokers, dealers or investment managers and ensure that these agents are
knowledgeable about, understand and provide disclosure regarding the use of
derivatives, including benefits and risks. The entity should secure written
acknowledgment from the
broker or dealer that they have received, read and understood the entity’s debt
and investment policies, including whether derivatives are currently authorized
under the entity’s investment policy, and that the broker, dealer or investment
manager has ascertained that the recommended product is suitable for the
government entity.
   8.   Government entities are responsible for ensuring this same level of
safeguards when derivative transactions are conducted by a third party acting
on behalf of the governmental entity.
(Prior Code, Ch. 38, App. B) (Ord. 99-286, passed 12-14-1999)
APPENDIX C: COLLATERALIZATION OF PUBLIC DEPOSITS
GOVERNMENT FINANCE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION
Recommended Practice
Collateralization of Public Deposits
   Safety of public funds should be the foremost objective in managing public
funds. Collateralization of public deposits through pledging of appropriate
securities is the only way to fully guarantee the safety of such deposits.
   Additionally, public entities should implement programs of prudent risk
control. Such programs could include a formal depository risk policy, credit
analysis and use of fully secured investments.
   Statewide collateralization programs have generally proved to be cost
effective and beneficial for both the public sector and its depositories. In
the absence of an effective statewide collateral program, local officials
should establish and implement collateralization procedures.
(Prior Code, Ch. 38, App. C) (Ord. 99-286, passed 12-14-1999)
APPENDIX D: PUBLIC BODY-FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SECURITY AND CUSTODY AGREEMENT
This Agreement is made and executed this _____ day of ___________________
20_____, by and between the City of Blue Island, Illinois, a body politic and
corporate in the State of Illinois; (“Public Body”),
_____________________________ (“Financial Institution”) and
____________________________(“Custodian”).
WHEREAS, the Public Body desires to continue to maintain deposits of the Public
Body’s funds at the Financial Institution.
WHEREAS, the Financial Institution desires to hold the funds of the Public Body
and can provide pledged securities as collateral security for those deposits;
and
WHEREAS, the Public Body and the Financial Institution desire the Custodian to
maintain custody from time to time of certain of the Financial Institution’s
securities for the benefit of the Public Body as collateral security for the
Public Body’s deposit accounts maintained at the Financial Institution;
NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed by and between the Public Body, the Financial
Institution and the Custodian as follows:
1.   Securities Interest.
The Financial Institution hereby pledges and grants in favor of the Public Body
a lien and continuing security interest in the securities deposited with the
Custodian from time to time, all substitutions and additions thereto, all other
rights and privileges incident to such securities, all proceeds and profits of
any of the foregoing (“Collateral”) as collateral security for all deposit
accounts maintained from time to time by the Public Body with the Financial
Institution. The Financial Institution shall take all necessary steps to
transfer and perfect this security interest pursuant to Illinois Commercial
Code. The lien and security interest pursuant for hereunder shall not be deemed
to disaffirm, replace or otherwise adversely affect the existence and
effectiveness of any lien or security interest previously or hereafter granted
by the Financial Institution in favor of the Public Body, pursuant to this
agreement or otherwise.
2.   Identification and Value of Securities.
The Financial Institution agrees to deposit and the Custodian agrees to accept
any documents necessary to facilitate transfer of title in the event of
subsequent release to the Public Body. With respect to each deposit of pledged
securities made with the Custodian, the Financial Institution will execute and
deliver to the Public Body a written confirmation identifying the pledged
securities and the value thereof (and, if delivered in substitution or
replacement of existing Collateral with the written authorization of the Public
Body, the Collateral being proposed for substitution). The Financial
Institution will also deliver to the Public Body a copy of a receipt by the
Custodian accepting the pledged securities. As used in this agreement, “value”
of Collateral means the lesser of the face principal amount of the securities
constituting Collateral or the current market value. Current market value of
any pledged securities shall be as determined and agreed between the Public
Body and the Financial Institution from time to time, each acting reasonably in
good faith.
3.   Permitted Securities.
Securities pledged hereunder and deposited with the Custodian shall be of one
or more of the following types:
   Government Securities;
   Obligations of Federal Agencies;
   Obligations of Federal Instrumentalities; or
   Obligation of the State of Illinois.
The types of securities may be modified from time to time by agreement between
the Public Body and the Financial Institution.
4.   Public Body Demand for Additional Collateral.
In the event that the amount of all deposits of the Public Body maintained with
the Financial Institution at the close of any business day exceeds 102% of the
value of the Collateral, the Public Body may, by notice to the Financial
Institution, demand that the Financial Institution deliver additional
Collateral to the Custodian, of a value which together with the Collateral then
held by the Custodian, shall equal or exceed 110% (or such other percentage
agreed upon by the Public Body and the Financial Institution) of the amount of
deposits at the close of business that day. The failure of the Financial
Institution to deliver the requested additional Collateral within 24 hours
after the demand by the Public Body shall constitute a default. In addition to
the rights enumerated in Section 13 of this agreement, the Public Body shall
have the right to immediately collect its deposits with the Financial
Institution without penalty.
5.   Release or Substitution of Securities.
The Financial Institution shall have the right at any time to seek to
substitute Collateral of equal value and of the type as permitted under Section
3 and otherwise acceptable to the Public Body. Substituted Collateral shall be
considered Collateral for all purposes. If the substitute collateral is of
equal or greater value, similar maturity and included in Section 3 above,
substitution can take place without approval of the Public Body. Notice of the
substitution should be sent to the Public Body, as provided in this agreement.
If the substitute collateral is not of equal or greater value, the Financial
Institution shall provide to the Public Body, at least 72 hours before the time
of any substitution, a statement of the respective values of the Collateral to
be replaced and the Collateral to be substituted. Except as provided herein,
the Custodian agrees that no Collateral may be released and substituted without
the prior written approval of the Public Body. At all times, the Custodian will
maintain on file the signatures of agents of the Public Body authorized to
approve releases and substitutions.
6.   Financial Institution Representations and Warranties.
   a.   The Financial Institution represents and warrants to the Public Body
that it is the owner of the Collateral and that such Collateral is and will
remain free and clear of any and all security interests, liens and claims of
any other person, except for the security interest granted hereunder to the
Public Body. The Financial Institution shall be deemed to repeat such
representation with respect to Collateral delivered in addition to or in
substitution of then-existing Collateral. The Public Body’s sole obligation to
the Financial Institution with respect to Collateral is to return or cause the
return of the Collateral to the Financial Institution at the termination, and
full performance by the Financial Institution of, its obligations with respect
to all deposits of the Public Body secured hereunder.
   b.   The Financial Institution agrees that all of the statements contained
in this Agreement and in documents executed pursuant to this Agreement are made
to induce the Public Body to deposit its funds in the Financial Institution and
with the knowledge that the Public Body will rely on these statements. This
Agreement shall prevail over the term of any other agreement between the
Financial Institution and the Public Body with which it may conflict.
7.   Approval by Board or Loan Committee of the Financial Institution.
The Financial Institution represents that it is duly authorized, by resolution
of the Board of Directors or the Loan Committee of the Financial Institution,
and has full right, power and authority, to execute this Agreement and the
Custody Agreement, and to pledge and grant a security interest with respect to
the Collateral. The Financial Institution has furnished a certified copy of the
authorizing resolution, attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Financial Institution
shall also furnish additional resolutions, if any, approved by the Board of
Directors or the Loan Committee of the Financial Institution authorizing the
substitution of Collateral or reauthorizing the granting of a security interest
with respect to the existing Collateral.
8.   Continuously Maintain Agreement as Official Record.
The Financial Institution further agrees that it will immediately upon
execution keep and continuously maintain, as part of its official record, an
executed copy of this Agreement, and confirmations executed hereunder and such
other customary writings and records sufficient to identify those securities
which have been pledged to the Public Body.
9.   Maintaining Custody.
The Financial Institution may participate in and use the Federal Book-Entry
Account System, a service provided by the Federal Reserve Bank for its member
banks for deposit of United States Treasury bills, bonds, notes, certificates
of indebtedness and Federal agency securities or the DTC system. The Custodian
may hold securities in its vault and may deposit securities with a depository.
The certificates representing securities, including those in bearer form, may
be held in bulk form with, and may be merged into certificates of the same
class of the issuer which constitutes assets of other accounts or owners
without certification as to the ownership attached. Utilization of a book-entry
system may be made for the transfer or pledge of securities held by the
Custodian or by the securities depository. However, it is understood that the
Custodian shall, at all times, maintain a separate and distinct record of the
securities in the account(s).
10.   Liability of the Custodian.
In the event of its failure to exercise ordinary care, the Custodian will be
liable only for direct damages. The Custodian shall be deemed to have exercised
ordinary care if its actions or failure to act is in conformity with reasonable
practice of the banking industry. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if it becomes necessary for the Public Body to obtain court
enforcement of its rights against the Custodian and the Public Body should
prevail, the Custodian shall be liable for the legal fees and cost of the
Public Body.
11.   Instructions.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Custodian may accept and act upon
instructions from the Financial Institution or the Public Body which
instructions must be in writing on the letterhead of the Financial Institution
or Public Body containing the signature of the person or persons authorized to
provide instructions. Instructions may also be sent by facsimile on the
letterhead of the Financial Institution or Public Body, provided the
instructions are also sent in writing on letterhead within one business day and
both the facsimile and the writing contain the signature of the person or
persons authorized to provide instructions. All instructions and confirmations
given to you hereunder shall be given pursuant to authority contained in
currently effective resolutions of the Public Body and by persons authorized by
such resolutions to give the same. The Public Body will from time to time
furnish you with certified copies of such resolutions and you may rely on
authorizations contained therein until we notify you in writing of a change
thereto.
12.   Events Constituting Default.
The following events shall constitute a default by the Financial Institution
under this Agreement:
   a.   The Financial Institution shall fail to pay when due principal or
interest with respect to any deposit of the Public Body maintained with the
Financial Institution;
   b.   Any representation of the Financial Institution herein shall prove to
have been untrue as of the date made or any date hereafter;
   c.   The Financial Institution shall fail to comply with any covenant or
agreement contained herein and such non-compliance has not been cured within 30
days of the Public Body’s notice thereof to the Financial Institution;
   d.   The failure or suspension of active operations of the Financial
Institution;
   e.   The Financial Institution shall make a general assignment for the
benefit of creditors; admit in writing its inability to pay its debts as they
become due; file a petition in bankruptcy or a petition seeking reorganization,
arrangement, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar
relief under any present or future bankruptcy, insolvency or similar statute,
law or regulation or seek the appointment of any trustee, receiver or
liquidator for the Financial Institution or any material part of its
properties; or
   f.   Any Federal or State agency or any creditor of the Financial
Institution shall file any petition or seek any appointment specified in
subsection e. above, or a conservator, receiver, liquidator or similar person
shall be appointed with respect to the Financial Institution.
13.   Rights Upon Default.
In the event of a default hereunder, the Public Body shall have all the rights
and remedies of a secured party under the Illinois Commercial Code with respect
to the Collateral, including without limitation the right upon default to
collect, liquidate, sell or dispose of the same and to apply the proceeds
thereof (after deduction therefrom all costs and expenses relating to such
collection, liquidation, sale or disposition, including reasonable attorney
fees and court costs) to the payment of any deposit or other liabilities of the
Financial Institution to the Public Body arising out of or as a result of the
default of the Financial Institution in such manner and at such time as the
Public Body may deem appropriate, with the Financial Institution to remain
liable for and to immediately pay to the Public Body any deficiency and with
any overplus to be returned to the Financial Institution as soon as
practicable. Any requirement of the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code for
reasonable notice shall be met by the mailing of written notice to the
undersigned by regular mail at its address set forth below at least five days
prior to the sale or other event giving rise to the requirement of such notice.
The rights and remedies specified herein shall be in addition to and
supplementary of all rights and remedies which the Public Body would otherwise
have at law or in equity. Any delay or failure on the Public Body’s part in
exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall not constitute a waiver thereof
or preclude the later or further exercise thereof. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, if it becomes necessary for the Public Body to
obtain court enforcement of its rights against the Custodian and the Public
Body should prevail, the Custodian shall be liable for the legal fees and costs
of the Public Body.
14.   Successors and Assigns.

successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Public Body and
the Custodian, and their respective successors and assigns.

written notice of termination to the Financial Institution and the Public Body.
Upon termination of its custody, the Custodian will take necessary steps to
transfer the securities to the destination directed by the Financial
Institution and the Public Body, jointly, and at the risk and expense of the
Financial Institution. In the event that no joint direction is received, the
Custodian shall transfer the securities to a trust account established by the
Public Body in a financial institution having deposits of at least one hundred
million dollars. Thereafter, the Custodian’s liability with respect to such
securities shall be fully discharged. The Custodian shall remain responsible

APPENDIX E: INTERNAL CONTROLS
Separation of Duties.
Individuals who perform investment transactions shall not be responsible for
the reconciliation of the accounts; furthermore, adequate separation of duties
requires that persons who perform investment transactions should not also be
responsible for writing checks or preparing bank deposit slips.
Duties and Responsibilities.
The Finance Director shall be responsible for the management of the City’s
Investment Program, including the purchases and sales of securities, bank
transfers, and wires. All such transactions must be authorized and signed off
by the Finance Director.
The Chief of Staff shall review the reconciliation of all investment
transactions and reports required in the “Monthly Financial Statement.”
Security Selection Process.
When purchasing an investment, the City shall select the security which
provides the highest bond equivalent yield (BEY) for a given investment. For
investments which require bidding, at least two (2) bids shall be secured. If
no security is offered for the date(s) requested, the Finance Director may
select the security with the highest BEY closest to the date(s) requested, or
may rebid the investment.
On an exception basis, when in the determination of the Finance Director
competitive bidding would inhibit the selection process, securities may be
purchased utilizing the comparison to current market price method. Acceptable
current market price providers include, but are not limited to:
   1.   The Bloomberg Information System;
   2.   The Wall Street Journal, or comparable nationally recognized financial
publication; and
   3.   Market pricing provided by the City’s safekeeping institution.
Examples of when this method may by used include:
   1.   When time constraints due to unusual circumstances preclude the use of
the competitive bidding process;
   2.   When no active market exists for the issue being traded due to the age
or depth of the issue;
   3.   When a security is unique to a single institution, (i.e., as a result
of a portfolio being purchased by a broker); and
   4.   When the transaction involves new issues “purchased at the window” or
issues in the “when issued” market.
When selection is made based on comparison to market prices, the following
information shall become part of the record of the security involved:
   1.   Reason for use of this method;
   2.   Source of the current market value used; and
   3.   Price and/or interest rate quoted by said source.
Safekeeping.
All settlements shall be executed by faxing a signed cover sheet and a
settlement note from the successful bidder to the City’s safekeeping
institution. All transactions, whether purchases or sales, shall require the
signature of two (2) authorized signors.
Delivery versus Payment.
Settlements shall be on a delivery versus payment (“DVP”) basis and shall
settle and be held at the City’s safekeeping institution. Except for Banker’s
Acceptances (which are only deliverable in physical form), the City will not
purchase any security requiring physical delivery.
Investment Accounting.
Following the execution and settlement of a transaction, all transaction
documentation shall be utilized by the Director of Finance for preparation of
the required journal entry.
Hard copy confirmations of all transactions shall be reviewed by the Chief of
Staff to ensure they agree with the settlement note received by the City on the
day of the transaction. Any deviation between the two documents must be
immediately brought to the attention of the Finance Director for remediation.
On a monthly basis, all outstanding investments shall be reconciled by the
Finance Director between:
   the general ledger and the City’s investment software, and
   the City’s investment software and the City’s safekeeping trust statement.
In addition, on a monthly basis, bank statements, investment reconciliations
and investment journal entries shall be reviewed by the Chief of Staff for
unusual or unauthorized transactions. Should there not be a reasonable
explanation for any such transaction, same should be brought to the immediate
attention of the Finance Director.
A listing of all outstanding investments shall be produced monthly and reviewed
by the Finance Director and shall be contained in the “Monthly Financial
Statement” and distributed to the Mayor, City Council and Chief of Staff.
Wire Transfer Agreements.
All wire transactions will be made in accordance with the procedures contained
in the executed wire transfer agreement between the City and its safekeeping
institution.
Repurchase Agreements.
While the City does not intend to utilize repurchase agreements (repos)
directly as a component of its investment portfolio at this time, it is mindful
that the majority of funds deposited into IPTIP are invested in repos. The City
believes that IPTIP’s collateralization requirement (equal to 102% of the value
of the repo at time of execution, and marked to market on a daily basis
thereafter) makes it a prudent vehicle in which to place short term cash.

APPENDIX F: MARK-TO-MARKET PRACTICES FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT
PORTFOLIOS AND INVESTMENT POOLS GOVERNMENT FINANCE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION
   Recommended Practice
   Mark-to-Market Practices for State and Local Government Investment
Portfolios and Investment Pools
   As the investment portfolios of state and local governments are subjected to
increased scrutiny, it is essential that reporting standards be enhanced so
that investors, governing bodies and the public remain informed of the current
market value of the portfolio. Regular disclosure of the value of a
governmental entity’s investments is an important step to furthering taxpayer
and market confidence in state and local government investment practices.
   The Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) recommends that state and
local government officials responsible for investment portfolio reporting
should determine the market value of all securities in the portfolio on at
least a quarterly basis. These values should be obtained from a reputable and
independent source and disclosed to the governing body or other oversight body
at least quarterly in a written report. It is recommended that the report
include the market value, book value and unrealized gain or loss of the
securities in the portfolio.
   Many state and local government officials are allowed to invest in various
state and local government investment pools available in their state or region.
Pool administrators should, on at least a monthly basis, determine the market
value of all securities in the pool and report this information to all pool
participants on at least a quarterly basis. These values should be obtained
from a reputable and independent source. This information should be included in
the report to the governing body prepared on at least a quarterly basis.

§ 52.021 METER TESTING; CHANGES; CHARGES.
   (A)   In case of breakage, stoppage or any other irregularity in the meter,
the owner or consumer is to notify the Department of Municipal Services
immediately and all necessary repairs will be made by the city, except as
provided in §
52.008(D).
   (B)   Upon the written request of the owner or consumer, the proper official
will test the meter servicing the premises. A deposit of money in an amount
which is equal to the current rate charged to the city to calibrate the water
meter, as such amount is determined by the Department of Municipal Services or
his or her designee from time to time, will be required before the meter is
tested. The deposit will be returned after the meter is tested if it is found
to be registering incorrectly, that is greater than 2% of accurate, such
condition being to the disadvantage of the consumer. Otherwise, the deposit
shall be retained by the city to cover the costs of the test. The owner or
consumer may be present at the time of the test, and the results of the test
shall be reported to the owner or consumer as the case may be. If the testing
of a meter indicates that it was registering incorrectly, the charge to the
consumer for water used shall be on the basis of the consumption for the
corresponding period of the previous year. If the meter had not been in service
for a year, or in the corresponding period of the previous year, or if for any
other reason the charge for the corresponding period cannot be properly
determined, the charge shall be equitably adjusted by the Municipal Services
Committee. The minimum metered rate as hereinafter specified will be charged
for as long as the meter remains on the service.
   (C)   In response to the written request of the owner or the owner’s
authorized agent asking that the water be shut off and the meter removed, the
city will proceed to comply with such request, and the minimum rate as
hereinafter specified will cease on the date when the meter is removed. No
charge will be made for the removal of a meter, but a charge as set forth in
the city’s fee and fine schedule will be imposed for reinstallation of a meter.
After the water supply has been shut off for any reason except for repairs, the
service will not be reestablished unless a written order is given to the
Department of Municipal Services by the owner or authorized agent and any
arrearage in payments are paid in full.
   (D)   Where a meter reading must be estimated because of inaccessibility of
the meter, the charge to the consumer will be a weighted average of previous
use. The consumer shall pay all additional charges when the meter is read and
shall not be entitled to a cash refund should the charge be higher than the
reading, unless authorized by theCity Administrator or designee after appeal
thereto. A consumer shall always be charged at least a minimum charge as
provided for in §
52.022, even if a gallonage credit exists. A card returned by the consumer
showing an actual reading of the meter shall not be considered an estimate.

WELLS
§ 52.035 FINDINGS AND DETERMINATIONS.
   (A)   Well water in the city has also been used over a period of time for
commercial and industrial purposes.
   (B)   The city desires to further limit the threat to human health from
ground water contamination to the city waterworks system because of the
installation of wells to supply ground water for commercial, industrial,
agricultural, residential and other purposes.
   (C)   The attempt to install or drill wells to supply ground water for
commercial, industrial, agricultural, residential and other purposes within the
corporate limits of the city may have a deleterious effect on the city water
supply due to the potential for backsiphonage into the city waterworks system
and contamination of the city water supply.
   (D)   The potential risk of backsiphonage and contamination of the city
waterworks system and the ramifications of this to the public health, safety
and welfare far outweighs the benefit of allowing the use of wells to supply
ground water for commercial, industrial, agricultural, residential and other
purposes.

violations may be immobilized, towed and impounded, regardless of whether the
immobilized or impounded, vehicle was the vehicle used in the violation,
provided a pre-immobilization/tow notice has been sent to the vehicle’s

by disproving liability for the unpaid final determinations of parking,
standing, compliance or automated traffic law violations listed on the notice.

submitting a request for hearing to the Traffic Compliance Administrator within
14 days of the date of the notice. The request for hearing shall be deemed

AUTOMATED TRAFFIC LAW
ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS
§ 70.060 FINDINGS.
   (A)   Pursuant to the Illinois Vehicle Code, as amended by Public Act 94-
0795, municipalities in the counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, Madison,
McHenry, St. Clair and Will are authorized to provide by ordinance for
automated traffic law enforcement systems, as that term is defined in § 11-
208.6 of the Vehicle Code, being 65 ILCS 11-208.6.
   (B)   Establishing automated traffic law enforcement systems at specified
intersections in the city at which traffic is controlled by signals exhibiting
different colored lights or color lighted arrows will benefit the public
health, safety and welfare by deterring drivers from entering those
intersections in violation of red light signals, thereby decreasing the
potential for personal injury and property damage due to vehicle collisions
caused by red light violations.
   (C)   It is therefore in the best interests of the city to establish
automated traffic law enforcement systems and to provide for administrative
adjudication of automated traffic law violations as specified in this

1426.1, or whether one of the defenses enumerated in 625 ILCS 5/11-1426.2 is
visibly applicable upon inspection. Upon determination that the recorded image
captures a violation and that no defense applies, the notice of violation shall
be served upon the registered vehicle owner in the manner provided for above.
The Traffic-Control Administrator shall retain a copy of all violation notices,
recorded images and other correspondence mailed to the owner of the vehicle.
Each notice of violation shall constitute evidence of the facts contained in
the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation of the
above-noted statutory and local provisions and shall be prima facie evidence of
a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in
this subchapter.
      (2)   The notice of violation shall include the following information:

shall occur following failure to pay the fine or penalty, or to contest the
alleged violation within 14 days of the notice of violation.
      (2)   Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest the alleged
violation in the time and manner specified in a prior mailed notice, the

Department and under circumstances provide by ordinance. Hazardous or unlawful
vehicles may be towed without prior notice except that when an unlawful vehicle
is one that has been reported as stolen and is not towable for some other
specific reason, the owner should be notified by telephone or other means when
practicable and given the opportunity to claim or move the vehicle if he or she
wishes to avoid incurring the expenses of a police ordered tow. Abandoned
vehicles may be towed with prior notice as provided for in this section.
   (B)   The abandonment of a vehicle or any part thereof on private or public
property, other than a highway, in view of the general public, within city
limits is unlawful except on property of the owner or bailee of such abandoned
vehicle. A vehicle or any part thereof so abandoned on private property shall
be authorized for removal by the Police Department after a waiting period of
seven days or more, or may be removed immediately if determined to be a
hazardous dilapidated motor vehicle under § 11-40-3.1 of the Illinois Municipal
Code, being 65 ILCS 5/11-40-3.1.
(Ord. 2016-001, passed 1-12-2016)
§ 70.086 NOTIFICATION REQUIRED GENERALLY; PRE-TOW NOTIFICATION.
   (A)   When an abandoned, lost, stolen or unclaimed vehicle comes into the
temporary possession or custody of a person not the owner of the vehicle, such
person shall immediately notify the Police Department when the vehicle is
within the city limits. Upon receipt of such notification, the Police
Department will authorize a towing service to remove and take possession of the
abandoned, lost, stolen or unclaimed vehicle. The towing service will safely
keep the towed vehicle and its contents, maintain a record of the tow as
required by § 4-204 of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code, being 625 ILCS 5/4-204,
until the vehicle is claimed by the owner or any other person legally entitled
to possession thereof or until it is disposed of.
   (B)   (1)   Except as set forth in this section, an abandoned vehicle which
is to be removed shall be towed only after notice has been given to the
registered owner or to the person entitled to possession of the motor vehicle
indicated in the most current registration list of the Secretary of State, if
the names and mailing addresses can be ascertained in the exercise of
reasonable diligence, notice shall be given by certified first class mail,
return receipt requested. If such names and addresses cannot be ascertained,
notice shall be given by affixing on the windshield or some other conspicuous
place on the vehicle a notice indicating that the vehicle will be removed, by
the city on or after a specific date. This date will be no sooner than seven
days alter the notice is mailed or affixed to the vehicle, unless the vehicle
is removed by the owner or legal possessor prior to that time.
      (2)   The notice required by division (B)(1) above shall state that the
vehicle will be removed seven days after the postmarked date or affixation of
the notice unless removed prior to that time and shall provide information on
the availability of the appeal process.
      (3)   The requirement that notice be given prior to the removal of an
abandoned vehicle may, as determined by the Police Department, be omitted in
those circumstances where there is a special need for prompt action to
eliminate traffic obstructions or to otherwise maintain and protect the public
safety and welfare. This includes, but is not limited to, situations that
include vehicles blocking or obstructing ingress or egress to businesses and
residences, vehicles parked in such a location or manner as to pose a traffic
hazard, and vehicles causing damage to public or private property. Such
findings shall be documented in written form by the Police Department.
(Ord. 2016-001, passed 1-12-2016)
§ 70.087 REMOVAL AND HAULING OF VEHICLES.
   (A)   When a vehicle is abandoned on a highway in the city for ten hours or
more, its removal by a towing service shall be authorized by Police Department.
   (B)   When an abandoned, unattended, wrecked, burned or partially dismantled
vehicle is creating a traffic hazard because of its position in relation to the
highway or its physical appearance is causing the impeding of traffic, its
immediate removal from the highway or private property adjacent to the highway
by a towing service may be authorized by Police Department.
   (C)   Whenever a police officer reasonably believes that a person under
arrest for driving under the influence in violation of § 11-501 of Illinois
Vehicle Code, being 625 ILCS 5/11-501, is likely, upon release, to commit a
subsequent violation of § 11-501, the arresting officer shall have the vehicle
which the person was operating at the time of the arrest impounded for a period
of not more than 12 hours after the time of arrest. However, such vehicle may
be released prior to the end of the impoundment period if:
      (1)   The vehicle was not owned by the person under arrest, and the
lawful owner requesting such release possesses a valid operator’s license,
proof of ownership, and would not, as determined by the arresting officer,
indicate a lack of ability to operate a motor vehicle in a safe manner, or who
would otherwise, by operating such motor vehicle, be in violation of Illinois
Motor Vehicle Code: or
      (2)   The vehicle is owned by the person under arrest, and the person
under arrest gives permission to another person to operate such vehicle,
provided however, that the other person possesses a valid operator’s license

support towing of the vehicle, the Hearing Officer shall direct that the
vehicle shall not be towed. The city shall furnish a copy of such decision to
the owner, who may place it inside the vehicle in a location plainly visible
from the outside, such as the dashboard or rear window. No vehicle about which
such a decision has been rendered shall be towed by the city unless the
circumstances under which the decision was rendered have changed. If at some

similarly situated vehicle.

decision of the Hearing Officer in any manner provided by law.

rationally related to its government interests including, but not limited to:

application for a permit;

necessary to bring the property into compliance with this section. In the event
the inspection reveals a structure which has been illegally converted, the
Department shall issue a notice of deconversion specifying the measures which
must be taken in order to bring the illegally converted structure into
compliance with applicable zoning regulations.
      (2)   A party issued a notice of repairs as provided for in division (E)

agreement with the city. The city shall issue a certificate of compliance upon
completion of the repairs necessary to bring the dwelling or structure into
compliance.

to enable the city to expeditiously obtain an order of compliance with this
section.

§ 95.080 ALTERNATIVE CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTY PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Whenever the Chief of Police of the city receives one or more police
reports documenting the occurrence of a nuisance activity, as herein defined,
on or within a property, the Chief of Police shall independently review such
reports and any other relevant facts or evidence to determine whether criminal
activity, nuisance activity or other prohibited conduct as provided in this
chapter has occurred at the property in question. Upon a finding that the
complained of activity has occurred, the Chief of Police may notify the owner,
in writing, that the property is in danger of becoming a chronic nuisance
property.
   (B)   The notice shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The street address and property index number sufficient for
identification of the property;
      (2)   A statement that the Police Department has information that the
property may be a chronic nuisance property, with a concise description of the
criminal or nuisance activity(ies) that may exist or that has occurred;
      (3)   Service of notice shall be provided by either personal delivery or
by first-class mail postage prepaid, addressed to the owner at the address of
the property believed to be a chronic nuisance property, or such other place
which is likely to give notice of the determination by the Chief of Police;
      (4)   A copy of the notice shall also be served on the taxpayer of record
at such address as shown on the tax rolls of the county and/or the occupant, at
the address of the property, if these persons are different from the owner and
shall be made either personally or by first-class mail, postage prepaid; and
      (5)   Demand that the owner respond and meet with the Chief of Police
within 20 days of receipt of the notice. Refusal of receipt of the notice by
any party to whom notice is sent shall be deemed receipt of the notice for
purposes of this section.
(Ord. 2021-29, passed 8-24-2021)
§ 95.081 CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTY PROCEDURE FOR ADDRESSING NUISANCE PROPERTY.
   (A)   At the meeting, the Chief of Police may request that the owner
implement a reasonable abatement plan designed to alleviate and prevent future
occurrences of criminal activity or nuisance activity upon the property. The
mitigation or abatement plan shall be reasonable under the circumstances in its
objective, cost and scope, and shall be implemented within 60 days of the
meeting with the Chief of Police or such longer period if not practically
feasible to do so within 60 days.
   (B)   If the criminal activity or nuisance activity complained of has or is
being conducted by a tenant leasing the property, and such activity is a
violation of the material terms of a lease agreement, the Chief of Police may
request that the owner evict the tenant and further request that future tenants
execute a “crime free lease addendum”. If eviction is requested, the owner
shall proceed with such an action in good faith. The city shall assist in the
eviction action by reasonably cooperating with the owner, manager(s) or person
(s) in charge of the property, including, but not limited to, providing law
enforcement officers or other municipal employees as witnesses regarding the
nuisance activity if relevant.
   (C)   When any party affected by this section responds and meets with the
Chief of Police as required above, no statements made in connection with the
furnishing of that response or in a meeting shall constitute or be used in any
judicial or quasijudicial proceeding as an admission that any nuisance activity
has or is occurring at or on the property. This division (C) does not require
the exclusion of any other evidence which is otherwise admissible and offered
for any other purpose than an admission by a person affected by this section.

question is a chronic nuisance property, the city shall have the initial burden
of proof to show, by a preponderance of evidence, that the property in question

entering the premises or a valid court order permitted the barred person’s

      (3)   Prohibits the city from enacting or enforcing ordinances to impose
penalties on the basis of the underlying criminal activity or local ordinance

   This chapter is enacted pursuant to authority given by certain provisions of
the Illinois Municipal Code, including, but not limited to: 65 ILCS 5/11-60-
2 granting authority to define, prevent and abate nuisances; and 65 ILCS 5/11-

(Ord. 2017-005, passed 2-27-2017)
§ 97.02 FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted for the purpose of regulating and permitting
alarm systems to which the Police or Fire Department is expected to respond;
defining and abating nuisances which are detrimental to the safety and public
welfare of the city; and addressing the effect of false alarms.
   (B)   A false alarm or false fire alarm as defined herein is declared a
public nuisance endangering the public health, safety and welfare, in that
nuisance (false) alarms:
      (1)   Generate calls to the Police and Fire Departments that are false in
the sense that no actual or attempted illegal entry to the building protected
by the alarm has actually occurred or that no fire or threat of fire exists,
and such alarms divert emergency responders away from legitimate emergencies or
actual threats to public health and safety which could lead to loss of life;
      (2)   Cause occupants unnecessary panic or cause occupants to develop
alarm fatigue whereby such alarms are ignored under the mistaken belief that
such alarm is a false alarm thereby increasing the risk of loss of life in a
real emergency;
      (3)   Unduly disturb the peace and comfort of neighboring persons or
property by their audible signal; and
      (4)   Disturb the peace by causing the Police or Fire Department to
respond with lights and sirens, thereby unnecessarily disturbing neighboring
persons and property and increasing the risk of accidents to the motoring

retention of rain water, reduction of' flooding, reduction in the cost of air
conditioning, blocking of ultraviolet light to sustain pavement life, increased
property value, and clean air.
      (2)   Blue Islanders have a long and proud history of beautiful tree
lined streets and landscaped homes. Every fall and spring, the trees in the
city add to the charm of the community. They also add financial value to
property in the city. This chapter is necessary to ensure that the city
protects one of its most valuable commodities.
   (B)   Intent. It is the intent of the City Council that the terms of this
chapter shall be construed so as to promote:
      (1)   The planting, maintenance, restoration and survival of desirable
trees, shrubs and other plants within the city; and
      (2)   The protection of the city from damage caused or threatened by the
improper planting, maintenance or removal of trees, shrubs or other plants
located within the community.

which case placement within a public right of way will only be allowed if a
right-of-way permit is issued, by the city’s Building Department.

storage or portable shipping container for which a permit is issued will be
allowed to remain on any property or on any parcel of real estate for a period
greater than 30 consecutive days within any 12 month period. An extension may
be granted by the City for an additional 15 days.
         (b)   Portable storage or portable shipping containers remaining on
the property in excess of the permitted time period will be considered in

      (3)   Location or placement of portable containers. In all residential
zoning districts and all commercial zoning districts, portable storage and
portable shipping containers shall be placed on a paved surface in a driveway
or, if permitted by the city, in an off-street parking space, and shall meet
all minimum setback requirements of the zoning district unless otherwise
allowed by the permit when issued. If a driveway or off-street parking space is
not available on property, not more than one portable storage or portable
shipping container may be placed in a public right-of-way in a legal parking
space only with the prior approval of the city as set forth and described in
the right-of-way permit issued by the city.

      (8)   Insolvency or bankruptcy of the company.
   (B)   Notice of substantial breach. Written notice shall be given to the
company setting forth:
      (1)   The nature of the substantial breach or default by the company;

      (3)   Notice that any failure to correct the remedy the substantial
breach or default within 30 days, or such other period of time as may be
stipulated in the franchise agreement, may be cause for revocation of the
franchise.
   (C)   Answer to notice of breach. Within 30 days after the city’s written
notice to the company, the company shall respond in writing to the city,
together with documentation in support of its response:
      (1)   That it contests the city’s notice of substantial breach and
requests an opportunity to be heard as provided herein;
      (2)   That corrective action has been implemented by the company and the
substantial breach or default has been cured; and
      (3)   That corrective action has been implemented by the company and is

   (D)   Hearing. If requested by the company, or if the city is not satisfied

by the company to remedy the substantial breach or default, the city shall
schedule a public hearing to hear and determine the issues and to consider
whether sufficient cause exists to revoke the franchise. The city shall give
the company not less than 14 days’ written notice specifying the city’s intent
to consider the revocation of the company’s franchise pursuant to this
subchapter, and the date, time and place of the public hearing to be held
before the corporate authorities, or a hearing officer appointed by the
corporate authorities. If a hearing officer has been designated, the hearing
officer shall hear the relevant evidence and shall render a record of the
administrative hearing and recommended findings and decision to the corporate
authorities.
   (E)   Determination. After hearing the relevant evidence or considering the
administrative record of the hearing, the corporate authorities shall determine
whether or not a substantial breach or default by the company has occurred,
whether it has been cured or a satisfactory corrective action plan has been
submitted and is being actively and diligently pursued, and whether cause
exists to revoke the franchise. The company shall be given an opportunity to be
heard in connection with those issues. If the corporate authorities are
persuaded that a substantial breach or default has occurred, the corporate
authorities shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the
substantial breach or default, as reflected by the following factors, in
considering whether some lesser sanction or cure, if any, should be imposed:
      (1)   Whether the conduct was egregious;
      (2)   Whether substantial harm resulted;
      (3)   Whether the violation was intentional;
      (4)   Whether there is a history of prior violations of the same or other
requirements; or
      (5)   Whether there is a history of overall compliance.
   (F)   Ordinance. If the corporate authorities determine that cause exists to
revoke the franchise, it may by ordinance declare the company’s franchise to be
terminated and revoked, provided that the city may grant the company an
additional period of time to remedy the substantial breach or default before
such ordinance is fully effective.

have been made based upon the evidence presented in each specific case that the
following conditions have been met:

the applicant, but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship which
would result if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out and which
is not generally applicable to other property within the same district;
         (b)   The alleged hardship has not been created by any person
presently having a proprietary interest in the property;
         (c)   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if a
fence may only be built under the regulations;

light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion in the
public streets, increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety;

the neighborhood; and
         (g)   The proposed variation is in harmony with the spirit and intent

known as barbed wire on real property in a C-1 Central Area Commercial District
or C-2 Highway Commercial District if the real property located within a one
square block area of the real property upon which the fence with barbed
wire is to be erected is improved with more than 50% residential dwellings or
if barbed wire would detract from the historical theme of the area as set forth

way; a permit for the wrecking or tearing down shall be obtained by the owner
or his or her agent from the City Clerk. It shall be unlawful to proceed with
the wrecking or tearing down of any building or structure or any structural

other structure may be wrecked or torn down provided that all the work done
shall be subject to the supervision of the Building Commissioner and to
reasonable restrictions that he or she imposes to safeguard the public and to
protect any public way. The work shall be protected by barricades, scaffolding
and other similar devices as may be necessary to protect the public and to
ensure safety to human life and to comply with the provisions of the Act of the

and applicable state law providing for the safety of workers in and about the
construction and removal of buildings.

or structure for which a permit is required, the person engaged in the work of
wrecking the building shall file with the City Clerk a surety bond with
sureties to be approved by the City Clerk in the amount of $20,000 to
indemnify, keep, and save harmless the city against any loss, cost, damage,
expense, judgment or liability of any kind whatsoever which the city may suffer
or which may accrue against, be charged to or be recovered from the city or any
of its officials from anything done under any permit granted for the wrecking
operations.
      (2)   However, the person engaged in the work of wrecking may, in lieu of
the surety bond, file with the City Clerk a policy of insurance or a
certificate evidencing the existence of a policy of insurance written by a
reputable insurance company qualified to do business in the state. The policy
shall be acceptable to the City Clerk and name the city as one of the insured.
The policy of insurance shall be written to afford protection to the city
against all claims by any person or persons who may sustain or suffer injury or
damage to property as a result of anything done in and about the wrecking of
the building. The limits of protection afforded by the insurance policy shall
be not less than $100,000 for injury to one person and not less than $200,000
for injury to two or more persons and $20,000 for damage to property. The
insurance policy shall be kept in force at all times during the wrecking of the
building or other structure and until the wrecking is fully completed.
   (E)   Disposition of wreckage and debris.
      (1)   All debris shall be removed from the site as the wrecking
progresses.
      (2)   However, salvage materials may be temporarily stored on the
premises upon condition that they be stored in a safe and neat manner and that
they be removed upon the completion of the wrecking.
      (3)   In no case shall wreck materials or debris be permitted to fall
upon any public way or any adjoining private property, or to occupy or obstruct
a public way.
      (4)   Upon the completion of the demolition, and if a succeeding building
is not to be immediately erected upon the site, the site shall be filled where
necessary with soil, cinders or other firm material to a level equal to that of
adjoining sidewalks, alleys or other properties.
   (F)   Discontinuance of operation.
      (1)   No wrecking operation shall be discontinued or abandoned once it
has been undertaken.
      (2)   It shall be carried forward promptly and without unnecessary
interruption.
   (G)   Obstruction or opening of street. In any case where the wrecking of
any building or structure will require the obstruction of any public street or
the opening of any public street or alley, the applicant, at the time of making
application for the permit required by the terms of this section, shall also
make application for and obtain any other permit which may be required in
connection with the street obstruction or street opening pursuant to the terms
of any other city law. The issuance of the permit required by this section
shall be subject to the provisions of this section.
   (H)   Protection of sidewalks.
      (1)   In every case where the wrecking of any building or structure will
or may cause or result in damage to any public sidewalk bordering the premises
upon which the building or structure is situated, the applicant shall, as a
condition precedent to the issuance of the permit required by the terms of this
section, make a deposit of cash with the City Clerk in an amount not less than
the amount estimated to be required to replace any sidewalk which may be
damaged in connection with the wrecking operation.
      (2)   The cash deposit shall be held by the City Clerk until the wrecking
operations are completed and any sidewalk damaged is repaired or replaced to
the satisfaction of the Superintendent of Streets of the city, following which
the cash deposit shall be returned to the person making the same.
      (3)   In the event any damaged sidewalk is not repaired or replaced
within 30 days following the date of the completion of the wrecking operations
or within a reasonable additional time allowed by the City Clerk because of
weather conditions or other similar cause, the cash deposit or so much thereof
as shall be necessary shall be used to pay the cost of repairing or replacing
the damaged sidewalk.
      (4)   The remainder, if any, shall be returned to the person making the
deposit.

previously approved by the city for the area in which the site is situated.
(Prior Code, § 156.22) (Ord. 2419, passed 10-24-1978)
§ 155.23 SAFETY PRECAUTIONS MAY BE IMPOSED.
   (A)   If, at any stage of the grading, the City Engineer or Superintendent
of Public Works determines by inspection that the nature of the formation is
such that further work as authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil
any property, public way, watercourse or drainage structure, he or she may
require, as a condition to allowing the work to be done, that reasonable safety
precautions be taken to avoid the likelihood of peril. Special precautions may
include, but shall not be limited to, specifying a more level exposed slope;
construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction,
leveling or cribbing; installation of plant material for erosion control; and
reports of a registered engineering geologist whose recommendations may be made
requirements for further work.
   (B)   Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading is
not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install
temporary planting to control erosion, install temporary structures or take
other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or the public
safety. On large operations or where unusual site conditions prevail, the City
Engineer or Superintendent of Public Works may specify the time of starting
grading and time of completion or may require that the operations be conducted
in specific stages to ensure completion of protective measures or devices prior
to the advent of seasonal rains.

private or public nuisance upon his or her property. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter shall not be a defense in any action to abate the
nuisance.
(Prior Code, § 156.24) (Ord. 2419, passed 10-24-1978)
§ 155.25 EXCEPTIONS.
   The Mayor and City Council may authorize exceptions to any of the
requirements and regulations set forth in this chapter, as follows.
   (A)   Application for any exception shall be made by a verified petition of
the applicant stating fully the grounds of the application and the facts relied
upon by the petitioner. The petition shall be filed with the site development
permit application. In order for the land referred to in the petition to come
within the provisions of this section, it shall be necessary that the Mayor and
City Council find all of the following facts with respect thereto:
      (1)   The land is of such shape or size, is affected by such physical
conditions, or is subject to such title limitations or record that it is
impossible or impractical for the subdivider or property owner to comply with
all of the regulations of this chapter;
      (2)   The exception is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the petitioner; and
      (3)   The granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the subject property.
   (B)   Each proposed exception shall be referred to the City Engineer and
Superintendent of Public Works. They shall transmit to the Mayor and City
Council their recommendations which shall be reviewed prior to the granting of
any exception.
   (C)   After review, the Mayor and City Council, by resolution, may approve
the site development permit application with the exceptions and conditions it
deems necessary, it may disapprove the site development permit application and
exception application, or it may take other appropriate action.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.001 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to the
city by 65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, 65 ILCS 5/11-12-12, 65 ILCS 5/11-30-2, 65 ILCS 5/11-
30-8 and 65 ILCS 5/11-31-2. The purpose of this chapter is to maintain the
city’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program; to minimize
potential losses due to periodic flooding including loss of life, loss of
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare; and to preserve and enhance the quality of
surface waters, conserve economic and natural values and provide for the wise
utilization of water and related land resources.
   (B)   This chapter is adopted in order to accomplish the following specific
purposes:
      (1)   To meet the requirements of 615 ILCS 5/18g, Rivers, Lakes and
Streams Act;
      (2)   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or
drainage hazards to others, or creating unstable conditions susceptible to
erosion;
      (3)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;
      (4)   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;
      (5)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities and flood rescue and
relief operations;
      (6)   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property
in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program;
      (7)   To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program codified as 44 C.F.R. parts 59 through 79, being 42 U.S.C. §§
4001 through 4138, as amended;
      (8)   To protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land
and water resources; and
      (9)   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of
watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and storm water
impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and
riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic
benefits and enhance community and economic development.
(Prior Code, § 157.001) (Ord. 08-023, passed 7-22-2008)
§ 156.002 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A non-habitable structure which is on the same parcel
of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure.

of the state, 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq.
   APPLICANT. Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an
application.
   APPROPRIATE USE. Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible
and will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed
are as specified in §
156.062 of this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year. The BASE FLOOD is also known as the 100-YEAR FREQUENCY FLOOD EVENT.
Application of the base flood elevation at any location is as defined in §
156.004 of this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation in relation to mean sea level of
the crest of the base flood.
   BASEMENT. The portion of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BUILDING. A walled and roofed structure, including gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally above ground, including manufactured homes,
prefabricated buildings and gas or liquid storage tanks. The term also includes
recreational vehicles and travel trailers installed on a site for more than 180
days per year.
   CHANNEL. Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully,
ravine, wash or natural or human-made drainageway, which has a definite bed and
banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or ground water flows, either
perennially or intermittently.
   CHANNEL MODIFICATION. Alteration of a channel by changing the physical
dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. CHANNEL MODIFICATION includes
damming, rip-rapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom
or banks. CHANNEL MODIFICATION does not include the clearing of dead or dying
vegetation, debris or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe form
of CHANNEL MODIFICATION involving a significant change in the channel cross-
section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.
straightening).
   CITY. The City of Blue Island, an Illinois municipal corporation, the
corporate authorities of said city, and said city’s authorized designees,
employees or officers.
   COMPENSATORY STORAGE. An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood
storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the
floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase
off-site floodwater elevations and flows.
   CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE. Preconstruction
approval by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map. This
preconstruction approval, pursuant to this part, gives assurances to the
property owner that once an appropriate use is constructed according to
permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon
review and acceptance of as-built plans.
   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A letter which indicates that
FEMA will revise base flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood
boundaries or floodway as shown on an effective Flood Hazard Boundary Map or
Flood Insurance Rate Map, once the as-built plans are submitted and approved.
   CONTROL STRUCTURE. A structure designed to control the rate of flow that
passes through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water
surface elevation.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare
of the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these CRITICAL FACILITIES can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk. Examples of CRITICAL FACILITIES where flood
protection should be required include: emergency services facilities (such as
fire and police stations); schools; hospitals; retirement homes and senior care
facilities; major roads and bridges; critical utility sites (telephone
switching stations or electrical transformers); and hazardous material storage
facilities (chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances). Examples
of CRITICAL FACILITIES where flood protection is recommended include: sewage
treatment plants; water treatment plants; and pumping stations.
   DAM. All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. DAMS may also include weirs, restrictive
culverts or impoundment structures. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.

are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city that may be annexed
into the county are designated for any streams flowing through the city’s
boundaries on the countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by FEMA and
dated 8-19-2008.
      (4)   To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the
designated floodway boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map
and located on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where
interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the designated
floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.

without a gravity release. A DETENTION FACILITY provides for storage of storm
water runoff and controlled release of this runoff during and after a flood or
storm.
   RIVERINE SFHA. Any SFHA subject to flooding from a river, creek,
intermittent stream, ditch, on-stream lake system or any other identified
channel. This term does not include areas subject to flooding from lakes,

   (C)   Upon receipt of a development permit application, the city along with
the City Engineer shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation.
      (1)   Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher than
the base flood elevation of the current Flood Insurance Rate Map and which has
not been filled after the date of the site’s first Flood Insurance Rate Map
without a permit as required by this chapter is not in the SFHA and, therefore,
not subject to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely, any development
located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically
connected, but shown on the current Flood Insurance Rate Map is subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   The city shall maintain documentation of the existing ground
elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation
existed prior to the date of the site’s first Flood Insurance Rate Map
identification.

§ 156.047 PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES.
   No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health
and safety.
   (A)   Submission of data; LOMR. If fill is being used to elevate the site
above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall
submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for
the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
   (B)   Compensatory storage.
      (1)   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated
for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
      (2)   The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.
      (3)   In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be
made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.
      (4)   All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood
elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All
floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation.
      (5)   All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse.
   (C)   Construction of the lowest floor below the base flood elevation (BFE).
A person who has obtained a letter of map revision based on fill that removes a
site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate
the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the city to construct the
lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The
city shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant has complied with all
the criteria set forth in the following divisions.
      (1)   Compensatory storage shall be provided per division (B) above.
      (2)   The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e.,
window wells, access ways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation
(FPE).
      (3)   The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above
the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet beyond the outside face of the
structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be
met, the city may waive the ten-foot minimum setback if a state licensed
professional engineer certify that an alternative method to protect the
building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met. The
certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural design
analysis, which shall be submitted to the city for review. The city may require
such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed shorter
setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the
setback distance be less than four feet.
      (4)   The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a
distance of 20 feet from the structure, shall be above the BFE. However, if
site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained, the city may
waive the 20-foot minimum setback distance if a state licensed professional
engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from
damages due to hydrostatic pressures have been met. A detailed soils analysis
and structural design proving that a shorter setback distance will keep the
structure reasonably safe from flooding shall be submitted to the city for
review. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet.
      (5)   The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets
all requirements of this division (C) and is at least five feet thick under the
basement floor slab. Nothing in this division (C)(5) shall be interpreted to
require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F,
if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification
and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according
to ASTM standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes.
      (6)   The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the
soil must be all of one material, and the engineering priorities must be in the
same direction.
      (7)   All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and
inspected by a state licensed professional engineer, as warranted by the site
conditions.
      (8)   The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than
five below the BFE.
      (9)   There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab,
and minimum of one-quarter horsepower emergency backup sump pump with a backup
power supply shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated
at four times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and
away from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift
of the floor under the effect of the seepage pressure.
      (10)   The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of
preventing backflow.
      (11)   All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic
pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices.
      (12)   If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set
forth in divisions (A) and (B) above, the city may allow the construction of a
basement below the BFE only if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed
fill and structure meet the guidelines and requirements set forth in FEMA
Technical Bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from flooding, the order to
demonstrate that the proposed structure is reasonably safe from flooding, the
applicant shall submit a detailed engineering analysis of the proposed fill and
foundation wall. The engineered basement study shall be completed in accordance
with the latest edition of FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01, with the analysis of
the fill being prepared by a state licensed professional engineer.
      (13)   In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in
no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot
exceed 18 inches, as measured from the previously existing natural grade. The
rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation, if
necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly
to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to drain
the compensatory storage area will not be permitted.

§ 156.062 PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES; LIST OF APPROPRIATE USES.
   (A)   The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are
appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and
which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood
heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or
impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or
channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as
called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses listed in 17 Ill. Adm.
Code part 3708 will be allowed. The approved appropriate uses are as follows:
      (1)   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
      (2)   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring
access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities,
and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
      (3)   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls;
      (4)   Underground and overhead utilities;
      (5)   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems,
including any related fencing (at least 50% open when viewed from any one
direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open
air pavilions and toilet facilities (four-stall maximum) that will not block
flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
      (6)   Detached garages, storage sheds or other non-habitable accessory
structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
      (7)   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto;
      (8)   Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
         (a)   The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will
not exceed one foot; or
         (b)   The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility parking
lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and
accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank
flooding events.
      (9)   Designated floodway regarding, without fill, to create a positive
non-erosive slop toward a watercourse;
      (10)   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of water-tight window wells, elevating
structures or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure and
which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure;
      (11)   The replacement, reconstruction or repair of a damaged building;
provided that, the outside dimensions are not increased and, if the building
was damaged to 50% or more of the market value before the damage occurred, the
building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation; and
      (12)   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the
enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood
elevation, and which will not block flood flows including, but not limited to,
fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios and second story additions. If the
building is improved to 50% or more of the market value before the modification
occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will be protected from
flooding to the flood protection elevation.
   (B)   Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any
new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or
channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the
floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a
fence) and storage of materials, except as specifically defined above as an
appropriate use.
   (C)   Within the designated floodway, the construction of an appropriate use
will be considered permissible; provided that, the proposed project meets the
following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with
supporting plans, calculations and data by a licensed professional engineer;
and, provided that, any structure meets the protection requirements of §§
156.090 through
156.093 of this chapter:
      (1)   Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood
stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
         (a)   Designated floodway conveyance, “K” = (1.486/n)(ARM), where “n”
is Manning’s roughness factor, “A” is the effective flow area of the cross-
section and “R” is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te
Chow, Open Channel Hydraulics, (McGraw-Hill, New York 1959))
         (b)   The same Manning’s “n” value shall be used for both existing and
proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative
land cover.
         (c)   Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations
of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant’s engineer can prove to
IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency.
            1.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream’s length.
            2.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream’s length.
            3.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length
shall be used.
            4.   Transition sections shall be provided between cross-sections
with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway
delineation on adjacent properties.
            5.   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
      (2)   Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream
flooding.
         (a)   Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or
structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
         (b)   Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at
least one times the volume of floodplain storage lost.
         (c)   Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head
loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
         (d)   The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed
between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood
elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation.
All designated floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year flood
elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All
such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse.
         (e)   If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location
of the proposed construction, the applicant’s engineer shall demonstrate
through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that
the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent.
         (f)   There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result
of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce
flooding at existing structure.
      (3)   Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream
erosion or flood heights.
         (a)   For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on-
stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the
average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events
up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
         (b)   In the case of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures built
for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows,
velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and
sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
      (4)   Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway
approaches.
         (a)   The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of
upstream flood stages greater than one-tenths foot when compared to the
existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within
the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks)
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or
within recorded flood easements.
         (b)   If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages
greater than one-tenths foot, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a
permit for a dam or waiver.
            1.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in §
156.004 of this chapter. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any
commonly accepted FEMA approved hydraulic models.
            2.   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per division (C)
(2) above.
            3.   Velocity increases must be mitigated per division (C)(3)
above.
            4.   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used
for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received.
            5.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge
showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by this
section.
            6.   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be
designed per division (C)(8) below.
      (5)   Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts and
approach roads.
         (a)   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than one-tenths foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
         (b)   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant’s engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
         (c)   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is
a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with 17 Ill. Adm. Code part 3708 (Floodway Construction in
Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued.
      (6)   On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water.
         (a)   Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than zero foot
when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and
including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel
banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as
within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within
recorded flood easements.
         (b)   A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be
obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flow.
         (c)   All dams and impoundment structures as defined in §
156.002 of this chapter shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm.
Code part 3702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity
involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an
impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
            1.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by
providing flood control, public recreation or regional storm water detention;
            2.   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous
fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life
cycle, such as for spawning;
            3.   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water
quality or habitat conditions, impoundment design should include gradual bank
slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation basin;
            4.   A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the city in
which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream
municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control; and
            5.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
subchapter.
      (7)   Flood proofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial
structures.
         (a)   If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building.
         (b)   Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required
for floodproofing activities.
      (8)   Excavation in the floodway.
         (a)   When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert
openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and
culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other appropriate
uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation.
         (b)   The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used
unless an applicant’s engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the
same efficiency:
            1.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream’s length;
            2.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream’s length;
            3.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length
shall be used; and
            4.   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and
downstream of the transition sections.
      (9)   Channel modification. If the proposed activity involves a channel
modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
         (a)   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which
would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the
body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank
stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from
the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel or the establishment of
a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if
the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish
and wildlife habitat;
         (b)   Water quality, habitat and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values;
         (c)   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria.
            1.   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall
match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-
section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.
            2.   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both
the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will
prevent erosion.
            3.   One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization
effects of the vegetation.
            4.   Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that
which is essential for construction of the channel.
            5.   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable.
Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as
concrete, gabions or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.
            6.   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be
seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
            7.   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity
such as deep pools, riffles and other similar features, such features shall be
provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow
characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where
appropriate.
            8.   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of
the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
            9.   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all
items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.
            10.   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
            11.   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification.
         (d)   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
subchapter.
      (10)   Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
      (11)   Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in the
floodway, including grading, filling and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria.
         (a)   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum
vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil
is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be
destroyed, removed or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of
improvements.
         (b)   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied
to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the
site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade, but
will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days.
         (c)   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches
and sediment traps and basins.
         (d)   A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be
preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels. (See
division (C)(16) below.) Construction vehicle use of channels shall be
minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to
minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be re-
stabilized immediately.
         (e)   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
designed and implemented consistent with Procedures and Standards for Urban
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois (1988) also known as the
Green Book and The Illinois Urban Manual (NRCS, 1995).
      (12)   Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects,
the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the
applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
      (13)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations.
         (a)   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in §
156.004 of this chapter, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If
the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR
shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base
conditions data to use.
            1.   If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of
the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet:
               a.   The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency
flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and
               b.   Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water
elevations.
            2.   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
      (14)   Conditional letter of map revision.
         (a)   If the appropriate use would result in a change in the
designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the
applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and
documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision
and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway
change before a permit is issued.
         (b)   The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA
until as-built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging
or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR.
         (c)   In the case of non-government projects, the city in incorporated
areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed
conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be
given.
         (d)   No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued.
         (e)   After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no
activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
      (15)   Professional engineer’s supervision. All engineering analyses
shall be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed professional
engineer.
      (16)   Criteria. For all activities in the floodway involving
construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be
met.
         (a)   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at
least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
         (b)   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the
construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
      (17)   Necessary materials. After receipt of conditional approval of the
designated floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of
map revision, construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may
proceed, but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an
appropriate use may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is
changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The designated floodway
map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the
“as-built” plans.
   (D)   Development activities in delegated communities requiring state
review. For those projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the
following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and
concurrence and/or permit prior to the issuance of a permit by a community or
county delegated state permitting authority in the floodway:
      (1)   An engineer’s analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed
bridge pursuant to division (C)(4) above;
      (2)   An engineer’s determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, pursuant to division (C)(5) above;
      (3)   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
storage pursuant to divisions (C)(1), (C)(2) and (C)(8) above;
      (4)   The construction of any IDNR/OWR projects, dams (as defined in §
156.002 of this chapter) and all other federal, state or local units of
government projects, including projects of the municipality or county;
      (5)   An engineer’s determination that a proposed bridge affected by
backwater from a downstream receiving stream may be built with a smaller
opening;
      (6)   Projects which revise or establish the floodway and/or flood
profiles; and
      (7)   Projects in public bodies of water.
   (E)   Other permits.
      (1)   In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, a
development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless
the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is
not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq.
      (2)   No correspondence from IDNR/OWR shall be required if the project
meets the requirements of Regional Permit 3.
      (3)   No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/OWR has delegated
this responsibility to the city.
   (F)   Permits for dams.
      (1)   Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a
dam, as defined in §
156.002 of this chapter, per 17 Ill. Adm. Code part 3702 (Rules for
Construction of Dams) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of
construction of a dam.

include, but are not limited to:
         (a)   Major changes by addition, alteration, maintenance,

      (2)   An exception to the certificate of appropriateness shall be made if
the applicant shows to the Commission that a failure to grant the certificate
will cause an imminent threat to life, health or property. The Building
Commissioner or Fire Chief shall certify that such conditions exist.
   (B)   Application for certificate of appropriateness.
      (1)   Every application for a building permit or demolition permit,
including plans and specifications, shall be forwarded by the Building and

         (a)   Street address of the property involved;
         (b)   Legal description of the property involved;
         (c)   Brief description of the present improvements situated on the

         (d)   A detailed description of the construction, alteration,

   (C)   Standards for certificate of appropriateness. In making a
determination whether to approve or deny an application for a certificate of
appropriateness, the City Historic Preservation Commission shall be guided by
the Secretary of the Interior’s “Standards for Rehabilitation”, as follows:
      (1)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site environment;
      (2)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided;
      (3)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken;
      (4)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved;
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
that characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with
sensitivity;
      (6)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or
pictorial evidence;
      (7)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of the
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible;
      (8)   Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken;
      (9)   New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials mat characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment; and
      (10)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (D)   Design guidelines. Design guidelines for applying the criteria for
review of certificates of appropriateness shall at a minimum, consider the
following architectural criteria.
      (1)   Height. The height of any proposed alteration or construction
should be compatible with the style and character of the landmark and with
surrounding structures in a historic district.
      (2)   Proportions of windows and doors. The proportions and relationships
between doors and windows should be compatible with the architectural style and
character of the landmark.
      (3)   Relationship of building masses and spaces. The relationship of a
structure within a historic district to the open space between it and adjoining
structures should be compatible.
      (4)   Roof shape. The design of the roof, fascia and cornice should be
compatible with the architectural style and character of the landmark.
      (5)   Landscaping. Landscaping should be compatible with the
architectural character and appearance of the landmark.
      (6)   Scale. The scale of the structure after alteration, construction or
partial demolition should be compatible with its architectural style and
character and with surrounding structures in a historic district.
      (7)   Directional expression. Facades in historic districts should blend
with other structures with regard to directional expression. Structures in a
historic district should be compatible with the dominant horizontal or vertical
expression of surrounding structures. The direction expression of a landmark
after alteration, construction, or partial demolition should be compatible with
its original architectural style and character.
      (8)   Architectural details. Architectural details including types of
materials, colors and textures should be treated so as to make landmark
compatible with its original architectural style and character of a landmark or
historic district.
      (9)   New structures. New structures in a historic district shall be
compatible with the architectural styles and design in said districts.
   (E)   Hearing on application.
      (1)   Applications for a certificate of appropriateness are available
from the Building and Zoning Department. Such applications shall be completed
and submitted to the Department, which applications shall be forwarded to the
City Historic Preservation Commission. The Commission shall schedule a public
meeting for consideration of the application within 30 days of receipt of
application. A public notice for consideration of the application shall be made
not less than 15 days, nor more than 30 days, before the hearing in a newspaper
of general circulation published in the city.
      (2)   If the Historic Preservation Commission finds at the time that the
application merits further consideration, then the Commission may table the
request until its next regularly scheduled meeting.
   (F)   Issuance of a certificate of appropriateness.
      (1)   The City Historic Preservation Commission shall notify the
applicants of its decision within five days after the public meeting. Upon
approval of the application, the Commission shall direct the Building and
Zoning Department to issue signed certificate of appropriateness to the
applicant with copies forwarded to the Building Commissioner.
      (2)   A certificate of appropriateness shall be invalid if changes in the
plans reviewed by the Commission are necessary in obtaining a building permit
or if the building permit issued for the same work becomes invalid. The
certificate of appropriateness remains valid for the same period of validity as
the building permit (one year).
   (G)   Appeals for denial of a certificate of appropriateness.
      (1)   In the event of denial of an application for a certificate of
appropriateness, the Commission shall notify the applicant in writing within
five days of the disapproval and the reasons therefore and shall recommend
changes, if any, in proposed actions that would cause the Commission to
reconsider its denial.
      (2)   Within 15 days of receipt of the notification of disapproval, the

hearing is received. Within 30 days of receipt of a written modification, the

hearing.

review as provided by law.

   (B)   All applications for a certificate of housing inspection shall be made
on such forms as prescribed by the Building Commissioner. The Building
Commissioner shall issue a certificate within 14 days after inspection of the
subject property which shall be consented to by the owner or landlord, in
writing, and after the payment of a $5 inspection fee for each dwelling unit
inspected. The Building Department shall inspect the subject property for
compliance with the Building, Housing, Property Maintenance and Zoning Codes,

ordinance violation other than for violations of division (B) above, against
the owner or landlord of the property when inspection was made.
   (D)   (1)   Where no consent has been given to enter or inspect any
property, no entry or inspection shall be made without the procurement of a
warrant from the Circuit Court of the county. The Court may consider any of the
following factors along with such other matters as it deems pertinent in its

of reasonable legislative and administrative standards which show that there is
reason to believe that a condition of non-conformity exists with respect to a
particular property in violation of an ordinance of the city.

CONSTRUCTION OF UTILITY FACILITIES
IN THE RIGHTS-OF-WAY
§ 163.01 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The city is a municipality in accordance with the Constitution of the
State of Illinois of 1970.
   (B)   The city has the authority to adopt ordinances and to promulgate rules
and regulations governing the use of public right-of-way and that protect the
public health, safety and welfare of its citizens.
   (C)   The city uses the public rights-of-way within its corporate limits to
provide essential public services to its residents and businesses, including
traffic- control signals, water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer.
   (D)   Other utility service providers, including electricity, telephone,
natural gas and cable television and video service providers have placed, or
from time to time may request to place, certain utility facilities in the
public rights-of-way within the city.
   (E)   Legislatures and regulatory agencies at the state and federal levels
have implemented changes in the regulatory framework to enhance competition in
the providing of various utility services.
   (F)   The combination of legislative and regulatory changes and the
development of new technologies has led additional service providers to seek
opportunities to provide services in the city.
   (G)   These regulatory and technological changes have resulted in demands
for access to and use of the public rights-of-way in the city as service
providers, particularly in the video and communications services, attempt to
provide new or additional services to compete with incumbent service providers.
   (H)   Unlike prior deregulations of utility services in which incumbent
service providers have been required to make their transmission and/or
distribution systems available to competitors, video and communications
services seeking to compete with incumbent service providers are seeking to
install their own facilities for delivering competing video and communications
services; thereby increasing the number of service providers seeking access to
and use of the public rights-of-way in the city.
   (I)   The public rights-of-way within the city are a limited public resource
held in trust by the city for the benefit of its citizens and the city has a
custodial duty to ensure that the public rights-of-way are used, repaired and
maintained in a manner that best serves the public interest.
   (J)   The corporate authorities of the city find and determine that it is
necessary to and in the best interests of the public health, safety and general
welfare to establish uniform standards and regulations for access to and use of
the public rights-of-way in the city by utility service providers and other
persons and entities that desire to place structures, facilities or equipment
in the public rights-of-way, so as to:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys and
other public ways and places by the city and the general public;
      (2)   Protect against visual and physical obstructions to vehicular and
pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
city’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in public rights-of-
way or property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (6)   Prevent visual blight; and
      (7)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (K)   This subchapter is adopted pursuant to the provisions of:
      (1)   The Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/1-1-1 et seq., including,
without limitation, 65 ILCS 5/11-20-5, 65 ILCS 5/11-20-10, 65 ILCS 5/11-42-11,
65 ILCS 5/11-42-11.2, 65 ILCS 5/11-80-1, 65 ILCS 5/11-80-3, 65 ILCS 5/11-80-6,
65 ILCS 5/11-80-7, 65 ILCS 5/11-80-8, 65 ILCS 5/11-80-10 and 65 ILCS 5/11-80-
13;
      (2)   Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4;
      (3)   The Illinois Highway Code, including, without limitation, Art. 7
and 9 thereof, 605 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq.;
      (4)   The Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act, 35 ILCS 636/5-
1 et seq.; and
      (5)   The Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007, 220 ILCS 5/21-100 et
seq.
   (L)   This subchapter establishes generally applicable standards for
construction on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the public
right-of-way, and for the use of and repair of the public right-of-way.
   (M)   In the enactment of this subchapter, the city has considered a variety
of standards for construction on, over, above, along, under, across, or within,
use of and repair of the public right-of-way, including, but not limited to,
the standards relating to accommodation of utilities on right-of-way of the
Illinois State Highway System promulgated by the State Department of
Transportation and found at 92 Ill. Adm. Code § 530.10 et seq.
   (N)   The city hereby finds that it is in the best interest of the city, the
public and the utilities using the public rights-of-way to establish a
comprehensive set of construction standards and requirements to achieve various
beneficial goals, including, without limitation, enhancing the planning of new
utility facilities; minimizing interference with, and damage to, rights-of-way
and the streets, sidewalks and other structures and improvements located in,
on, over and above the rights-of-way; and reducing costs and expenses to the
public.
   (O)   All prior city utility rights of way ordinances or cable televisions
ordinances, including Ord. 2450, 01-360, 2001-375, 2001-376 and 2001-377, are
hereby amended by the adoption of this subchapter, and where inconsistent with
this subchapter, this subchapter shall supersede said prior ordinance or

adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this subchapter. This subchapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the rights-of-
way within the jurisdiction of the city. A facility lawfully established prior
to the effective date of this subchapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses or similar agreements. The city, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the city
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the city enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the city may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this
subchapter.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the city, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this subchapter and the provisions of

containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the City Building
Department Commissioner within a reasonable time after filing. If the
application does not conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances,
codes, laws, rules and regulations, the City Building Department Commissioner
shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the
City Building Department Commissioner is satisfied that the proposed work
conforms to the requirements of this subchapter and applicable ordinances,
codes, laws, rules and regulations, the City Building Department Commissioner
shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it
shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the
City Building Department Commissioner, that the construction proposed under the
application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this
subchapter.
   (B)   Additional city review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a
telecommunications retailer shall notify the city that it intends to commence
work governed by this subchapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans, specifications
and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of the
facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications retailer to the
city not less than ten days prior to the commencement of work requiring no
excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of work
requiring excavation. The City Building Department Commissioner shall specify
the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and
constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the City Building Department Commissioner fails
to provide such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer
within either ten days after service of notice to the city by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for
new construction or 25 days after service of notice by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under
this subchapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the city, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
163.05 of this chapter, the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
city an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of division (A) above.
   (C)   Additional city review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state-issued authorization under the Cable

granted 45 days after submission to the city, unless otherwise acted upon by
the city; provided, the holder has complied with applicable city codes,
ordinances and regulations.
(Prior Code, § 164.06) (Ord. 07-103, passed 10-9-2007)
§ 163.07 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this subchapter on city rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this subchapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this subchapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the city with
such city representatives in attendance as the city deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
(Prior Code, § 164.07) (Ord. 07-103, passed 10-9-2007)
§ 163.08 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within 90 days after the
completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this subchapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
163.21 of this chapter. If the city denies the request for a variance, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the
facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.

   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility’s liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.

form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city, in an amount of not less than $20,000 per location. Any surety bond or
letter of credit provided pursuant to this division (B) shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the
state at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the City Building Department Commissioner, and may
also include reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. In no
event shall said Security Fund be in an amount of less than $20,000 per work
location. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will
be performed in phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase
consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of
locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior
to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the
City Building Department Commissioner may, in the exercise of sound discretion,
allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be
applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of
the Security Fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount
that would have been required under the provisions of this division (C) for any
single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The city, upon 14 days’ advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division (D), may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund; provided
that, the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the 14-
day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this subchapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
city that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the permittee
shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in division (C) above.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city; provided that, any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) above.
   (G)   Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
subchapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the
permit, the Security Fund and any and all accrued interest therein shall become
the property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation; provided
that, any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the city with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether
reserved by this subchapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

be accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance specified by the City
Director of Public Works from the edge of the pavement. Pits for boring or
jacking shall be excavated no more than 48 hours in advance of boring or
jacking operations and backfilled within 48 hours after boring or jacking
operations are completed. While pits are open, they shall be clearly marked and
protected by barricades. Shoring shall be designed, erected, supported, braced
and maintained so that it will safely support all vertical and lateral loads
that may be imposed upon it during the boring or jacking operation.
            2.   Wet boring or jetting. Wet boring or jetting shall not be
permitted under the roadway.
            3.   Borings with diameters greater than six inches. Borings over
six inches (0.15 m) in diameter shall be accomplished with an auger and
following pipe, and the diameter of the auger shall not exceed the outside
diameter of the following pipe by more than one inch (25 mm).
            4.   Borings with diameters six inches or less. Borings of six
inches or less in diameter may be accomplished by either jacking, guided with
auger or auger and following pipe method.
            5.   Tree preservation. Any facility located within the drip line
of any tree designated by the city to be preserved or protected shall be bored
under or around the root system.
         (b)   Trenching. Trenching for facility installation, repair or
maintenance on rights-of-way shall be done in accord with the applicable
portions of § 603 of IDOT’s “Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction.”

practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipe-line testing. Only
one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless special
permission is obtained from the City Building Department Commissioner.
            2.   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by applicable state law.
Where practicable, the excavated material shall be deposited between the
roadway and the trench as added protection. Excavated material shall not be
allowed to remain on the paved portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width
does not allow for windrowing excavated material off the paved portion of the
roadway, excavated material shall be hauled to an off-road location.
            3.   Drip line of trees. The utility shall not trench within the
drip line of any tree designated by the city to be preserved.
         (c)   Backfilling.
            1.   Any pit, trench or excavation created during the installation
of facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth and length using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT’s Standard Specifications for

unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
            2.   For a period of three years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore
any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If so
ordered by the Building Department Commissioner, the utility, at its expense,
shall remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of the installed
facility, place and properly compact new backfill material, and restore new
pavement, sidewalk, curbs and driveways to the proper grades, as determined by
the Building Department Commissioner.
         (d)   Pavement cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair
shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed
to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this division (B)(1)
(d) is permitted under §
163.21 of this chapter, the following requirements shall apply.
            1.   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and
compacted as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10
gradation, as designated by the Building Department Commissioner.
            2.   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as
soon as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be
provided immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or
the restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the city.
            3.   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
            4.   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
         (e)   Encasement.
            1.   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
city.
            2.   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
            3.   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement
shall be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or city approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the city. Bell and spigot type pipe
shall be encased regardless of installation method.
            4.   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement
may be eliminated.
            5.   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
               a.   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance
or repair; and
               b.   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
            6.   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.
         (f)   Minimum cover of underground facilities. Cover shall be provided
and maintained at least in the amount specified in the following table for
minimum cover for the type of facility:

         (b)   Capacity for the utility’s foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The city may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations (49 C.F.R. § 192.707).
   (D)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. The city may
require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are not
highways, rather than within particular highways.
   (E)   Freestanding facilities.
      (1)   The city may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   The city may require any freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way to be screened from view.
   (F)   Facilities installed above ground. Above ground facilities may be
installed only if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         (g)   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         (h)   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   (H)   Appearance standards.
      (1)   The city may prohibit the installation of facilities in particular
locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
(Prior Code, § 164.16) (Ord. 07-103, passed 10-9-2007)
§ 163.17 VEGETATION CONTROL.
   (A)   Electric utilities; compliance with state laws and regulations. An
electric utility shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation control
activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable Illinois laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the city as permitted by law.
   (B)   Other utilities; tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this subchapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The city will require
compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without
authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The city may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The city may require
that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special
significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm
extensions, covered wire or other means.
   (D)   Chemical use.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) below, no utility shall
spray, inject or pour any chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation
in the city for any purpose, including the control of growth, insects or
disease.
      (2)   Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals will not be
permitted on rights-of-way unless the utility demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the Building Department Commissioner that such spraying is the only
practicable method of vegetation control.
(Prior Code, § 164.17) (Ord. 07-103, passed 10-9-2007)
§ 163.18 REMOVAL, RELOCATION OR MODIFICATIONS OF UTILITY FACILITIES.
   (A)   Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the city, a
utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently
disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility
facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have
determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably
necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance or installation of any city
improvement in or upon, or the operations of the city in or upon, the rights-
of-way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the city, any utility that owns, controls or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall,
at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this subchapter; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The city retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the city, as the city may determine to be necessary, appropriate or
useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances
permit, the city shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior to
cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after
cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights-of-way of the city, the utility shall notify the city within 90 days.
Following receipt of such notice the city may direct the utility to remove all
or any portion of the facility if the City Building Department Commissioner
determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health,
safety and welfare. In the event that the city does not direct the utility that
abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the
city, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or
removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person.
(Prior Code, § 164.18) (Ord. 07-103, passed 10-9-2007)
§ 163.19 CLEANUP AND RESTORATION.
   The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and
terrain and other property within ten days after any portion of the rights-of-
way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or maintenance by
the utility, all to the satisfaction of the city. This includes restoration of
entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using
materials and methods approved by the City Building Department Commissioner.
Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading,
reseeding, resodding or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a
condition substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the
commencement of the project. The time period provided in this section may be
extended by the City Building Department Commissioner for good cause shown.
(Prior Code, § 164.19) (Ord. 07-103, passed 10-9-2007)
§ 163.20 MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or
within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the city and at the utility’s expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit.
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
City Building Department Commissioner or his or her duly authorized agent of
the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for
protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the
necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with
the free movement of traffic, the city police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the city a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after
an emergency repair.
(Prior Code, § 164.20) (Ord. 07-103, passed 10-9-2007)
§ 163.21 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this subchapter must do so in writing to the City Building
Department Commissioner as a part of the permit application. The request shall
identify each provision of this subchapter from which a variance is requested
and the reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The City Building Department
Commissioner shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision
of this subchapter identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The City Building Department
Commissioner may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the
variance has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the City Building Department Commissioner may require
the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this subchapter but which
carry out the purposes of this subchapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the City
Building Department Commissioner under the provisions of this subchapter shall
have the right to appeal to the City Council, or such other board or commission
as it may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing
to the City Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement,
decision or determination. The City Council shall commence its consideration of
the appeal at the Council’s next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least
seven days after the filing of the appeal. The City Council shall timely decide
the appeal.
(Prior Code, § 164.21) (Ord. 07-103, passed 10-9-2007)
§ 163.22 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This subchapter shall take effect ten days after its passage, approval and
publication in pamphlet form.
(Prior Code, § 164.22) (Ord. 07-103, passed 10-9-2007)
§ 163.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person who violated any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
   (B)   (1)   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to
comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in
accordance with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when
the city will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because
the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
subchapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
city’s costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it.
      (2)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as limiting any
additional or further remedies that the city may have for enforcement of this
subchapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 164.01 FINDINGS.
   (A)   This chapter is intended as, and is in the exercise of certain powers
and functions pertaining to the government and affairs of the city.
   (B)   Buildings that are indefinitely vacant or in a state of disrepair or
boarded are public nuisances in that they contribute to the decrease in value
of surrounding properties, precipitate disinvestment by neighboring owners,
provide a location for criminal activity, undermine the aesthetic character of
the neighborhood and city, and have other undesirable effects.
   (C)   Vacant buildings, especially those which remain boarded for more than
three months, are unsightly and diminish neighboring-property values and
neighbors’ sense of well-being and are a public nuisance.
   (D)   Allowing certain buildings to remain indefinitely vacant even in the
absence of code violations or boarding is detrimental to the public health,
safety and welfare; unreasonably interferes with the reasonable and lawful use
and enjoyment of other premises within the neighborhood; may pose an
extraordinary danger to police officers or firefighters entering the premises
in time of emergency; and detracts from the appearance and good order of the
neighborhood; all of which are especially associated with such buildings which
have been vacant for over two years.
   (E)   Registration of vacant properties and implementation of a maintenance
plan will discourage property owners from allowing their properties to remain
indefinitely vacant or in a state of disrepair and will thereby provide a basis
for the return of vacant properties to the housing stock.
   (F)   The city has the authority to regulate the maintenance of properties
and buildings within the city in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare of its citizens.
   (G)   The definition, prohibition and abatement of public nuisances pertain
to the government and affairs of the city.
   (H)   The city has statutory power to define, prohibit and abate public
nuisances pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/11-60-2 of the Illinois Municipal Code.
   (I)   The City Council adopts the “broken window” concept among the rational
for this chapter. The “broken window” concept is that one broken window, left
unrepaired, leads to more broken windows as it gives the appearance that no one
cares or protects the property; that the building becomes increasingly more
deteriorated, and that the deterioration may have a ripple effect.
   (I)   The abatement of nuisances caused by vacant buildings, repair and
rehabilitation of vacant properties and their subsequent occupancy is in the
best interests of the citizens of the city.
   (J)   An ordinance providing for the declaration of certain boarded and/or
vacant buildings as a public nuisance and providing for their abatement is a
means for the city to use in maintaining sanitation and health standards,
preventing crime and avoiding fire, health, and safety hazards and minimizing
or eliminating the effect such buildings have on the personal and economic
well-being of the neighborhood.
   (K)   Various state statutes authorize the city to provide for the removal
of certain nuisances from private properties within the city, including cutting
and removal of neglected weeds, grass, trees and bushes, 65 ILCS 5/11-20-7,
pest control activities, 65 ILCS 5/11-20-8, removal of infected trees, 65 ILCS
5/11-20-12, removal of garbage, debris and graffiti, 65 ILCS 5/11-13, and
removal, securing and enclosing abandoned residential properties, 65 ILCS 5/11-
20-15.1.
   (L)   The city incurs costs in abating these nuisances by performing
property maintenance activities on these properties.
   (M)   Section 11-20-15 of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/11-20-15,
authorizes municipalities to record traditional liens against a property for
these nuisance abatement and property maintenance costs.
   (N)   The Illinois General Assembly recently adopted 65 ILCS 5/11-20-15.1,
effective 3-1-2010, authorizing municipalities to record “priority liens”
against abandoned residential properties for costs incurred in certain property
maintenance activities that would be senior to all other liens with the
exception of tax liens.
   (O)   The corporate authorities of the city deem it to be in the interest of
the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city to set forth
specific registration requirements for vacant buildings, as well as a procedure
for liens regarding property maintenance activities.
(Prior Code, § 165.01) (Ord. 11-141, passed 8-23-2011)
§ 164.02 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as and may be cited as the “Blue Island Vacant
Property and Priority Lien Ordinance” of the City of Blue Island, Illinois.
(Prior Code, § 165.02) (Ord. 11-141, passed 8-23-2011)
§ 164.03 SCOPE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety
and welfare by enactment which:
      (1)   Establishes a program for identification, registration and
regulation of buildings that are or become vacant on and after the effective
date of this chapter;
      (2)   Determines the responsibilities of owners of vacant buildings; and
      (3)   Provides for administration, enforcement of property regulations,
including prevention and abatement of public nuisances, and imposition of
penalties.
   (B)   This chapter shall be construed liberally to affect its purposes.
(Prior Code, § 165.03) (Ord. 11-141, passed 8-23-2011)
§ 164.04 OTHER ORDINANCES.
   This chapter shall not be construed to prevent the enforcement of other
applicable ordinances, codes, legislation and regulations prescribing standards
other than those provided herein, and in the event of conflict, the most
restrictive shall apply.
(Prior Code, § 165.04) (Ord. 11-141, passed 8-23-2011)

§ 164.06 DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Within 60 days after the effective date of this chapter, the Building
Commissioner shall evaluate all buildings in the city he or she believes to be
unoccupied on the effective date of this chapter and make a determination for
each as to whether the building is a vacant building. The Building Commissioner
may determine that a vacant building is not to be regulated under this chapter
for a stated period if, upon consideration of reliable evidence, he or she
determines that regulation of the building under this chapter would not serve
the public health, welfare and safety and makes written findings in support of
his or her decision. For buildings, the Building Commissioner determines to be
vacant buildings, he or she shall, within seven days of making that
determination, send notice of the written determination with the factual
findings to the last taxpayer of record listed on the most recent county tax
records. Said notice of determination shall be sent certified mail, return
receipt requested. Failure of delivery shall not excuse a person from complying
with this chapter. Any person making such service shall execute an affidavit

§ 164.08 APPEAL OF DETERMINATION.
   (A)   An owner of a building determined to be a vacant building as provided
for in this chapter may appeal that determination to the Community Development
Committee. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall be filed with the
Community Development Committee within 15 days of the date of mailing of the
notice of determination. The filing of an appeal stays the owner’s obligation
to register his or her building as required by §§
164.25 through
164.30 of this chapter. The appeal shall contain a complete statement of the
reasons the owner disputes the determination, shall set forth specific facts in

within seven days from the date of notice of owners appeal. The Community
Development Committee must send written notice of its decision to owner. The
Community Development Committee may, but is not required to, seek additional
information from the owner. The Community Development Committee, upon written
notice thereof to the owner, take no more than ten additional days to decide

(Prior Code, § 165.10) (Ord. 11-141, passed 8-23-2011)
§ 164.11 BOARDING OF BUILDINGS.
   It is the policy of the city that boarding is a temporary solution to
prevent unauthorized entry into a vacant building and that boarded buildings
are a public nuisance. A vacant building may not remain boarded longer than
three months unless an extension of that time is part of a plan approved by the
Building Commissioner. A vacant building which is unboarded and code compliant
and for which boarding is determined by the Building Commissioner on the basis
of police reports, citizen complaints and other information of other type
considered reliable by reasonable persons, to not require boarding to prevent
unauthorized entry may not remain vacant for more than two years without an
approved plan for occupancy, sale, demolition or other disposition of the
building.

   Once every six months, the Building Commissioner or his or her designee
shall send notice to the City Council a list of all vacant buildings which have

previously declared buildings which are no longer vacant. The notice shall
include a summary of fees and fines assessed and collected, the compliance and
non-compliance rate of property owners, and other pertinent information in
order for the City Council to make sound decisions regarding future affairs.
Said reports will also be provided to the Police Department, Fire Department

registration.
      (4)   File an amended registration within 15 days of any change in the
information contained in the annual registration. A new registration is
required for any change in ownership whatsoever.

the use and occupancy of the property. Such determination shall be at the
discretion of the Building Department and be based upon the applicable city
codes.

      (1)   A plan of action to repair any doors, windows or other openings
which are boarded up or otherwise secured or covered by any means other than
conventional methods used in the design of the building or permitted for new
construction or similar type. The proposed repair shall result in openings
being secured by conventional methods used in the design of the building or by
methods permitted for new construction of similar type with board removed.
Boarding shall be accomplished with materials and methods described by the
Building Commissioner or his or her designee. The owner shall maintain the
building in an enclosed and secure state until the building is reoccupied or
made available for immediate occupancy. If the owner demonstrates that securing
of the building will provide adequate protection to the public, the Building
Commissioner may waive the requirement of an enclosure;
      (2)   For buildings and/or premises which are determined as being or
containing public nuisances, as defined in §

date of completion of repair for each improperly secured opening and nuisance
identified;
      (4)   When the owner proposes to demolish the vacant building, then the

actions required to achieve habitability. No plan which fails to provide for
compliance with this chapter or, which will not, as determined by the Building
Commissioner or his or her designee, achieve such compliance, within three
months, in the case of a vacant boarded building, and two years, in the case of
a vacant, unboarded and code-compliant building will be approved; except that,
the Building Commissioner may approve an extension of the time during which the
building will be unoccupied beyond two years to a date certain but then only
based upon clear and documented evidence of good cause shown by the owner as
determined;
      (7)   The owner shall conduct, at a minimum, bi-weekly inspections of all
premises upon which unoccupied or vacant buildings are located and the
exteriors shall at all times be maintained in compliance with this chapter;

security guard service at the building from 3:00 p.m. through 8:00 a.m. daily.
Such service shall remain in place until the Building Commissioner or his or
her designee gives written notice that the service is no longer required. Such
service shall be required when the Building Commissioner or his or her designee
makes a written determination that the vacant building constitutes a fire
hazard, is otherwise dangerous to human life or the public welfare, involves
illegal or improper use, occupancy or maintenance, under such conditions that
securing the building is insufficient to prevent the actual or threatened harm.

persuade the Community Development Committee that the modification is not
required by the ordinance or is arbitrary.
   (C)   (1)   The Community Development Committee shall send written notice of
its determination to the owner within ten days of his or her receipt of the
appeal.
      (2)   The Community Development Committee may, but is not required to,

for herein and elsewhere in the municipal code, including, but not limited to,
an action to compel correction of property maintenance violations.

      (1)   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of this chapter, accessory parking and
loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the
districts in which such buildings or uses are located. However, where a
building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this chapter,
and provided that construction is begun within six months of such effective
date and diligently prosecuted to completion, parking and loading facilities in
the amounts required for issuance of said building permit may be provided in
lieu of any different amounts required by this chapter.
      (2)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity or other units of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use. However, no
building or structure lawfully erected or use lawfully established prior to the
effective date of this chapter shall be required to provide such additional
parking or loading facilities unless and until the aggregate increase in units
of measurement shall equal not less than 15% of the units of measurement
existing upon the effective date of this chapter, in which event parking or
loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for the total increase.
However, in the case of expansion or alteration of residential buildings,
required parking or loading facilities shall be provided on the basis of the
total required units of measurement for the entire capacity of such buildings.
      (3)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall
hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be
provided as required for such new use. However, if said building or structure
was erected prior to the effective date of this chapter, additional parking or
loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements
for the new use would exceed those for the existing use if the latter were
subject to the parking and loading provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Existing parking facilities. Accessory off-street parking facilities
in existence on the effective date of this chapter and located on the same lot
as the building or use served shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if
already less than, shall not be further reduced below the requirements for a
similar new building or use under the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Permissive parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this chapter
shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or
loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, provided all
regulations herein governing the location, design and operation of such
facilities are adhered to.
   (D)   Damage or destruction. For any conforming or legally non-conforming
building or use which is in existence on the effective date of this chapter,
which subsequently thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion
or other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off-
street parking or loading facilities need not be provided; except that, parking
or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage
or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in no case
shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in
excess of those required by this chapter for equivalent new uses or
construction.

§ 165.033 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Special use. Planned development shall be permitted as a special use
in appropriate zones only after specific approval by the Planning and Zoning
Board of Appeals and the City Council as set forth under §
165.089 of this chapter and this section.
   (B)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of planned development regulations is to allow more
creative and imaginative design for land developments than is possible under
more conventional zoning regulations. In this regard, the bulk and use
regulations of any district may be modified within a planned development.
Preservation of natural site qualities, better urban amenities, more open
space, and a higher quality project are the desired results of the planned
development process.
      (2)   In addition to the purposes detailed in §
165.089, the following objectives are sought through the use of the planned
development procedure:
         (a)   To permit a creative approach to the use of land and related
physical facilities that results in better design and development, with the
inclusion of aesthetic amenities;
         (b)   To encourage a pattern of development to preserve natural
vegetation, topographic and geological features and environmentally appropriate
features;
         (c)   To create a method for the permanent preservation of common open
space for the continued use and enjoyment of the residents of the development;
         (d)   To provide for more usable and suitably located recreation
facilities and other public and private facilities; and
         (e)   To encourage a land use which promotes the public health,
safety, comfort, morals, and welfare.
   (C)   Pre-application procedure. Prior to the filing of an application for
approval of a planned development, the developer may request an informal
meeting with the city administration and key department heads and/or with the
Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals at a regularly-scheduled meeting of that
body. The pre-application conference is not mandatory. It is intended that the
informal proposal submitted will be in preliminary conceptual form, and the
substance and detail of the matters presented shall, beyond complying with the
requirements of this chapter, be largely within the discretion of the
developer. However, the city and/or Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals may
request the submission of other specified information or documentation. The
purpose of the conference shall be informal communication, information, and
discussion, and no commitments shall be given nor shall statements or opinions
of the City or Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals be deemed binding. No
recommendations need be made to, or acted upon, by the City Council.
   (D)   Preliminary plan stage. The purpose of the preliminary plan is to
obtain tentative approval and/or commitments from the city that the plans,
design and program that the developer intends to build and follow are
acceptable, and that the developer can reasonably proceed into final detailed
architecture, engineering, surveying and landscape architecture in anticipation
of final plan approval and subsequent construction. This is a relatively
detailed submission that assures the developer that its plan is acceptable and
that it can invest the money necessary to prepare final plans with the
assurance that the final plat and plans will be accepted if they substantially
conform to the preliminary plat and plans. It is at this stage that final
modifications, adjustments and interpretations are made to the conceptual plan.
      (1)   Procedure. Every application for planned development shall begin
with a request for preliminary plan approval, unless waived by the Zoning
Administrator. Applications shall be submitted to the City Clerk who shall
refer same to the Zoning Administrator and Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals
for a public hearing and report and recommendation as to whether the City
Council should approve the preliminary plan.
      (2)   General requirements. Applications for review of preliminary plans
must include all information and materials required in this section and §
165.089(C). Seventeen copies of all required information shall be submitted,
which will then be given to members of the Planning and Zoning Board of
Appeals, the City Council and staff. The application shall be accompanied by a
fee as provided in §
165.089.
      (3)   Specific requirements. The following plans and other documentation
must be submitted as part of planned development applications, unless waived by
the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator may also require additional
documents be provided before the preliminary hearing.

of the preliminary plan as it may deem necessary to ensure conformity with the
intent of all comprehensive plan elements, the stated purpose of the planned
development, and the general and specific purposes for planned developments.
      (6)   Preliminary approval. If the preliminary plan is approved by the
City Council, the final plan, once submitted and considered by the Planning and
Zoning Board of Appeals and the City Council, shall be approved and the planned
development, as a form of conditional use, granted by ordinance, if it conforms

recording with the County Recorder of Deeds, shall be prepared and submitted to
the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals. The purpose of the final plat is to
designate with particularity the land subdivided into conventional lots as well
as the division of other land not so treated into common open areas and
building areas. The final plat shall include, but not be limited to:
         (a)   An accurate legal description of the entire area under immediate
development within the planned development;
         (b)   A subdivision plat of all subdivided lands in the same form and
meeting all the requirements of a normal subdivision plat;
         (c)   An accurate legal description of each separate nnsubdivided use
area, including common open space;
         (d)   Designation of the exact location of all buildings to be
constructed;
         (e)   Certificates, seals and signatures required for the dedication
of lands and recording the documents; and
         (f)   Tabulations on separate unsubdivided use area, land area, number
of buildings, number of dwelling units, and dwelling units per acre.
      (3)   Final plans. Any preliminary documents submitted as part of the
approved preliminary plan must be provided in final, updated form, including,
but not limited to, architectural plans, landscaping plans and facilities
plans.
      (4)   Common open space. All common open space may be either conveyed to
a municipal or public corporation, conveyed to a not-for-profit corporation or
entity established for the purpose of benefitting the owners and residents of
the planned development, or retained by the developer. In any event, the City
Council may require legally binding covenants and other guarantees, in a form
approved by the City Attorney, that the common open space will be permanently
preserved as an open area. All land conveyed to a not-for-profit corporation or
like entity shall be subject to the right of said corporation to impose a
legally enforceable lien against the individually owned property in the planned
development for maintenance and improvement of the common open space. Such
documents shall also provide that the city shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to perform necessary maintenance of the common open space and shall
have a lien against the individually owned property in the planned development
for the costs thereof.
      (5)   Public facilities. All public facilities and improvements made
necessary as a result of the planned development shall be either constructed in
advance of the approval of the final plan, or at the election of the city,
escrow deposits, irrevocable letters of credit in a form approved by the City
Attorney, or performance bonds shall be delivered to the city to guarantee
construction of the required improvements.
      (6)   Construction plan. Detailed plans shall be submitted for the
design, construction or installation of site amenities, including buildings,
landscaping, lakes and other site improvements. A final construction schedule
shall be submitted for that portion of the planned development for which
approval is being requested.
      (7)   Covenants. In residential planned developments, agreements,
provisions or covenants that will govern the use, maintenance and continued
protection of the planned development and any of its common open space shall be
provided. Said covenants shall be reviewed and approved by the City Attorney
prior to recordation.
      (8)   Final hearing. Within 30 days after receiving the final plan and
supporting documents, the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the
final plan at a public meeting to determine whether the final plan is in
substantial conformance with the approved preliminary plan. The Planning and
Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine whether the final plan is in conformity
with the regulations provided in this section and the approved preliminary
plan. The Planning and Zoning Board shall recommend approval, approval with
conditions or denial of approval of the final plat. The Planning and Zoning
Board of Appeals shall make written findings and shall submit same together
with its recommendation to the City Council within 30 days of the public
hearing. If the applicant opted to submit preliminary and final plans together,
or final plans alone, the hearing shall be as provided in division (D)(4)
above.
      (9)   City Council action. The City Council shall not act upon a final
planned development plan until it has received the report and recommendation of
the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals. After receipt, the City Council shall
approve, approve with conditions or disapprove the preliminary plan. The City
Council may require such special conditions in the approval of the final plan
as it may deem necessary to ensure conformity with the intent of all
comprehensive plan elements, the stated purpose of the planned development, and
the general and specific purposes for planned developments. Approval of a final
plan by the City Council is valid for a time period of one year, within which
time the final plat must be recorded. If the applicant opted to submit
preliminary and final plans together, or final plans alone, approval shall be
considered as provided in division (D)(5) above.
   (F)   Notice. Notice of the time and place of any preliminary’ hearing, or
any final hearing when a preliminary hearing has been bypassed, shall be given
in the following manner:
      (1)   By publishing notice at least once in one or more newspapers of
general circulation within the city, not more than 30, nor less than 15 days
prior to such hearing;
      (2)   By posting notice as provided in §
165.085 for special uses;
      (3)   By mailing via certified mail notice to all owners of property
within 250 feet of the boundaries of the planned development, with a
description of the proposed planned development and a legal description of the
subject property; and
      (4)   By mailing via certified mail the same notice to owners of property
beyond 250 feet of the boundaries of the planned development, as required by
the Zoning Administrator if he or she deems it necessary and reasonable because
of the size or nature of the development, unusual configuration of the property
involved, or any other reason likely to result in a direct impact of the
development on residents beyond 250 feet.
   (G)   Generally. The following regulations shall also apply, unless waived
by City Council after consideration by the Planning and Zoning Board of
Appeals.
      (1)   Spacing and orientation of building groups - residential.
         (a)   Walls containing main window exposures or main entrances shall
be so oriented as to ensure adequate light and air exposure.
         (b)   Such buildings shall be so arranged as to avoid undue exposure
to concentrated loading or parking facilities and shall be so oriented as to
preserve visual and audible privacy between adjacent buildings.
         (c)   A building wall containing windows and an entrance way shall be
located no closer to another building than a distance equal to the height of
the taller building of the two, but in no case less than 50 feet.

shall be located no closer to another building than a distance equal to the
height of the taller building of the two, but in no case less than 25 feet.
         (e)   A building group shall not be so arranged that any temporary or
permanently inhabited building is inaccessible to emergency vehicles.
         (f)   The proposed site shall be properly landscaped, so as to further
enhance the natural qualities of the land. Where adjacent land use dictates,
proper screening and buffer zones may be required. No certificate of occupancy
shall be issued for any such building or buildings, unless the same conforms in
all respects to such site plans and unless all facilities included in the site
plan are in accordance with the requirements set forth herein. Proper
landscaping shall be provided along all walks and streets, around recreation
areas and along the outer property line of the site.
         (g)   The maximum length of any group of attached structures shall not
exceed 150 feet. A building group may not be so arranged as to be inaccessible
by emergency vehicles.

vehicular ways and parking spaces and to separate pedestrian walks, malls and
public transportation loading places from general vehicular circulation
facilities.
         (c)   Buildings and vehicular circulation open spaces shall be
arranged so that pedestrians moving between buildings are not unnecessarily
exposed to vehicular traffic.
      (4)   Paving and drainage. There shall be an adequate design of grades,
paving, gutters, drainage and treatment of turf to handle storm waters, prevent
erosion, and to prevent the formation of dust.
      (5)   Driveways. All driveways and parking areas shall be developed with
all-weather hard surfaces and shall contain facilities for light illumination.
      (6)   Signs and lighting. Signs and lighting devices shall be properly
arranged with respect to traffic-control devices and adjacent residential
districts.
      (7)   Open space.
         (a)   Permanent open space refers to parks, playgrounds, parkway
medians, landscaped green space, landscape swales (or similar drainage
practices), schools, community centers, parking amenities (including, but not
limited to, ride-sharing spots, charging stations and bicycle racks) or other
similar areas in public ownership or areas covered by an open easement.
         (b)   Pervious open space shall be limited to any land used as yards,
parks, recreational areas, landscaped green areas, and landscape swales (or
similar drainage practices), but shall not include areas used for off-street
parking and any area, the use of which notwithstanding, that has been compacted
or covered with a layer of material so that it does not readily absorb or
retain water.
         (c)   No plan for a planned development shall be approved unless such
plan provides for a certain percentage of total area classifiable as permanent
open space. That percentage is 20% in the R-1 District and 10% in the U-TOD
district.
         (d)   No plan for a planned development shall be approved unless such
plan provides for a certain percentage of gross land area classifiable as
pervious open space. That percentage is 20% in the R-1 District, 10% in the C-
2 District, 15% in the I-1 and I-2 Districts, and 10% in the U-TOD District.
         (e)   Any applicant for a planned development who desires a variance
reducing these open space requirements shall be responsible for demonstrating
that the proposed development will not increase the area’s runoff and will
include sufficient green space.
         (f)   Stormwater facilities.
            1.   As used in this division (G)(7), STORMWATER FACILITIES shall
include the following:
               a.   Vegetated swale. A shallow, landscaped area designed to
capture, convey and potentially infiltrate stormwater runoff as it moves from a
paved surface;
               b.   Infiltration/flow-through planter. A contained landscaped
area designed to capture and retain stormwater runoff; and
               c.   Rain garden. A shallow, landscaped area that can collect,
slow down, filter and absorb large volumes of water and can also delay
discharge into a connected watershed system, either natural or human-made.
            2.   All three stormwater facilities can be used in an urban,
suburban or rural area of the city. They can be used in street or parking lot
applications.
      (8)   Minimum lot, area in residential planned developments. Provided the
overall number of dwelling units per acre (density) is not increased beyond the
provisions of §
165.089(I)(4) of this chapter, and provided that the permanent open space in
accord with division (E)(7) above, the minimum individual lot area per dwelling
unit provisions of the district in which the development is located may be
waived.
(Prior Code, § 166.033) (Ord. 2151, passed 6-28-1971; Ord. 2021-043, passed 9-
14-2021; Ord. 2021-062, passed 12-14-2021)
§ 165.034 YARD REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Projection into required yards. Certain architectural features may
project into required yards as follows.
      (1)   Cornices, canopies, eaves or other similar architectural features
may project into required yards not more than two feet.
      (2)   Bay windows, balconies, fireplaces, fire escapes and chimneys may
project three feet, six inches provided that such features do not occupy, in
the aggregate, more than one-third of the length of the building wall on which
they are located.
   (B)   Walls and fences. Walls and fences are permitted in yards, except
front yards in R-Zones, subject to the visibility requirements in division (I)
below.
   (C)   Front yards for corner lots. A front yard of the required depth shall
be provided on one of the two frontages and a second front yard shall be
provided on the other frontage; provided that, in any R-Zone, the second front
yard need be only 50% of the required depth for front yards in that zone.
   (D)   Minimum side yard width. Where a side yard to a principal building is
provided, although not required by this chapter, it shall not be less than six
feet in width unless it abuts a street or alley.
   (E)   Dwelling over other permitted uses. The horizontal distance between
the rear lot line and the rear wall of a dwelling unit on any floor of the
building shall be not less than 25 feet.
   (F)   Required yard applies to one building only. No part of a yard or other
open space or off-street parking or loading space required for or in connection
with any building for the purpose of complying with this chapter shall be
included as part of a yard, open space or off-street parking or loading space
similarly required for any other building.
   (G)   No reduction of yard dimensions. No yard existing at the time of
passage of this chapter shall be reduced in dimension below the minimum
requirements set forth in §
165.023 of this chapter.
   (H)   Vacation of public ways. Whenever any street, alley or other public
way is vacated in the manner authorized by law, the zone adjoining each side of
such street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the center
of such vacation and all areas included in the vacation shall then and
henceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended zone.
   (I)   Visibility at intersection. On any corner lot nothing shall be
erected, placed, planted or allowed to grow in such a manner as materially to
impede vision between a height of two and one-half and ten feet above the
centerline grades of the intersecting streets in the area bounded by the street
lines of such corner lot.
   (J)   Limited number of buildings. There shall be no more than one principal
dwelling and two accessory structures, including a private garage, on each lot
in any R-Zone except as provided in §
165.033 of this chapter.
   (K)   Deposit of wastes. No materials or wastes shall be deposited on any
premises in such form or manner that they may be transferred off such premises
by natural cause or forces. All materials or wastes which might cause fumes or
dust or which constitute a fire hazard or which may be edible by or otherwise
be attractive to rodents, insects or animals shall be stored outdoors only in
closed containers.
   (L)   Access to service stations, garages and parking areas. No automobile
service station, public garage or commercial parking areas of garages for 25 or
more motor vehicles shall have an entrance or exit for vehicles within 200 feet
along the same side of a street on which is located a school, playground, place
of worship, hospital, library or institution for dependents or for children,
except where such property is in another block or on another street on which
the lot does not abut.
(Prior Code, § 166.034) (Ord. 2151, passed 6-28-1971)
§ 165.035 USE DISPERSAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The dispersal standards contained in this section
exist to prevent the clustering of certain uses to promote diversification
within zoning districts and increase the availability of uses that will benefit
the health, safety, and welfare of residents.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   Dispersal standards contained in the table below shall apply to all
proposed new uses, measuring the distance of that new use from all pre-existing
uses of the same description. New uses shall be prohibited if the distance
between the new use and a pre-existing use of the same description is equal to
or less than the dispersal standard listed for that category or use. For the
purposes of this section, distance shall be measured in a straight line between
the nearest point on the lot line occupied by the pre- existing use to the
nearest point on the lot line to be occupied by the proposed new use.
      (2)   The dispersal standards apply irrespective of whether a particular
proposed use is permitted by right or permitted by special use.
      (3)   The dispersal standards apply to uses not listed in the table below
if the proposed use is similar to a listed use, as determined by the Zoning
Administrator (for permitted uses) or the Planning and Zoning Board Of Appeals
(for special uses).
 
      (4)   If a conflict exists between a dispersal standard listed in this
section and a dispersal standard listed elsewhere in the Blue Island Code of
Ordinances or Illinois statutes, the larger distance shall apply.

(Ord. 2024-34, passed 8-27-2024)
NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS,
STRUCTURES AND USES
§ 165.045 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide for the regulation of
non-conforming uses, buildings and structures and to specify those
circumstances and conditions under which those non- conforming uses, buildings
and structures which adversely affect the maintenance, development, use or
taxable value of other property in the district in which they are located shall
be gradually eliminated in accordance with the authority granted by state law.
   (B)   This chapter establishes separate districts, each of which is an
appropriate area for the location of the uses which are permitted in that
district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of those
districts that those non-conforming uses, buildings and structures, which
substantially and adversely affect the orderly development and taxable value of
other property in the district not be permitted to continue indefinitely. It is
logical and reasonable, and in accordance with the authority delegated by state
law, that a time limit be placed upon the continuance of such existing non-
conforming uses, based upon the nature of the use; and in the case of non-
conforming buildings and structures, upon their character, age and the
investment therein. In such cases, the adoption of a reasonable amortization
program permits the owner gradually to make his or her plans during a period
when he or she is allowed to continue the non- conforming use of his or her
property, thereby minimizing his or her loss, while at the same time assuring
the public that the district in which the non- conformity exists will
eventually benefit from a substantial uniformity of permitted uses. The use of
the term STRUCTURE herein shall include any improvement upon land, other than
the land itself, and shall include any sign, whether attached to or upon
another structure, or to or upon a building, or whether affixed directly in the
ground, and shall include all such signs as are painted or otherwise applied
directly upon the surface of a building.
(Prior Code, § 166.050) (Ord. 2151, passed 6-28-1971)
§ 165.046 AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES.
   (A)   Any pre-existing non-conforming use, building or structure which
existed lawfully at the time of the adoption of this chapter and which remains
non-conforming, and any use, building or structure which became non-conforming
upon the adoption of this chapter or which will become non-conforming upon the
adoption of any amendment thereto, may be continued, some for specified and
respective periods of time, subject to the regulations which follow.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the above division (A), any use that would require a
special use permit to operate within that zoning district shall be deemed non-
conforming if no special use permit has been obtained. Legally non-conforming
uses of this type shall be allowed to continue until there is a change of
ownership or, for non-residential properties, tenancy, at which time the new
owner or, for non-residential properties, tenant shall apply for a special use
permit under §
165.089 of this chapter to become a conforming use. Such special uses shall be
granted provided that the special use meets all standards under § 165.089(F)
and all violations of building codes discovered during mandatory inspections
have been resolved, except that no special use shall be denied solely for non-
conformance with the regulations listed in §
165.047(A) of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 166.051) (Ord. 2151, passed 6-28-1971; Ord. 2024-037, passed 8-
27-2024)
§ 165.047 EXEMPTED BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES.
   (A)   No building, structure or use lawfully established on the effective
date of this chapter shall be subject to the amortization provisions of this
subchapter solely by reason of being non-conforming with respect to the
standards prescribed in this chapter for any of the following:
      (1)   Floor area ratio;
      (2)   Yards: front, side, rear or transitional;
      (3)   Lot area per dwelling unit;
      (4)   Building height;
      (5)   Maximum gross floor area;
      (6)   Off-street parking and loading spaces; and
      (7)   Number of employees.
   (B)   No building, structure or use lawfully established on the effective
date of this chapter and located in any commercial or industrial district shall
be subject to the amortization provisions of this subchapter, except for a non-
conforming use of land. To protect the health and safety of those using the
buildings or structures, this provision shall not prevent the city from
requiring property owners to repair or modify buildings or structures that are
not in compliance with the requirements of this Code, except those standards
exempted in division (A).
   (C)   No residential use lawfully established on the effective date of this
chapter shall be subject to the amortization provisions of this subchapter.
This provision shall include principal dwelling units, guest houses, and coach
houses. For purposes of this section, “coach house” refers to a structure, or
part of a structure, that is not the principal dwelling unit and contains
exactly one accessory dwelling unit. To protect the health and safety of its
residents, this provision also shall not prevent the city from requiring
property owners to repair or modify buildings or structures that are not in
compliance with the requirements of this Code, except those standards exempted
in division (A) above.
   (D)   Non-conforming signs shall be subject to amortization only as provided
in this subchapter, but in all other respects, signs shall be subject to the
provisions applicable to non-conforming structures and the use thereof.

§ 165.048 BUILDING NOT IN CONFORMANCE WITH DISTRICT REGULATIONS; CONTINUANCE
OF.
   Any lawfully existing building or structure which does not conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located may be continued subject to
the provisions of this section.
   (A)   Repairs and alterations. Ordinary repairs and alterations may be made
to a non-conforming building or structure; provided that, no structural
alterations shall be made in or to a building or structure all, or
substantially all, of which is designed or intended for a use not permitted in
the district in which it is located, except those required by law or except to
make the building or structure and use thereof conform to the regulations of
the district in which it is located. For the purpose of this section, repairs
shall include the replacement of storage tanks where the safety of operation of
the installation required such replacement, and other replacements of, or
substitutions for, machinery or equipment not involving structural alterations
to the building or structure except as hereinabove provided.
   (B)   Additions and enlargements. A non- conforming building or structure
which is non- conforming as to bulk, or all or substantially all of which is
designed or intended for a use not permitted in the district, in which it is
located shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner unless such additions
and enlargements thereto are made to conform to all the regulations of the
district in which it is located, and unless such non-conforming building or
structure, including all additions and enlargements thereto, shall conform to §
165.023 of this chapter.
   (C)   Moving. No building or structure which does not conform to all of the
regulations of the district in which it is located shall be moved in whole or
part to any other location on the lot unless every portion of such building or
structure which is moved and the use thereof is made to conform to all the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (D)   Restoration of damaged non-conforming building. A building or
structure, all or substantially all of which is designed or intended for a use
which is not permitted in the district in which it is located, and which is
destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty or act of God to the extent that
the cost of restoration to the condition in which it was before the occurrence
shall exceed 50% of the cost of restoration of the entire building new, shall
not be restored unless said building or structure and the use thereof shall
conform to all the regulations of the district in which it is located. In the
event such damage or destruction is less than 50% of the cost of restoration of
the entire building new, no repairs or reconstruction shall be made unless such
restoration is started within one year from date of the partial destruction and
is diligently prosecuted to completion.
   (E)   Discontinuance of use. A building, structure or portion thereof, all

§ 165.086 VARIATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. The City Council, by ordinance, may grant a variation in the
regulations of this chapter in harmony with their general purpose and intent,
only in the specific instances and in accordance with standards and procedures
hereinafter set forth.
   (B)   Procedure. An application for a variation shall be filed in writing
with the Zoning Administrator on forms recommended by the Planning and Zoning
Board of Appeals and prepared by the Zoning Administrator. Such application
shall be forwarded from the Zoning Administrator to the Planning and Zoning
Board of Appeals with a request to hold a public hearing and thereafter set
forth its findings and recommendations to the City Council. Notice of the time
and place of such public hearing shall be published at least once, not more
than 30 days, or less than 15 days, before the hearing, in a newspaper of

Appeals by rule, may require.
      (1)   Standards. The City Council shall not vary the regulations relating
to use, construction or alteration of buildings or structures or the use of
land as authorized in this chapter, unless the Planning and Zoning Board of
Appeals shall have made findings based upon the evidence presented to it in
each specific case that the following conditions have been complied with:
         (a)   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in
the district in which it is located;
         (b)   The proposed variation will not merely serve as a convenience to
the applicant, but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship which
would result if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out and which
is not generally applicable to other property within the same district;
         (c)   The alleged hardship has not been created by any person
presently having a proprietary interest in the premises;
         (d)   The proposed variation will not be materially detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood;
         (e)   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion in the
public streets, increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety;
         (f)   The proposed variation will not alter the essential character of
the neighborhood; and
         (g)   The proposed variation is in harmony with the spirit and intent
of this chapter.
      (2)   Recommend. The Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend
the imposition of such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefitted
by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards established
above, to reduce or minimize the effect of such variation upon other properties
in the neighborhood, and to better carry out the general intent of this
chapter.
   (C)   Authorized variations.
      (1)   Variations from the regulations of this chapter shall be granted by
the City Council only in accordance with the standards established in this
section and only in the following instances:
         (a)   To permit any yard or setback less than a yard or a setback
required by the applicable regulations, or an impervious coverage of 10% or
less of the allowed impervious lot area;
         (b)   To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise
prohibited solely because of insufficient area or width of the lot or lots, but
in no event shall the respective area and width of the lot or lots be less than
75% of the required area and width;
         (c)   To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two or more uses, provided that substantial use of such
facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours of
the same days of the week;
         (d)   To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading
facilities required by not more than one parking space or loading space, or 20%
of the applicable regulations, whichever number is greater;
         (e)   To increase by not more than 25% the maximum distance that
required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use served;
         (f)   To allow a fence, wall or hedge in excess of the height
limitations specified in this chapter; and
         (g)   In such other instances as may be provided by law.
      (2)   No ordinance of the City Council granting a variance shall be valid
for a period longer than six months from the date of such ordinance unless the
building permit is obtained within such period and the erection or alteration
of a building is started or the use is commenced with such period.

§ 165.087 APPEALS.
   (A)   An appeal may be taken to the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals by
any person, firm or corporation, or by any office, department, board or bureau
aggrieved by a decision of the Building Official. Such an appeal shall be taken
within 30 days after the decision on the action complained of, by filing with

Building Official shall forthwith transmit to the Planning and Zoning Board of
Appeals all of the papers constituting a record upon which the action appealed
from was taken.
   (B)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from unless the Building Official certifies to the Planning and Zoning
Board of Appeals, after the notice of the appeal has been filed with him or
her, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or
her opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property, in which case the
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may
be granted by the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals or by a court of record.
   (C)   The Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall select a reasonable
time and place for the hearing of the appeal and give due notice thereof to the
parties by mailing notice thereof to the parties in interest, said mailing to
be made at least ten days prior to the date of hearing. The Board shall
thereafter reach its decision within 60 days from the filing of the appeal. The
Board may affirm or may reverse wholly or in part, or modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination, and to that end, shall have all the
powers of the officer to whom the appeal is taken. The Building Official shall
maintain records of all actions of the Board relative to appeals.

§ 165.088 AMENDMENT OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   Authority. The City Council may, from time to time, in the manner
hereinafter set forth, amend the regulations imposed in the districts created
by this chapter or amend district boundary lines; provided that, in all
amendatory ordinances adopted under the authority of this section, due
allowance shall be made for existing conditions, the conservation of property
values, the direction of building development to the best advantage of the
entire city and the uses to which property is devoted at the time of the
adoption of such amendatory ordinance.
   (B)   Initiation of amendment. Amendments may be proposed by the City
Council, the Planning Commission, the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals or
by any owner or owners of property within a zoning district which would be
affected by such amendment or the duly authorized agent or agents thereof.
   (C)   Application. An application for an amendment shall be filed with the
Zoning Administrator on a suitable form provided by the Zoning Administrator,
accompanied by such information and data as is recommended by the Planning and
Zoning Board of Appeals. Copies of such application shall be forwarded by the
Zoning Administrator to the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals with a request
to hold a public hearing thereon and to the Building Official for examination
of the application and compliance with all applicable ordinances.
   (D)   Hearing. The Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public
hearing on each application for an amendment at such time and place as shall be
established by the Board. The hearing shall be conducted and a record of such
proceedings shall be preserved in such manner as the Board shall, by rule,
prescribe from time to time.
   (E)   Notice. Notice of time and place of such hearing shall be published at
least once in one or more newspapers of general circulation within the city,
not more than 30, nor less than 15, days before such hearing. Supplemental or
additional notices may be published or distributed as the Planning and Zoning
Board of Appeals may, by rule, prescribe from time to time.
   (F)   Findings.
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall make written
findings of fact and shall submit same together with its recommendations to the
City Council within 30 days of the public hearing. Where the purpose and effect
of the proposed amendment is to change the zoning classification of a
particular property, the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall make
findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case with
respect to the following matters:
         (a)   Existing uses of property within the general area of the
property in question;
         (b)   The zoning classification of the property within the general
area of the property in question;
         (c)   The suitability of the property in question to the uses
permitted under the existing zoning classification;
         (d)   The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the
property in question; and
         (e)   Projected use of the property, as indicated in the comprehensive
plan.
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall not recommend the
adoption of a proposed amendment unless it finds that the adoption of such
amendment is in the public interest and is not solely for the interest of the
applicant. The Board may recommend the adoption of an amendment changing the
zoning classification of the property in question to any higher classification
than that requested by the applicant. For the purpose of this division (F), the
R-1 District shall be considered the highest classification and the I-
2 District shall be considered the lowest classification.
   (G)   Action by City Council.
      (1)   The City Council shall not act upon a proposed amendment to this
chapter until it shall have received a written report and recommendation from
the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals on the proposed amendment.
      (2)   The City Council may grant or deny any application for an
amendment; however, in the event of a written protest against any proposed
amendment, signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20% of the frontage
proposed to be altered, or by the owners of 20% of the frontage immediately
adjoining or across an alley therefrom, or by the owners of 20% of the frontage
directly opposite the frontage proposed to be altered, such amendment shall not
be passed except by a favorable vote of two-thirds of all the members of the
City Council then holding office.
      (3)   If an application for a proposed amendment is not acted upon
finally by the City Council, within 90 days of the date upon which such
application is received by the City Council, it shall be deemed to have been
denied.
(Prior Code, § 166.094) (Ord. 2151, passed 6-28-1971; Ord. 2021-043, passed 9-
14-2021)
§ 165.089 SPECIAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose. The development and execution of this chapter is based upon
the division of the city into
districts within which the use of land and buildings, and the bulk and location
of buildings and structures in relation to the land, are substantially uniform.
It is recognized, however, that there are certain uses which, because of their
unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular
district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of
those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use
at the particular location. Such uses fall into two categories:
      (1)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest; and
      (2)   Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
   (B)   Initiation of special use. Any person having a freehold interest in
land, or a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a
contractual interest which may become a freehold interest or an exclusive
possessory interest, and which is specifically enforceable, may file an
application to use such land for one or more of the special uses provided for
in this chapter in the zoning district in which the land is located.
   (C)   Application. An application for a special use shall be filed with the
Zoning Administrator on a suitable form provided by the Zoning Administrator
and shall be accompanied by such plans and other data as are recommended by the
Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals, and shall include a statement in writing
by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed special use
will conform to the standards hereinafter set forth. Copies of such application
shall be forwarded by the Zoning Administrator to the Planning and Zoning Board
of Appeals with a request to hold a public hearing thereon and to the Building
Official for examination of the application and compliance with all appliance
ordinances.
   (D)   Hearing. Upon receipt in proper form of the application and statement,
the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold at least one public hearing
on the proposed special use. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall
be published at least once in one or more newspapers of general circulation
within the city, not more than 30, nor less than 15, days prior to such
hearing. The published notice may be supplemented by such additional forms of
notice as the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals may, by rule, require.
   (E)   Authorization. For each application for a special use, the Planning
and Zoning Board of Appeals shall report to the City Council its findings and
recommendations, including the stipulation of additional conditions and
guarantees that such conditions will be complied with when they are deemed
necessary for the protection of the public interest. If an application for a
proposed use is not acted upon finally by the City Council within 90 days of
the date upon which such application is received by the City Council, it shall
be deemed to have been denied.
   (F)   Standards. No special use shall be recommended by the Planning and
Zoning Board of Appeals unless such Board shall find that:
      (1)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will
not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or
general welfare;
      (2)   The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of
other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood;
      (3)   The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district;
      (4)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
      (5)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in public streets; and
      (6)   The special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may in each instance be modified by the City Council pursuant to
the recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (G)   Special conditions and guarantees. Prior to the granting of any
special use, the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend, and the
City Council shall stipulate, such conditions and restrictions upon the
establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the special
use as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to
secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified herein. In all
cases in which special uses are granted, the City Council shall require such
evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions
stipulated in connection therewith are being and will be complied with. In
addition, all special use permits shall be conditioned upon the following:
      (1)   The special use shall be limited to the applicant and shall not be
transferable except upon reapplication, hearing and approval in the manner
provided in the Zoning Code;
      (2)   The special use approval authorizes the conduct of the special use
only on the applicant's property identified in the application and is not
transferable to other properties;
      (3)   Any modification or intensification of a special use that alters
the essential character or operation of the use in a way not intended at the
time the special use was granted shall require a new special use approval;
      (4)   The approval of a special use authorizes the property to be used in
the manner proposed, but does not alone authorize the establishment or
extension of any use, nor development, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, or moving of any building, structure, or parking lot without first
obtaining any other required permit, including a zoning certificate, building
permit and certificate of occupancy;
      (5)   The special use shall comply with all other codes and ordinances of
the City of Blue Island, the County of Cook, the State of Illinois, and the
federal government; and
      (6)   The special use shall not involve uses, activities, processes,
materials, equipment and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to
any persons, property or the general welfare by reason of excessive production
of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare or odors.
   (H)   Adult regulated special use.
      (1)   General. In the development and execution of this chapter, it is
recognized that there are some uses which, because of their very nature, are
recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics,
particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances,
thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. Special regulation
of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not
contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood.
These special regulations are itemized in this section. The primary controls or
regulations are also itemized in this section and are for the purpose of
preventing a concentration of these uses in any one area (i.e., not more than
two such uses within 1,000 feet of each other which would create such adverse
effects). Uses subject to these controls are as follows:
         (a)   Adult book store;
         (b)   Adult motion picture theater;
         (c)   Adult mini motion picture theater; and
         (d)   Adult entertainment cabaret.
      (2)   Waiver. The Mayor and City Council may waive the locational
provision set forth in division (H)(1) above for adult book stores, adult
motion picture theaters, adult mini motion picture theaters or adult
entertainment cabarets, if the following findings are made:
         (a)   The proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest or
injurious to nearby properties, and that the spirit and intent of this chapter
will be observed;
         (b)   The proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the development
of a “skid row” area;
         (c)   The establishment of an additional regulated use in the area
will not be contrary to any program of neighborhood conservation nor will it
interfere with any program of urban renewal; and
         (d)   All applicable regulations of this chapter will be observed.
      (3)   Locations near residential areas. It shall be unlawful to hereafter
establish any adult book store, adult motion picture theater, adult mini
theater or adult entertainment cabaret within 1,500 feet of any area zoned for
residential use or use by churches or schools. This prohibition may be waived
if the person applying for the waiver shall file with the Planning and Zoning
Board of Appeals a petition which indicates approval of the proposed regulated
use by 60% of the persons owning, residing or doing business within a radius of
1,500 feet of the location of the proposed use. The petitioner shall attempt to
contact all eligible locations within this radius, and must maintain a list of
all addresses at which no contact was made.
         (a)   The Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall adopt rules and
regulations governing the procedure for securing the petition of consent
provided for in division (H)(3) above. The rules shall provide that the
circulator of the petition requesting a waiver shall subscribe to an affidavit
attesting to the fact that the petition was circulated in accordance with the
rules of the Board, that the circulator personally witnessed the signatures on
the petition, and that the same were affixed to the petition by the person
whose name appeared thereon.
         (b)   The Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall not consider the
waiver of locational requirements set forth in division (H)(3) above until the
above described petition shall have been filed and verified.
      (4)   Application for adult regulated special use. An application for an
adult regulated special use shall be filed with the City Clerk on a suitable
form provided by the City Clerk, shall be accompanied by such plans and other
data recommended by the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals, and shall include
a statement in writing by the applicant along with adequate evidence showing
that the proposed adult regulated special use will conform to the standards
hereinafter set fo shall be supported by the waiver of location requirements as
set forth in this division (H). Copies of such application shall be forwarded
by the City Clerk to the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals with a request to
hold a public hearing thereon and to the Building Official for examination of
the application and compliance with all applicable ordinances.
      (5)   Hearing on application. Upon receipt in proper form of the
application and statement, the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold
at least one public hearing on the proposed adult regulated special use. Notice
of the time and place of such hearing shall be published at least once in one
or more newspapers of general circulation within the city, not more than 30,
nor less than 15, days prior to such hearing. The published notice may be
supplemented by such additional forms of notice as the Planning and Zoning
Board of Appeals, by rule, requires.
      (6)   Authorization. For each application for an adult regulated special
use, the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall report to the City Council
its findings and recommendations, including the stipulation of additional
conditions and guarantees that such conditions will be complied with when they
are deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest. If an
application for a proposed adult regulated special use is not acted upon
finally by the City Council within 90 days of the date upon which such
application is received by the City Council, it shall be deemed to have been
denied.
      (7)   Standards. No adult regulated special use shall be recommended by
the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals unless such Board shall find that:
         (a)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the adult
regulated special use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health,
safety, morals, comfort or general welfare;
         (b)   The adult regulated special use will not be injurious to the use
and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes
already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within
the neighborhood;
         (c)   The establishment of the adult regulated special use will not
impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding
property for uses permitted in the district;
         (d)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other
necessary facilities have been or are being provided;
         (e)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in public streets; and
         (f)   The adult regulated special use, in all respects, conforms to
the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as
such regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the City Council
pursuant to the recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals.
      (8)   Conditions and guarantees. Prior to the granting of any adult
regulated special use, the Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend, and the City
Council shall stipulate, such conditions and restrictions upon the
establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the adult
regulated special use as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public
interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified
herein. In all cases in which adult regulated special uses are granted, the
City Council shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem
necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are
being and will be complied with.
   (I)   Planned developments. Planned developments are of such substantially
different character from other special uses that specific and additional
standards and exceptions are hereby established to govern the report and
recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals and the action of
the City Council.
      (1)   Purposes. Some specific purposes of the planned development
procedure are:
         (a)   Residential planned development. To offer recreational
opportunities close to home; to enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by the
conservation of streams and local spots of natural beauty; to add to the sense
of spaciousness through the preservation of natural green spaces; to counteract
the effects of urban monotony and congestion in the streets; to encourage
cooperative relationships between neighbors and participation by all age groups
in the use and care of local open space tracts in new residential subdivisions;
to promote harmonious architecture between adjacent dwellings or institutional
buildings; and to encourage the placement of structures in proper relationship
to the natural characteristics of the site;
         (b)   Business planned development. To promote the cooperative
development of business centers each with adequate off-street parking; to
control access points on thoroughfares; to separate pedestrian and automobile
traffic; to aid in stabilizing property values; to develop centers of size and
location compatible with the market potential; to buffer adjacent residential
areas with landscaped green spaces; and to encourage harmonious architecture
between adjacent commercial structures; and
         (c)   Industrial planned development. To promote the establishment of
industrial parks; to permit groups of industrial buildings with an integrated
design and coordinated physical plan; to encourage recreational facilities
within industrial areas; and to buffer adjacent residential areas with
landscaped green spaces.
      (2)   Required information. The developer shall be required to submit
plans and other documentation to the Planning and Zoning Board as detailed in §
165.033 .
      (3)   Use exceptions. The Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals may
recommend and the City Council may authorize that there be in part of the area
of such development, and for the duration of such development, specified uses
not permitted by the use regulations of the district in which said development
is located; provided, the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals finds that:
         (a)   The uses permitted by such exception are necessary or desirable
and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the development;
         (b)   The uses permitted by such exception are not of such a nature or
so located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the surrounding
neighborhood; and
         (c)   Not more than 25% of the ground area or of the gross floor area
of such development shall be devoted to the uses permitted by said exception.
      (4)   Bulk regulations. In the case of any planned development, the
Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend and the City Council may
authorize exceptions to the applicable bulk regulations of this chapter within
the boundaries of such development; provided, the Planning and Zoning Board of
Appeals finds that:
         (a)   Such exception shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an
integrated site plan no less beneficial to the residents or occupants of such
development and the neighboring property, than would be obtained under the bulk
regulations of this chapter for building development on separate zoning lots;
         (b)   The lot coverage percent for residential planned development
would not exceed by more than 20% the maximum lot coverage percent which would
be determined on the basis of the percentage required for the individual uses
in such planned developments, as listed in §
165.023 of this chapter; and
         (c)   In a residential planned development the maximum number of
dwelling units permitted shall be determined by dividing the net development
area by the minimum lot area per dwelling unit required by the district or
districts in which the area is located, and then increasing this number by 20%.
Net development area shall be determined by subtracting the area set aside for
non-residential uses from the gross development area and deducting 10% of the
remainder for streets regardless of the amount of land actually required for
streets. The area of land set aside for common open space or recreational use
may be included in determining the number of dwelling units permitted.
      (5)   Additional standards.
         (a)   In addition to meeting the special use standards provided in §
165.088(F), no planned development shall be recommended by the Zoning Board of
Appeals and approved by the City Council unless the Board and Council find that
the development meets the following standards.
            1.   Size and ownership. The site of the planned development must
be under single ownership and/or unified control and be not less than two acres
in area.
            2.   Compatibility. The planned development shall be demonstrated
by developer to be of a type, and to be so located as to exercise no undue
detrimental influence upon surrounding properties and to be compatible with the
surrounding uses.
            3.   Need. A showing of the desirability of the plan and its
benefit to the community must be made.
            4.   Yards. The required yards along the periphery of the planned
development shall be at least equal in width or depth to that of the adjacent
zoning district or districts.
            5.   Parking requirements. Adequate parking shall be provided as
required in other sections of this chapter.
            6.   Traffic. Adequate provision shall be made to provide ingress
and egress so designated as to minimize traffic congestion on the public
streets and promote safety.
         (b)   The planned development may depart from strict conformance with
the required density, dimension, area, height, bulk, use and other regulations
for the zoning district in which the property is located, as long as all
special use and planned development standards are met.
      (6)   Conditions and restrictions. Prior to the granting of any planned
development, the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals and/or the City Council
may require such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location,
design, layout, height, density, construction, maintenance, aesthetics,
operation and other elements of the planned development as deemed necessary for
the protection of the public interest, protection of the adjacent area, and to

Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals and the City Council.
   (K)   Revocation. In any case where a special use has not been established
within one year after the date of granting thereof, then without further action
by the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals or the City Council the

(Prior Code, § 166.110) (Ord. 2014-040, passed 7-8-2014; Ord. 2023-030, passed
5-23-2023) Penalty, see §
165.999
§ 165.111 DETERMINATION OF VISIBILITY.
   In determining visibility of a sign from a residential property, it will be
assumed that a two-story residence will occupy the property with second-story
windows facing toward the sign.
(Prior Code, § 166.111) (Ord. 2014-040, passed 7-8-2014)
§ 165.112 MEASUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Computation of sign area. For signs on a background, the entire area
of the background will be calculated for sign area, including any material or
color forming the sign face or background used to differentiate the sign from
the structure against which it is placed. Sign area does not include any
supporting framework or bracing, unless such framework or bracing is part of
the message or sign face.
      (1)   Computation of sign area.
      (2)   Computation of sign area, non-rectangle.
      (3)   Computation of sign area, individual lettering.
         (a)   For wall signs consisting of individually attached letters or
logos, the area of a sign face (“sign area”) is calculated by means of the
smallest square, circle, rectangle or triangle, or combination thereof that
will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or
other display. Sign area does not include any supporting framework or bracing,
unless such framework or bracing is part of the message or sign face.
         (b)   For awning or canopy signs, the sign area is calculated in the
same manner as for wall signs consisting of individual letters and logos.
      (4)   Computation of sign area, individual lettering.
      (5)   Measurement of area of multi-faced signs. Where the sign faces of a
double-faced sign are parallel and the distance between the faces is three feet
or less, only one display face will be measured in computing sign area. If the
two faces of a double-faced sign are of unequal area, the area of the sign will
be the area of the larger sign. In all other cases, the areas of all faces of a
multi-faced sign will be added together to compute the area of the sign.
      (6)   Sign height and clearance measurements. The height of a sign will
be computed as the distance from the highest point of the sign structure to the
elevation of the centerline of the adjacent public street or highway. The
required clearance of a pole or projecting sign will be computed as the
distance from the lowest point of the sign structure to the established grade
on which the sign rests or is directly below the sign.
      (7)   Sign height and clearance measurements.
   (B)   Design loads (wind, direct and snow). Any sign, other advertising
structure, marquee, canopy or awning as defined in this chapter must be
designed and constructed to withstand a wind pressure of not less than 30
pounds per square foot of net surface area, snow loads as required by the city
code, and ASCE/SEI minimum design loads for buildings and other structures as
required in the Building Code and/or other ordinances of the city.
   (C)   Location. On a corner lot, no freestanding sign over two feet tall may
be placed within the clear sight area, as defined.
   (D)   Illumination.
      (1)   Reflector lighting. Any sign illumination, including gooseneck or
reflectors and internally illuminated signs, and all electronic signs must be
designed, located, shielded and directed to prevent the casting of glare or
direct light upon roadways and surrounding properties, or the distraction of
motor vehicle operators or pedestrians in the public right-of-way. In the case
of internally illuminated signs, the sign face must function as a filter for
any illumination.
      (2)   The use of neon lighting as an accent is permitted for projecting,
window and wall signs in the U-TOD and Commercial Sign Overlay Districts,
subject to the following.
         (a)   Neon lighting shall only be used as an accent material on
projecting and wall signs, such as for letters, logos and/or sign details.
         (b)   Neon lighting on projecting and wall signs shall not be
illuminated during the daylight hours. When lit, neon lighting must be
continuously illuminated. Flashing neon is prohibited.
         (c)   Neon lighting on projecting and wall signs shall not be combined
with any reflective materials (such as mirrors, polished metal, highly-glazed
tiles or other similar materials) that would cause glare and increase the
spread of light.
         (d)   Neon tubes or LED-related neon tubes (flexible, “opaque,” or
frosted) are allowed to accent windows in a commercial setting (i.e., a
storefront window), but LED light strips are prohibited, especially if LED
emitting diodes can be seen.
      (3)   LED light strips are prohibited to outline business signs,
buildings, or building elements such as windows, doors, staircases, and etc.
      (4)   Any sign that uses illumination shall be turned off while the
related business is not open to the public for regular distribution of goods or
services.
      (5)   No sign illumination shall exceed one footcandle of illumination at
the property line, except indirect lighting where permitted in accordance with
this section.
   (E)   Landscaping. All ground signs must be landscaped at the base of the
sign in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Landscaping must extend a minimum of one square foot for every one
square foot of sign area. All landscaping must be maintained in good condition,
and free and clear of rubbish and weeds. Landscaping around the base of a sign
is included in the total amount of landscaping required on a site, if
applicable.
      (2)   Ground signs (monument or pole) must be landscaped with small
shrubs a minimum of 18 inches in height at planting. The remainder of the
landscaped area must be planted with a mix of perennials, ornamental grasses,
shrubs, groundcover and organic mulch.
   (F)   Items of information.
      (1)   All signs must limit the number of items of information on any
single sign face to no more than six items to prevent traffic hazards for
passing motorists and to minimize the cluttered appearance of signs.
      (2)   Each piece of information on a sign shall be defined as an item of
information. For example, each of the following would be defined as one item of
information: a telephone number, the name of the business, even if multiple
words, or the business logo. If the sign advertises products or services, each
product or service would be one item of information. The street number address
of the business is not counted as an item of information.
      (3)   In the case of an electronic sign, the electronic portion of the
sign counts as one item of information. Changeable copy signs, where the items
of information are changed manually, are also counted as one item of
information.
      (4)   All signs on a zoning lot must be related to goods and/or services
sold or offered on the premises, with the exception of non-commercial or
political signs.
      (5)   Ground signs for multi-tenant commercial buildings used to
advertise which tenants are located within the development, are limited to one
item of information per tenant within the development, in addition to the name
and address of the development.
      (6)   Directory signs and hospital signs are exempt from the items of
information limitation.
   (G)   Design criteria.
      (1)   The purpose of these design criteria is to establish a checklist of
those items relative to signs that affect the physical aspect of the city’s
environment. Pertinent to signs is the design of the sign, its scale and
relationship to buildings and structures, plantings, street furniture and
miscellaneous other objects.
      (2)   The following criteria are not intended to restrict imagination,
innovation or variety, but rather to assist in focusing on design principles
that can result in creative solutions that will develop a satisfactory visual
appearance within the city, preserve property values and promote the public
health, safety and welfare.
         (a)   Every sign shall have good scale and proportion in its design
and in its visual relationship to buildings and surroundings.
         (b)   Sign materials, size, color, lettering, location and arrangement
shall be an integral part of site and building design.
         (c)   The colors, materials and lighting of every sign shall be
restrained and harmonious.
         (d)   The number of graphic elements on a sign shall be held to the
minimum needed to convey the sign’s major message and shall be composed in
proportion to the area of the sign face. Text should be kept to a minimum.
         (e)   Lighting for signs shall be in harmony with the signs’ and the
project’s design. If external lighting is used, it should be arranged so the
light source is shielded from view.
         (f)   Sign supports and braces shall whenever possible be an integral
part of the sign design. Necessary supports or braces shall whenever possible
be hidden from public view.

§ 165.113 ESTABLISHMENT OF SIGN OVERLAY DISTRICTS.
   (A)   The following Sign Overlay Districts are established, and are mapped
in division (C) below:
      (1)   Residential Sign Overlay District. The purpose of the Residential
Sign Overlay District is to ensure proper regulation of signs common to
residential areas for both limited non-residential uses that need to identify
their location and services, and the variety of temporary and non-commercial
signs residents may require, provided in a manner that is not contrary to the
established predominant residential character of the district.
      (2)   Commercial Sign Overlay District. The purpose of the Commercial
Sign Overlay District is to ensure that signs within these areas are able to
balance the needs of commercial users located adjacent to or within residential
neighborhoods to identify their premises and the goods and/or services sold on
the premises without negative impact to the character of the surrounding
residential neighborhoods.
      (3)   Uptown-Transit Oriented Development Sign Overlay District. The
purpose of the Uptown Transit Oriented Development (U-TOD) Sign Overlay
District is to ensure that signs within the Uptown central business district,
Vermont Street Station area and Old Western Historic District are compatible in
character and image and provide businesses with a number of alternatives for
identifying their premises and the goods and/or services sold on the premises
to pedestrian and automotive patrons.
      (4)   Industrial Sign Overlay District. The purpose of the Industrial
Sign Overlay District is to ensure that signs provide an effective means of
identifying their premises and the goods and/or services sold on the premises,
as well as presenting a positive and coordinated appearance along the roadway.
Signs within the industrial areas are to be primarily oriented toward the
automobile.
   (B)   Hospital use. A hospital that falls within any of the Sign Overlay
Districts established is subject to the regulations for a hospital, as defined
in this subchapter, provided under §
165.117(H).
   (C)   Sign Overlay District location.

§ 165.124 HISTORIC SIGNS.
   The city has several historic signs in its commercial areas that serve as
important visual markers which residents and visitors closely identify with an
existing or former business or civic entity or a period of time in the city.
Many such signs were erected or painted under a previous code and may not
conform to the height, shape, type and sign area requirements of this chapter
nor to the non-conforming and obsolete signs provisions of this chapter.
   (A)   Purpose. The intent of this section is to permit historic signs to be
kept in place and be maintained to ensure their continued display for as long
as possible and to be exempt from any provisions of this chapter that would
require that such a sign be removed or significantly altered.
   (B)   Required characteristics of a historic sign. To be eligible for
classification as a historic sign in the city, a sign must:
      (1)   Have been lawfully erected prior to June 28,1971 and has been
continuously maintained in the same location since that date;
      (2)   Is attached to or painted on a significant historic building or
landmark, and has come to be identified with that building or landmark, whether
or not it is original to it;
      (3)   Is located on a site that has been continuously operated for the
same business use since June 28,1971 or earlier;
      (4)   Is of a unique shape or type of design representative of its era;
      (5)   Is a ghost sign; or
      (6)   Identifies a building or business that is associated with a family,
business or organization that was noteworthy in the history of the city
community.
   (C)   Procedure.
      (1)   The owner of a property on which an historic sign is located may
submit a request to the Building and Zoning Department to have such sign
classified as historic for the purposes of this subchapter. The Building and
Zoning Department will review such a request and refer it to the Historic
Preservation Commission. The Historic Preservation Commission will review the
property owner’s request and make a recommendation to the City Council that
such sign should be classified as historic and thus exempt from the
requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The Historic Preservation Commission may also initiate a review of
a historic sign and make its own direct recommendation to the City Council that
such sign should be classified as historic and thus exempt from the
requirements of this chapter.

   All signs not in conformance with this section must comply with the
provisions of this section.
   (A)   Any sign lawfully existing or under construction from or before the
effective date of this subchapter that does not conform to one or more of the
provisions of this section may be continued in operation and maintained
indefinitely as a non- conforming sign, subject to compliance with this
section. A sign shall be deemed to lawfully exist when the consent, license or
permit to erect the sign can be proven or verified.
   (B)   As an incentive to encourage the removal of non-conforming signs, the
City Council, after review and recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Board
of Appeals, is expressly authorized to waive sign permit fees and special use
permit application fees and approve special use permit requests for replacement
signs. In deciding such requests, the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals must
consider whether the public benefit derived from removal and replacement will
be generally proportionate to the fee waiver and/or deviation requested. The
Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals is also authorized to approve minor
exception requests for replacement signs if the Committee determines that the
public benefit derived from removal and replacement will be generally
proportionate to the exception requested.
   (C)   Routine maintenance of non-conforming signs is allowed, including
changing of copy, necessary non-structural repairs, and incidental alterations
that do not expand, extend or enlarge the non-conforming features of the sign.
However, no structural alteration, enlargement, or expansion may be made to a
non-conforming sign unless the alteration, enlargement, or expansion will
result in the elimination of the non-conforming features of the sign.
   (D)   A non-conforming sign and its associated sign structure must be
removed or modified to comply with these regulations if the sign or sign
structure is demolished or destroyed to an extent exceeding 50% of its
replacement cost. A non-conforming sign or sign structure subject to removal
under this division (D) must be removed by the owner of the sign or the owner
or lessee of the property. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign, the
Zoning Administrator must give the owner/lessee written notice of the
requirements of this division (D) and the sign must be removed within 30 days
of such notice.

§ 165.128 SIGN MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   All signs must be adequately maintained in good appearance and repair.
   (B)   Painted signs will be considered in need of refinishing if:
      (1)   Twenty percent or more of the surface is missing or shows evidence
of peeling, checking, cracking or blistering of the paint;
      (2)   Twenty percent or more of the surface shows evidence of mildew; or
      (3)   The colors used have faded appreciably and the surface sheen is
gone.
   (C)   All sign framing and support structures must be adequately maintained
to keep them in a state of good appearance and repair.
   (D)   Illuminated signs will be considered in need of repair if 20% or more
of the light bulbs are not fully illuminated, or if 20% or more of the surface
area of an internally illuminated sign is not illuminated.

§ 165.129 SIGN VARIATIONS.
   The Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and make recommendations
to the City Council with regard to requests for variations from the city sign
ordinance.
   (A)   Determination of need for a variation. It shall be the duty of the
Zoning Administrator, after an application for any sign permit, to advise the
applicant whether under the provisions of this subchapter, a sign variation is
required.
   (B)   Preliminary conference.
      (1)   Any applicant for a sign permit that requires a variance may file a
written request for a preliminary conference with the Planning and Zoning Board
of Appeals. At the conference, the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall
give consideration to preliminary exterior drawings, sketches or photographic
examples, landscape and site plans and materials on a specific project, and
shall provide the applicant with guidance in the development of a plan which
would be consistent with the requirements and purposes of this subchapter.
      (2)   Notice of this preliminary meeting shall be provided to tenants
within 250 feet of the subject property. Notice will be by mail and shall be
given no more than 30 days nor less than 15 days before the meeting. Such
notice shall include the time and place of the hearing, a general description
of the contents of the request to be heard, and the address or location of the
property to which the request applies.
   (C)   Procedure.
      (1)   An applicant for a sign permit that requires a variation shall
apply to the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals for such variation and shall
submit all items as required in division (C)(3) below. Upon receipt of such
application, the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall schedule a meeting
where the applicant shall be given an opportunity to make a presentation and
all interested parties shall be given the opportunity to comment.
      (2)   Notice of public hearings on requests for variances shall be given
no more than 30 days nor less than 15 days before the hearing by publication in
a newspaper of general circulation in the city. Such notice shall include the
time and place of the hearing, a general description of the contents of the
request to be heard, and the address or location of the property to which the
request applies. The published notice may be supplemented by such additional
form of notice as provided by rule of the hearing body.
      (3)   At the time of the public hearing, the applicant shall provide the
Board with the following documents depicting exterior design features:
         (a)   Drawings which shall include plans, elevations and site plans;
         (b)   Landscaping and screening plans (when appropriate);
         (c)   Renderings and specifications for signs;
         (d)   A statement as to kind, color and texture of materials; and
         (e)   All documents shall be drawn to scale.
      (4)   Based upon the findings of fact in division (D) below, the Planning
and Zoning Board of Appeals shall make its recommendation to the Mayor and
Aldermen of the city within 30 days of the conclusion of the hearing. The
concurring vote of a majority of the members of the City Council shall be
necessary to grant a variance. The order of the City Council shall be by
written resolution and contain its findings of fact.
      (5)   Upon the granting of a variation by the City Council, the exterior
drawings, sketches, landscape and site plans, renderings and materials upon
which the variance was granted shall be turned over to the Zoning Administrator
whose responsibility it shall be to determine that, upon completion, there have
been no deviations from the approval regarding sign design, aesthetics or
regulations contained within this subchapter.
      (6)   The Building and Zoning Department will be responsible for
inspecting the built sign plans and built sign to ensure that it does not
deviate from this and other city codes related to structural, electrical and
any other regulations contained in this subchapter or other city codes. Such
deviations shall constitute a violation of this subchapter, in which event the
Zoning Administrator or Building and Zoning Department may stop work on the
project in the same manner as for a violation of the city code. Work may not be
resumed until such deviations are corrected.
      (7)   It shall be the duty of the person to whom a variation has been
granted to comply with the requirements and/or conditions of the variation and
to obtain such inspections as are necessary to assure compliance. The Building
Official shall give notice to said person of any deficiencies found to exist.
Failure to correct any deficiencies within ten days after receipt of
notification of such deficiency shall constitute a violation of this
subchapter.
   (D)   Findings of fact. After hearing and considering the materials
presented, the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall recommend a variation
if it finds that:
      (1)   The applicant’s plans are substantially consistent with the design
criteria of this subchapter;
      (2)   The proposed exterior design features of the sign are suitable and
compatible with the character of neighboring buildings and structures existing
or under construction and with the character of the neighborhood and the
applicable zoning district, and enhance the environment of the city;
      (3)   The exterior design features of the sign will not be detrimental to
the harmonious and orderly growth of the city; or
      (4)   The exterior design features of the sign will not cause a
substantial depreciation in the property values in the neighborhood.
   (E)   Validity and extension of time.
      (1)   No order granting a variation shall be valid longer than 12 months
from the date the approval was granted unless an application for building
permit is filed within such period or the use is commenced within such period.
      (2)   The City Council may grant one additional extension of time not
exceeding 12 months, upon written application made within the initial 12- month
period, without further notice or hearing. The right to so extend said time
shall not include the right to grant additional relief by expanding the scope
of the variation.
   (G)   Amendments to approved variations. Amendments to a variation may be
obtained by application in the same manner as provided for an original
variation.

the fine, the business registration and license for the establishment shall be
immediately suspended until payment is made.
   (C)   (1)   In the event the licensee of any business or commercial
establishment is convicted of three or more violations of this subchapter for
violations occurring within any 90-day period, the licensee of the
establishment shall be required to appear before the Planning and Zoning Board
of Appeals for a hearing to show cause why the business registration and
license should not be suspended or revoked. After such hearing the Planning and
Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend to the Mayor and Aldermen of the city
suspension or revocation the license.
      (2)   If the City Council finds sufficient cause to suspend or revoke the
establishment’s business registration and license, the establishment shall
cease operations for the period specified by the City Council.
