   Upon the adoption by the Village Board of Trustees, this Village Code is
hereby declared to be and shall hereafter constitute the official “Revised Code
of Ordinances of the Village of Hecker”. The Revised Code of Ordinances shall
be known and cited as the “Village Code”, and it is hereby published by
authority of the Village Board and shall be kept up-to-date as provided in
Section
1-1-3 under the direction of the Village Attorney, acting for said Village
Board. Any reference to the number of any section contained herein shall be
understood to refer to the position of the same number, its appropriate chapter
and article heading and to the general penalty clause relating thereto as well
as to the section itself when reference is made to this Village Code by title
in any legal document. (See 65 ILCS 5/1-2-3)
1-1-2   ACCEPTANCE.
   The Village Code as hereby presented in printed form shall hereafter be
received without further proof in all courts and in all administrative

permanent effect, except the excluded ordinances enumerated in Section
1-1-8. (See 65 ILCS 5/1-2-6)
1-1-3   AMENDMENTS.
   Any ordinance amending this Village Code shall set forth the article,
chapter, and section number of the section or sections to be amended, and this
shall constitute a sufficient compliance with any statutory requirement
pertaining to the amendment or revision by ordinance of any part of this
Village Code. All such amendments or revisions by ordinance shall be forwarded
to the codifiers on an annual basis and the ordinance material shall be
prepared for insertion in its proper place in each copy of this Village Code.
Each such replacement page shall be properly identified and shall be inserted
in each individual copy of the Village Code on an annual basis. (See 65 ILCS 5/
1-2-3)
1-1-4   CODE ALTERATION.
   It shall be deemed unlawful for any person to alter, change, replace or
deface in any way, any section or any page of this Code in such a manner that
the meaning of any phrase or order may be changed or omitted. Replacement pages
may be inserted according to the official instructions when so authorized by
the Village Board. The Clerk shall see that the replacement pages are properly
inserted in the official copies maintained in the office of the Clerk.
   Any person having in his custody an official copy of this Code shall make
every effort to maintain said Code in an up-to-date and efficient manner. He
shall see to the immediate insertion of new or replacement pages when such are
delivered to him or made available to him through the office of the Village
Clerk. Said Code books, while in actual possession of officials and other
interested persons, shall be and remain the property of the Village and shall
be returned to the office of the Clerk upon termination of office or separation
of duties.
1-1-5   JURISDICTION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, this Code applies to acts performed within
the corporate limits of the Village. Provisions of this Code also apply to acts
performed outside the corporate limits and up to the limits prescribed by law,
where the law confers power on the Village to regulate such particular acts
outside the corporate limits.
1-1-6 - 1-1-7   RESERVED.
DIVISION II - SAVING CLAUSE
1-1-8   REPEAL OF GENERAL ORDINANCES.
   All general ordinances of the Village passed prior to the adoption of this
Code are hereby repealed, except such as are referred to herein as being still
in force or are, by necessary implication, herein reserved from repeal [subject
to the saving clauses contained in the following sections], from which are
excluded the following ordinances, which are not hereby repealed:
   Tax Levy Ordinances; Appropriation Ordinances; Ordinances Relating to
Boundaries and Annexations; Franchise Ordinances and other Ordinances Granting
Special Rights to Persons or Corporations; Contract Ordinances and Ordinances
Authorizing the Execution of a Contract or the Issuance of Warrants; Ordinances
Establishing, Naming, or Vacating Streets, Alleys, or Other Public Places;
Improvement Ordinances; Bond Ordinances; Ordinances Relating to Elections;
Ordinances Relating to the Transfer or Acceptance of Real Estate by or from the
Village; and all Special Ordinances.
1-1-9   PUBLIC UTILITY ORDINANCES.
   No ordinance relating to railroads or railroad crossings with streets and
other public ways or relating to the conduct, duties, service or rates of
public utilities shall be repealed by virtue of the adoption of this Code or by
virtue of the preceding section, excepting as this Code shall be considered as
amending such ordinance or ordinances in respect to such provisions only.
1-1-10   COURT PROCEEDINGS.
   No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former ordinance,
whether such former ordinance is expressly repealed or not, as to any offense
committed against such former ordinance or as to any act done, any penalty,
forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising
under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any claim arising
under the former ordinance or in any way whatever to affect any such offense or
act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so
incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance takes
effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform to the
ordinance in force at the time of such proceeding, so far as practicable. If
any penalty, forfeiture or punishment be mitigated by any provision of a new
ordinance, such provision may be, by the consent of the party affected, applied
to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes effect.
   This Section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or
implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions
upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
   Nothing contained in this Chapter shall be construed as abating any action
now pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the Village herein
repealed and the provisions of all general ordinances contained in this Code
shall be deemed to be continuing provisions and not a new enactment of the same
provision; nor shall this Chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating,
modifying or altering any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the
liability of any person, firm or corporation, or as waiving any right of the
Village under any ordinance or provision thereof in force at the time of the
adoption of this Code.
1-1-11   SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS.
   Each section, paragraph, sentence, clause and provision of this Code is
severable, and if any provision is held unconstitutional or invalid for any
reason, such decision shall not affect the remainder of this Code, nor any part
thereof, other than that part affected by such decision.

have had an opportunity to do so; provided, however, that the proponent of the
matter under consideration, as the case may be, shall have the right to open

   The Village Board may, at any time, adjourn over one (1) or more regular
meetings on a vote of a majority of all the Trustees authorized by law to be
elected.
   (R)   Previous Question. When the previous question is moved on the main
question and seconded, it shall be put on this form: “Shall the main question
now be put?”. If such motion be carried, all further amendments and all further
motions and debate shall be excluded, and the question put without delay upon
the pending amendment in proper order and then upon the main question.
   (S)   Motions to Lay on the Table and to Take From the Table. A motion

proposed at the same meeting at which such motion or proposition was laid upon
the table, provided two-thirds (2/3) of the Trustees vote therefor.
   A motion to lay any particular motion or proposition on the table shall

other pending question may be laid on the table and neither the main question
nor such other pending question shall be affected thereby.
   (T)   Indefinite Postponement; Motion to Defer or Postpone Without Any
Reference to Time. When consideration of a motion or other proposition is
postponed indefinitely, it shall not be again taken up at the same meeting.
   A motion to postpone indefinitely shall not open the main question to
debate.
   A motion to defer or postpone without any reference to time shall not be
construed as a motion to postpone indefinitely, but shall be considered to be
of the same general nature and to possess the same general attributes so far as
applicable under these rules, as a motion to postpone indefinitely or to a time
certain.

then those to be inserted, and finally, the paragraph as it will stand if so

to a committee and neither the main question nor such other pending question

times proposed, the question shall be taken first on the least sum or the
longest time.

accepted by the Trustees by a vote shall entirely supersede such original
proposition or amendment, as the case may be, and cut off all amendments
appertaining thereto.
   (Y)   Reconsideration. A vote or question may be reconsidered at any time
during the same meeting, or at the first regular meeting held thereafter. A
motion for reconsideration having been once made and decided in the negative
shall not be renewed, nor shall a motion to reconsider be reconsidered.
   A motion to reconsider must be made and seconded by Trustees who voted on
the prevailing side of the question to be reconsidered, unless otherwise
provided by law; provided, however, that where a motion has received a majority
vote in the affirmative, but is declared lost solely on the ground that a
greater number of affirmative votes is required by statute for the passage or
adoption of such motion, then in such case, a motion to reconsider may be made
and seconded only by those who voted in the affirmative on such question to be
reconsidered.
   (Z)   Adoption of Robert's “Rules of Order Revised”. The rules of
parliamentary practice comprised in the latest published edition of Robert's

authorities entitled by law to be elected.

members present, or expelled by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of all Trustees

Village Board, not to any member thereof.
      (2)   No person other than the Board member recognizing the individual

DIVISION III - ORDINANCES
1-2-14   ORDINANCES.
   (A)   Attorney. It shall be the duty of the Village Attorney to prepare such
ordinances as may be required by the Village Board.
   (B)   Introduced. When a proposed ordinance is introduced, it shall be read
one time by title only and referred to the proper committee unless the Board of
Trustees shall otherwise specifically direct.
   (C)   Vote required-Yeas and Nays Record. The passage of all ordinances for
whatever purpose, and of any resolution or motion (1) to create any liability
against a Village or (2) for the expenditure or appropriation of its money,
shall require the concurrence of a majority of all members then holding office
on the Village Board, including the Mayor, unless otherwise expressly provided
by the Code or any other act governing the passage of any ordinance,
resolution, or motion; provided that, where the Board consists of an odd number
of Trustees, the vote of the majority of the trustees shall be sufficient to
pass an ordinance. The yeas and nays shall be taken upon the question of the
passage of the designated ordinances, resolutions, or motions and recorded in
the journal of the Village Board. In addition, the corporate authorities at any
meeting may by unanimous consent to take a single vote by yeas or nays on the
several questions of the passage on any two (2) or more of the designated
ordinances, orders, resolutions or motions placed together for voting purposes
in a single group. The single vote shall be entered separately in the journal
under the designation "omnibus vote", and in such event the Clerk may enter the
words "omnibus vote" or "consent agenda" in the journal in each case in lieu of
entering names of the members of Village Board voting "yea" and of those voting
"nay" on the passage of each of the designated ordinances, orders, resolutions
and motions included in such omnibus group or consent agenda. The taking of
such single or omnibus vote and such entries of the words "omnibus vote" or
"consent agenda" in the journal shall be a sufficient compliance with the
requirements of this Section to all intents and purposes and with like effect
as if the vote in each case had been separately by yeas and nays on the
question of the passage of each ordinance, order, resolution and motion

DIVISION V - VACANCIES
1-2-38   VACANCY BY RESIGNATION.
   A resignation is not effective unless it is in writing, signed by the person
holding the elective office, and notarized.
   (A)   Unconditional Resignation. An unconditional resignation by a person
holding the elective office may specify a future date, not later than sixty
(60) days after the date the resignation is received by the officer authorized
to fill the vacancy, at which time it becomes operative, but the resignation
may not be withdrawn after it is received by the officer authorized to fill the
vacancy. The effective date of a resignation that does not specify a future
date at which it becomes operative is the date the resignation is received by
the officer authorized to fill the vacancy. The effective date of a resignation
that has a specified future effective date is that specified future date or the
date the resignation is received by the officer authorized to fill the vacancy,
whichever date occurs later.
   (B)   Conditional Resignation. A resignation that does not become effective
unless a specified event occurs can be withdrawn at any time prior to the
occurrence of the specified event, but if not withdrawn, the effective date of
the resignation is the date of the occurrence of the specified event or the
date the resignation is received by the officer authorized to fill the vacancy,
whichever date occurs later.
   (C)   Vacancy Upon the Effective Date. For the purpose of determining the
time period that would require an election to fill the vacancy by resignation
or the commencement of the sixty (60) day time period referred to in Section
1-2-42, the resignation of an elected officer is deemed to have created a
vacancy as of the effective date of the resignation.
   (D)   Duty of the Clerk. If a resignation is delivered to the Clerk of the
Municipality, the Clerk shall forward a certified copy of the written
resignation to the official who is authorized to fill the vacancy within seven
(7) business days after receipt of the resignation.
1-2-39   VACANCY BY DEATH OR DISABILITY.
   A vacancy occurs in an office by reason of the death of the incumbent. The
date of the death may be established by the date shown on the death
certificate. A vacancy occurs in an office by permanent physical or mental
disability rendering the person incapable of performing the duties of the
office. The corporate authorities have the authority to make the determination
whether an officer is incapable of performing the duties of the office because
of a permanent physical or mental disability. A finding of mental disability
shall not be made prior to the appointment by a court of a guardian ad litem
for the officer or until a duly licensed doctor certifies, in writing, that the
officer is mentally impaired to the extent that the officer is unable to
effectively perform the duties of the office. If the corporate authorities find
that an officer is incapable of performing the duties of the office due to
permanent physical or mental disability, that person is removed from the office
and the vacancy of the office occurs on the date of the determination.
1-2-40   VACANCY BY OTHER CAUSES.
   (A)   Abandonment and Other Causes. A vacancy occurs in an office by reason
of abandonment of office; removal from office; or failure to qualify; or more
than temporary removal of residence from the Municipality, as the case may be.
The corporate authorities have the authority to determine whether a vacancy
under this Section has occurred. If the corporate authorities determine that a
vacancy exists, the office is deemed vacant as of the date of that
determination for all purposes including the calculation under Sections
1-2-42 or
1-2-43.
   (B)   Guilty of a Criminal Offense. An admission of guilt of a criminal
offense that upon conviction would disqualify the municipal officer from
holding the office, in the form of a written agreement with State or federal
prosecutors to plead guilty to a felony, bribery, perjury, or other infamous
crime under State or federal law, constitutes a resignation from that office,
effective on the date the plea agreement is made. For purposes of this Section,
a conviction for an offense that disqualifies a municipal officer from holding
that office occurs on the date of the return of a guilty verdict or, in the
case of a trial by the court, on the entry of a finding of guilt.
   (C)   Election Declared Void. A vacancy occurs on the date of the decision
of a competent tribunal declaring the election of the officer void.
1-2-41   ELECTION OF AN ACTING MAYOR.
   The election of an acting Mayor pursuant to Section
1-2-43 or
1-2-44 does not create a vacancy in the original office of the person on the
Village Board, unless the person resigns from the original office following
election as acting Mayor. If the person resigns from the original office
following election as acting Mayor, then the original office must be filled
pursuant to the terms of this Section and the acting Mayor shall exercise the
powers of the Mayor and shall vote and have veto power in the manner provided
by law for a Mayor. If the person does not resign from the original office
following election as acting Mayor, then the acting Mayor shall exercise the
powers of the Mayor but shall be entitled to vote only in the manner provided
for as the holder of the original office and shall not have the power to veto.
If the person does not resign from the original office following election as
acting Mayor, and if that person’s original term of office has not expired when
a Mayor is elected and has qualified for office, the acting Mayor shall return
to the original office for the remainder of the term thereof.
1-2-42   APPOINTMENT TO FILL TRUSTEE VACANCY.
   An appointment by the Mayor or acting Mayor, as the case may be, of a
qualified person as described in Section
1-2-23 of this Code to fill a vacancy in the office of Trustee must be made
within sixty (60) days after the vacancy occurs. Once the appointment of the
qualified person has been forwarded to the corporate authorities, the corporate
authorities shall act upon the appointment within thirty (30) days. If the
appointment fails to receive the advice and consent of the corporate
authorities within thirty (30) days, the Mayor or acting Mayor shall appoint
and forward to the corporate authorities a second qualified person as described
in Section
1-2-23. Once the appointment of the second qualified person has been forwarded
to the corporate authorities, the corporate authorities shall act upon the
appointment within thirty (30) days. If the appointment of the second qualified
person also fails to receive the advice and consent of the corporate
authorities, then the Mayor or acting Mayor, without the advice and consent of
the corporate authorities, may make a temporary appointment from those persons
who were appointed but whose appointments failed to receive the advice and
consent of the corporate authorities. The person receiving the temporary
appointment shall serve until an appointment has received the advice and
consent and the appointee has qualified or until a person has been elected and
has qualified, whichever first occurs.
1-2-43   ELECTION TO FILL VACANCIES IN MUNICIPAL OFFICES WITH FOUR (4) YEAR
TERMS.
   If a vacancy occurs in an elective municipal office with a four (4) year
term and there remains an unexpired portion of the term of at least twenty-
eight (28) months, and the vacancy occurs at least one hundred thirty (130)
days before the general municipal election next scheduled under the general
election law, then the vacancy shall be filled for the remainder of the term at
that general municipal election. Whenever an election is held for this purpose,
the Village Clerk shall certify the office to be filled and the candidates for
the office to the proper election authorities as provided in the general
election law. If a vacancy occurs with less than twenty-eight (28) months
remaining in the unexpired portion of the term or less than one hundred thirty
(130) days before the general municipal election, then:
   (A)   Mayor. If the vacancy is in the office of Mayor, the vacancy must be
filled by the corporate authorities electing one of their members as acting
Mayor. Except as set forth in Section
1-2-41, the acting Mayor shall perform the duties and possess all the rights
and powers of the Mayor until a Mayor is elected at the next general municipal
election and has qualified. However, in villages with a population of less than
five thousand (5,000), if each of the trustees either declines the election as
acting Mayor or is not elected by a majority vote of the trustees presently
holding office, then the trustees may elect, as acting Mayor, any other Village
resident who is qualified to hold municipal office, and the acting Mayor shall
exercise the powers of the Mayor and shall vote and have veto power in the
manner provided by law for a Mayor.
   (B)   Trustee. If the vacancy is in the office of Trustee, the vacancy must
be filled by the Mayor or acting Mayor, as the case may be, in accordance with
Section
1-2-42.
   (C)   Other Elective Office. If the vacancy is in any elective municipal
office other than Mayor or Trustee, the Mayor or acting Mayor, as the case may
be, must appoint a qualified person to hold the office until the office is
filled by election, subject to the advice and consent of the Board of Trustees,
as the case may be.
1-2-44   VACANCIES DUE TO ELECTION BEING DECLARED VOID.
   In cases of vacancies arising by reason of an election being declared void
pursuant to Section
1-2-40(C), persons holding elective office prior thereto shall hold office
until their successors are elected and qualified or appointed and confirmed by
advice and consent, as the case may be.
1-2-45   OWING A DEBT TO THE MUNICIPALITY.

Village for a considerable period of time detracts from and, in many instances,
is detrimental to the healthful and comfortable life for which such areas were
created.

to be a public nuisance. The terms “dog” and “cat” shall be construed as
provided in Section
3-1-2.
   (B)   Limitation; Exception.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to keep more than

wherein dogs or cats are kept for breeding, sale, sporting purposes or
boarding.

YEARS TO AMEREN ILLINOIS, A CORPORATION, ITS SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, THE
FRANCHISE, RIGHT, PERMISSION AND AUTHORITY TO CONSTRUCT, RECONSTRUCT, EXCAVATE
FOR, PLACE, REMOVE, EXTEND, MAINTAIN, AND OPERATE A GAS UTILITY SYSTEM IN THE
VILLAGE OF HECKER, COUNTY OF MONROE AND STATE OF ILLINOIS.
   BE IT ORDAINED BY THE PRESIDENT AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE VILLAGE OF
HECKER, COUNTY OF MONROE, AND THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, AS FOLLOWS:
   Section 1. It is the intent of the parties by this Ordinance to extend for
an additional term, subject to the terms and conditions here stated, the
authorization to Ameren Illinois, its successors and assigns, to construct,
operate and maintain a gas utility system within the Village as originally
authorized by Ordinance No. 160, approved on March 9, 1965. The parties
acknowledge that by so doing they are continuing an existing relationship
authorizing the services of a utility for the provision of gas energy and other
purposes within the Village for the benefit of its citizens and residents as
well as other consumers of gas energy located within its corporate limits.
   Section 2. There is hereby given and granted to Ameren Illinois, its
successors and assigns (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”), the right,
privilege and authority to construct, operate, maintain and/or extend within
the corporate limits, as the same now exists or may hereafter be extended, of
the Village of Hecker (hereinafter referred to as “Municipality”), a gas
utility system for the transmission, distribution and/or sale of gas energy and
other purposes (the “System”), together with the right, privilege and authority
to lay, erect, construct, install, operate and/or maintain all necessary mains,
pipes, valves, equipment and/or other apparatus as may be necessary or
convenient for the System, in, upon, along, over, under, through and/or across
each and all of the streets, avenues, alleys, bridges, easements, rights of way
and/or other public places as agreed upon by both parties.
   Section 3. All mains, pipes, valves and apparatus shall, so far as
practicable, be placed underground and shall be so located and laid as not to
interfere unnecessarily with any pipes, conduits, sewers, drains, pavements,
public places, or right-of-way existing at the time of such location, and said
Company shall forthwith repair any damage caused to such improvements to the
satisfaction of the official or officials of said Municipality having charge of
the supervision thereof. There shall be no unnecessary obstruction to the
streets, avenues, alleys, public places and right-of-way of said Municipality
in the laying, installation, operation or maintenance of any of said mains,
pipes, valves or other equipment. All facilities of Company in said
Municipality shall be installed and maintained in accordance with the
applicable rules and regulations of the Illinois Commerce Commission.
   When any roadway within a right-of-way shall be graded, curbed, paved or
otherwise changed or when there is a relocation of such right-of-way, so as to
make the resetting or relocation of any mains, pipes, valves or other equipment
placed or installed under this Ordinance necessary, the Company shall make such
resetting or relocation, at the Company’s cost and expense. Municipality shall
provide the Company with a suitable location for the resetting or relocation of
such mains, pipes, valves or other equipment, and the Company’s obligation
shall be limited to resetting or relocating mains, pipes, valves or other
equipment of the same type and configuration as the displaced mains, pipes,
valves or other equipment. Company shall make such resetting or relocation
within a reasonable time after receiving written notice of the need for the
same from the authorized representative of the Municipality, and the
establishment by the Municipality of the permanent grade at the new location.
Except as expressly stated, nothing in this Section requires the Company to
bear responsibility for any costs or expenses to relocate its mains, pipes,
valves or other equipment for any other reason or cause.
   Section 4. When any street, avenue, alley, bridge, easement, right of way
and/or other public place, upon which or in which any facilities of Company
have been placed, shall be graded, curbed, paved or otherwise changed by the
Municipality so as to make the resetting or reconstruction of such facilities
necessary, Company shall make such necessary change in construction at no cost
to Municipality. Should it become necessary or should the Company desire to use
conduits or other similar fixtures, Company shall make application to the
Municipality for the establishment of permanent grades and such conduits or
other similar fixtures shall not be installed until such permanent grades have
been established. The Municipality agrees to establish promptly such permanent
grades upon such application.
   Section 5. The rates to be charged by the Company for gas service rendered
under this Ordinance shall be such as are approved from time to time by the
Illinois Commerce Commission of the State of Illinois and/or such other duly
constituted governmental authority as shall have jurisdiction thereof. All
Rules and Regulations of the Illinois Commerce Commission of the State of
Illinois applicable to the rights, privileges and authority granted by this
Ordinance, in the event of conflict herewith, shall govern.
   Section 6. As a further consideration for the rights, privileges and
authorities granted by this Ordinance, the Company shall, in Year 1 of the
agreement, furnish municipality compensation in the amount of $1,500, payable
within 30 days of the acceptance of this ordinance by the municipality. In

of the ordinance on the following graduated scale: Year 2 - $1,345; Year 3 -
$1,190; Year 4 - $1,035; and Year 5 and all remaining years - $880.
Municipality may request a revision to the compensation amount after five years
from the date of passage of this Ordinance if Municipality has a reasonable
belief that its population has increased or decreased by 3% or more.
Municipality must request the revision at least 60 days prior to the next
anniversary date. If Company confirms that the number of customers served by
the System within Municipality’s corporate limits has increased or decreased by
3% or more, the compensation amount will be revised by that percentage for the
next and succeeding payments. Municipality may request similar revisions to
compensation amounts under these criteria in additional five-year periods
throughout the term of this Ordinance.
   Section 7. The rights, privileges and authority hereby granted shall inure
to and be vested in Company, its successors and assigns, successively, subject
to all of the terms, provisions and conditions herein contained, and each of
the obligations hereby imposed upon Company shall devolve and be binding upon
its successors and assigns, successively, in the same manner.

and all contractors, officers, employees and representatives thereof from all

out of, caused by, or as a result of the Company’s construction, erection,
maintenance, use or presence of, or removal of any mains, pipes, valves or
other appurtenances thereto, or equipment or attachments thereto. The foregoing
indemnification shall not apply to the extent any such claim, demand, cause of
action, liability, judgment, cost, expense or loss arises out of, is caused by,
or results from the negligent or wrongful willful act or omission of the
Municipality or any contractor, officer, employee or representative thereof.
   Section 9. This Ordinance shall confer no right, privilege or authority on
Company, its successors or assigns, unless Company shall within ninety (90)
days after due notice to the Company of the enactment of this Ordinance, file
with the Village Clerk an acceptance of the terms and provisions hereof;
provided, however, that if such acceptance be not so filed within said period
of ninety (90) days, all rights, privileges, and authority herein granted shall
become null and void.

Ordinance are granted for a term of 20 years from and after the acceptance of
this Ordinance as hereinafter provided (the “Initial Term”), and thereafter on

Municipality notifies the other in writing of its desire to terminate this
Ordinance at least six (6) months prior to the expiration of the Initial Term
or any Subsequent Term.
   Section 11. The Municipality acknowledges that Company is vested in rights,
permissions and authority independent of this Ordinance. Neither acceptance of
this Ordinance nor compliance with its provisions shall impair in any way or
waive any right, permission or authority which Company may have independent of
this Ordinance. In addition, neither use by Company of public property or
places as authorized by this Ordinance nor service rendered by Company in said
Municipality shall be treated as use solely of the rights, permission and
authority provided for by this Ordinance and in no way shall indicate non-use
of any right, permission or authority vested in the Company independent of this
Ordinance. In the event the Municipality vacates any streets, avenues, alleys,
easements, rights of way, bridges or other public places during the term of
this Ordinance, Municipality agrees to reserve unto Company the rights,
privileges and authority herein given and granted to the Company in, upon,
along, over and across each and all of such vacated premises which are at the
time in use by the Company.
   Section 12. All ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict with this
Ordinance or with any of its provisions are, to the extent of such conflict,
hereby repealed.

comply with any ordinance now existing in the Municipality or enacted in the
future requiring Company to obtain written permits or other approval from the
Municipality prior to commencement of construction of facilities within the
streets thereof, except Company shall not be required to obtain permits or
other approval from the Municipality for the maintenance, upgrading and repair
of its facilities. Except in cases of emergency, prior to engaging in any
excavation activity that is expected to create an obstruction or other
hazardous condition in any street, avenue, alley or public place, the Company
shall notify Municipality of the location and extent of the planned excavation.
In cases of emergency, Company shall notify Municipality of the location and
extent of any such activity as soon as practicable after the emergency has been

provision to particular circumstances, shall be held invalid, the remainder of
this Ordinance, or the application of such provision to circumstances other
than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby.

permits another entity or person to provide gas distribution or similar
services, and Company reasonably believes the other entity or person is granted
more favorable treatment, terms, or conditions, then Company shall notify
Municipality of such treatment, terms, or conditions. Alternatively, if
Municipality reasonably believes the other entity or person grants Municipality
more favorable treatment, terms, or conditions, then Municipality shall notify
Company of such treatment, terms, or conditions. Upon receipt of such notice,
Municipality and Company shall negotiate in good faith to amend this Ordinance
to provide Company or Municipality such more favorable treatment, terms or
conditions on an equivalent basis. Such amendment shall take into consideration
all circumstances that distinguish between Company and the entity or person
receiving the more favorable or less favorable treatment, terms, or conditions.
   Section 16. The Company shall be exempt from any special tax, assessment,
license, rental or other charge during the term of this Ordinance, on all
mains, pipes, valves, equipment and other apparatus placed under the streets,

This Ordinance shall be in full force from and after its passage, approval and
ten (10) day period of publication in the manner provided by law.

   (D)   To notify the Secretary of State where a club incorporated under the

complaint with the Liquor Commissioner, stating that a licensee under this Code
has been or is violating the provisions of this Code or any amendments hereto,
or of any of the statutes of this State of Illinois, enacted with reference to
the control of liquor. Such complaint shall be made in writing and shall be
signed and sworn to by the parties complaining.
   The complaint shall state the particular provision, rule or regulation
believed to have been violated and the facts in detail upon which such belief
is based. If the Liquor Commissioner is satisfied that the complaint
substantially charges a violation, and that from the facts alleged, there is
reasonable cause for such belief, he shall set the matter for hearing, and
shall serve notice upon the licensee of the time and place of such hearing and
of the particular charges in the complaint. (235 ILCS 5/7-7)
21-4-10   REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF LOCAL LICENSE; - NOTICE AND HEARING.
   The Liquor Commissioner may revoke or suspend any license issued by him if
he determines that the licensee has violated any of the provisions of the
Illinois Liquor Act, any valid ordinance adopted by the municipality, any
applicable rule or regulation established by the Liquor Commissioner or the
State Commission which is not inconsistent with law.
   (A)    Fine as Opposed to Suspension or Revocation. In addition to the
suspension, the Local Liquor Control Commissioner in any county or municipality
may levy a fine on the licensee for such violations. The fine imposed shall not
exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for a first violation within a twelve
(12) month period, One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) for a second
violation within a twelve (12) month period, and Two Thousand Five Hundred
Dollars ($2,500.00) for a third or subsequent violation within a twelve (12)
month period. Each day on which a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation. Not more than Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00) in
fines under this Section may be imposed against any licensee during the period
of his license. Proceeds from such fines shall be paid into the general
corporate fund of the municipal treasury. (See P.A. 89-0063)
   (B)   Revocation and Suspension: Notice. However, no such license shall be
so revoked or suspended, and no licensee shall be fined except after a public
hearing by the Local Liquor Control Commissioner with a three (3) day written
notice to the licensee affording the licensee an opportunity to appear and
defend. All such hearings shall be open to the public and the Liquor
Commissioner shall reduce all evidence to writing and shall maintain an
official record of the proceedings. If the Liquor Commissioner has reason to
believe that any continued operation of a particular licensed premises will
immediately threaten the welfare of the community he may, upon the issuance of
a written order stating the reason for such conclusion and without notice or
hearing order the licensed premises closed for not more than seven (7) days,
giving the licensee an opportunity to be heard during that period, except that
if such licensee shall also be engaged in the conduct of another business or
businesses on the licensed premises such order shall not be applicable to such
other business or businesses.
   (C)   Hearing. The Liquor Commissioner shall, within five (5) days after
such hearing, if he determines after such hearing that the license should be
revoked or suspended, state the reason or reasons for such determination in a
written order of revocation or suspension and shall serve a copy of such order
within the five (5) days upon the license. The findings of the Commissioner
shall be predicted upon competent evidence. (235 ILCS 5/7-5)
21-4-11   APPEALS FROM ORDER OF LIQUOR COMMISSIONER.
   Except as provided in this section, any order or action of a Local Liquor
Control Commissioner levying a fine or refusing to levy a fine on a licensee,
granting or refusing to grant a license, revoking or suspending or refusing to
revoke or suspend a license or refusing for more than thirty (30) days to grant
a hearing upon a complaint to revoke or suspend a license may within twenty
(20) days after notice of such order or action by appealed by any resident of
the municipality under the jurisdiction of the Liquor Commissioner or any
person interested, to the State Commission.
   In any case where a licensee appeals to the State Commission from an order
or action of the Liquor Commissioner having the effect of suspending or
revoking a license, denying a renewal application, or refusing to grant a
license, the licensee shall resume the operation of the licensed business
pending the decision of the State Commission and the expiration of the time
allowed for an application for rehearing. If an application for rehearing is
filed, the licensee shall continue the operation of the licensed business until
the denial of the application or, if the rehearing is granted, until the
decision on rehearing. (235 ILCS 5/7-9)
21-4-12   SUBSEQUENT VIOLATIONS IN A YEAR.
   In any case in which a licensee appeals to the State Commission a suspension
or revocation by a Local Liquor Control Commissioner that is the second or
subsequent such suspension or revocation placed on that licensee within the
preceding twelve (12) month period, the licensee shall consider the suspension
or revocation to be in effect until a reversal of the Liquor Commissioner's
action has been issued by the State Commission and shall cease all activity
otherwise authorized by the license. The State Commission shall expedite, to
the greatest extent possible, its consideration of any appeal that is an appeal
of a second or subsequent suspension or revocation within the past twelve (12)
month period. (235 ILCS 5/7-9)
21-4-13   APPEAL LIMITATIONS FOR SUBSEQUENT VIOLATION.
   Any appeal of the decision and findings of the Liquor Commissioner in
Section
21-4-12 shall be limited to a review of the official record of the proceedings
of said Liquor Commissioner. The official record shall be a "certified official
record" of the proceedings taken and prepared by a certified court reporter or
certified shorthand reporter. A copy of this record shall be filed by the
Liquor Commissioner within five (5) days after notice of the filing of such
appeal is received by the municipality from State Commission. (235 ILCS 5/7-9)

ARTICLE I – IDENTITY THEFT
22-1-1   PROGRAM ADOPTION.
   The Village developed this Identity Theft Prevention Program pursuant to the
Federal Trade Commission’s Red Flags Rule, which implements Section 114 of the
Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions of 2003. 16 C.F.R. § 681.2. This Program
was developed with oversight and approval of the Village. After consideration
of the size and complexity of the Utility’s operations and account systems, and
the nature and scope of the Utility’s activities, the Village Board determined
that this Program was appropriate for the Village, and therefore approved this
Program on February 9, 2009.
22-1-2   PROGRAM PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Fulfilling Requirements of the Red Flags Rule. Under the Red Flag
Rule, every financial institution and creditor is required to establish an
“Identity Theft Prevention Program” tailored to its size, complexity and the
nature of its operation. Each program must contain reasonable policies and
procedures to:
      (1)   Identify relevant Red Flags for new and existing covered accounts
and incorporate those Red Flags into the Program;
      (2)   Detect Red Flags that have been incorporated into the Program;
      (3)   Respond appropriately to any Red Flags that are detected to prevent
and mitigate Identity Theft; and
      (4)   Ensure the Program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in
risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from Identity
Theft.
   (B)   Red Flags Rule Definitions Used in this Program. The Red Flags Rule
defines “Identity Theft” as “fraud committed using the identifying information
of another person” and a “Red Flag” as “a pattern, practice, or specific
activity that indicates the possible existence of Identity Theft.”
   According to the Rule, a municipal utility is a creditor subject to the Rule
requirements. The Rule defines creditors “to include finance companies,
automobile dealers, mortgage brokers, utility companies, and telecommunications
companies. Where non-profit and government entities defer payment for goods or
services, they, too, are to be considered creditors.”
   All the Utility’s accounts that are individual utility service accounts held
by customers of the utility whether residential, commercial or industrial are
covered by the Rule. Under the Rule, a “covered account” is:
      (1)   Any account the Utility offers or maintains primarily for personal,
family or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or transactions;
and
      (2)   Any other account the Utility offers or maintains for which there
is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of
the Utility from Identity Theft.
   “Identifying information” is defined under the Rules as “any name or number
that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to
identify a specific person,” including: name, address, telephone number, social
security number, date of birth, government issued driver’s license or
identification number, alien registration number, government passport number,
employer or taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification
number, computer’s Internet Protocol address, or routing code.
22-1-3   IDENTIFICATION OF RED FLAGS.
   In order to identify relevant Red Flags, the Utility considers the types of
accounts that it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its
accounts, the methods it provides to access its accounts, and its previous
experiences with Identity Theft. The Utility identifies the following red
flags, in each of the listed categories:
   (A)   Notifications and Warnings from Credit Reporting Agencies; Red Flags.
      (1)   Report of fraud accompanying a credit report;
      (2)   Notice or report from a credit agency of a credit freeze on a
customer or applicant;
      (3)   Notice or report from a credit agency of an active-duty alert for
an applicant; and
      (4)   Indication from a credit report of activity that is inconsistent
with a customer’s usual pattern or activity.
   (B)   Suspicious Documents; Red Flags.
      (1)   Identification document or card that appears to be forged, altered
or inauthentic;
      (2)   Identification document or card on which a person’s photograph or
physical description is not consistent with the person presenting the document;
      (3)   Other document with information that is not consistent with
existing customer information (such as if a person’s signature on a check
appears forged); and
      (4)   Application for service that appears to have been altered or
forged.
   (C)   Suspicious Personal Identifying Information; Red Flags.
      (1)   Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other
information the customer provides (example: inconsistent birth dates);
      (2)   Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other
sources of information (for instance, an address not matching an address on a
credit report);
      (3)   Identifying information presented that is the same as information
shown on other applications that were found to be fraudulent;
      (4)   Identifying information presented that is consistent with
fraudulent activity (such as an invalid phone number or fictitious billing
address);
      (5)   Social security number presented that is the same as one given by
another customer;
      (6)   An address or phone number presented that is the same as that of
another person;
      (7)   A person fails to provide complete personal identifying information
on an application when reminded to do so (however, by law social security
numbers must not be required); and
      (8)   A person’s identifying information is not consistent with the
information that is on file for the customer.
   (D)   Suspicious Account Activity or Unusual Use of Account; Red Flags.
      (1)   Change of address for an account followed by a request to change
the account holder’s name;
      (2)   Payments stop on an otherwise consistently up to date account;
      (3)   Account used in a way that is not consistent with prior use
(example: very high activity);
      (4)   Mail sent to the account holder is repeatedly returned as
undeliverable;
      (5)   Notice to the Utility that a customer is not receiving mail sent by
the Utility;
      (6)   Notice to the Utility that an account has unauthorized activity;
      (7)   Breach in the Utility’s computer system security; and
      (8)   Unauthorized access to or use of customer account information.
   (E)   Alerts From Others, Red Flag.
      (1)   Notice to the Utility from a customer, identity theft victim, law
enforcement or other person that it has opened or is maintaining a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in Identity Theft.
22-1-4   DETECTING RED FLAGS.
   (A)   New Accounts. In order to detect any of the Red Flags identified above
associated with the opening of a new account, Utility personnel will take the
following steps to obtain and verify the identity of the person opening the
account:
      (1)   Require certain identifying information such as name, date of
birth, residential or business address, principal place of business for an
entity, driver’s license or other identification;
      (2)   Verify the customer’s identity (for instance, review a driver’s
license or other identification card);
      (3)   Review documentation showing the existence of a business entity;
and
      (4)   Independently contact the customer.
   (B)   Existing Accounts. In order to detect any of the Red Flags identified
above for an existing account, Utility personnel will take the following steps
to monitor transactions with an account:
      (1)   Verify the identification of customers if they request information
(in person, via telephone, via facsimile, via email);
      (2)   Verify the validity of requests to change billing addresses; and
      (3)   Verify changes in banking information given for billing and payment
purposes.
22-1-5   PREVENTING AND MITIGATING IDENTITY THEFT.
   (A)   Prevent and Mitigate. In the event Utility personnel detect any
identified Red Flags, such personnel shall take one or more of the following
steps, depending on the degree of risk posed by the Red Flag:
      (1)   Continue to monitor an account for evidence of Identity Theft;
      (2)   Contact the customer;
      (3)   Change any passwords or other security devices that permit access
to accounts;
      (4)   Not open a new account;
      (5)   Close an existing account;
      (6)   Reopen an account with a new number;
      (7)   Notify the Program Administrator for determination of the
appropriate step(s) to take;
      (8)   Notify law enforcement; or
      (9)   Determine that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances.
   (B)   Protect Customer Identifying Information. In order to further prevent
the likelihood of Identity Theft occurring with respect to Utility accounts,
the Utility will take the following steps with respect to its internal
operating procedures to protect customer identifying information:

22-1-6   PROGRAM UPDATES.
   The Program Administrator will periodically review and update this Program
to reflect changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the Utility from
Identity Theft. In doing so, the Program Administrator will consider the
Utility’s experiences with Identity Theft situations, changes in Identity Theft
methods, changes in Identity Theft detection and prevention methods, and
changes in the Utility’s business arrangements with other entities. After
considering these factors, the Program Administrator will determine whether
changes to the Program, including the listing of Red Flags, are warranted. If
warranted, the Program Administrator will update the Program or present the
Village Board with his or her recommended changes and the Village Board will
make a determination of whether to accept, modify or reject those changes to
the Program.
22-1-7   PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Oversight. Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating
this Program lies with an Identity Theft Committee for the Utility. The
Committee is headed by a Program Administrator who may be the head of the
Utility or his or her appointee. Two or more other individuals appointed by the
head of the Utility, or the Program Administrator comprise the remainder of the
committee membership. The Program Administrator will be responsible for the
Program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of Utility staff on
the Program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of Red
Flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating Identity Theft, determining
which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular
circumstances and considering periodic changes to the Program.
   (B)   Staff Training and Reports. Utility staff responsible for implementing
the Program shall be trained either by or under the direction of the Program
Administrator in the detection of Red Flags, and the responsive steps to be
taken when a Red Flag is detected.
   (C)   Service Provider Arrangements. In the event the Utility engages a
service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more
accounts, the Utility will take the following steps to ensure the service
provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and
procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of Identity
Theft.
      (1)   Require, by contract, that service providers have such policies and
procedures in place; and
      (2)   Require, by contract, that service providers review the Utility’s
Program and report any Red Flags to the Program Administrator.
   (D)   Non-Disclosure of Specific Practices. For the effectiveness of this
Identity Theft Prevention Program, knowledge about specific Red Flag
identification, detection, mitigation and prevention practices must be limited
to the Identity Theft Committee who developed this Program and to those
employees with a need to know them. Any documents that may have been produced
or are produced in order to develop or implement this program that list or
describe such specific practices and the information those documents contain
are considered “security information” as defined in 720 ILCS 5/16-30 et seq.
and 5 ILCS 179/1 et seq. and are unavailable to the public because disclosure
of them would be likely to substantially jeopardized the security of
information against improper use, that use being to circumvent the Utility’s
Identity Theft prevention efforts in order to facilitate the commission of
Identity Theft.

22-3-5   REQUEST FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.
   The Village shall respond to a request for records to be used for a

response shall (1) provide to the person making the request an estimate of the
time required by the Village to provide the records requested and an estimate

possible, according to the types of records requested.
22-3-8   GRANTING OR DENIAL OF REQUESTS.
   A request for all records within a category shall be granted unless the
request constitutes an undue burden upon the Village. Prior to denying a
request based upon the burdensome nature of the request, an opportunity to
narrow the request to manageable proportions shall be provided. If the attempt
to narrow the request fails, the request may be denied because compliance will
unduly burden the operations of the Village and the burden outweighs the public
interest in the information. The denial shall be in writing, specifying the
reasons why compliance will be unduly burdensome and the extent to which
compliance will so burden the operations of the Village. Repeated requests from
the same person for the same records that are unchanged or identical to records
previously provided are properly denied under the Freedom of Information Act

the application of any exemption claim;

the denial;
      (4)   the right to review by the Public Access Counselor and the address
and phone number for the Public Access Counselor; and
      (5)   the right to judicial review.
   If an exemption is claimed, then the denial must include the specific
reasons for the denial, including a detailed factual basis and a citation to
support a legal authority.
   (B)   If the Village asserts an exemption under Subsection (1)(c) or (1)(f)
of Section 7 of the Freedom of Information Act, it shall, within the time
periods provided for Respondent to request, provide written notice to the
person making the request and the Public Access Counselor of its intent to deny
the request in whole or in part. The notice shall include:
      (1)   a copy of the request for access to records;
      (2)   the proposed response from the Village;
      (3)   a detailed summary of the Village’s basis for asserting its
exemption.

the procedures set forth in the Freedom of Information Act, as amended from
time to time, regarding the review of denials shall be applicable. Times for
response compliance by the Village to the request shall be tolled until the
Public Access Counselor concludes his or her inquiry.

any of the provisions of this Code.
(65 ILCS 5/11-11.1-1)
ARTICLE V – INVESTMENT POLICY
22-5-1   INVESTMENT POLICY.
   It is the policy of the Village to invest public funds in a manner which
will provide the highest investment return with the maximum security while
meeting the daily cash flow demands of the Village and conforming to all State
and local statutes governing the investment of public funds.
22-5-2   SCOPE.
   This policy includes all public funds of the Village.
22-5-3   PRUDENCE.
   Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then
prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in
the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment,
considering the probable safety of their capital, as well as the probable
income to be derived.
   The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the
“prudent person” standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an
overall portfolio.
22-5-4   OBJECTIVE.
   The primary objective, in order of priority, shall be:
   (A)   Legality. Conformance with federal, state and other legal
requirements.
   (B)   Safety. Preservation of capital and protection of investment
principal.
   (C)   Liquidity. Maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet operating
requirements.
   (D)   Yield. Attainment of market rates of return.
   The portfolio should be reviewed periodically as to its effectiveness in
meeting the Village’s needs for safety, liquidity, rate of return,
diversification and its general performance.
22-5-5   DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
   Management and administrative responsibility for the investment program is
hereby delegated to the Treasurer who may establish written procedures for the
operation of the investment program.
22-5-6   ETHICS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and
management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to
make impartial decisions.
22-5-7   AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL DEALERS AND INSTITUTIONS.
   The Treasurer will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to
provide investment services. In addition, a list will also be maintained of
approved security brokers/dealers selected by creditworthiness.
22-5-8   AUTHORIZED AND SUITABLE INVESTMENTS.
   Investments may be made in any type of security allowed for in Illinois
statutes regarding the investment of public funds. Investments shall be made
that reflect the cash flow needs of the fund type being invested.
22-5-9   COLLATERALIZATION.
   Collateralization may be required, at the discretion of the Village, on all
funds held in banks or savings and loans above the insured limits provided by
the FDIC or FSLIC. In order to anticipate market changes and provide a level of
security for all funds, the collateralization level will be a minimum of one
hundred two percent (102%) of market value of principal and accrued interest.
22-5-10   SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY.
   All security transactions, including collateral for repurchase agreements,
entered into by the Village, shall be conducted on a delivery-versus-payment
(DVP) basis. Securities will be held by an independent third-party custodian
designated by the Treasurer and evidenced by safekeeping receipts and a written
custodial agreement.
22-5-11   DIVERSIFICATION.
   The Village shall diversify its investments to the best of its ability based
on the type of funds invested and the cash flow needs of those funds.
Diversification can be by type of investment, number of institutions invested
in, and length of maturity.
22-5-12   MAXIMUM MATURITIES.
   To the extent possible, the Village shall attempt to match its investments
with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash
flow, the Village will not directly invest in securities maturing more than two
(2) years from the date of purchase.
   Reserve funds may be invested in securities exceeding two (2) years if the
maturity of such investments is made to coincide as nearly as practicable with
the expected use of the funds.
22-5-13   INTERNAL CONTROL.
   The Treasurer is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal
control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the Village are
protected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal control structure shall be
designed to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met. The
internal controls shall address the following points:
   (A)   Control of collusion.
   (B)   Separation of transaction authority from accounting.
   (C)   Custodial safekeeping.
   (D)   Written confirmation of telephone transactions for investments and
wire transfers.
22-5-14   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The investment portfolio will be managed in accordance with the parameters
specified within this policy. The portfolio should obtain a comparable rate of
return during a market/economic environment of stable interest rates. Portfolio
performance should be compared to benchmarks with similar maturity, liquidity
and credit quality as the portfolio maintained by the Illinois Public
Treasurer’s Investment Pool (IPTIP).
22-5-15   REPORTING.
   The Treasurer shall prepare an investment report at least monthly. The
report should be provided to the Village Board and available upon request. The
report should be in a format suitable for review by the general public. An
annual report should also be provided to the Village Board. A statement of the
market value of the portfolio shall be issued to the Village Board quarterly.
22-5-16   INVESTMENT POLICY ADOPTION AND MODIFICATION.
   The investment policy has been adopted by ordinance. The policy shall be
reviewed on an annual basis by the Treasurer, and any modifications made
thereto shall be made by ordinance.

   (A)   The Village will incorporate into any contract for construction work,

of the Secretary of Labor or of any prior authority that remain in effect,
which is paid for in whole or in part with the aid of such financial
assistance, the following “Equal Opportunity Clause”:
      (1)   In the event of the contractor’s noncompliance with the provisions

future contracts or subcontracts with the State of Illinois or any of its
political subdivisions or municipal corporations, and the contract may be

applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, marital status, national origin or ancestry, citizenship status,
age, physical or mental disability unrelated to ability, sexual orientation,

         (b)   That, if he or she hires additional employees in order to
perform this contract or any portion of this contract, he or she will determine
the availability (in accordance with the Department’s Rules and Regulations) of

         (c)   That, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees
placed by him or her or on his or her behalf, he or she will state that all

race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin
or ancestry, citizenship status, age, physical or mental disability unrelated
to ability, sexual orientation, military status or an unfavorable discharge
from military service.
         (d)   That he or she will send to each labor organization or
representative of workers with which he or she has or is bound by a collective
bargaining or other agreement or understanding, a notice advising the labor
organization or representative of the contractor’s obligations under the Act

         (e)   That he or she will submit reports as required by the

ARTICLE VIII – POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
22-8-1   PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s sex. The courts
have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title
VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have
a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual
harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders
and sexual orientations. It is a policy of this Village to prohibit harassment
of any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal
officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof.
22-8-2   DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
   (A)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
      (1)   Submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of an
individual’s employment, either explicitly or implicitly; or
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   (B)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes, but is not
limited to:
      (1)   Verbal Harassment. Sexual innuendoes, suggestive comments, insults,
humor, jokes about: sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual
propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements of a sexual
nature about other employees, even outside of their presence.
      (2)   Non-verbal Harassment. Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling),
leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, “catcalls”,
“smacking” or “kissing” noises.
      (3)   Visual. Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
      (4)   Physical Harassment. Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
      (5)   Textual/Electronic Harassment. “Sexting” (electronically sending
messages with sexual content, including pictures or video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/ video messages, intranet/on-
line postings, blogs, instant messages and posts on social network websites
like Facebook and Twitter).
   (C)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a “reasonable person.”
22-8-3   PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/
himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s)
as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating his/her position to
the offending employee, and his/her immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
      (1)   Electronic/Direct Communication. If there is sexual harassment
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express his/her objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      (2)   Contact with Supervisory Personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
director of human resources, an ethics officer, the village manager or
administrator, or the chief executive officer of the Municipality.
   The employee experiencing what he/she believes to be sexual harassment must
not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses
and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the
Municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.
      (3)   Resolution Outside Municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
Municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within three hundred (300) days
of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with
the EEOC must also be filed within three hundred (300) days.
      (4)   Allegations Made Against an Elected Official by Another Elected
Official. In addition to the methods of reporting included above, an elected
official may request an independent review of a complaint of sexual harassment
by another elected official. The request shall be made to the human resources
director, the village manager or administrator or the chief elected official of
the Village. The official receiving the request shall take immediate action in
keeping with the procurement process of the Village to retain a qualified
individual or entity for the independent review of the allegations of sexual
harassment in violation of this policy. The outcome of the independent review
shall be reported to the corporate authorities.
   (C)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the location), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
   (D)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
Municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
22-8-4   PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
ALLEGATIONS.
   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal office shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal
employee or official due to a municipal employee’s or official’s:
      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy,
      (2)   Providing information related to an investigation or testimony
before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any
violation of this policy, or
      (3)   Assistance with or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (B)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s or official’s involvement in
protected activity pursuant to this policy.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against, even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action, and this policy prohibits
retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or
denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who
does any of the following:
      (1)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy or practice of any officer, member, agency or other
employee that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule,
or regulation; or
      (2)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule or regulation by any officer, member, agency or other employee; or
      (3)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act or this policy.
   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer
may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, before a legislative commission or committee or in any
other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or federal law, rule or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
   (F)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire to
retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted or
participated in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under the Illinois
Human Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge – either due within three hundred (300) days of the
alleged retaliation.
22-8-5   CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant
to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks
and/or collective bargaining agreements, any person who violates this policy or
the Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be
subject to a fine of up to Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) per offense,
applicable disciplinary actions or discharge by the Municipality and any
applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State
law or Federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any
discipline imposed by the Municipality shall be separate and distinct from any
penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a
court of law or a State or Federal agency.
22-8-6   CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.
   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser to
accomplish an outcome other than stopping sexual harassment or stopping
retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report
made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the
consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense
that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally
makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall
be subject to disciplinary action or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal
policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreements.
   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an ethics commission, an inspector general, the Illinois State Police, a
State’s Attorney, the Attorney General or any other law enforcement official is
guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) against any
person who intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.
(Ord. No. 20-03; 07-14-20)

this policy conflicts with any precedent or past practice of the Village,
management will resolve that conflict by means consistent with established

and not their own. It is further expected that their behavior, both on the job
and off, reflects positively on the Village, its reputation, and its employees.
Pursuant to this policy, an employee’s duties and responsibilities include, but
are not limited to:
   (A)   Duty to Protect the Reputation of the Village. It is the duty of every
employee to uphold and protect the good reputation of the Village and his or
her fellow workers.
   (B)   Duty to Obey the Law. It is the responsibility of every employee to
obey the law in the execution of his or her duties. Ignorance of the law or a
particular regulation may not be considered an excuse for committing a
violation or oversight.
   (C)   Duty to Comply with Village Policies. It is the responsibility of
every employee to comply with all Village policies.
   (D)   Conflicts of Interest Must be Avoided. In the broadest sense of the
meaning, no employee shall engage in a behavior that may appear to be or give
rise to a conflict of interest between him or herself and that employee’s
official capacity or duties. Should a conflict of interest arise, the employee
involved shall report it in the manner described below.
   (E)   Disqualification from Acting on Village Business. An employee shall
disqualify him or herself and shall not act on any matter in which he or she, a
member of his or her immediate family, or another employer of the employee has
a financial interest.
   (F)   Prohibition of Certain Financial Interest or Activity. No employee,
regardless of any prior disclosure, who has a material interest, personally or
through a member of his or her immediate family, in any business entity doing
or seeking to do business within the Village shall influence or attempt to
influence the selection of the business entity or the making of a contract
between such business entity and the Village. Employees may not have financial
interests in contracts.
   (G)   Solicitation of Gifts or Loans is Prohibited. No employee shall
solicit anything of monetary value (even such things which might be returned or
repaid) if it would appear to have been solicited with intent of obtaining
something in return. Nothing shall prohibit contributions of gifts including
political contributions, which are reported in accordance with applicable law
or which are accepted on behalf of the Village.
   (H)   Gifts in Excess of the $300 Annual Gift Limitation Amount are
Prohibited. No employee or family member of an employee shall accept gifts that
exceed an aggregate value of the adjusted annual gift limitation amount in
accordance with Government Code in any twelve (12) consecutive months from an
individual or entity that is doing business with the Village.
   (I)   Improper Disclosure of Privileged, Personal or Confidential
Information. Unless expressly authorized, no employee shall intentionally
disclose privileged, personal or confidential information obtained as a result
of, or in connection with, his or her employment with the Village for any
purpose. Privileged, personal or confidential information does not include
information that is a matter of public knowledge or that is available to the
public on request. Nothing in this policy is intended to prohibit or infringe
upon any communication, speech or expression that is protected or privileged
under law. This includes speech and expression protected under state and
federal constitutions as well as labor or other applicable laws.
   (J)   Improper Using One’s Village Employment. No employee shall use or
permit the use of any Village assets for a non-Village purpose that is for the
private benefit of the employee or any other person unless available on equal
terms to the general public.
   (K)   Improper Influence. No employee, except in the course of his or her
official duties, shall assist any person in any transaction with the Village
when such employee’s assistance would appear to a reasonable person to be
enhanced by that employee’s position with the Village for their own personal
benefit. This subsection shall not apply to any employee appearing on his own
behalf or representing himself as to any matter in which he has a proprietary
interest, if not otherwise prohibited by law.
   (L)   Duty to Identify, Report and Work to Eliminate Fraud, Waste and Abuse.
It is the responsibility and duty of every employee to identify, report and
work to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse at all levels of the Village
administration and operations. Employees are encouraged to bring to the
attention of management any opportunity to reduce or eliminate fraud, waste and
abuse.
   (M)   Duty to Cooperate. It is the duty of every employee to cooperate in an
investigation involving a violation or an alleged violation of this policy.
Upon the Village’s request, an employee will participate and fully cooperate in
any investigation. This policy does not preclude an employee from exercising
his or her Constitutional rights or those afforded to him or her by a Village
recognized labor contract. However, the exercising of one’s rights does not
preclude Village from disciplining an employee for his or her failure to
participate or cooperate in an investigation if the Village may lawfully do so.
   (N)   Handling of Anonymous Complaints or Allegations of Violations of this
Policy. Employees are prohibited from attempting to identify or intentionally
exposing the identity of any party making an anonymous report or complaint
pursuant to this policy.
22-9-6   REPORTING.
   Employees are expected to report all violations or suspected violations of
this policy to management in a timely and professional manner. The Village
recognizes that the reporting party may desire or require anonymity. Thus,
anonymous reports or concerns may be reported by any party to the Village
President or the Village Trustees. It is the duty of every employee to report
any known violation of this policy or what would appear to a reasonable person
to be a violation of this policy. Employees are reminded that they may report
anonymously any actions that detract from the efficiency and effectiveness of
Village operations include, but not limited to, fraud, waste, abuse, ethics
violations, retaliation, discrimination and safety violations. It is a
violation of this policy to retaliate against an employee who makes a report
anonymously under Illinois Labor Code. The Illinois State Attorney General’s
Whistleblower Hotline number is (888) 814-4646.
22-9-7   INVESTIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   All violations or alleged violations of this policy will be investigated. As
stated above, it is the duty of every employee to cooperate in an investigation
involving a violation or an alleged violation of this policy. Upon the request
of the Village, an employee will participate and fully cooperate in any
investigation, whether conducted by the Village or its agent(s). If as a result
of good faith investigation and a resultant reasonable conclusion that a
violation of this policy has occurred, the offending employee may be subject to
disciplinary action up to and including termination.

   The Village is committed to maintaining a drug free workplace pursuant to
the federal and state Drug Free Workplace Acts, 41 U.S.C.A. § 701 et seq., 30
ILCS 580/1 et seq. It is the policy of the Village that the public has the
reasonable right to expect persons employed by the Village to be free from the
effects of alcohol and drugs. The Village, as the employer, has the right to
expect its employees to report for work fit and able for duty. This policy is
intended to ensure that Village employees are not impaired in their ability to
perform assigned duties in a safe, healthy and productive manner and to protect
any such employee and the public from the risks associated with the adverse
effects of drugs and alcohol. Accordingly, the unlawful manufacture,
distribution, possession, or use of a controlled substance, including cannabis
and alcohol, is prohibited in the workplace or while acting on behalf of the
Village. Employees are required to sign a release and consent/authorization
form, a copy of which is included with this policy, at the time the policy is
distributed to the employee.
22-11-2   DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply:
   (A)   “Abuse of alcohol” or “being under the influence of alcohol” means the
consumption of any beverage, mixture or preparation, including any medication
containing alcohol, which results in an employee being intoxicated. Intoxicated
or a positive test for alcohol shall mean a test result which shows an alcohol
concentration of .02 or more for all persons covered by Federal DOT regulations
and .08 or more for all persons not covered by Federal DOT regulations.
   (B)   “Abuse of any drug” means the use of any illegal drug, the use of any
prescription drug which has not been legally prescribed and dispensed, or the
misuse of any legally prescribed drug.
   (C)   “Drug” means any controlled substances listed in the Federal

Substances Act, 720 ILCS 570/100 et seq., and cannabis as defined in the state
Cannabis Controlled Act, 720 ILCS 550 et seq.
22-11-3   PROHIBITED ACTIONS.
   Employees shall be prohibited from:
   (A)   Manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, use, sale,
purchase, abuse of alcohol or being under the influence of alcohol at any time
during the course of the employee’s workday or anywhere on or in any Village-
owned property, including Village buildings and Village-owned vehicles.
   (B)   Manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, use, sale,
purchase, being under the influence of or abuse of any drug at any time and at
any place.
   (C)   Failure to immediately disclose to his or her Department Head or

shall also include, but not be limited to, any attempt to tamper with or
substitute any sample to be used in connection with any such test.
22-11-4   APPLICABILITY.
   This Drug/Alcohol Testing Policy and Procedure is not intended to replace
the Drug Free Workplace Programs but to define and clarify, who will be tested,
when the employees will be tested and where employees will be tested. The
following four employee categories define under which category each full time,
part time/temporary and volunteer employee will be tested:
   (A)   Any employee who drives a Village vehicle, tractor, tractor mower or
similar motor-powered equipment that moves under its own power will be tested
under the Federal DOT testing standards.
   (B)   Testing for employees of the Police Department shall be controlled by
the provisions set forth in their union contract.
   (C)   All other Village employees who are not included within the two
categories listed above in (A) or (B) will be subject to testing to comply with
the requirements necessary to establish a Drug Free Workplace within the
Village.
   (E)   Part time/temporary employees and volunteer employees of the Village
will remain exempt from pre-employment and random testing as defined in this
testing program, but they can be included for testing if reasonable suspicion
should arise, or an accident should occur during the tenure of their part time/
temporary or volunteer employment. After reasonable suspicion of abuse of drugs
or alcohol has been established or an accident should occur, the decision to
request a drug and alcohol test for the employee must be deemed necessary and
reasonable by the Mayor and/or the supervisor of the employee.
22-11-5   TESTING PROCEDURE.
   In conducting any drug testing under this policy, the Village shall:
   (A)   Use only a clinical laboratory or hospital facility that is licensed
pursuant to the Illinois Clinical Laboratory and Blood Bank Act, 210 ILCS 25/
101 et seq., that has been or is capable of being accredited by the National
Institute of Drug Abuse (“NIDA”).
   (B)   Ensure that the laboratory or facility selected conforms to all NIDA
standards.
   (C)   Follow all Federal DOT guidelines for the collection, testing and
reporting procedures.
   (D)   In conducting any alcohol testing under this policy, the Village shall
use a facility that:
      (1)   Ensures that all technicians are trained, and equipment is
calibrated.
      (2)   Conducts breath test to detect the presence of alcohol or blood
tests if circumstances require.
   (E)   The fees for drug/alcohol testing shall be paid as follows:
      (1)   Pre-employment testing will be paid by the Village.
      (2)   Post accident tests shall be paid by the Village.
      (3)   Reasonable suspicion testing will be paid by the Village.
      (4)   Random testing will be paid by the Village.
      (5)   Retesting at the request of the employee after a positive drug or
alcohol test shall be at the employee’s sole expense.
      (6)   Drug/Alcohol test for renewal of CDL Driver’s License shall be paid
by the Village.
22-11-6   SCREENING AND TESTING.
   (A)   Pre-Employment Testing.
      (1)   All employee applicants shall be advised of the Village Drug/
Alcohol testing requirements at the time of interview. After having
successfully completed the interview process, the selected prospective full-
time employee shall then be required to successfully complete the Village’s
drug screening test, as part of his/her background investigation.
      (2)   All applicants for full time employment shall sign a release and
consent/authorization form for Drug/Alcohol testing.
      (3)   An applicant will not be employed or considered for employment if:
   the test results confirm POSITIVE;
   he/she refuses to complete the test;
   he/she tampers with, or adulterates the specimen;
   he/she fails to cooperate in the testing process (including executing all
required documentation).
   (B)   Testing Based on Reasonable Suspicion. If there is a reasonable
suspicion that any Village employee, paid or volunteer, has violated any of the
prohibited actions covered by this policy, such employee may be required to
undergo drug and/or alcohol testing. Reasonable suspicion exists if the facts
and circumstances warrant a rational inference that an employee has violated
any of the acts prohibited by this policy. Reasonable suspicion shall be based
upon the following:
      (1)   Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of use or the
verifiable physical symptoms resulting from the abuse of drugs or being under
the influence of alcohol which may include by way of example but is not limited
to a pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior, a dramatic decline in
work performance, excessive sick leave usage, difficulty in walking, slurred
speech, needle marks, glazed stare, and possession of alcohol, or unauthorized
banned substance or drug paraphernalia at work.
      (2)   Information provided by an identifiable, reliable and credible
third party that an employee has committed any of the acts prohibited by this
policy.
   In the event reasonable suspicion exists, the Village shall arrange for a
drug and/or alcohol test. When testing is ordered, the employee may be
temporarily reassigned or relieved from duty and placed on leave with pay
pending the receipt of the test results by the Village. The Village shall also
provide the employee with written notice setting forth the objective facts and
reasonable inferences to be drawn from those facts which form the basis of the
reasonable suspicion.
   The employee will then be escorted to the testing facility or collection
facility by a designated supervisor immediately.
   After completing the test, the employee will be escorted to his/her
residence or at the option of his/her supervisor to another location to await
the test results, and the employee shall be off work with pay pending the
results of the tests. Under no circumstances shall the employee be allowed to
leave the work site or the test site driving his/her own vehicle or a Village
vehicle.
   Employees who test positive for either drugs or alcohol will be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
   (C)   Random Testing. Random drug testing shall be conducted during working
hours. Employees will be selected at random for a drug test by a random
drawing/lottery. The testing times and dates are unannounced and are with
unpredictable frequency throughout the year.
   When testing is ordered, the employee will be directed to the testing
facility or collection facility within a reasonable period of time.
   After completing the test, the employee will return to work pending the
results of the test.
   Employees who test positive for drugs will be subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.
   (D)   Post Accident Testing. Post accident drug/alcohol testing is required
immediately following any accident involving a Village employee, paid or
volunteer, who operates Village equipment or operates a Village vehicle where
an injury to a person has occurred or where damage to equipment, or property
has occurred and that damage exceeds One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), based on
actual cost or reliable estimates of damage.
   When testing is ordered, the employee will be escorted to the testing
facility or collection facility by a designated supervisor within a reasonable
period of time following the accident.
   Employees who test positive for either drugs or alcohol will be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
   (E)   Testing Required for Position Required to Have a CDL.
   In addition to the provisions of this policy, any employee who is appointed
to a position required to have a commercial driver’s license (“CDL”) shall be
subject to drug and/or alcohol screening following any work-related accident.
Mandatory drug screening shall also be required of all applicants chosen to be
hired for positions requiring a CDL. Those who fail the pre-employment drug
screening shall not be hired for those positions.
22-11-7   CONFIDENTIALITY OF TEST RESULTS.
   Any employee subject to a drug and/or alcohol test under this policy will be
provided a copy of all information and reports received by the Village in
connection with any drug and/or alcohol test and any results thereof under this
policy. Any results of drug and alcohol test will be disclosed to any employee
tested, the applicable supervisor, Village Attorney and those permitted by law.
22-11-8   CONSEQUENCES OF POSITIVE TEST RESULT OR REFUSAL TO COOPERATE.
   Any employee who refuses to cooperate in testing or who fails a test or
violates the Drug and Alcohol Policy shall be subject to disciplinary action,
up to and including termination.
Policy
As a Federal Grantee, I hereby notify employees that the unlawful manufacture,
distribution, dispensing, possession or use of a controlled substance is
prohibited in this workplace. As a condition of employment, employees must
abide by this policy.
Drug-Free Awareness
Drug abuse in the workplace has major adverse effects on the welfare of all
citizens of the United States, and it results in lost productivity each year.
Employees who use illegal drugs have three to four times more accidents while
at work.
Employees with drug abuse problems should seek help. Employees desiring more
information on the dangers of drug abuse in the workplace and those employees
needing drug counseling, rehabilitation, or other employee assistance should
contact the local municipal drug administrator.
Employees will be referred to the appropriate resource for available
counseling, rehabilitation or other assistance.
Notice of Potential Personnel Actions for Illegal Drug Use On-the-Job
Penalties may be imposed upon employees for drug abuse violations occurring in
our workplaces:
1.   Employees must notify this employer of any criminal drug statute
conviction or a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five days
after such conviction.
2.   Within 30 days of receiving notice of any criminal drug statute conviction
or a violation occurring in the workplace, this employer will take appropriate
personnel action against such employee, up to and including termination; or
3.   Within 30 days of receiving notice of any criminal drug statute conviction
or a violation occurring in the workplace, this employer may require such
employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or
rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by a Federal, State or local
health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.
Employee Certification
   I understand the drug-free workplace policy.   
   I agree, as a condition of my employment, to abide by the terms of this
program.

unnecessarily attempt to delay, hinder or obstruct any other person in lawfully
driving and traveling upon or along any highway within this State or who shall

the effective movement of traffic shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
violation of this Code."
24-4-2   DRIVING RULES.
   (A)   Careless Driving. It shall be unlawful to operate a vehicle in the
Village in a careless manner so as to interfere with the safe or lawful
operation of any other vehicle or so as to interfere with or to injure, damage,
or endanger persons or property engaged in the lawful use of the street.

racing as such activity is defined by 625 ILCS 5/11-504.
   (C)   Fleeing or Attempting to Elude Police Officer. Any driver or operator
of a motor vehicle who, having been given a visual or audible signal by a
police officer directing such driver or operator to bring his vehicle to a
stop, willfully fails to or refuses to obey such direction, increases his
speed, extinguishes his lights or otherwise flees or attempts to elude the
officer is guilty of a violation of this Chapter. The signal given by the
police officer may be by hand, voice, siren, red or blue light. Provided,
however, the officer giving such signal shall be in police uniform and if
driving a vehicle, such vehicle shall be marked showing it to be an official
police vehicle.
   (D)   Unlawful Possession of Highway Sign or Marker. Traffic control
signals, signs or markers owned by the Village shall be possessed only by the
Village’s employees, police officers, contractors, or their employees engaged
in highway construction, contract or work upon the roadways or public ways
approved by the Village. No person shall possess a traffic control signal, sign
or marker owned by the Village except as provided in this paragraph without the
prior written authority of the Village. It shall be a violation of this Chapter
for a person to possess such a traffic control signal, sign or marker without
lawful authority. (See 625 ILCS 5/11-313)
   (E)   Special Speed Limitations on Elevated Structures. No person shall
drive a vehicle over any bridge or other elevated structure constituting a part

maintained with safety to such bridge or structure when such structure is sign-
posted.
   Upon the trial of any person charged with the violation of this Section,
proof of the determination of the maximum speed by the Village and the
existence of such signs is conclusive evidence of the maximum speed which can
be maintained with safety to such bridge or structure. (See 625 ILCS 5/11- 608)
   (F)   General Speed Restrictions. The speed limits on the various streets
shall be approved by the Village Board but shall not exceed twenty miles per

   (H)   Failure to Reduce Speed. A vehicle shall be driven upon the streets
and alleys of this Village at a speed which is reasonable and proper with
regard to traffic conditions and the use of the street or alley. The fact that
the vehicle does not exceed the applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve
the driver of the duty to decrease speed when approaching and crossing an
intersection or when special hazard exists with respect to pedestrian or other
traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions. Speed must be decreased
as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle on or
entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of all
persons to use due care.
   (I)   Traffic Lane Usage. Whenever any roadway within the Village has been
divided into two (2) or more clearly marked lanes for traffic, a vehicle shall

of State for the purpose of obtaining the required ownership information.
   (B)   The law enforcement agency authorizing the impounding of a vehicle

a directed communication to the State Police for stolen or wanted information
on the vehicle. When the State Police files are searched with negative results,
the information contained in the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) files
will be searched by the State Police. The information determined from these
record searches will be returned to the requesting law enforcement agency for
that agency’s use in sending a notification by certified mail to the registered
owner, lienholder and other legally entitled persons advising where the vehicle
is held, requesting a disposition be made and setting forth public sale
information. Notification shall be sent no later than ten (10) business days

of a vehicle, provided that if the law enforcement agency is unable to
determine the identity of the registered owner, lienholder or other person
legally entitled to ownership of the impounded vehicle within a ten (10)
business day period after impoundment, then notification shall be sent no later
than two (2) days after the date the identity of the registered owner,
lienholder or other person legally entitled to ownership of the impounded
vehicle is determined. Exceptions to a notification by certified mail to the
registered owner, lienholder and other legally entitled persons are set forth

facsimile transmission, or by other means the Secretary of State deems
acceptable.

statement that the information was not found in the vehicle registration
records of the State, by U.S. Mail or other delivery service, facsimile
transmission, as requested by the towing service, or by other means acceptable
to the Secretary of State.
   (D)   The Secretary of State may prescribe standards and procedures for
submission of requests for record searches and replies via computer link.
   (E)   Fees for services provided under this Section shall be in amounts
prescribed by the Secretary of State under Section 3-821.1 of the Illinois
Municipal Code. Payment may be made by the towing service using cash, any
commonly accepted credit card, or any other means of payment deemed acceptable
by the Secretary of State. (625 ILCS 5/4-205)

ARTICLE XI – ADULT USES REGULATED
27-11-1    PURPOSE AND ADDITIONAL FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this Article to regulate public nudity
in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the
citizens of the Village. The provisions of this Article have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of
any communicative materials.
   (B)   Findings. The Village Board finds:
      (1)   Public places allowing nudity lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled.
      (2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at adult-oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-
private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, live sex shows or public
nudity.
      (3)   Allowing public nudity creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
adult oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such adult oriented businesses.
      (5)   At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by
activities occurring in adult oriented businesses involving public nudity,
including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency
virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non-A, Non-
B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.
      (6)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States.
      (7)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (8)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (9)   Sanitary conditions in some adult oriented businesses and those
places allowing public nudity are unhealthy, in part, because the activities
conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature
of the activities, including nudity, and the failure of the owners and the
operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain
those facilities.
      (10)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of adult oriented businesses allowing public nudity and where
persons view “adult” oriented films.
      (11)   The findings noted in paragraphs (1) through (10) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (12)   Public places allowing nudity have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (13)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the Village will be promoted by the enactment of this Article.

ARTICLE XII - OBSCENITY
27-12-1   OBSCENITY.
   (A)   Elements of the Offense. A person commits an obscenity offense when,
with the knowledge of the nature or content thereof or recklessly failing to
exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content
thereof, he:
      (1)   sells, delivers or provides or offers or agrees to sell, deliver or
provide any obscene writing, picture, record or other representation or
embodiment of the obscene; or
      (2)   presents or directs an obscene play, dance, or other performance or
participates directly in that portion thereof which makes it obscene; or
      (3)   publishes, exhibits or otherwise makes available anything obscene;
or
      (4)   performs an obscene act or otherwise presents an obscene exhibition
of his body for gain; or
      (5)   creates, buys, procures or possesses obscene matter or material
with intent to disseminate it in violation of this Section, or of the penal
laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction; or
      (6)   advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented
or held out by him to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
   (B)   Obscene Defined. Any material or performance is obscene if:
      (1)   the average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest; and
      (2)   the average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or
perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions or lewd
exhibition of the genitals; and
      (3)   taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value.
   (C)   Interpretation of Evidence. Obscenity shall be judged with reference
to ordinary adults except that it shall be judged with reference to children or
other especially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the
material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for
or directed to such an audience.
   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination,
distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being commercially
exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with
respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the
matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
   In any prosecution for an offense under this Section, evidence shall be
admissible to show:
      (1)   the character of the audience for which the material was designed
or to which it was directed;
      (2)   what the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary
adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would probably have
on the behavior of such people;
      (3)   the artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of
the material, or the absence thereof;
      (4)   the degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this
State;
      (5)   appeal to prurient interest or absence thereof in advertising or
other promotion of the material;
      (6)   purpose of the author, creator, publisher or disseminator.
   (D)   Prima Facie Evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement or
possession of a mold, engraved plat or other embodiment or obscenity, specially
adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three
(3) copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to
disseminate. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-5-1)
27-12-2   HARMFUL MATERIAL.
   (A)   Elements of the Offense.  A person who, with knowledge that a person
is a child; that is, a person under eighteen (18) years of age, or who fails to
exercise reasonable care in ascertaining the true age of a child, knowingly
distributes to, or sends or causes to be sent to, or exhibits to or offers to
distribute or exhibit any harmful material to a child is guilty of a violation
of this Code.
   (B)   Definitions.
      (1)   Material is harmful if, to the average person applying contemporary
standards, its predominant appeal, taken as a whole, is to prurient interest;
that is, shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion which goes
substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or
representation of such matters and is material, the redeeming social importance
of which is substantially less than its prurient appeal.
      (2)   “Material” as used in this Code means any writing picture, record
or other representation or embodiment.
      (3)   “Distribute” means to transfer possession of material whether with
or without consideration.
      (4)   “Knowingly” as used in this Section means having knowledge of the
contents of the subject matter or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable
inspection which would have disclosed the contents thereof.
   (C)   Interpretation of Evidence. The predominant appeal to prurient
interest of the material shall be judged with reference to average children of
the same general age of the child to whom such material was offered,
distributed, sent or exhibited unless it appears from the nature of the matter
or the circumstances of its dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it
is designed for specially susceptible groups, in which case, the predominant
appeal of the material shall be judged with reference to its intended or
probable recipient group.
   In prosecutions under this Section where circumstances of production,
presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity, indicate the
material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal,
such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the material and can
justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance of the material is,
in fact, substantially less than its prurient appeal.
   (D)   Affirmative Defenses.
      (1)   Nothing in this Section shall prohibit any public library or any
library operated by an accredited institution of higher education from
circulating harmful material to any person under eighteen (18) years of age,
provided such circulation is in aid of a legitimate scientific or educational
purpose, and it shall be an affirmative defense in any prosecution for a
violation of this Section that the act charged was committed in aid of
legitimate scientific or educational purposes.
      (2)   Nothing in this Section shall prohibit any parent from distributing
to his child any harmful material.
      (3)   Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown and acted in reliance
upon any of the following documents as proof of the age of a child shall be a
defense to any criminal prosecution under this Section:
         (a)   A document issued by the federal government or any state, county
or municipal government, or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not
limited to a motor vehicle operator's license, a registration certificate
issued under the Federal Selective Service Act or an identification card issued
to a member of the armed forces.
      (4)   In the event an advertisement of harmful material as defined in
this Section culminates in the sale or distribution of such harmful material to
a child, under circumstances where there was no personal confrontation of the
child by the defendant, his employees or agents as where the order or request
for such harmful material was transmitted by mail, telephone, or similar means
of communication and delivery of such harmful material to the child was by
mail, freight, or similar means of transport, it shall be a defense in any
prosecution for a violation of this Section that the advertisement contained
the following statement or a statement substantially similar thereto, and that
the defendant required the purchaser to certify that he was not under the age
of eighteen (18) years and that the purchaser falsely stated that he was not
under the age of eighteen (18) years:
         “NOTICE:   It is unlawful for any person under eighteen (18) years of
age to purchase the matter herein advertised. Any person under eighteen (18)
years of age who falsely states that he is not under eighteen (18) years of age
for the purpose of obtaining the material advertised herein is guilty of a
misdemeanor.”
   (E)   Child Falsifying Age. Any person under eighteen (18) years of age who
falsely states, either orally or in writing that he is not under the age of
eighteen (18) years, or who presents or offers to any person any evidence of
age and identity which is false or not actually his own for the purpose of
ordering, obtaining, viewing or otherwise procuring or attempting to procure or
view any harmful material is guilty of a misdemeanor. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-5-1)
27-12-3   TIE-IN SALES OF OBSCENE PUBLICATIONS TO DISTRIBUTORS.
   Any person, firm or corporation, or any agent, officer or employee thereof
engaged in the business of distributing books, magazines, periodicals, comic
books or other publications to retail dealers who shall refuse to furnish to
any retail dealer such quantity of books, magazines, periodicals, comic books
or other publications as such retail dealer normally sells because the retail
dealer refuses to sell, or offer for sale, any books, magazines, periodicals,
comic books or other publications which are obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy
or indecent is guilty of an offense. Each publication sold or delivered in
violation of this Section shall constitute a separate offense. (See 720 ILCS 5/
11-22)
ARTICLE XIII – SMOKE FREE AIR CODE
27-13-1   BACKGROUND.
   Smoking creates the hazard of injury to the personal health of those in the
environment of such smoke as well as the potential of damage to property that
may result from the incendiary nature of such activity. It has been determined
that breathing ambient smoke is a health hazard to both smokers and nonsmokers.
Cigarette smoking also produces several substances that are considered
hazardous to health including carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, nitrous oxide
and formaldehyde. Secondhand smoke (68% of the total smoke produced by a
cigarette) affects the health of the bystander, interfering with respiratory
tract defenses, often causing nonsmokers to have allergic or irritative
reactions, and is a known cause of lung cancer.
   Because the hazards of smoking have a potentially harmful effect, material
and direct, on the public health, safety, welfare, comfort, and property of
residents of the Village, it is necessary and desirable to establish
regulations that prohibit smoking in all enclosed public places, in all
enclosed places of employment, near entrances to all such public places and
places of employment, in and near open air public dining areas, and within
certain unenclosed public places including school grounds, parks and recreation
areas and outdoor venues.

is to protect the public health, comfort and environment by prohibiting smoking

feet of all public entrances to such places, in open air public dining areas

public places including school grounds, parks and recreation areas and outdoor

29-1-6   MAINTENANCE.
   Equipment, systems, devices and safeguards required by this Code or a

designated agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of buildings,
structures and premises. (102.2)

provisions of this Code and the referenced standards, the provisions of this
Code shall apply. (102.7)
29-1-12   REQUIREMENTS NOT COVERED BY CODE.

public health, safety and general welfare, to adopt and promulgate rules and
procedures; to interpret and implement the provisions of this Code; to secure
the intent thereof; and to designate requirements applicable because of local
climatic or other conditions. Such rules shall not have the effect of waiving
structural, or fire performance requirements specifically provided for in this
Code, or of violating accepted engineering methods involving public safety.
(104.2)
29-1-23   INSPECTIONS.
   The Code Official shall make all of the required inspections or shall accept
reports of inspection by approved agencies or individuals. All reports of such
inspections shall be in writing and be certified by a responsible officer of
such approved agency or by the responsible individual. The Code Official is
authorized to engage such expert opinion as deemed necessary to report upon
unusual technical issues that arise, subject to the approval of the appointing
authority. (104.3)
29-1-24   RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   The Code Official is authorized to enter the structure or premises at
reasonable times to inspect subject to constitutional restrictions on
unreasonable searches and seizures. If entry is refused or not obtained, the
Code Official is authorized to pursue recourse as provided by law. (104.4)
29-1-25   IDENTIFICATION.

29-1-28   COORDINATION OF INSPECTIONS.
   Whenever in the enforcement of this Code or another code or ordinance, the
responsibility of more than one code official of the jurisdiction is involved,
it shall be the duty of the code officials involved to coordinate their

owners and occupants of the structure shall not be subjected to visits by
numerous inspectors or multiple or conflicting orders. Whenever an inspector
from any agency or department observes an apparent or actual violation of some
provision of some law, ordinance or code not within the inspector’s authority
to enforce, the inspector shall report the findings to the Code Official having
jurisdiction. (104.8)
29-1-29   RESERVED.
DIVISION V - APPROVAL
29-1-30   MODIFICATIONS.
   Whenever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying out the
provisions of this Code, the Code Official shall have the authority to grant
modifications for individual cases, provided the Code Official shall first find
that special individual reason makes the strict letter of this Code
impractical, and the modification is in compliance with the intent and purpose
of this Code and that such modification does not lessen health, life and fire
safety requirements. The details of action granting modifications shall be
recorded and entered in the department files. (105.1)
29-1-31   ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS, METHODS AND EQUIPMENT.
   The provisions of this Code are not intended to prevent the installation of

Code Official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with
the intent of the provisions of this Code, and that the material, method or
work offered is, for the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of that
prescribed in this Code in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance,
durability and safety. (105.2)
29-1-32   REQUIRED TESTING.
   Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the provisions of
this Code, or evidence that a material or method does not conform to the
requirements of this Code, or in order to substantiate claims for alternative
materials or methods, the Code Official shall have the authority to require
tests to be made as evidence of compliance at no expense to the jurisdiction.
(105.3)
   (A)   Test Methods. Test methods shall be as specified in this Code or by

   It shall be unlawful for a person, firm or corporation to be in conflict
with or in violation of any of the provisions of this Code. (106.1)

   The Code Official shall serve a notice of violation or order in accordance
with Division VII. (106.2)
29-1-37   PROSECUTION OF VIOLATION.
   Any person failing to comply with a notice of violation or order served in
accordance with Division VII shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and the
violation shall be deemed a strict liability offense. If the notice of
violation is not complied with, the Code Official shall institute the
appropriate proceeding at law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate such
violation, or to require the removal or termination of the unlawful occupancy
of the structure in violation of the provisions of this Code or of the order or
direction made pursuant thereto. Any action taken by the authority having
jurisdiction on such premises shall be charged against the real estate upon
which the structure is located and shall be a lien upon such real estate.
(106.3)
29-1-38   VIOLATION PENALTIES.
   Any person who shall violate a provision of this Code, or fail to comply
therewith, or with any of the requirements thereof, shall be prosecuted within
the limits provided by Section
1-1-20. Each day that a violation continues after due notice has been served
shall be deemed a separate offense. (106.4)
29-1-39   ABATEMENT OF VIOLATION.
   The imposition of the penalties herein prescribed shall not preclude the
legal officer of the jurisdiction from instituting appropriate action to
restrain, correct or abate a violation, or to prevent illegal occupancy of a
building, structure or premises, or to stop an illegal act, conduct, business
or utilization of the building, structure or premises. (106.5)
29-1-40   RESERVED.
DIVISION VII – NOTICES AND ORDERS
29-1-41   NOTICE TO PERSON RESPONSIBLE. 
   Whenever the Code Official determines that there has been a violation of
this Code or has grounds to believe that a violation has occurred, notice shall
be given in the manner prescribed in Sections
29-1-42 and
29-1-43 to the person responsible for the violation as specified in this Code.
Notices for condemnation procedures shall also comply with Section
29-1-49. (107.1)
29-1-42   FORM.
   Such notice prescribed in Section
29-1-41 shall be in accordance with all of the following:
   (A)   Be in writing.
   (B)   Include a description of the real estate sufficient for
identification.
   (C)   Include a statement of the violation or violations and why the notice
is being issued.
   (D)   Include a correction order allowing a reasonable time to make the
repairs and improvements required to bring the dwelling unit or structure into
compliance with the provisions of this Code.
   (E)   Inform the property owner of the right to appeal.
   (F)   Include a statement of the right to file a lien in accordance with
Section
29-1-37.
(107.2)
29-1-43   METHOD OF SERVICE.
   Such notice shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy thereof is:
   (A)   delivered personally;
   (B)   sent by certified or first-class mail addressed to the last known
address; or
   (C)   if the notice is returned showing that the letter was not delivered, a
copy thereof shall be posted in a conspicuous place in or about the structure
affected by such notice.
   All of the services noted above may be expensive and time consuming. In some
communities, the courts may consider service to be valid if the notice was sent
to the last known address of the owner or owner’s agent by regular postage and
the notice was not returned by the post office. This method of service is
obviously much cheaper and usually faster than waiting for the return of a
certified letter. It must, however, be acceptable to the court system. The
jurisdiction’s attorney should be consulted to determine that the type of
service is legally acceptable, reasonably cost effective and timely. (107.3)
29-1-44   PENALTIES.
   Penalties for noncompliance with orders and notices shall be as set forth in
Section
29-1-38. (107.4)
29-1-45   TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP.

in a neighboring municipality of atomic or other means from without, or by
means of sabotage or other disloyal actions within, or from fire, flood,
earthquake, or other natural or man-made causes, and in order to insure that
this municipality will be prepared to and will adequately deal with any such

emergency shall be given prompt and general publicity, and shall be filed

as appropriate.

address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:
      (1)   prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
Village’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;

facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the Village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this Article may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements. The Village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the Village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the Village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the Village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this Article.
   (E)   Effect of Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements.  
      (1)   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the Village, such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications Providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this Article and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the Village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts With Other Articles or Chapters. This Article supersedes all
Articles or Chapters, or parts of Articles or Chapters adopted prior hereto
that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts With State and Federal Laws. In the event that applicable
federal or State laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
Article, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this Article to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or State laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound Engineering Judgment. The Village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this Article and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this Article when the Village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the

permit. No application fee is required to be paid by any electricity utility
that is paying the municipal electricity infrastructure maintenance fee
pursuant to the Electricity Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act.
33-4-5   ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Village Review of Permit Applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Superintendent
within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not conform to
the requirements of all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and
regulations, the Superintendent shall reject such application in writing,
stating the reasons therefor. If the Superintendent is satisfied that the
proposed work conforms to the requirements of this Article and all applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Superintendent shall issue
a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be the
duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the
Superintendent, that the construction proposed under the application shall be
in full compliance with the requirements of this Article.
   (B)   Additional Village Review of Applications of Telecommunications
Retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4,
a telecommunications retailer shall notify the Village that it intends to
commence work governed by this Article for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the Village not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement
of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
commencement of work requiring excavation. The Superintendent shall specify the
portion of the right-of- way upon which the facility may be placed, used or
constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Superintendent fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either (a)
ten (10) days after service of notice to the Village by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or
(b) twenty-five (25) days after service of notice by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under
this Article.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to Section
33-4-4 of this Article the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
Village an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of paragraph (A) of this
Section.
   (C)   Additional Village Review of Applications of Holders of State
Authorization Under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted forty-five (45) days
after submission to the Village, unless otherwise acted upon by the Village,
provided the holder has complied with applicable Village codes, ordinances, and
regulations.
33-4-6   EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A
permit from the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this Article on Village rights-of-way and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this Article shall be valid for a
period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-Construction Meeting Required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this Article prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre- construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the Village with
such Village representatives in attendance as the Village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance With All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by the
Village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the Village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
33-4-7   REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within ninety (90)
days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans
shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities
deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the
permit also deviates from the requirements of this Article, it shall be treated
as a request for variance in accordance with Section
33-4-21 of this Article. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor.
33-4-8   INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required Coverages and Limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right- of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the Village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
paragraphs (1) and (2) below:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred as
“X”, “C”, and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         (a)   Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
         (b)   Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
         (c)   Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal
injury and property damage for each accident;
      (3)   Worker’s compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors
and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this Section.
   (B)   Excess or Umbrella Policies. The coverages required by this Section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies Required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this Section to the Village within ten (10) days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the Village.
   (D)   Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages. The insurance policies
required by this Section shall contain the following endorsement:
   “It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by
the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of
a written notice addressed to the Village Administrator of such intent to
cancel or not to renew.”
   Within ten (10) days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in no
event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this Section.
   (E)   Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by paragraph (A) of this
Section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under paragraph (A), or the requirements of paragraphs (B), (C) and
(D) of this Section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under paragraph (A) of
this Section, such as evidence that the utility is a “private self insurer”
under the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility’s Liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the Village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this Section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance Companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this Section
shall be affected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rates “A-“ or better
and of a class size “X” or higher by A.M. Best Company.
33-4-9   INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its elected
and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this Article or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
Article by the Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
33-4-10   SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this Section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this Section at the permittee’s sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve a security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this Article;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this
Article; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this Article including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this Article to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this Article or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in
the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional  letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this paragraph shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the Village and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Superintendent, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if
the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Superintendent
may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single
amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction
under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall
be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the
provisions of this paragraph (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The Village, upon fourteen (14) days’ advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this paragraph, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this Article that the Village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security
Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in
paragraph (C) of this Section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in paragraph (C) of this Section.
   (G)   Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
Article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the Village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether
reserved by this Article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
33-4-11   PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (A)   Village Right to Revoke Permit. The Village may revoke or suspend a
permit issued pursuant to this Article for one or more of the following
reasons:
      (1)   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete
statements in the permit application;
      (2)   Noncompliance with this Article;
      (3)   Permittee’s physical presence or presence of permittee’s facilities
on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way
presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare;
or
      (4)   Permittee’s failure to construct the facilities substantially in
accordance with the permit and approved plans.
   (B)   Notice of Revocation or Suspension. The Village shall send written

alternatives available to permittee under this Section 33-4-11.
   (C)   Permittee Alternatives Upon Receipt of Notice of Revocation or
Suspension. Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the Village, the permittee shall have the following options:
      (1)   Immediately provide the Village with evidence that no cause exists
for the revocation or suspension;
      (2)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the Village, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the Village within five (5) working days after receipt of the
written notice of revocation; or
      (3)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way
to the satisfaction of the Village providing written proof of such removal to
the Village within ten (10) days after receipt of the written notice of
revocation.
The Village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time
periods provided in this paragraph.
   (D)   Stop Work Order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the Village may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within paragraph (A)
of this Section.
   (E)   Failure or Refusal of the Permittee to Comply. If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of paragraph (C) of this Section, the Village or
its designee may, at the option of the Village:
      (1)   correct the deficiencies;
      (2)   upon not less than twenty (20) days notice to the permittee, remove
the subject facilities or equipment; or
      (3)   after not less than thirty (30) days notice to the permittee of
failure to cure the noncompliance, deem them abandoned and property of the
Village. The permittee shall be liable in all events to the Village for all
costs of removal.
33-4-12   CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER’S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS.
   (A)   Notification of Change. A utility shall notify the Village no less
than thirty (30) days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the
right-of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility
or the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and all applicable laws, ordinances,
rules and regulations, including this Article, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
   (B)   Amended Permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and  conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the Village’s right-
of- way.
   (C)   Insurance and Bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.
33-4-13   GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Standards and Principles. All construction in the right-of-way shall
be consistent with applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations,
and commonly recognized and accepted traffic control and construction
principles, sound engineering judgment and, where applicable, the principles
and standards set forth in the following IDOT publications, as amended from
time to time:

employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility Attachments to Bridges or Roadway Structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports,
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;

(1) foot (0.3m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or Village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the Village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
         (i)   extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair and
         (ii)   cathodic protection of the pipe is provided;
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.

the right-of-way without the prior written approval of the Superintendent. When
such storage is permitted, all pipe, conduit, wire, poles, cross arms, or other
materials shall be distributed along the right- of-way prior to and during
installation in a manner to minimize hazards to the public or an obstacle to
right-of-way maintenance or damage to the right-of-way and other property. If
material is to be stored on right- of-way, prior approval must be obtained from
the Village.
      (3)   Hazardous Materials. The plans submitted by the utility to the
Village shall identify any hazardous materials that may be involved in the
construction of the new facilities or removal of any existing facilities.
   (D)   Operational Restrictions.
      (1)   Construction operations on rights-of-way may, at the discretion of
the Village, be required to be discontinued when such operations would create
hazards to traffic or the public health, safety, and welfare. Such operations
may also be required to be discontinued or restricted when conditions are such
that construction would result in extensive damage to the right-of-way or other
property.
      (2)   These restrictions may be waived by the Superintendent when
emergency work is required to restore vital utility services.
      (3)   Unless otherwise permitted by the Village, the hours of
construction are from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.
   (E)   Location of Existing Facilities. Any utility proposing to construct
facilities in the Village shall contact J.U.L.I.E. and ascertain the presence
and location of existing above ground and underground facilities within the
rights-of-way to be occupied by its proposed facilities. The Village will make
its permit record available to a utility for the purpose of identifying
possible facilities. When notified of an excavation or when requested by the
Village or by J.U.L.I.E., a utility shall locate and physically mark its
underground facilities within forty-eight (48) hours, excluding weekends and
holidays, in accordance with the Illinois Underground Facilities Damage
Prevention Act (220 ILCS 50/1 et seq.)
33-4-17   VEGETATION CONTROL.
   (A)   Electric Utilities - Compliance with State Laws and Regulations. An
electric utility shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation control
activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable Illinois laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the Village as permitted by law.
   (B)   Other Utilities - Tree Trimming Permit Required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing the same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this Article.
      (1)   Application for Tree Trimming Permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to Trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The Village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The Village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen Trees or Trees of Special Significance. The Village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

      (1)   Except as provided in the following paragraph, no utility shall
spray, inject or pour any chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation
in the Village for any purpose, including the control of growth, insects or
disease.
      (2)   Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals will not be
permitted on rights-of-way unless the utility demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the Superintendent that such spraying is the only practicable method of
vegetation control.
33-4-18   REMOVAL, RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATION OF UTILITY FACILITIES.
   (A)   Notice. Within ninety (90) days following written notice from the
Village, a utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or
permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any
utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities
have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is
reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation
of any Village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the Village in or
upon, the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the Village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains
any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way
shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to
removal in the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this Article; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The Village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the Village, as the Village may determine to be necessary, appropriate
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the Municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if
known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if
known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of Facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights- of-way of the Village, the utility shall notify the Village within
ninety (90) days. Following receipt of such notice the Village may direct the
utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the Superintendent
determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health,
safety and welfare. In the event that the Village does not direct the utility
that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to
the Village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the
alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility
or person.
33-4-19   CLEANUP AND RESTORATION.
   The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and
terrain and other property within ten (10) days after any portion of the
rights-of-way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or
maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the Village. This
includes restoration of entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway
surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved by the
Superintendent. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of
backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to
restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially equivalent to that which
existed prior to the commencement of the project. The time period provided in
this Section may be extended by the Superintendent for good cause shown.
33-4-20   MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within rights- of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the Village and at the utility’s expense.
   (B)   Emergency Maintenance Procedures. Emergencies may justify
noncompliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of- way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flags. If a hazard does not
exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Superintendent or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing
him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling
public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature
of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the
Village police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency Repairs. The utility must file in writing with the Village a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within forty-eight
(48) hours after an emergency repair.
33-4-21   VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for Variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this Article must do so in writing to the Superintendent
as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision
of this Article from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a
variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to Grant Variances. The Superintendent shall decide whether
a variance is authorized for each provision of this Article identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for Granting of Variance. The Superintendent may authorize
a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Superintendent may require the utility requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this Article, but which carry out the purposes of
this Article.
   (E)   Right to Appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the
Superintendent under the provisions of this Article shall have the right to
appeal to the Village Board, or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
Village Clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. The Village Board shall commence its
consideration of the appeal at the Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting
occurring at least seven (7) days after the filing of the appeal. The Village
Board shall timely decide the appeal.
33-4-22   PENALTIES.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this Article shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when the Village
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
Article. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of

buildings throughout the Village:
   (F)   To preserve the Village’s natural beauty and topography to the maximum
feasible extent;
   (G)   To protect against injury or damage caused by pollution, storm water
run-off, erosion and sedimentation, or similar hazards;

subdivision jurisdiction of another municipality. Jurisdictional boundary lines
shall be determined in accordance with Illinois Compiled Statutes, Chapter 65,
Section 5/11-12-9.
   (B)   Whenever the requirements of this Chapter differ from those of any
easement, statute, other lawfully adopted ordinance or regulation, the more

minimum requirement for the promotion of the public health, safety, and
welfare.
   (E)   This Chapter and the aforementioned statutes shall be construed
together in such a manner as to give full effect to both the regulations and
statutes except in a case of irreconcilable conflict. In case of irreconcilable

ARTICLE III - DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS
34-3-1   GENERAL PROHIBITION.
   Streets, sanitary sewer systems, and water treatment and distribution
represent major investments in a community. Obviously, these improvements
should be constructed in such a manner so that they become enduring assets to
the community. In order to assure that improvements constructed by a
subdivision developer for dedication to the public are worthy of acceptance by
the Village, this Article sets forth the appropriate design and construction
standards necessary to achieve that goal. The design and improvement standards
set forth herein shall be deemed the minimum requirements for public health,
safety, and general welfare. Nothing contained in this Article shall be
construed as preventing the Subdivider from constructing improvements that
exceed these requirements.
   (A)   No land within the subdivision jurisdiction of the Village; other than
land that is specifically exempted from the requirements of the Illinois Plats
Act (765 ILCS 765 205/1 (b)) shall be subdivided or developed except in
compliance with the regulations of this Article and the applicable provisions
of State law. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-12-8; 765 ILCS 205/1, et seq.)
   (B)   No lot in any subdivision shall be conveyed until:
      (1)   The Final Plat of said subdivision has been approved by the Village
Board and recorded with the County Recorder of Deeds; and
      (2)   The portion of said subdivision of which the lot is located has
been improved in accordance with the requirements of this Article or until an
irrevocable Letter of Credit or some other acceptable assurance has been posted
to warrant the completion of such improvements.
   (C)   No building permit shall be issued to allow construction on any lot
conveyed in violation of this Section, and any so issued shall be made invalid
by said violation.
34-3-2   GENERAL SUITABILITY FOR SUBDIVISION.
   Land which the Village Board determines to be unsuitable for development due
to probable flooding, poor drainage, rough topography, adverse soil conditions,
or other conditions that in the opinion of the administrator and/or Village
Engineer will prove detrimental to the health, safety and/or general welfare of
the future inhabitants of said tract and/or surrounding areas shall not be
subdivided or developed unless the developer submits plans and methods that the
Administrator or Village Engineer deems adequate to resolve or avoid the
problems caused by the adverse land conditions.
34-3-3   GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS.
   It is the intent of this Chapter and the Village to facilitate the design of
new subdivisions and developments that are in compliance with the provisions
and procedures outlined herein. As such, the Village has developed the
following Standard Specification Plan Sheets in order to illustrate specific
design requirements:
   ∙   Standard Specification Plan Sheet: T1 -    
       Typical Street Cross Sections, Design Considerations and Erosion Control
Methods
   ∙   Standard Specification Plan Sheet: T2 -    
       Typical Street Construction Details
   ∙   Standard Specification Plan Sheet: T3 -    
       Typical Storm Sewer Construction Details
   ∙   Standard Specification Plan Sheet: T4 -    
      Typical Storm Sewer Construction Details
   ∙   Standard Specification Plan Sheet: T5 -    
       Typical Sanitary Sewer Construction Details
   ∙   Standard Specification Plan Sheet: T6 -    
       Typical Water System Construction Details
   Said Plan Sheets are included herein and made a part hereof by reference.
The Village shall make said Plan Sheets available to all Subdividers/
Developers, who are thereafter encouraged to photocopy said sheets and include
them within the construction plans for the proposed development. By doing so,
the Subdivider/Developer can more easily make the requirements of this Chapter
known to the contractors responsible for the construction and installation of
improvements within the development and be more assured that actual
construction will be in compliance with said illustrations.
34-3-4   STANDARDS FOR LOTS.
    The planning and development of lots shall be done in such a manner so as
to assure compliance with the Hecker Zoning Code. In order to help achieve this
result, every Subdivider shall comply with the requirements herein.
   (A)   All lots in any subdivision within the Village, shall conform to the
minimum lot area and dimension requirements of the Zoning District in which
said subdivision is located.
   (B)   All lots in any subdivision outside the Village, shall conform to the
minimum lot area and dimension requirements of the Village’s Zoning District
which is most appropriate; as determined by the Administrator of this Code.
   (C)   Land contained with lakefront lots that is under water when the lake
is at its highest level, or land reserved for street improvements shall not be
counted in determining compliance with minimum lot size requirements.
   (D)   If possible, the creation of through lots should be avoided in all new
subdivisions.
   (E)   Every corner and through lot shall be large enough to permit
compliance with the Zoning District's front setback requirement on every side
of said lot that faces a street.
   (F)   All lot remnants shall be added to adjacent lots to avoid the creation
of non- buildable or non-conforming parcels.
   (G)   All side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street right-
of-way lines or radial to curved street right-of-way lines, except where the
Village Engineer has determined that a deviation from this requirement will
provide a street and lot design more beneficial to the Village.
   (H)   All side lot lines of lots which front a cul-de-sac shall be at right
angles to the centerline of said cul-de-sac until the point at which the
centerline meets the center of the cul-de-sac turnaround. Side lot lines beyond
that point shall be radial to the center of the cul-de-sac turnaround except
where the Village Engineer has determined that a deviation from this
requirement will provide a street and lot design more beneficial to the
Village.
34-3-5   STREET FRONTAGE REQUIRED.
    All land to be subdivided, shall be divided in such a way that each lot
abuts a public street meeting the requirements of Sections
34-3-16 and
34-3-17.
34-3-6   REFERENCE MONUMENTS REQUIRED.
    In accordance with "An Act to Revise the Law in Relation to Plats", 765
ILCS 205/1 (a), et seq., as amended from time to time, reference monuments
shall be erected by each Subdivider as follows:
   (A)   In the Field. Stone or reinforced concrete reference monuments, set in
the ground in such a manner that they will not be moved by frost, shall be
placed in the field, at opposite comers of the subdivision.
   (B)   At Lot Corners. Every lot corner shall be marked by an iron pin or
pipe, at least one-half (1/2) inch in diameter and not less than twenty-four
(24) inches long, driven into the ground deep enough that they do not protrude
above the surface more than one and one-half (1 ½) inches.
(1)   No lot in any subdivision shall be sold unless the corners of said lot
are marked as specified above at the time of sale.
   (C)   Front Lot Corners.  Front lot corners abutting platted street shall be
marked in the curb by a saw cut "T” (minimum of one-fourth (1/4) inch deep and
maximum of one-half (1/2) inch deep) in addition to the lot pins required
above.
34-3-7   CLEARING AND GRUBBING.
   (A)   Prior to grading within the limits of the right-of way, the entire
area to be affected with improvements, including areas intended for pavement,
water mains, sewer lines, and drainage facilities, shall be cleared of all tree
stumps, roots, brush, and other objectionable materials and of all trees not
intended for preservation.
   (B)   Existing vegetation, specifically trees having a diameter of four (4)
inches or more when measured at a point twelve (12) inches above the ground,
should be retained and protected to the maximum extent consistent with the
development of the site.
34-3-8   EROSION CONTROL.
    Because of the possibility that excessive quantities of soil will erode
from areas undergoing subdivision or development and the construction of
related improvements, this code requires the use of specific erosion control
measures. Sediment from soil erosion can reduce the channel capacity of
waterways, thereby limiting their use for many beneficial purposes and
resulting in increased chances of flooding, a risk to public health and safety.
Sediment can also clog sewers and ditches; pollute and silt rivers, streams,
lakes, and reservoirs; and necessitate costly repairs to gullies, washed out
fill and embankments.
   In order to help safeguard persons, protect property prevent damage to the
environment, and promote the public welfare, the provisions of this section
guide, regulate and control the design, construction, use, maintenance of any
development which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the
movement of earth on land situated within the Village.
   In addition to other penalties authorized by Section
34-4-1, any person, partnership, or corporation convicted of violating any of
the provisions of the erosion control provisions of this Code shall be required
to restore the affected site to the condition existing prior to commission of
the violation, or to reimburse the Village for the expense of such restoration.
34-3-9   GENERAL EROSION CONTROL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Whenever feasible, natural contours should be followed as closely as
possible in areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills might otherwise be
required, so that the design of every subdivision is consistent with the
natural limitations presented by topography and soil, and so as to create the
least potential for soil erosion.
   (B)   Wherever possible, natural vegetation should be retained and protected
and areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left
undisturbed.
   (C)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest
practical time during development.
   (D)   During development, the Subdivider/Developer shall install temporary
erosion control measures to prevent siltation of adjacent streams, roads, and
property.
   (E)   The Subdivider/Developer shall install and maintain appropriate
permanent devices, such as sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins,
silt traps, filters, rip rap, or energy dissipaters, in order to prevent long
term erosion and siltation and to remove sediment from run- off waters.
   (F)   The Subdivider/Developer shall select erosion and sedimentation
control measures based upon an assessment of the probable frequency of climatic
and other events likely to contribute to erosion, and upon an evaluation of the
risks, costs, and benefits involved.
   (G)   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics
and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered.
   (H)   Provision shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainage ways
should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities
of discharges will not create additional erosion.
   (I)   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as
practical during development, and in no case exceed more than ninety (90) days.
34-3-10   EROSION CONTROL PLAN.
   (A)   No Subdivider/Developer shall commence or perform any grading,
stripping, or excavating of land, without having first submitted an Erosion
Control Plan as part of the Improvement Plan process outlined in Section
34-4-20 and received approval therefor.
      (1)   The developer shall not be relieved of responsibility for damage to
persons or property otherwise imposed by law and the Village or its officers or
agents are not made liable for such damage, by:
         (a)   The approval of a plan under this Ordinance;
         (b)   Compliance with the provisions of that plan or with conditions
attached to it by the Building and Zoning Administrator or any representative
or agent to the Village;
         (c)   Failure of Village Officials to observe or recognize hazardous
or unsightly conditions;
         (d)   Failure of Village Officials to recommend denial of, or to deny
a plan; or
         (e)   Exemptions from the plan requirements of this Ordinance.
      (2)   Plans, specifications, and reports for all site developments shall
be retained with the Subdivision Improvement Plans.
   (B)   The Erosion Control Plan shall be prepared in accordance with the
standards and requirements contained in "Procedures and Standards for Urban
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois", prepared by the
Northeastern Illinois Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Steering
Committee, and recognized by the Monroe County Soil and Water Conservation
District.
   (C)   No Erosion Control Plan shall be approved for any intended development
site unless:
      (1)   Where applicable, the proposed subdivision, planned unit
development, or other development has been approved by the Village, or
      (2)   The proposed site is situated within, and the earthwork is being
performed, as part of a Comprehensive Development Plan previously approved by
the Village.
   (D)   Any significant amendments of the approved Erosion Control Plan shall
be submitted to the Building and Zoning Administrator or his designated
representative, reviewed and approved or disapproved in the same manner as the
original plan.
      (1)   Field modifications of a minor nature may be authorized by the
Building and Zoning Administrator or his designated representative by written
authorization to the Subdivider/Developer.
   (E)   Every Erosion Control Plan shall expire and become null and void if
the work authorized by such plan has not been commenced within one hundred
eighty (180) days or is not completed by a date which shall be specified in the
plan.
      (1)   The Building and Zoning Administrator may grant a reasonable
extension of time if written application is made before the expiration date of
the plan, and if the developer presents satisfactory evidence that unusual
difficulties have prevented work being commenced or completed within the
specified time limits.
   (F)   The Building and Zoning Administrator or his designated representative
may authorize exceptions to any of the erosion control requirements and
regulations set forth in this Code, in accordance with the following
procedures:
      (1)   An application for any requested exception shall be made by written
petition of the Subdivider/Developer and filed with all other documents
required as part of the erosion of the erosion control plan.
      (2)   Said petition shall clearly state the grounds upon which it is
based, and the facts relied upon by the Subdivider/ Developer.
      (3)   In order for said petition to be granted, the Building and Zoning
Administrator shall determine all of the following:
         (a)   That the land referred to in the petition is of such shape or
size, or is affected by such physical conditions, or is subject to such
title limitations of record, that it is impossible or impracticable for the
applicant to comply with all of the requirements of these provisions;
         (b)   That the exception is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant; and
         (c)   That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the
subject property.
   (G)   If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be done in
phases, the Subdivider/Developer shall give notice and request the inspections
required in Section
34-4-22 for each separate phase at each of the stages of work listed in said
Section.
      (1)   If the Village determines by inspection at any stage of the earth
work that further work, although authorized by an erosion control plan, is
likely to imperil property, public ways, watercourses or drainage structures,
the Village may require that special precautions be taken in order to minimize
the likelihood of such peril and may require said precautions as a condition of
allowing the work to continue.
         (a)   "Special precautions" may include but shall not be limited to: a
more level exposed slope; construction of additional drainage facilities,
berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing; installation of plant materials for
erosion control; or recommendations from a registered soils engineer and/or
engineering geologist.
      (2)   Should it appear, that damage may result from pending storms
because the grading on any development site is not complete, the Village may
require that work be stopped, and that the Subdivider/Developer install
temporary structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect
adjoining property or the public safety.
      (3)   On large developments or where unusual, site conditions prevail,
the Village may specify an allowable time period during which earthwork may be
performed or may require that earthwork be conducted in specific stages so as
to insure completion of protection measures or devices prior to the advent of
seasonal rains.
   (H)   The Village may waive specific requirements for the content of said
plan upon determining the information as submitted is sufficient to show that
work will comply with the objectives and principles of this Code.
34-3-11   STANDARDS FOR GRADING.
   (A)   All grading necessitated for the construction of pavement, curb and
gutter, sidewalks, right-of-way and drainage facilities shall be done in such a
manner so as to assure a uniform subgrade with adequate bearing capacity to

its ability to obtain the required density on adjacent earthwork.
   (C)   In areas requiring the construction of roadway embankment, and where
said embankment will be less than one and one-half (1 ½) feet in height, all
filling shall be done in lifts that do not exceed eight inches loose thickness,
and that are compacted to not less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the
standard laboratory density.
      (1)   If the embankment height is between one and one-half (1 ½) feet and
three (3) feet inclusive, the first lift shall be compacted to not less than
ninety percent (90%), and the balance to a minimum of ninety- five percent
(95%) of the standard laboratory density.
      (2)   If the embankment exceeds three (3) feet in height, the lower one-
third (1/3) of the embankment, but not more than two (2) feet, shall be
compacted in a manner that will yield a minimum of ninety percent (90%) of
standard laboratory density to the uppermost lift of that portion of the
embankment. The next one (1) foot of embankment shall be compacted to not less
than ninety-three percent (93%), and the balance of the embankment compacted to
not less than ninety-five (95%) of the standard laboratory density.

as specified by the Illinois Department of Transportation shown in the Standard
Specification Plan Sheets may be utilized in lieu of tie bars.
   (K)   Joint Sealing. Prior to traffic being allowed on newly placed concrete
pavement, all sawed joints (contraction and longitudinal) are to be thoroughly
cleaned of all foreign material, including membrane curing compound, and
immediately sealed with hot poured rubber asphalt joint filling compound.
      (1)   All construction joints and pavement edges shall first be finished
with an edging tool having a radius of one-fourth (¼) inch.
      (2)   The joint faces shall be clean and surface dry when the seal is
applied.
   (L)   Finished Texture. Subsequent to initial set prior to hardening of the
surface, the pavement shall be given a roomed or burlap drag finish either
transversely or parallel to the centerline of the road, so that the surface is
indented to a nominal depth of one-sixteenth (1/16) inch.
   (M)   Curing Procedures. Following the application, of the finished texture,
and as soon as possible without marring the surface, the pavement shall be
coated with membrane curing compound required.
      (1)   In doing so the contractor shall insure that adequate and uniform
coverage is achieved.
      (2)   Two separate applications applied at least one minute apart, each
at the rate of not less than one (1) gallon per two hundred fifty (250) square
feet will be required upon the surface.
      (3)   Type III compound shall be agitated immediately before and during
the application.
      (4)   Membrane curing is not permitted where a protective coat or
waterproofing is to be applied, or at any area where rubbing or a normal finish
is required, or at construction joints other than those necessary in pavement
or base course.
      (5)   Curing shall be maintained for a minimum of seventy-two (72) hours.
   (N)   Cold Weather Protection. When the National Weather Bureau Forecast for
the construction area predicts a temperature of 32°F or lower, or if the actual
temperature drops below 32° or lower, concrete less than seventy-two (72) hours
old shall be protected in the following manner:
      (1)   If the temperature is predicted to fall or falls to 25-32°F or
lower, protection shall consist of two (2) layers of polyethylene sheeting or
one (1) layer of polyethylene and one (1) layer burlap, or two (2) layers of
waterproof paper.

protection shall consist of six (6) inches of straw covered with one (1) layer
of polyethylene sheeting or waterproof paper placed after initial set of the
concrete.
   (O)   Traffic Restriction. Traffic shall be restricted on newly placed
concrete streets by barricades and appropriate signs for a period of ten (10)
days, provided that the Village Engineer may increase the time period depending
upon site location and conditions such as weather.
   (P)   Protective Coat. Whenever pavement is constructed after October 15 and
it will be opened to traffic prior to the following April 15, or whenever
directed to do so by the Village Engineer or Administrator, the Subdivider/
Developer shall apply a protective surface treatment consisting of two (2)
coats of boiled linseed oil mixture to the surface of the pavement and all
appurtenances.
      (1)   Said protective coat shall conform to Section 1023 - Protective
Coat of the IDOT Standard Specifications and is to be applied when the concrete
is at least fourteen (14) days old and before the pavement is opened to
traffic.

   New streets shall be so arranged to provide for the continuation of
collector streets between adjacent properties when such continuation is
necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire and police
protection, efficient provision of utilities, and where such continuation is in
accordance with the Village’s Official Map.
   (A)   Whenever any subdivision abuts an existing street that is narrower
than the standards indicated in this Section, the dedicate shall dedicate
sufficient right-of-way on the side abutting the subdivision to permit
compliance with those standards at some future date.
   (B)   Whenever any subdivision is proposed in such a manner that it will
front on either one or both sides of an existing street, the developer shall,
at his own expense, be required to make improvements to said existing street so
that is complies with the standards imposed herein, as determined by the
Village.
      (1)   If such a development is proposed to front only one side of an
existing street, the cost to improve said street to the standards set herein,
shall be borne equally by the developer and the Village.

an existing street, the cost to improve said street to the standards set
herein, shall be borne entirely by the developer.
   (C)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial
street, the Village Board may require that access to said street be limited by
one of the following means:
      (1)   That lots be subdivided so that they back onto the arterial street
and front onto a parallel land access street, thereby creating double frontage
lots, and that the developer install screening in a reserve strip along the
rear lot lines of such lots; or
      (2)   That the developer create a series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped
streets, or short loops entered from and generally at right angles to the
arterial street, with the rear lot lines of the lots at the termini of such
streets backing onto the minor arterial; or
      (3)   That the developer creates a frontage road, separated from the
arterial street by a planting strip, but having access thereto at suitable
points.
   (D)   New residential streets shall be planned and laid out to discourage
traffic through the subdivision, by avoiding a rigid rectangular street
pattern, and by instead utilizing curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped
streets to affect a more desirable street layout and minimize traffic between
streets outside the subdivision.
34-3-24   DESIGNING BLOCKS.
   (A)   Block Width. Wherever practicable, blocks shall be sufficiently wide
to accommodate two (2) tiers of lots having the minimum depth required by the
applicable Zoning District regulations.
   (B)   Block Length.  No block shall be longer than one thousand four hundred
(1,400) feet, nor shorter than five hundred (500) feet; provided, however, that
wherever practicable, blocks along collector streets shall not be less than one
thousand (1,000) feet in length.

than seventy (70) degrees.
      (2)   An oblique street shall be curved as it approaches an intersection
so that it is approximately at right angles with said intersection for a
distance of at least one hundred (100) feet therefrom, unless the Subdivider's
engineer recommends, and the Village Engineer and/or administrator concurs,
that a lesser distance would in accordance with safe and accepted traffic
engineering practices.
   (C)   Proposed new intersections along one (1) side an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, align with any existing intersection on the
opposite side of such street.
      (1)   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred fifty
(150) feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has
divided lanes without median breaks at either intersection.
      (2)   Intersections involving collector or arterial streets shall be at
least one thousand (1,000) feet apart.
   (D)   Returns at intersections shall be made concentric and shall be rounded
by a radius of not less than twenty (20) feet at the right-of-way line, and not
less than thirty (30) feet at the back of curb line.
   (E)   All street intersections shall be built in such a way that whenever
practical; the cross-slopes thereon do not exceed three percent (3%).
   (F)   The approach to an intersection shall be designed and built so that
for a distance of at least seventy-five (75) feet from the centerline said
intersection the grade does not exceed three percent (3%).
   (G)   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation in a triangular area depicted herein on the Standard Specification
Plan Sheets, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation, including
trees, in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way.
34-3-26   DESIGNING CURVES.
   (A)   Where curvilinear horizontal alignment is utilized for subdivision
streets, the minimum centerline radius shall be as indicated below, unless
otherwise dictated by site constraints and reviewed by the Village Engineer:
      (1)   Arterial Street - 300 feet
      (2)   Collector Street - 150 feet
      (3)   Local or Land Access Street - 75 feet
   (B)   If reverse curves are to be utilized on any collector street or
arterial street, the radii of which are less than three hundred (300) feet, a
tangent at least one hundred (100) feet in length shall be introduced between
the curves, as depicted on the Standard Specification Plan Sheets.
34-3-27   DESIGNING DEAD-END STREETS.
   (A)   Temporary Stub Streets.  If property adjacent to a subdivision is
undeveloped and the Village Plan, the Planning Commission or the Village Board
propose the future extension of streets from the subdivision presented for
development into the undeveloped property, said streets maybe allowed to dead-
end temporarily. In this case, the right-of-way shall be extended to the
property line, a temporary turnabout shall be provided at the terminus, and no
strip that would prevent connections with future streets shall be reserved.
      (1)   A temporary all-weather surface turnabout with a minimum radius of
thirty (30) feet shall be provided at the terminus of any temporary dead-end
street whenever the distance along the dead-end street measured from the
terminus to the nearest intersection is greater than one contiguous lot.
   (B)   Permanent Dead-End Streets.  For greater convenience to traffic and
more effective police and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall be
limited to one thousand (1,000) feet in length.
      (1)   The terminus of a permanent dead-end street shall not be closer
than one hundred (100) feet to the boundary of an adjacent tract.
      (2)   A cul-de-sac turnaround, having a minimum right-of-way radius of
fifty- nine (59) feet and a minimum pavement radius of fifty (50) feet, shall
be provided at the end of every permanent dead-end street, as depicted on the
Standard Specification Plan Sheets.
34-3-28   DESIGNING SIDEWALKS.
   The Subdivider/Developer shall be required to construct sidewalks at no cost
to the Village along both sides of every new or improved street. No variation
from this requirement shall be granted unless the Village Board, having
considered an advisory report from the Planning Commission, determines that in
the area in question, topographical conditions make the installation of
sidewalks impractical.
   (A)   Every sidewalk shall be constructed of concrete in accordance with the
specifications outlined in Section
34-3-21 - "SPECIFICATIONS FOR CONCRETE IN NON-PAVEMENT AREAS", as well as the
following:
      (1)   Every sidewalk shall be constructed to generally parallel the
street and be placed to a thickness of at least four (4) inches, provided,
however, that any sidewalk locate across a point of ingress or egress for
vehicles shall be placed to a thickness of at least six (6) inches.
      (2)   Control joints shall be troweled in at intervals of five (5) feet
or less.
      (3)   Expansion joints of three-fourths (3/4) inch pre-molded joint
filler shall be placed at driveway crossings, at both ends of the sidewalk, at
the back of the curb when the sidewalk abuts, and in the event of excessively
long runs, as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (4)   No sidewalk shall be constructed at a grade steeper than eight
percent (8%) unless steps, and/or ramps, approved by the Village Engineer, are
provided.
      (5)   The cross slope shall not exceed 1:50.
      (6)   Curbs shall be cut, and sidewalks ramped at all intersections and
driveways so as to enhance the mobility of handicapped individuals and comply
with accessibility rules and regulations.
      (7)   All ramps at intersections and other hazardous vehicular ways shall
have a detectable warning texture.
      (8)   When a sidewalk intersects with the top of a storm sewer inlet
cover, the inlet cover dimension perpendicular to the street shall be increased
so that the edge of said cover which is parallel to and furthest away from the
street, is aligned with the edge of the sidewalk furthest away from the street,
thereby incorporating the inlet cover into the sidewalk, as depicted on the
Standard Specification Plan Sheets. This provision shall not be required if the
parkway between the sidewalk and curb is wide enough to allow an inlet cover
independent of the sidewalk.
   (B)   In residential areas, sidewalks shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in
width.
      (1)   Said sidewalks shall be located thirty (30) inches behind the curb
along streets, and twelve (12) inches behind the curb around the radii of cul-
de-sacs and curves.
      (2)   Because driveways in a new residential subdivision can not be
effectively located until lots are sold and developed thereby inhibiting the
initial installation of sidewalks throughout the development, the Subdivider/
Developer may require that individual owners install sidewalks in accordance
with these provisions at the same time that the owner's driveway is
constructed. No final building inspection will be considered complete until
sidewalks and/or driveways are constructed and approved.
      (3)   Failure to do so by the owner shall not release the Subdivider/
Developer from the ultimate responsibility for installation of said sidewalks.
   (C)   In commercial and other non-residential areas, sidewalks shall be a
minimum of five (5) feet in width.
      (1)   Because of safety considerations in said areas, sidewalks shall be
located as far as practical from the traffic lanes, usually abutting the right-
of-way line.
34-3-29   SPECIFICATIONS FOR STREET SIGNS.
   Street name signs shall be purchased by the Subdivider/Developer for all
intersections within or abutting any subdivision.
   (A)   Said signs shall be of flat .080 aluminum with engineering grade
sheeting and measure six (6) inches in height and no less than twenty-four (24)
inches and no more than thirty- six (36) inches in length.
   (B)   At a minimum, all street name signs shall be mounted on galvanized
steel "U" channel posts twelve (12) feet in length and weighing at least three
(3) pounds per foot, provided, however, that the Village may allow other
options upon written request from the Subdivider/Developer.
   (C)   Mounting brackets and bolts shall be made of aluminum, shall be
designed so as to inhibit theft of said signs, and shall comply with the IDOT
Standard Specifications.
   (D)   All street name signs within a subdivision shall be provided to the
Village for installation by the Village no later than the date on which the
first home within said subdivision is occupied.
   (E)   A street that is a continuation of an existing street, or obviously in
alignment with an existing street, shall bear the same name as the existing
street.
   (F)   The names of new streets shall be significantly different in sound and
spelling from the names of existing streets in the Village so as to avoid
confusion and shall be approved by the County 911 Coordinator prior to the
ordering of said signs.
34-3-30   DEDICATION FOR PUBLIC USE.
   Every Subdivider/Developer shall dedicate for public use, at least the
minimum right-of-way indicated in the street design specifications contained
herein.
   (A)   The Village Engineer may require a Subdivider/Developer to dedicate
right-of- way in excess of the stated minimum if, in his professional opinion,
he feels that:
      (1)   Due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide
adequate site lines; or
      (2)   Due to the location of streams and railroads tracks, additional
width is needed to construct bridges, underpasses, and/or safe approaches
thereto.
   (B)   Whenever a subdivision abuts an existing street that does not meet the
street design specifications contained herein, the Subdivider/Developer shall
reserve sufficient right-of-way along the street abutting the subdivision so
that, when additional right-of-way is acquired on the other site, compliance
with said standards will be possible.
   (C)   Any land that is dedicated or reserved for public rights-of-way shall
not be counted in determining compliance with the lot size and setback
requirements set forth in the Hecker Zoning Code.
   (D)   Upon the effective date of this Chapter, it shall be unlawful to
create any private street within the subdivision jurisdiction of the Village.
34-3-31   STORM WATER MANAGEMENT REQUIRED.
   (A)   Any person, firm, corporation or other entity proposing to construct
buildings or develop land within the jurisdiction of the Village shall prepare,
for review by the Village Engineer, a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
that describes the manner in which erosion, sediment and runoff resulting from
the development will be controlled and managed. The provisions of this Section
shall be applicable to the following developments:
      (1)   Any residential development having a gross aggregate of five (5)
acres or more; or
      (2)   Any residential development of less than five (5) acres but with at
least fifty percent (50%) impervious surface including roads, building, utility
right-of-way and other improvements; or
      (3)   Any commercial, industrial, institutional or utility development
that has a gross aggregate area of one (1/2) half acre or more.
   (B)   No building or construction permits, or plat approval shall be issued
by the Village until the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan has been
reviewed by the Village Engineer as meeting the requirements of this Ordinance,
or the requirement for such Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan has been
waived by the Village Engineer.
   (C)   Downstream property owners, watercourses, channels, or conduits shall
not receive storm water runoff from proposed upstream developments at a higher
peak flow rate than would have resulted from the same storm event occurring
over the site of the proposed development with the land in its natural,
undeveloped conditions, nor shall storm water runoff exceed the capacity of the
natural drainage system.
   (D)   Storm water runoff resulting from a proposed development shall be
detained on- site;
      (1)   By wet or dry bottom reservoirs;
      (2)   By underground reservoirs;
      (3)   On flat roofs, parking lots, or streets; or
      (4)   By other detention methods reviewed by the Village Engineer.
   (E)   For purposes of designing adequate on-site detention facilities, the
Illinois State Water Survey Bulletin 70 rainfall data for this region shall be
used.
   (F)   Detention Basins. Detention basins may be constructed to temporarily
detain the storm water runoff so that the rate at which it is released is the
same rate as before development. The following features shall be incorporated
into the design of any detention basin:
      (1)   The volume of storage provided shall be sufficient to store flows
both during and immediately after the maximum storm event which can be expected
to occur once every two (2) and one hundred (100) years.
      (2)   Outlet works shall be designated to limit peak outflow rates from
detention storage areas to or below peak flow rates that would have occurred
prior to the proposed development. Due to the potential for maintenance
problems associated with small diameter outfall pipes from detention
facilities, no outfall pipe smaller than four (4) inches in diameter shall be
used.
      (3)   Outlet works shall not include any mechanical components or devices
and shall function without requiring attendance or control during operation.
      (4)   Emergency spillways shall be provided to permit the safe passage of
runoff generated from a 100-year storm.
      (5)   The maximum planned depth of storm water stored shall not normally
exceed four (4) feet.
      (6)   The maximum side slopes for grassed basins shall not exceed one (1)
foot vertical for three (3) feet horizontal (3:1 slope).
      (7)   In no case shall the limits of maximum ponding be closer than
thirty (30) feet horizontally from any building and less than two (2) feet
vertically below the lowest sill elevation.
      (8)   The basin bottom should be designed to drain expeditiously. If the
bottom is to be grass, it should have a minimum slope of one percent (1%).
      (9)   Small flows through the detention basin should be handled by paved
ditches from inflow structures to outflow structures to minimize erosion.
      (10)   If the detention basin is to have other uses, the design of the
basin bottom should include under drains to expedite drying of the bottom
between runoff events.
      (11)   Designs should result in aesthetically pleasing configurations
that will enhance public acceptability.
      (12)   Outfall storm sewer structures for detention ponds and basins
shall be piped through lots.
   (G)   Detention Ponds. Detention ponds may also be used to temporarily
detain the differential runoff from the development. In addition to the general
design features for detention basins as listed above, the following should also
be incorporated into the design of any detention pond.
      (1)   In order to minimize weed growth, the normal pool depth should be
four (4) feet minimum.
      (2)   If fish are to be kept in the pond, at least one-quarter of the
area of the permanent pool should have a minimum depth of ten (10) feet.
      (3)   In order to ease cleaning of the pond or shoreline maintenance, the
pond design should include provisions for emptying the pond.
      (4)   The design of any pond may include a low flow by-pass channel or

upon which to protest the taxes at the time of payment or if the taxpayer paid
the taxes under duress.

four (4) or less years after the end of the calendar year in which payment in

administered taxes, interest or penalties paid in error shall be as follows:

      (3)   In the event the local tax administrator grants, in whole or in
part, a claim for refund or credit, the amount of the grant for refund or

conducted. The audit shall be conducted not less than seven (7) days nor more
than thirty (30) days from the date the notice is given, unless the taxpayer

event taxpayer is unable to comply with the audit on the date in question, the
taxpayer may request another date within the thirty (30) days, approved in
writing, that is convenient to the taxpayer and the local tax administrator.
   (D)   Every taxpayer shall keep accurate books and records of the taxpayer’s
business or activities, including original source documents and books of entry
denoting the transactions which had given rise or may have given rise to any
tax liability, exemption or deduction. All books shall be kept in the English
Language and shall be subject to and available for inspection by the Village.
   (E)   It is the duty and responsibility of every taxpayer to make available
its books and records for inspection by the Village. If the taxpayer or tax

provided, the local tax administrator may issue a tax determination and
assessment based on the tax administrator’s determination of the best estimate
of the taxpayer’s tax liability.

local tax administrator a written protest and petition for hearing, setting
forth the basis of the taxpayer’s request for a hearing. The written protest
and petition for hearing must be filed with the local tax administrator within
forty-five (45) days of receipt of the written notice of the tax determination
and assessment.

within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the written protest and petition for
hearing, unless the taxpayer requests a later date convenient to all parties.
   (D)   If a written protest and petition for hearing is not filed within the
forty-five (45) day period, the tax determination, audit or assessment shall
become a final bill due and owing without further notice.
   (E)   Upon the showing of reasonable cause by the taxpayer and the full
payment of the contested tax liability along with interest accrued as of the
due date of the tax, the local tax administrator may reopen or extend the time
for filing a written protest and petition for hearing. In no event shall the
time for filing a written protest and petition for hearing be reopened or
extended for more than ninety (90) days after the expiration of the forty-five
(45) day period.
36-2-10   HEARING.

36-2-9, above, the local tax administrator shall conduct a hearing regarding
any appeal.

preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any continuance granted
shall not exceed fourteen (14) days.

hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax determination, audit
or assessment. The strict rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings
shall not apply.

make a written determination on the basis of the evidence presented at the
hearing. The taxpayer or tax collector shall be provided with a copy of the
written decision.
36-2-11   INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   In the event a determination has been made that a tax is due and owing,
through audit, assessment or other bill sent, the tax must be paid within the
time frame otherwise indicated.
   (A)   Interest. The Village hereby provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax to be six
percent (6%) per annum, based on a year of three hundred sixty-five (365) days
and the number of days elapsed.
   (B)   Late Filing and Payment Penalties. If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty, of six percent (6%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%)
of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the Village
issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure
to file penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the
total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was
required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a
failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance.
36-2-12   ABATEMENT.
   The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any
late filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the
local tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or

36-2-13   INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS.
   The Village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with
the local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without
further notice to the taxpayer.
36-2-14   STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   The Village, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax

of the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax
still due and owing.
   (A)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four (4)
years maximum after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   (B)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
Village, the tax paid was less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the

   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not

filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this

to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (A)   timely remove the lien at the Village’s expense;
   (B)   correct the taxpayer’s credit record; and
   (C)   correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
36-2-18   APPLICATION.

invoice, and
         (c)   the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on
the retailer’s books and records kept in the regular course of business.

insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this State in the same manner and subject to the same

The permit may be revoked by the Department at its discretion.

that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that event, shall

Section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the
municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
municipal tax.

taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this State and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be

privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this Article
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
Department in the manner provided by the Department.

show the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this Article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the Department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunications tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person’s having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided hereinabove in this Section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this State shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

   (E)   Service Obtained By Fraud. All contracts for water and sewer services
shall be made in the name of the head of the household, firm or corporation
using the established spelling of that person's or firm's name. Attempts to
obtain service by the use of other names, different spellings or by
substituting other persons or firms shall be considered a subterfuge and
service shall be denied. If service has been discontinued because of nonpayment
of bills, or any unpaid obligation and service has again been obtained through
subterfuge, misrepresentation or fraud, that service shall be promptly
disconnected and the whole or such part of the deposit as may be necessary to
satisfy the unpaid obligation shall be retained by the Village and credited to
the appropriate account.
   (F)   Failure to Receive Bill. Failure to receive a bill shall not excuse a
customer from his obligation to pay within the time specified. Should the
Department be unable to bill a customer for services used during any month, the
following billing shall include the charges for services used during the
unbilled month.
   (G)   Request to Discontinue Service.  Services shall have been deemed to
have been supplied to any property connected to the Water and Sewer Systems
during a month unless the customer notifies the Village prior to the first day
of the new billing month in which the services are to be discontinued.
   (H)   Billing; Utility Shut-off; Hearing.
      (1)   All bills for utility services shall be due and payable upon
presentation and if a bill is not paid within twenty (20) days, a penalty equal
to ten percent (10%) of the amount due on said bill shall be added thereto.
This penalty shall be in addition to the charges heretofore established for the
utility services.
      (2)   Any customer who fails to pay the utility bills within thirty (30)
days of presentation shall have the utility services disconnected after a
written notice by the Clerk has been mailed by first-class mail to the
customer, affording the customer an opportunity for a hearing. The aforesaid
notice shall be mailed to the customer twenty-one (21) days after billing,
specifically advising the customer of the following:
         (a)   Name and address of the customer and amount due for services
including late penalties.
         (b)   The date, time, and location of the hearing to be held.
         (c)   That the customer has a right to be heard and to present
evidence in his behalf if he does not agree with the bill.
         (d)   That if the customer fails to appear at the hearing, the
consumer's utility service shall be terminated without further proceedings.
         (e)   The date of termination.
[See Memphis Light, Gas & Water v. Craft 98 S.Ct 1554 (1978)]
      (3)   The time, date and location of the hearing shall be determined by
the Mayor, the Superintendent or the Treasurer. One of these officials shall
preside over the hearing and shall make a final determination as to the rights
of the consumer and the Village based on the information received at the
hearing. (See Appendix #6)
      (4)   The customer shall be notified within three (3) working days of the
decision rendered by the hearing officer. If the service is to be discontinued,
a date and time will be set out in the notice to terminate the service or
services of the customer. Notice of the hearing officer's decision shall be
made by first-class mail.
      (5)   If the hearing officer decides in favor of the Village, the Village
shall have the right to discontinue the customer's utility services. Should the
customer fail to appear at the hearing, or should the notice be returned non-
accepted, then the Village shall also have the right to terminate the
customer's utility services without further proceedings.
      (6)   If the customer who has been notified for nonpayment of utility
bills is not the owner of record, then the Village shall notify the owner of
the property by first-class mail.
      (7)   Once utility services have been disconnected the same shall not be
again connected or used until all delinquent accounts and bills of service are
paid in full, including a fee of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) for each
connection of such utility services, plus expenses incurred in the reconnecting
of the utility services.
   (I)   Lien Notice. Whenever a bill for utility services remains unpaid for
sixty (60) days after it has been rendered, the Treasurer shall file with the
County Recorder of Deeds a statement of lien claim. This statement shall
contain the legal description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid
bill, and a notice that the municipality claims a lien for this amount to the
period covered by the bill.
   If the consumer of utility services whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of
the premises and the Treasurer has notice of this, then notice shall be mailed
to the owner of the premises if his address is known to the Treasurer whenever
such bill remains unpaid for a period of thirty (30) days after it has been
rendered.
   The failure of the Treasurer to record such lien or to mail such notice, or
the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right to
foreclose the lien for unpaid utility bills as mentioned herein. (See 65 ILCS
5/11-139-8)
   (J)   Foreclosure of Lien.  Property subject to a lien for unpaid utility
charges may be sold for non-payment of the same, and the proceeds of such sale
shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in
the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill- in-
equity in the name of the Village.
   The Village Attorney is hereby authorized to institute such proceedings in
the name of the Village in any Court having jurisdiction over such matters
against any property for which the bill for utility services has remained
unpaid ninety (90) days after it has been rendered. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-139- 8)
38-2-2   CONSUMER LISTS.
   It is hereby made the duty of the Clerk to prepare or cause to be prepared a
complete and accurate list of all premises and properties receiving utility

time to allow changes in the occupancy or ownership of any such property or
premises. It shall be presented at the regular monthly meeting if requested.

premises by the Village only on the condition that such owner, occupant and
user shall be jointly and severally liable therefor to the Village.
38-2-5   ESTIMATED CHARGE.
   Whenever any meter, by reason of its being out of repair or from any cause
fails to properly register the utilities passing through the same, the consumer
shall be charged the average charge of the previous three (3) months usage. If
no record of the previous three (3) months exists, then it shall be the duty of
the Water Clerk to estimate the amount of utilities consumed during the time
the meter fails to operate and the consumer shall be charged with such
estimated amount. Bills may be estimated whenever it is impossible to read the
meters during inclement weather.
38-2-6   NO FREE UTILITY SERVICE.
   No free utility service shall be furnished to any person, public or private,
and all rates and charges shall be non-discriminatory, provided that the Mayor
and Village Board reserve the right to impose special rates and charges in
cases where particular circumstances render the regular rates inadequate or
unjust.
38-2-7   METER TESTING.
   (A)   Municipality’s Responsibility. All meters are accurately tested before
installation. Meters are also periodically tested in accordance with the
Illinois Commerce Commission’s regulations. The Water Department may, at any
time, remove any meter for routine test, repair or replacement and may, at its
option and expense, test any meter when the Water Department has reason to
believe that it is registering inaccurately.
   (B)   Customer’s Rights. A customer may request a meter be tested for
accuracy, which test will be made in accordance with the standard regulations
for meter testing as prescribed by the Illinois Commerce Commission. Each
request for the test of a meter for accuracy shall be accompanied by a deposit
of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) for five-eighths (5/8) inch through one (1) inch
meters and Fifty Dollars ($50.00) for one and one-half (1 ½) inch and larger
meters. If the meter so tested shall be found to be accurate within the limits
prescribed by the Illinois Commerce Commission, the deposit shall be retained
by the Water Department as compensation for such test; if the error in
registration is found to be more than permitted by the Commission, then the
cost of the test shall be returned to the customer and the customer’s bill
shall be adjusted in accordance with the result of the test, if error is
established.

provisions of this Chapter shall be held by the Village as security for the
payment of utility services used by the applicant upon the premises to which
his application pertains and may be so applied when any default is made in the
payment in the utilities bill in accordance with this Chapter. The depositor
shall earn no interest on the deposit.
38-2-9   EXTRATERRITORIAL SERVICE.
   No water or sewer service shall be provided to an applicant outside the
corporate limits of the Village unless such applicant petitions for annexation
to the Village, or if the applicant cannot annex to the Village pursuant to
law, that such applicant must execute a pre-annexation agreement with the
Village. In addition to any other provisions that may be contained in said pre-
annexation agreement, the agreement must provide for the annexation of the
property to the Village and must further provide, in those instances where the
applicant desires water service to more than one single family residential
unit, that the applicant demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Village, that
the proposed land use for which water is desired, is in conformity with the
Regional Land Use Plans currently used and prepared by the Southwest Illinois
Metropolitan Area Planning Commission.

or main. Before taking any such steps the Superintendent shall notify the owner
of the real estate if the owner’s name and address is known and shall notify
the person shown on the real estate tax records as having paid taxes on the
property the last time taxes were paid. Such notice shall be made by mail, at

branch is larger than four (4) inches in diameter. The entire sewer main in the
location of the wye and the wye shall be encased in concrete.
   (C)   Using the pipe cutter only, neatly and accurately cut out desired
length of pipe for insertion of proper fitting. Remove both hub and bell ends,
or other compression couplings from wye branch fitting to allow the wye branch
to be inserted with no more than a total of one-half (1/2) inch gap. Use "Band
Seal" couplings, or similar couplings, and shear rings and clamps to fasten the
inserted fitting and hold it firmly in place. The entire section shall then be
encased in concrete having a minimum thickness of four (4) inches and extending
eight (8) inches beyond each joint.
   If another method is desired, a detail shall be submitted for review and
approval by the Village before the connection is made. Indiscriminate breaking
of the sewer main pipe is not allowed.
   On Site Inspection. After the wye branch has been inserted and jointed, and
before any additional fittings have been placed in the service line, the
installation shall be approved by the  Superintendent, or his authorized
representative. After approval is granted, the contractor shall encase the work
area as specified herein.

accommodating the particular needs of all residents, and to discourage
development on inappropriate sites;

   (C)   To protect and enhance the character and stability of sound existing

personally liable for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a
result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his duties under
this Code. (See “Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity
Act”, 745 ILCS 10/1-101)
   (B)   Any suit brought against any official, board member, agent, or
employee of the Village as a result of any act required or permitted in the
discharge of his duties under this Code, shall be defended by the Village
Attorney until the final determination of the legal proceedings.
40-1-6   SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this Code is declared unconstitutional or invalid by a
court of competent jurisdiction, that decision shall not affect the validity of
the remainder of this Code.

40-3-1   ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS.
   In order to implement the regulatory scheme of this Code so as to achieve
the objectives enumerated in Section
40-1-2, the entire Village is hereby divided into the following zoning
districts:
 
DISTRICT                        DESIGNATION MINIMUM AREA*
Agricultural                    A-1         3 acres

Industrial                      I-1         5 acres
 
(Ord. No. 94-07)
*   The “minimum area” requirement (which is intended to prevent spot zoning)
refers to the smallest total area of contiguous parcels that can properly be
given the particular district classification. The minimum area requirement is
not satisfied merely because the acreage of numerous noncontiguous parcels,
when aggregated, happens to equal or exceed the minimum area indicated above.
40-3-2   ZONING MAP AND DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The boundaries of the listed zoning districts are hereby established as
shown on the Official Zoning Map of the Village. This map, including all
notations and other information thereof is hereby made a part of this Code by
reference. The Official Zoning Map shall be kept on file in the Administrator’s
office.
40-3-3   ANNUAL PUBLICATION.
   In accordance with State Law, if any changes are made in the zoning
districts or regulations during a calendar year, the Zoning Administrator shall
publish the revised official zoning map of the Village not later than March
31st of the following year. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-13- 19)
   NOTE: The map shall be published if there are any annexations.

      (2)   Lot line   Such lot line.
      (3)   Railroad tracks   Right-of-way line of such track
      (4)   Stream   Center of such stream
      (5)   Section, fraction or survey lines   Such lines
   (B)   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is legally vacated, the
zoning districts adjoining each side of such vacated public way shall
automatically extend to the center of such way, and all territory included in
the vacated way shall thereafter be subject to all regulations of the extended
districts.
40-3-5   ANNEXED TERRITORY.
   Any territory hereafter annexed to the Municipality shall automatically be
in the SR-1, Single-Family Residence District until duly changed by an
amendment to this Code; except that the Village Board, with the advice of the
Zoning Board, may annex any territory as any other zoning district or districts
herein established if all legal requirements for zoning the property at the
time of the annexation and the requirements for amending this Code by the
extension of the zoning district provisions are met. (See Sec. 40-10-30 for
amendments)
40-3-6   GENERAL PROHIBITION.

   (C)   to use, occupy, or develop any lot or part thereof;*
   *EXCEPT in conformity with the provisions of this Code.
40-3-7   UNLISTED USES PROHIBITED.
   Whenever any use is not specifically listed as “permitted” or “special”
within a particular zoning district, such use shall be deemed prohibited in
that district. However, if the Village Board, following consultation with the
Zoning Administrator and the Zoning Board of Appeals finds that the unlisted
use is similar to and compatible with the listed uses, they may allow such use.
The decision of the Village Board shall become a permanent record, and any
unlisted use that they Approve shall thereafter have the same status as listed
uses.
40-3-8   MEETING MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   Except as specifically provided otherwise else where in this Code, every lot
must meet the minimum area, minimum dimensions, and minimum setback
requirements of the district in which it is located independently; that is,

DIVISION II - PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
40-3-20   PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DEFINED.
   As used in this Division, the term “planned development” or “PD” means a
development wherein, in accordance with an approved development plan:
   (A)   common open space is reserved;
   (B)   various housing types and other structures and uses may be mixed and/
or
   (C)   overall average density does not exceed the usual zoning district
limit.
40-3-21   OBJECTIVES.
   This Section authorizes development of Planned Developments and establishes
procedures in order to achieve the objectives enumerated in Section
40-1-2 and the following additional objectives:
   (A)   to provide a regulatory mechanism whereby the Village can be assured
that upon completion, approved development projects will substantially conform
to the plans or models which constituted the basis for the issuance of the
necessary zoning and subdivision permits;
   (B)   to permit development of a wide variety of housing types and other
structures and uses in a single comprehensively planned project;
   (C)   to preserve the natural topography, scenic features, mature trees and
historic structures existing on sites proposed for development;
   (D)   to encourage innovative site layouts and coordinated architectural
treatment of different housing types and other structures;
   (E)   to ensure the provision of usable, common, open space in planned
developments, and to spur installation of various amenities therein;
   (F)   to facilitate the economical installation of standard streets, sewers,
utilities, and other improvements.
40-3-22   COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS GENERALLY REQUIRED.  
   Except as specifically provided otherwise in this Code, planned
developments--including all structures and uses therein- -shall, at a minimum,
be built in conformity with all applicable codes and ordinances, including the
Zoning Code and the Subdivision Code.
40-3-23   DISTRICTS WHERE ALLOWED.
   Planned Developments may be built in any Zoning District, but only upon the
issuance of a special-use permit by the Zoning Board of Appeals after a hearing
before the Plan Commission.  (See Sec. 40-10-26)
40-3-24   PERMISSIBLE DEVIATION FROM CODE REQUIREMENTS.
   The Planned Development concept is intended to afford both the developer and
the Village considerable flexibility in formulating development proposals.
Consequently, to the extent indicated in this Section, Planned Developments may
deviate from generally applicable Code requirements without a variance. Any
proposed deviation not listed below, however, shall require a variance.
   (A)   Mixed Uses. Planned Developments may include all types of residential
structures and any other uses approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals, provided
that in approving such mixed uses, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach any
conditions necessary to protect the public welfare.
   (B)   Lot and Structure Requirements. In Planned Developments, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may approve any reasonable deviation from the lot and
structure requirements of the particular zoning district so long as the
different uses within the PD are appropriately interrelated and property
abutting the PD is adequately protected from any potential adverse impacts of
the development. “Lot and structure requirements” mean minimum individual lot
area, width and depth; minimum setbacks; and maximum structure height.
   (C)   Accessory Uses. In PDs the Zoning Board of Appeals may allow the
developer to disregard the usual restrictions on accessory uses other than the
prohibition against using an accessory structure as a dwelling.
   (D)   Location of Parking/Loading Spaces. By permission of the Zoning Board
of Appeals, off-street parking and loading spaces in PDs need not be located in
accordance with generally applicable requirements. The minimum number of such
spaces, however, shall not be less than the number required as per Article V of
this Code.

Article for all structures and uses erected or established after the effective
date of this Code.
40-5-2   EXISTING PARKING/LOADING FACILITIES.
   (A)   Existing off-street parking or loading facilities located on the same
lot as the use served shall not be reduced, or if already less than, shall not
be further reduced below the requirements and standards for similar new
structures or uses.

subsequently repaired or rebuilt, parking/loading facilities equivalent to any
maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be restored, but
additional parking/loading spaces need not be provided.
   (C)   Whenever the use of any structure or premises is intensified through
addition of dwelling units, increased floor area, greater seating capacity,
etc., additional off-street parking and loading spaces commensurate with such
intensification shall be provided.
   (D)   Whenever the existing use of a structure is changed to a different
use, off-street parking or loading facilities shall be provided as required
herein for such new use.
40-5-3   PARKING LOT DESIGN STANDARDS.
   All off-street parking lots shall conform to the standards indicated in the
subsections which follow:
   NOTE: Standards applicable to all parking areas are indicated by one
asterisk (*); standards applicable to all parking areas except those accessory
to single- or two-family dwellings are indicated by two asterisks (**).
40-5-3.1   SPACES.
   (A)   Each off-street parking space shall be at least nine (9) feet wide and
twenty (20) feet long and shall have at least seven (7) feet of vertical
clearance. Every space shall be situated so that no part of any parked vehicle
overhangs the public right-of-way. (*)
   (B)   Markings shall be laid and restored as often as necessary to clearly
delineate each parking space. (**)
(Ord. No. 21-01; 01-12-21)
40-5-3.2   INTERIOR AISLES.
   Aisles within parking lots shall be sufficiently wide to permit safe and
efficient vehicular movement in the aisles, and into and out of parking spaces.
Aisles designed for two-way traffic shall be at least twenty-two (22) feet
wide. One-way aisles designed for sixty (60) degree parking shall be at least
eighteen (18) feet wide. (**)
40-5-3.3   ACCESS WAY.
   (A)   Parking lots shall be designed so that ingress to and egress from a
parking space is from an aisle or driveway, not directly from the public right-
of-way. (*)
   (B)   No access way to any parking lot shall be located within thirty (30)
feet of any corner formed by the intersection of the rights-of-way of two (2)
or more streets. At intersections where traffic control devices are installed,
the Administrator may increase this requirement as necessary to prevent
hazards. (*)
   (C)   Parking lot access ways (as well as residential driveways) and public
streets shall be aligned to form, as closely as feasible, right angles. (*)
   (D)   The access way to every parking lot located in any business district
or in the Industrial District shall be at least twenty-four (24) feet wide
unless two (2) one-way drives, each twelve (12) feet wide, are provided. (**)
   (E)   The access way to every parking lot located in any residential
district or in the Agricultural District shall be at least ten (10) feet wide;
but if the parking area is longer than one hundred (100) feet, access shall be
provided either by one two-way drive at least twenty (20) feet wide or by two
one-way drives, each at least ten (10) feet wide. (*)
40-5-3.4   SURFACING.
   Parking lots shall be graded and improved with a compacted stone base at
least seven (7) inches thick, surfaced with at least two (2) inches of
asphaltic concrete or approved comparable material. Parking lots used
exclusively for employees are hereby exempt from these requirements but shall
be constructed of an approved dustless surface. (Note: “Oil and chip” is not
comparable material.) (**)
40-5-3.5   LIGHTING.
   Any light(s) used to illuminate any parking lot shall be arranged or
shielded so as to confine direct light rays within the lot lines of the parking
lot to the greatest extent possible and in no case, shall the light(s) shine on
or into nearby residences. (*)
40-5-3.6   LANDSCAPING.
   In order to reduce heat and glare, to minimize blowing of dust and trash,
and to reduce the oppressive visual effects of large open parking areas,
landscaping shall be provided and maintained within every parking lot that
contains twenty (20) or more parking spaces. Parking lots used exclusively for
employees are hereby exempt from these requirements but shall be constructed of
an approved dustless surface. (**)
   (A)   A landscaping plan (either a separate document or an element of a more
inclusive development plan) shall accompany every application for a Certificate
of Zoning Compliance to develop any parking lot that will contain twenty (20)
or more parking spaces.
   (B)   The landscaping plan shall include the following information:
      (1)   Proposed type, amount, size and spacing of plantings, including
trees, shrubbery, and ground cover;
      (2)   Proposed size, construction materials, and drainage of landscaped
islands; and
      (3)   Sketch indicating proposed spatial relationships of landscaped
areas, parking spaces, automobile circulation, and pedestrian movement.
40-5-4   LOCATION OF PARKING.
   All off-street parking shall be located in conformity with the following
requirements:
   (A)   For Dwellings.
      (1)   Parking spaces accessory to any dwelling shall be located on the
same lot as the dwelling. Such parking spaces shall not be located in any
required front yard or required side yard adjacent to a street except in the
driveway, but may be located in the side or rear yards.
      (2)   Each parking space accessory to a multi-family dwelling shall be
unobstructed so that no vehicle need be moved in order to allow another vehicle
to enter/exit the parking area; provided that this requirement shall not be
applicable to two-family dwellings.
   (B)   For Business/Industrial Uses.
      (1)   Every off-street parking space accessory to any business or
industrial use shall be located within five hundred (500) feet of the use
served; provided that no portion of any parking lot for non-residential uses
shall extend into any residential district or into the Agriculture District,
except by written permission of the Administrator.
      (2)   In any business district or in the Industrial District, off-street
parking facilities for different buildings or uses may be provided
collectively; but only if the total number of spaces so located together is not
less than the sum of the separate requirements for each use, and if all other
pertinent regulations are observed.
40-5-5   DESIGN AND LOCATION OF OFF-STREET LOADING FACILITIES.
   All off-street loading facilities shall conform to the minimum standards
indicated below:
   (A)   Size of Space. Every off-street loading space shall be at least twelve
(12) feet wide and forty-five (45) feet long exclusive of aisle and maneuver
space and shall have vertical clearance of at least fourteen (14) feet. In no
case shall a vehicle being loaded or unloaded overhang into the public right-
of-way.
   (B)   Access Way. Every off-street loading space shall have a safe means of
vehicular access to a street or alley. Such access way shall be at least twelve
(12) feet wide.
   (C)   Surfacing. Every off-street loading area shall be improved with a
compacted stone base at least seven (7) inches thick, surfaced with at least
two (2) inches of asphaltic concrete or approved comparable material. (No “oil
and chip”)
   (D)   Buffer Strips. No loading space or area for vehicles over two (2) ton
cargo capacity shall be developed closer than fifty (50) feet to the lot line
of any lot located in any residential district or in the Agricultural District
unless such space/area is completely enclosed by walls, a solid fence, or
closely planted shrubbery at least ten (10) feet in height and of sufficient
density to block the view from residential property.
   (E)   Location. Every off-street loading space shall be located on the same
parcel of land as the use served, and not closer than fifty (50) feet to the
intersection of the rights-of-way of two (2) or more streets, and not on any
required front yard.
40-5-6   COMPUTATION OF REQUIRED PARKING/LOADING SPACES.  
   In computing the number of parking spaces required by this Code, the Zoning
Administrator shall apply the following rules:
   (A)   In computing parking space requirements based on the number of
employees, the maximum number of employees on the premises at any period of the
day shall be used. “Employee parking” means one (1) parking space shall be
required per one and one-half (1.5) employees”, unless otherwise stated.
   (B)   In computing parking or loading space requirements on the basis of
building floor area, the gross floor area shall be used.
   (C)   Whenever it is necessary to translate gross parking lot area into
number of parking spaces, three hundred fifty (350) square feet of gross area
shall be deemed one (1) parking space.
   (D)   If computation of the number of parking or loading spaces required by
this Code results in a fractional space, any fraction of one-half (.5) or more
shall be counted as one (1) space.
   (E)   No space or portion thereof needed to satisfy the minimum applicable
requirement for number of off-street parking or loading spaces shall be counted
as part of the off-street parking or loading spaces required for another
structure or use.
40-5-7   NUMBER OF PARKING AND LOADING SPACES REQUIRED.  
   Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided as indicated in
tabular form below. For any use that is not listed in the table, the same
amount of parking and loading space shall be provided as is required for the
most similar listed use. The Zoning Administrator shall make the determination

ARTICLE VI - SIGN REGULATIONS
40-6-1   GENERAL PROHIBITION.
   Any sign not expressly permitted in this Article shall be deemed prohibited.
40-6-2   COMPUTATION OF SIGN AREA ALLOWANCE.
   Within the limitations and restrictions as further provided in this Article,
the total area of all signs which an establishment is permitted to display
shall be computed according to the following formula:
      One (1) square foot of sign area per one (1) foot of street frontage or
two (2) square feet of sign for each lineal foot of the front width of the
business.
   provided, however, that no establishment in any district shall display more
than three hundred (300) square feet of sign on any street front.
40-6-2.1   DEFINITION OF SIGN AREA.
   As used in this Article, the term “sign area” means the area of the one
imaginary square or rectangle which would completely enclose all the letters,
parts, or symbols of a sign. (See Figures 3 and 4 at End of Code)
40-6-2.2   SPECIAL SITUATIONS.
   (A)   Except as specifically provided otherwise in this Article, if an
establishment has frontage on two (2) or more streets, each side having such
frontage shall be considered separately for purposes of determining compliance
with the provisions of this Article. However, the area allowance for signs
shall not be aggregated so as to permit such establishment to display on any
one (1) frontage a greater area of signs than would be permitted by application
of the formula set forth above.
   (B)   The side of an establishment adjacent to an off-street parking area
shall not be deemed frontage unless the establishment has no other frontage.
40-6-3   SIGNS TO BE NON-HAZARDOUS, WELL-MAINTAINED.
   (A)   No sign shall be erected, relocated or maintained so as to prevent
free access or egress from any door, window, fire escape, or driveway.
   (B)   No sign shall be erected or maintained in such a manner that it
interferes with, obstructs the view of, or is likely to be confused with any
authorized traffic control device.
   (C)   Every sign shall be designed and constructed in conformity with any
applicable provisions of the adopted Building Code, if any.
   (D)   Every sign and appurtenance shall be maintained in a neat and
attractive condition by its owner. The sign supports shall be kept painted to
prevent rust or deterioration.
40-6-4   ILLUMINATION.
   Illumination of signs is permitted, subject to the following requirements:
   (A)   No sign shall employ red, yellow, or green lights in such a manner as
to confuse or interfere with vehicular traffic.
   (B)   No sign other than those providing time and temperature information
shall have blinking, flashing, or fluttering lights or any other illuminating
device which has a changing light intensity, brightness, or color; provided,
however, that this provision shall not apply to any message on any
electronically-operated, changeable sign.
   (C)   The light from any illuminated sign shall be shaded, shielded, or
directed so that it creates neither a nuisance to adjacent property nor a
traffic hazard.
40-6-5   NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   A nonconforming sign means any lawfully erected sign or billboard that does
not conform to one or more provisions of this Article or any amendment thereto.
40-6-6   RESTRICTIONS.
   Any nonconforming sign as defined in Section
40-6-5 that does not pose an imminent peril to life or property may lawfully
remain subject to all the restrictions on the enlargement, alteration, or
relocation, or reconstruction of nonconforming structures set forth in Article
VIII of this Code; provided as follows:
   (A)   Merely changing the message displayed on a nonconforming sign shall
not be construed as a prohibited alteration;
   (B)   Whenever any sign is nonconforming solely because it is appurtenant to
a nonconforming commercial/industrial use located in the Agricultural District
or in any residential district, said sign shall be treated in the same manner
as it would be if it were appurtenant to a commercial/industrial use located in
any Business District or in the Industrial District.
40-6-7   STRICTLY PROHIBITED SIGNS.
   Except as specifically noted otherwise, henceforth, the following signs and
street graphics are strictly prohibited throughout the Village:
   (A)   Mobile/Portable Marquees; except that they may be permitted as a
temporary sign.
   (B)   Signs attached to trees, fences or public utility poles, other than
warning signs posted by government officials or public utilities.
   (C)   Defunct Signs, including the posts or other supports therefor that
advertise or identify an activity, business, product, or service no longer
conducted on the premises where such sign is located.
   (D)   Roof-mounted signs, that project or protrude above the highest point
of the roof.  (See Sec. 40-6-11)
40-6-8   SIGNS PERMITTED IN ANY DISTRICT.
   Any sign or other street graphic enumerated below that complies with the
indicated requirements is permitted in any district of the Village. Such signs
or street graphics shall not be debited against the displaying establishment’s
sign area allowance. (See Sec. 40-6-2)
   (A)   Construction Signs identifying the architects, engineers, contractors,
and other individuals or firms involved with the construction, and/or
announcing the character or purpose of the building, but not advertising any
product: Such signs shall not exceed twenty-four (24) square feet in area,

ARTICLE VIII - NONCONFORMITIES
40-8-1   PURPOSE OF ARTICLE.
   The requirements imposed by this Code are designed to guide the use of land
by encouraging the development of structures and uses that are compatible with
the predominant character of each of the various districts. Lots, structures,
and uses of land or structures that do not conform to the requirements of the
district in which they are located tend to impede appropriate development. For
example, nonconformities are frequently responsible for heavy traffic on
residential streets, the overtaxing of parking facilities, the creation of
nuisances, and/or the lowering of property values. The regulations of this
Article are intended to alleviate such existing/potential problems by
encouraging the gradual elimination of nonconformities.
40-8-2   NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   If the Zoning Board of Appeals grants a variance for any vacant lot that
does not conform to one (1) or more of the lot size (area dimensions)
requirements of the district in which it is located, that lot may, nonetheless,
be developed for any use permitted in that district if such vacant lot:
   (A)   was recorded in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds prior to
the effective date of this Code (or pertinent amendment thereto); and
   (B)   is at least fifty (50) feet wide.
40-8-2.1   TWO OR MORE LOTS IN COMMON OWNERSHIP.
   If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage were of record and in common ownership on the effective
date of this Code, and if one (1) or more of those lots does not meet the
minimum lot width, depth, and area requirements of the district in which it is
located, the land involved shall be considered an undivided parcel. No portion
of any such parcel shall be developed except in compliance with this Code, nor
shall any such parcel be divided so as to create a lot that does not meet the
requirements of this Code.
40-8-3   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Any otherwise lawful structure which exists on the effective date of this
Code, but which could not be erected under the terms of this Code because of
requirements/restrictions concerning lot size, height, setbacks, or other
characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, may lawfully
remain, subject to the following provisions.
   (A)   Maintenance. A nonconforming structure may be maintained by ordinary
repairs.
   (B)   Enlargement, Alterations. A nonconforming structure shall not be
enlarged or altered in any way which increases its nonconformity.
   (C)   Relocation. A nonconforming structure shall not be moved unless, after
relocation, it will conform to all the regulations of the district in which it
is situated.
   (D)   Reconstruction. No structure which is destroyed or damaged by any
means shall be reconstructed if the Administrator determines that the cost of
such reconstruction exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the structure's market value
at the time of loss, unless after reconstruction the structure will conform to
all applicable regulations of the district in which it is located. In the event
the Administrator determines the estimated cost of reconstruction is less than
fifty percent (50%) of the structure's market value at the time of the loss,
repairs or reconstruction shall be permitted, provided such work starts within
six (6) months from the date the damage occurred and is diligently prosecuted
to completion.
   The Administrator may require that the reconstruction cost estimate be made
by a bona fide construction contractor, and that the structure's market value
at the time of loss be determined by a licensed real estate appraiser. The
owner of the damaged structure shall be responsible for obtaining these
estimates for the Administrator.
   As an alternative, the market value may be determined by the Administrator
by using the “state equalized assessed value” multiplied by the number three
(3).
   The provisions of paragraph (D) shall not apply to single-family dwellings.
40-8-4   NONCONFORMING USES OCCUPYING A STRUCTURE.
   If any lawful use occupying a structure exists on the effective date of this
Code, but would not be allowed under the terms of this Code, such use may
lawfully continue, subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   Maintenance. Any structure housing a nonconforming use may be
maintained through ordinary repairs.
   (B)   Enlargement, Alteration, Reconstruction, Relocation. No structure
housing a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, structurally altered,
reconstructed, or relocated unless the use of the structure is changed to a
permitted use.
   (C)   Extension of Use. No nonconforming use may be extended to any part(s)
of the structure not intended or designed for such use, nor shall the
nonconforming use be extended to occupy any land outside such structure.
   (D)   Change of Use. A nonconforming use occupying a structure may be
changed to a similar use, to a more restrictive use, or to a conforming use.
Such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use.
   (E)   Discontinuance of Use. When a nonconforming use of a structure or of a
structure and premises in combination is discontinued for twelve (12)
consecutive months or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year
period, the nonconforming use shall not thereafter be resumed. Any
discontinuance caused by government action and without any contributing fault
by the nonconforming user shall not be counted in calculating the length of
discontinuance.
40-8-5   NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND.
   Any lawful use of land existing on the effective date of this Code that
would not be permitted under the terms of this Code may lawfully continue,
subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   Intensification or Extension of Use. A nonconforming use of land shall
not be intensified or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was
occupied by such use on the effective date of this Code.
   (B)   Relocation. No nonconforming use of land shall be moved, in whole or
in part, unless such use, upon relocation, will conform to all pertinent
regulations of the district in which it is proposed to be located.
   (C)   Change of Use. Whenever a nonconforming use of a building has been
changed to a more restrictive use or to a conforming use, such use shall not
thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use. If no structural alterations
are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or more restricted classification.
   (D)   Discontinuance. When a nonconforming use of land is discontinued for a
period of twelve (12) consecutive months or for eighteen (18) months during any
three (3) year period, it shall not thereafter be resumed, and any subsequent
use of such land shall conform to the applicable district regulations. Any
discontinuance caused by government action and without any contributing fault
by the owner or operator shall not be counted in calculating the length of
discontinuance.
40-8-6   NONCONFORMITIES UNDER PERMIT AUTHORITY.
   The regulations of this Article shall not apply to any change in an existing
structure or to any change in the use of a structure or of land for which a
permit was issued prior to effective date of this Code or any pertinent
amendment thereto, provided that the work authorized by such permit is
completed within a reasonable time.

the imposition of fines.
40-9-9   SERVICE OF ORDER.

DIVISION II - APPEALS
40-10-12   NATURE OF AN APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Zoning Administrator in
any matter related to the interpretation or enforcement of any provision of
this Code may appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals on a prescribed form. Every
such appeal shall be made and treated in accordance with Illinois law (65 ILCS
Sec. 5/11-13-12) and the provisions of this Section.  (See 65 ILCS 5/11-13-3
(D))
40-10-13   FILING, RECORD TRANSMITTAL.
   Every appeal shall be made within forty-five (45) days of the matter
complained of by filing with the Administrator and the Zoning Board of Appeals
a written notice specifying the grounds for appeal. Every appeal shall also be
filed with the Soil and Water Conservation District as per State law. Not more
than five (5) working days after the notice of appeal has been filed, the
Administrator shall transmit to the Zoning Board of Appeals all records
pertinent to the case. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-13-14) (See 70 ILCS 405/22.02A)
40-10-14   STAY OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.
   An appeal stays all further action on the matter being appealed unless the
Administrator certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals after the notice of
appeal has been filed with him, that for reasons stated in the certificate, a
stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, further
action shall not be stayed unless the Zoning Board of Appeals or the Circuit
Court grants a restraining order for due cause and so notifies the
Administrator.  (See 65 ILCS 5/11-13-12)
40-10-15   PUBLIC HEARING, NOTICE.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on every appeal
within a reasonable time after the filing of the appeal notice. At the hearing,
any interested party may appear and testify, either in person or by duly
authorized agent or attorney. Notice indicating the time, date, and place of
the hearing, and briefly describing the issue to be decided shall be given not
more than thirty (30) days nor less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing:
   (A)   By publication in a newspaper of general circulation within this
Municipality; and
   (B)   By certified mail to the applicant; and,
   (C)   By first-class mail to all owners of property contiguous to any
property affected by the appeal.
(See 65 ILCS 5/11-13-12)
40-10-16   RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF APPEALS.
   The Board of Appeals shall render a recommendation on the appeal within
thirty (30) days after the hearing therein. The Board of Appeal may reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify or amend the decision or order appealed
from the extent and in the manner that they deem appropriate. In so doing, the
Board of Appeals has all the power of the Administrator. The recommendation
shall be forwarded to the Village Board for a final decision.
40-10-17   DECISION BY BOARD OF TRUSTEES.
   The Board of Trustees shall render a decision on the appeal within a
reasonable time after receiving the appropriate records and recommendation of
the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Board of Trustees may uphold the
recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals or make such other decision as
they deem appropriate. In so doing, the Board of Trustees has all the powers of
the Administrator and Zoning Board of Appeals. Such decision shall be binding
upon the Zoning Administrator and observed by him and he shall be required to
incorporate the terms and conditions of the same in the Zoning Certificate to
the applicant or appellant whenever a Certificate of Occupancy is authorized by
the Board.
   ED. NOTE: The Board of Appeals is delegated the task of hearing appeals from
the decisions of the Zoning Administrator or other official charged with
enforcement of an ordinance passed pursuant to the Zoning Enabling Act. This
may, for example, entail determining whether there has been a discontinuance of
a nonconforming use. It is important for the applicant to note the appeal
process because of the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies
before suit is filed as well as the more obvious reason of using a less
expensive administrative process for correcting a mistake or error which may
have been made by the Zoning Administrator. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-13-3(D))
DIVISION III - VARIANCES
40-10-18   VARIANCES.
   A variance is a relaxation of the requirements of this Code that are
applicable to a particular lot, structure, or use. A so-called “use variance”
(which would allow a use that is neither permitted nor special in the district
in question) is not a variance, it is an amendment, and should be granted only
as provided for in Section
40-10-30.
40-10-19   APPLICATION.
   Every application for a variance shall be filed with the Administrator on a
prescribed form. Every variance application shall also be filed with the Soil
and Water Conservation District as per State law. The Administrator shall
promptly transmit said application, together with any device he might wish to
offer, to the Zoning Board of Appeals. The application shall contain sufficient
information to allow the Zoning Board of Appeals to make an informed decision
and shall include, at a minimum, the following:  (NOTE: Filing fee required.)
[See 70 ILCS Sec. 405/22.02(A)]
   (A)   Name and address of the applicant;
   (B)   Location of the structure/use for which the variance is sought;
   (C)   Brief description of adjacent lots, structures, and/or uses;
   (D)   Brief description of the problems/circumstances engendering the
variance request;
   (E)   Brief, but specific, explanation of the desired variance;
   (F)   Specific section(s) of this Code containing the regulations which, if
strictly applied, would cause a serious problem; and
   (G)   Any other pertinent information that the Administrator may require.
40-10-20   PUBLIC HEARING, NOTICE.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on each variance
request within sixty (60) days after the variance application is submitted to
them. At the hearing any interested party may appear and testify either in
person or by duly authorized agent or attorney. Notice indicating the time,
date, and place of the hearing, and the nature of the proposed variance shall
be given not more than thirty (30) nor less than fifteen (15) days before the
hearing;
   (A)   By certified mail to the applicant and
   (B)   By publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the
Municipality and,
   (C)   By first-class mail to all owners of property contiguous to the
property affected by the proposed variance.  (See 65 ILCS 5/11-13-7)
40-10-21   STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not grant any variance unless they find
that the proposed variance is consistent with the general purposes of this
Code, and that the strict application of the district requirements would result
in great practical difficulties of hardship to the applicant. More specifically
the Board shall not decide upon a variance unless they determine, based upon
the evidence presented to them, that:
   (A)   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if the
district regulations are strictly applied; and
   (B)   The plight of the applicant is due to peculiar circumstances not of
his own making;
   (C)   The variance, if granted, will not be detrimental to the public
health, safety, and welfare.
   (D)   The peculiar circumstances engendering the variance request are not
applicable to other property within the district, and therefore, that a
variance would be a more appropriate remedy than an amendment (rezoning); and
   (E)   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of
the area where the premises in question are located, nor materially frustrate
implementation of this Municipality’s comprehensive plan. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-13-
4)
40-10-22   DECISION BY BOARD OF APPEALS.
   The Zoning Board shall be required to submit an advisory report on all
applications within thirty (30) days after the final hearing thereon. A copy of
the Zoning Board’s report shall be transmitted to the applicant or appellant
and to the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Board shall specify the terms of
relief recommended (if any) in one statement and their findings of fact in
another statement. The findings of fact shall clearly indicate the Zoning
Board’s reasons for recommending or denying any requested variance.
40-10-23   ACTION BY VILLAGE BOARD.
   The Village Board shall act on every proposed variance at their next
regularly scheduled meeting following submission of the advisory report of the
Board of Appeals. Without further public hearing, the Village Board may approve
or disapprove any proposed variance by simply majority vote of all the members
then holding office. Such decision shall be binding upon the Zoning
Administrator and observed by him. He shall be required to incorporate the
terms and conditions of the same in the Zoning Certificate to the applicant or
appellant whenever a Certificate is authorized by the Zoning Board.
DIVISION IV - SPECIAL USES
40-10-24   SPECIAL-USE PERMITS.
   This Code divides the Village into various districts and permits in each
district as a matter of right only those uses which are clearly compatible with
one another. Certain other uses, because of their special operational or
physical characteristics, may or may not have a detrimental impact on nearby
permitted uses, depending upon their precise location, manner of operation and
other factors. Such "special uses" require careful case-by-case review and may
be allowed only after review and approval by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
40-10-25   APPLICATION.
   Every applicant for a special-use permit shall submit to the Zoning
Administrator in narrative and/or graphic form, the items of information
enumerated below. The Administrator shall promptly transmit the completed
application, together with any comments or recommendation he might have, to the
Zoning Board of Appeals for further consideration.  (NOTE: Filing fee required
in Section
40-9-7)
ITEMS OF INFORMATION:
   (A)   Name and address of the applicant;
   (B)   Name and address of the owner or operator of the proposed structure or
use, if different from (A);
   (C)   Nature of the proposed use, including type of activity, manner of
operation, number of occupants or employees, and similar matters;
   (D)   Location of the proposed use or structure, and its relationship to
existing uses of structures on adjacent lots;
   (E)   Area and dimensions of the site for the proposed structure or use;
   (F)   Existing topography of the site and proposed finished grade;
   (G)   Existing and proposed screening, landscaping, and erosion control
features on the site, including the parking area;

   (I)   Number and size of the proposed dwelling units, if any;

   (M)   Location of any signs.
40-10-26   PUBLIC HEARING, NOTICE.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on every special-use
permit application within sixty (60) days after the application is submitted to
them. At the hearing, any interested party may appear and testify, either in
person or by duly authorized agent or attorney. Notice indicating the time,
date, and place of the hearing, and the nature of the proposed special use
shall be given not more than thirty (30) days nor less than fifteen (15) days
before the hearing:

   (B)   By publication in a newspaper of general circulation within this
Municipality.
   (C)   By first-class mail to all owners of property contiguous to the
property affected by the proposed special-use request. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-13-7)
40-10-27   ADVISORY REPORT, FACTORS CONSIDERED.
   Within thirty (30) days after the public hearing, the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall reach a final decision. In deciding the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall consider the following factors:
   (A)   Whether the proposed design, location, and manner of operation of the
proposed special use will adequately protect the public health, safety, and
welfare, and the physical environment;
   (B)   Whether the proposed special use is consistent with this
Municipality’s comprehensive plan, if any:
   (C)   The effect the proposed special use would have on the value of
neighboring property and on this Municipality’s overall tax base;
   (D)   The effect the proposed special use would have on the public utilities
and on the traffic circulation on nearby streets; and
   (E)   Whether there are any facilities near the proposed special use (such
as schools or hospitals) that require special protection.
40-10-28   ACTION BY VILLAGE BOARD.
   The Village Board shall act on every request for a special-use permit at
their next regularly scheduled meeting following submission of the advisory
report by the Zoning Board of Appeals. Without further public hearing, the
Village Board may approve or disapprove a special-use permit by an ordinance
passed by simple majority vote of all members then holding office. In a
separate statement accompanying any such ordinance, the Village Board shall
state their findings of fact, and indicate their reasons for a special-use
permit. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-13-1)
40-10-29   TEMPORARY USE PERMITS: PROCEDURE FOR.
   As set forth at Section 40-3-18, requests for temporary use permits shall be

but may renew any such permit as they see fit.

interest. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-13-14)

Administrator on a prescribed form. Every amendment proposal shall also be
