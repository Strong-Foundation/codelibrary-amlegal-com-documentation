   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, a village official,
who is authorized to issue a citation/ticket for violations of this Code, may,
in lieu of filing a complaint in court in the first instance, issue the alleged
violator a compliance or P ticket, as may apply, for the following:
      (1)   A violation of any section of Title VII of this Code in relation to
which the violation can be rectified by correction of the violation alleged.

official directing the immediate cessation of the unlawful conduct or activity.
      (4)   No ticket shall be issued under this section for any offense under
the Illinois Vehicle Code, or similar offense, which is a traffic regulation

   (B)   Upon the issuance of a compliance or P ticket, the alleged violator

showing proof of the correction of the violation (i.e., replacement of the
faulty equipment, purchase of the required license or permit), if applicable,
within ten days from the date such alleged violation was committed, or by
paying to the village the sum of $100, subsequent to the ten-day period and
prior to 30 days from the date such alleged violation was committed, and
showing proof of the correction of the violation, if applicable.
   (C)   The tickets referred to in this section shall be issued as a courtesy

converted to a complaint, or a Uniform Traffic Complaint or Notice to Appear
will be issued for that violation, and that person shall be subject to the
general penalties set forth in this Code.

§ 30.28 PARTICIPATION IN MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE OR OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS.
   (A)   Findings. Public Act 94-1058, effective January 1, 2007, amends the
Open Meetings Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 120, §§ 1 et seq.) to allow municipalities
to adopt rules and procedures that permit appointed and elected members of
boards, commissions and committees to attend, participate and vote at open and
closed public meetings through the use of telephone conference calls or other
electronic means. The corporate authorities of the village find that it is in
the public interest to adopt a set of rules and procedures that allow appointed
and elected members of Village boards, commissions and committees to attend,
participate in and vote at open and closed public meetings through the use of
telephone conference calls or other electronic means (e.g., video or audio
conference).
   (B)   Definitions. The definitions of the terms “MEETING,” “PUBLIC BODY,”
“OTHER MEANS,” “QUORUM” or any other defined term used in this section, which
is also found in the Open Meetings Act, shall have the same definitions as
contained in the Open Meetings Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 120, SS 1 et seq.), as
amended.
   (C)   Rules and procedures.
      (1)   Village boards, committees and commissions must comply with all of
the applicable requirements of the Open Meetings Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 120, §§ 1
et seq.), as amended.
      (2)   Village boards, committees and commissions are prohibited from
establishing a quorum to conduct business at an open or closed meeting through
the attendance of board members by the use of telephone conference calls or
other electronic means. A quorum of members of a village board, commission or
committee must be physically present at the location of an open or closed
meeting.
      (3)   Village officials who wish to attend a meeting electronically must
give notice 48 hours before the commencement of the meeting to the recording
secretary or the Village Clerk (or Deputy Clerk), unless advance notice is
impractical.
      (4)   Meeting minutes must reflect whether a member is present physically
or electronically, regardless of whether any members are attending through the
use of a telephone conference call or other electronic means.
      (5)   Provided that the audio, telephone or video conference connection
allows the voice of an absent member to be clearly heard by the attendees of
the meeting (including the public) and the absent member can clearly hear the
voices of the attendees who participate in the meeting, a member of a village
board, committee or commission may attend, participate and vote at an open or
closed meeting through the use of a telephone conference call or other
electronic means if the member is prevented from physically attending because
of:
         (a)   Personal illness or disability;
         (b)   Employment purposes or the business of the public body; or
         (c)   A family or other emergency.
      (6)   Where one member of a village board, committee or commission is
attending the meeting by use of a telephone conference call or other electronic
means, the presiding officer shall, immediately after convening of the meeting,
announce to the public which member is attending the meeting by use of a
telephone conference call or other electronic means, identify the method of
attendance and the reason why the absent member is participating by such means.
      (7)   If the presiding officer attends the meeting through the use of a
telephone conference call or other electronic means, he or she shall vacate the
chair and may not act in his or her capacity as the presiding officer.
      (8)   The voice of the absent member participating by telephone
conference call or other electronic means, after being identified by the other
village board, committee or commission members as belonging to the absent
member, shall be simultaneously broadcast to the public present at the meeting
so that his or her voice can be heard, and the member shall also be able to
hear any discussions of the other members and the public comment regarding any
issue discussed at the meeting before a vote is taken.
      (9)   The reasons for which an absent member of a village board,
committee or commission may participate in a meeting by use of a telephone
conference call or other electronic means are limited to those reasons set
forth in division (C)(5) above, and do not include vacations or other personal
business. Any absent member participating in a meeting by use of a telephone
conference call or other electronic means shall publicly state the reason(s)
for his or her absence and the reason(s) shall be made part of the record of
the meeting.
      (10)   Only one member of the Village Board shall be allowed to
participate in any meeting by use of telephone conference call or other
electronic means at a time. Up to two members of any village committee or
commission, other than the Village Board, shall be allowed to participate in
any meeting by use of telephone conference call or other electronic means at a
time.
      (11)   No member of any village board, committee or commission shall be
allowed to participate in any meeting by telephone conference call or other
electronic means more than three times in a fiscal year, except for members of
the Village Board who are serving as non-voting liaison to a committee or
commission.
      (12)   All requests to remotely attend closed session meetings, including
those made pursuant to ILCS Ch. 5, Act 120, § 7(e), shall be included in the

designate in writing to the Village Treasurer what portion (or all) of his

designation to which program it should be paid into. Thereafter, the Village
Treasurer shall be entitled to make payments until that time as the Village
Treasurer receives a written direction from an elected official to either
increase or decrease the amount of the payment or to discontinue making the
payments entirely for that official. The Village Treasurer shall be entitled to
rely upon and act in accordance with any written designation or direction
received from time to time and the village and the Village Treasurer shall be

Benefit Cooperative or any other entity or agency as determined from time to
time by the village. The village shall pay the entire cost of the group term
life insurance for those elected officials, with the amount of the insurance to
be in the same amount as from time to time provided to the full-time employees
of the village through the village's group term life insurance program. This

conditions as may be required from time to time by the insurance carrier and
the Cooperative or other entity or agency providing the program.

in the IMRF, and is provided a greater death benefit through the IMRF based
upon their compensation with the village, or if such term life insurance
benefits provided under division (C) of this section are greater than the
amount referenced in this section, then no such additional life insurance
benefit shall be required, with the death benefits then being solely provided
pursuant to the IMRF or other term life insurance provided under division (C)
of this section. As applicable, the beneficiary, or beneficiaries, of said
insurance shall be designated by the elected official. This insurance shall be
subject to all restrictions and conditions as may be required from time to time
by the insurance provider, as applicable.
   (E)    The village will purchase additional indemnity insurance coverage for
elected officials to provide a maximum death benefit in the amount of $50,000
for any elected official of the village who dies while in the act of conducting
official village business. As applicable, the beneficiary or beneficiaries, of
said insurance shall be designated by the elected official. This insurance
benefit shall take into consideration the benefits herein provided under
divisions (C) or (D) of this section. Accordingly, the maximum combined death
benefit to be provided under divisions (C), (D), and (E) of this section, in
the case of a death of an elected official while conducting official village
business shall be in the amount of $50,000. This insurance shall be subject to
all restrictions and conditions as may be required from time to time by the
insurance provider, as applicable.
   (F)    The village maintains comprehensive health and medical insurance
plans on an annual basis for its employees. Each elected official of the
village may choose to participate in the village's health insurance plan
offerings. Any elected official who opts to obtain health insurance through the
village's plans shall pay 20% of the premium cost for such participation, with

(Ord. 2017-O-054, passed 9-5-17; Am. Ord. 2018-O-026, passed 5-1-18)
§ 35.06 SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Prohibition on sexual harassment. It is unlawful to harass a person
because of that person’s sex. The courts have determined that sexual harassment
is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of
1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in an environment
free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which
affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of
the Village of Tinley Park to prohibit harassment of any person by any
municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal agency or
office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal
agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or offices are prohibited
from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship
or lack thereof.
   (B)   Definition of sexual harassment.
      (1)   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in
the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
         (a)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or
any conduct of a sexual nature when:
            1.    Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment,
            2.    Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual
is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
            3.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      (2)   No co-worker, supervisor, department head, manager or village
official has the authority to require you to tolerate or agree to any conduct
that violates this policy in order to receive any job benefit.
      (3)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes (but is not
limited to):
         (a)   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor,
and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
         (b)   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, “catcalls”, “smacking”
or “kissing” noises.
         (c)   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
         (d)   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
         (e)    Textual/electronic: “sexting” (electronically sending messages
with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line
postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and
Twitter).
      (4)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a “reasonable person.”
   (C)   Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment.
      (1)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes
herself or himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the
incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her or
his position to the offending employee, and her or his department head, any
department head, Village Human Resources or the Village Manager. It is not
necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
      (2)   Any employee must report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
         (a)    Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her or his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
         (b)   Contact with supervisory personnel.
            1.   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to, a department head, the director of human
resources, or the Village Manager.
            2.   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
         (c)   Resolution outside municipality.
            1.   The purpose of this policy is to establish prompt, thorough
and effective procedures for responding to every report and incident so that
problems can be identified and remedied by the municipality. However, all
municipal employees have the right to contact the Illinois Department of Human
Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for
information regarding filing a formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR
complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is
a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must be filed within 300 days.
            2.    Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any
report (what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including,
but not limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
            3.   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted
and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. All
employees are expected and required to cooperate fully in the investigation
process. All matters will be treated with the utmost discretion and sensitivity
to the extent practicable without compromising the investigation.
      (3)   Allegations of sexual harassment made against an elected official
of the governmental unit by another elected official of a governmental unit. In
addition to the methods of reporting included above, an elected official may
request an independent review of a complaint of sexual harassment by another
elected official. The request shall be made to the Human Resources Director,
the Village Manager, or the chief elected official of the village. The official
receiving the request shall take immediate action in keeping with the
procurement process of the municipality to retain a qualified individual or
entity for the independent review of the allegations of sexual harassment in
violation of this policy. The outcome of the independent review shall be
reported to the Village Board of Trustees.
   (D)   Prohibition on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment
allegations.
      (1)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:
         (a)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy,
         (b)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy, or
         (c)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
      (2)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
      (3)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against provided a
report is made in good faith even if it is not substantiated. In addition, any
witness will be protected from retaliation.
      (4)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein,
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430 § 15-10)
provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs
in retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
         (a)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a
public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state
agency, or other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is
in violation of a law, rule, or regulation,
         (b)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state
employee, or
         (c)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
      (5)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (ILCS Ch.740, Act 174 § 15(a)),
an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in
a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or
committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause
to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal
law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an
employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency,
where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information
discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. (ILCS Ch.
740, Act 174 § 15(b)).
      (6)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (ILCS Ch. 775, Act 5 §
6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people
to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he or she has opposed that
which he or she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment
in employment, because he or she has made a charge, filed a complaint,
testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or
hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.
      (7)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge - due within 189 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of
the alleged retaliation.
   (E)   Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual harassment.
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the
prohibition on sexual harassment contained in ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430 § 5-65, may
be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or
discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency.
   (F)   Consequences for knowingly making a false report.
      (1)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
      (2)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a
state’s attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official
is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.
   (G)   This policy was drafted using the Illinois Department of Human Rights
Sexual Harassment Model Policy and has been modified to conform to Public Act
100-0554.

other similar real estate as well as any appurtenances thereon.

discretion, transfer money into the Fund from any other village funds

purchase of real property by the village, it being understood that from time to
time there may be insufficient amounts in the Fund for the purchase of a
particular property by the village and/or that the Corporate Authorities may
direct that an additional or different source(s) of funds be used for a
particular purchase or series of related purchases.
   (H)   In addition to the purchase price, any related costs, expenses, and/or
charges due to third parties associated with a purchase of real property by the

amounts be removed or transferred from the Fund for a purpose other than the
purchase of real property.

be at the direction of the Village Treasurer with the concurrence of the
Finance and Economic Development Committee pursuant to lawful authority from
the Corporate Authorities.

into the Fund pursuant to the village's existing investment policy and

this chapter at any time pursuant to a majority vote.

village to require disclosure by all officials and employees of private

providing services for which the recovery of costs is to be sought. Within 60
days of receiving an itemized statement of the expenses of providing services

   (B)   Upon a determination to assess costs made pursuant to this chapter,
the Village Treasurer shall submit an itemized invoice, by first class mail or

is responsible for the costs sought to be recovered hereunder the parties shall

§ 42.07 APPEALS TO VILLAGE MANAGER.
   (A)   Any responsible party who receives a statement of costs assessed
pursuant to this chapter may appeal any or all of the amount shown on the
statement by filing a written appeal with the Village Manager within 14
calendar days of the date of the statement of costs. The appeal must be
accompanied by a written explanation as to all of the reasons why the full
amount on the statement should not be charged to the person and why the
responsible party believes the costs assessed pursuant to this chapter should
be modified. Any reason, basis or argument for a modification of the assessed
costs not set forth in the written appeal shall be deemed waived by the
responsible party. Failure to file a written appeal within 14 days of the date
of the statement of assessed costs shall constitute a waiver of the responsible
party's right to appeal and to appear before the Village Manager.
   (B)   Upon receipt of an appeal, the Village Manager shall review the appeal
and schedule a hearing with the responsible party to discuss the appeal within
a reasonable time after receipt of the appeal.
   (C)   At the appeal hearing, the responsible party shall have the
opportunity to address the Village Manager regarding the written appeal and the
request that the village modify the assessed costs. The responsible party shall
be limited, in addressing the Village Manager, to those reasons and bases set
forth in the responsible party's written appeal and have the burden of proving,
by a preponderance of relevant facts, that the determination appealed from is
erroneous in whole or in part. The Village Treasurer and the department head
from the department from which the costs originated shall have the opportunity
to participate in the hearing and to address the Village Manager to explain the
process by which the assessed costs were determined and allocated. The Village
Manager, after hearing the responsible party and the Treasurer and department
head, shall review the assessed costs and make a final determination regarding
the costs assessed to the responsible party. The Village Manager shall
undertake such additional investigation or fact finding as he or she deems
necessary.
   (D)   On appeal of a determination of assessed costs, the Village Manager
shall, within a reasonable time, reverse, affirm or modify the determination
appealed from. If the Village Manager determines that the person is not liable
for any or all of the expense of the response or that the payment of the costs
will impose an undue hardship, the Village Manager may waive any or all of the
costs. The decision of the Village Manager shall be final when made. The
Village Treasurer shall then send a statement of assessed costs to the
responsible party, by first class mail, to the last known address of the
responsible party. The assessed costs shall be due and payable 30 days from the
date of that statement. If the responsible party fails to pay the assessed
costs within those 30 days, the village shall have available to it all remedies
available under division (E) below.
   (E)   If a statement of costs is not paid in full or appealed within 30 days
of the date of the statement, or paid in full within 30 days of the denial or
partial denial of an appeal, the village, to the extent allowed by applicable
law, may pursue any responsible party under one or more of the divisions below.
      (1)   The Village Manager may authorize the Village Attorney to commence
a civil action to recover the costs, plus a late payment penalty, as adopted by
the Village Board and listed in the Comprehensive Fee Schedule (Tinley Park
Code of Ordinances, Table of Special Ordinances,
Table XI), together with attorneys’ fees and any other costs allowed by law.
      (2)   The Village Treasurer may place the charges for collection with a
collection agency designated by the village.
      (3)   In cases where services have been rendered to real or personal
property in the village, or the owner of real or personal property in the
village, the charges shall constitute a lien on the property. The Village
Treasurer shall file or cause to be filed a notice of lien within two years
after such charges are incurred, which notice of lien shall be recorded with
the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds.
      (4)   Nothing in this section shall preclude the village from seeking to
collect any debt due the village through the use of any other administrative
procedure, collection action or court proceeding authorized by law.
   (F)   Any monies collected pursuant to this chapter shall be supplemental to
other methods of financing emergency responses, including but not limited to
budget appropriations, ad valorem taxation, grants, and other sources permitted
by law.

44.03   Health insurance benefits pending a final determination
   
44.04   Applicant election of alternate group insurance
§ 44.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide a fair and efficient method of
determining the eligibility of an employee for the benefits enumerated under
the Public Safety Employee Benefits Act (ILCS Ch. 820, Act 320, §§ 1 et seq.)
(PSEBA), as amended. All benefits provided public safety employees shall be
consistent with PSEBA, which provides basic group health insurance for an
injured employee, the injured employee's spouse, and for each dependent child
of the injured employee until the child reaches the age of 25 if the child
continues to be dependent for support or the child is a full-time or part-time
student and is dependent for support. In accordance with PSEBA, the benefits
ascribed herein are limited to group health insurance and do not include any
additional benefits the PSEBA applicant may have received as an employee of the
village, including, but not limited to dental or vision insurance. The village
has identified its BlueAdvantage HMO Plan as its basic group health plan. The
Village Manager retains the right to identify an alternative basic group health
plan as needed.
(Ord. 2016-O-054, passed 9-20-16)
§ 44.02 APPLICATION FORM, MEDICAL INFORMATION AND AFFIDAVIT.
   (A)   In conjunction with a request for PSEBA benefits, a public safety
employee, or his/her representative, shall file a completed, notarized
application for PSEBA benefits, waiver for relevant medical information, a
general waiver for relevant information and an affidavit for PSEBA coverage
with the Village Manager within 60 days of a Pension Board Duty Disability
determination. The application for PSEBA benefits shall include, but shall not
be limited to, a fully detailed statement of the nature of the employee's claim
giving full particulars thereof, i.e. date, time, place, nature of injury, and
any other factual circumstances surrounding the incident giving rise to said
claim. A copy of all required forms is attached hereto and incorporated herein.
The Village Manager is hereby authorized to modify aforementioned forms as
needed in accordance with Illinois law.
   (B)   Within 21 days after receipt of the aforesaid PSEBA application, the
Village Manager shall determine whether sufficient documentation has been
presented to warrant approval of the requested PSEBA benefit. Should the
Village Manager approve the PSEBA benefit, the Village Manager shall issue a
written decision which shall be deemed a final administrative decision under
the Administrative Review Law (ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 3-101 et seq.), as
amended. Should the Village Manager deny the request for PSEBA benefit, the
Village Manager shall issue a written decision to that effect. A copy of the
Village Manager's written decision shall be promptly served on the PSEBA
applicant by certified mail.
   (C)   Should the Village Manager determine additional information regarding
the circumstances surrounding the incident giving rise to the injury are
needed, he or she is hereby authorized to request additional information from
the PSEBA applicant within 21 days of receipt of an application. In doing so,
the Village Manager shall make a request for additional information in writing,
allowing a reasonable amount of time for the applicant to respond to such
requests and designating such deadline in the request. Should the Village
Manager request additional information, he or she will make a determination
regarding benefits within 15 days of receipt of the PSEBA applicant's
supplemental documentation.
(Ord. 2016-O-054, passed 9-20-16)
§ 44.03 HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS PENDING A FINAL DETERMINATION.
   Until a final unappealable determination of PSEBA eligibility has been made,
a public safety employee shall be entitled to maintain his/her prior health
insurance as a village employee. However, until a final, unappealable
determination of PSEBA eligibility has been made, a public safety employee, or
his/her representative, shall be responsible for the prompt payment of all
health insurance premiums as though the public safety employee was not eligible
for PSEBA benefits. Should the public safety employee be found to be eligible
for PSEBA benefits by virtue of a final, unappealable judicial determination,
the public safety employee, or his/her representative, shall be promptly
reimbursed by the village for any out-of-pocket health insurance premiums paid
from the date of the employee's catastrophic, PSEBA-related injury death or the
date of the Pension Board awarded line-of-duty disability pension.
(Ord. 2016-O-054, passed 9-20-16)
§ 44.04 APPLICANT ELECTION OF ALTERNATE GROUP INSURANCE.
   A PSEBA beneficiary retains the right to elect any group health plan
available to village employees. An election which incurs a premium cost above
the cost associated with the basic group health plan will require a
beneficiary, his or her spouse and/or dependents to remit the difference in
premium costs above the identified basic group plan to the village. The Village
Manager will inform the PSEBA beneficiary of the time and manner in which he or
she must remit premium payment in accordance with the village's contractual
agreements with its insurance providers.

   Mitigation Rate Notes
The mitigation rates above are average “billing levels” for one hour of service, and are
typical for the incident responses listed, however, when a claim is submitted, it may be
itemized and based on the actual services provided.
These average mitigation rates were determined by itemizing costs for a typical run (from the
time a fire apparatus leaves the station until it returns to the station) and are based on the
actual costs, using amortized schedules for apparatus (including useful life, equipment,
repairs, and maintenance) and labor rates (an average department’s “actual
personnel expense” and not just a firefighter’s basic wage). The actual personnel expense
includes costs such as wages, retirement, benefits, workers comp, insurance, etc.

   (B)   No person, firm, or corporation shall in any way use or take water for
private use from the village water system, or from any pipes or systems
connected therewith, whether located inside or outside the village limits,

      (1)   Any person, firm, or corporation desiring to use utilities supplied
by the village shall file a written application with the village.
      (2)   All applicants for utility service for tenant (non-owner) occupied
premises shall be required to make a deposit (“renter’s deposit”) as listed in
the Comprehensive Fee Schedule (Tinley Park Code of Ordinances, Table of

interest.
         (b)   The renter’s deposit shall be applied to the final utility bill
when the account is closed.

provided under §
50.026.

§ 50.024 EXCESS CHARGES DUE TO DEFECTIVE METER.
   If at any time a meter fails to register the quantity of water passing
through it, the quantity shall be determined and the charge made based on the
quantity registered during the corresponding periods of the previous years, or,
if applicable, then based upon 85 gallons per capita per day for a residential
user and a reasonable estimate based upon village experience for any non-
residential user. The customer shall be responsible for maintaining all pipes
and fixtures on the owned premises, and no credit will be given on excess meter
charges caused by leakage and waste on the customer's premises, whether known
or not.
§ 50.025 BILLING PROCEDURE; DUE DATE.
   (A)   All water furnished shall be charged and paid for as measured and

June 25). If this due date should fall on a day where the village office would
normally be closed (e.g., Saturday, Sunday, or a village recognized holiday),
the due date shall be extended to the next following business day on which the
village offices are open.
   (D)   If payment of the full amount of the bill is not made within the
required period, then an amount as listed in the Comprehensive Fee Schedule
(Tinley Park Code of Ordinances, Table of Special Ordinances,
Table XI) against the total amount of the current charges of the bill, not

§ 50.026 PARTIES LIABLE FOR PAYMENT.
   The owner of the premises being served, the occupant thereof, and the user
of the service, shall be jointly and severally liable to pay for the service to
those premises. Service is furnished to the premises by the village only upon
the condition that the owner of the premises, the occupants thereof and the
users of the service are jointly and severally liable to the village therefor.
§ 50.027 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OF PREMISES.
   In the event of a change in the ownership of premises receiving water
service, or a change in the tenancy of the premises where the new tenant is to
be charged for water service, the village shall be notified promptly and a new
application for water service made and signed. Otherwise, the water service
will be discontinued after notice and hearing in the same manner as provided in
§ 50.021 for discontinuing water service because of a lack of a certificate of
occupancy.
§ 50.028 DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS; SERVICE DISCONTINUATION; HEARING; LIEN.
   (A)   Delinquent accounts.
      (1)   In the event the charges for service are not paid within 30 days
after rendition of the bill for service, the charges shall be deemed
delinquent. A notice of discontinuation of service in the amount of the
delinquency shall be sent in writing to the utility customer on record. As
applicable, at the village’s discretion, a copy of the notice of
discontinuation of service may be sent to the taxpayer whose name appears on
the real estate tax bill for the parcel as the owner of the premises (also
known as “owner of record”), the occupant of the premises, and the user of the
service by U.S. Postal Service. Such notices should state that discontinuation
of service will occur within 72 hours of the date of delivery of the notice and
that delinquency could also create a lien against the property.
      (2)   In addition to such notice, the account shall be assessed a fee as
listed in the Comprehensive Fee Schedule (Tinley Park Code of Ordinances, Table
of Special Ordinances,
Table XI).
      (3)   In the case of buildings with three or more residential apartments,
notice of discontinuation of service shall also be provided to all tenants
pursuant to the provisions of the Rental Property Utility Service Act (ILCS Ch.
765, Act 735 § 0.01). In accordance with said Act, this notice shall contain
the following information:
         (a)   The specific date, no sooner than ten days after the notice is
rendered, that utility service is subject to termination;
         (b)   A statement of the tenants’ statutory right either (i) to pay
the utility company the amount due and owing by the landlord and to deduct the
amount paid to the utility company from the rent due on the rental agreement or
(ii) to petition the court for appointment of a receiver to collect the rents
due for use and occupancy of the building and remit a portion to the utility
company for payment of utility bills;
         (c)   The dollar amount of the utility bills due and owing on the date
such notice is given and the average monthly utility bill; and
         (d)   The name and telephone number of any legal services agency
within the utility company’s service area where the tenants may obtain free
legal assistance. Any notice provided to tenants of a building under this Act
shall be of a conspicuous size, on red paper, and in at least 14-point bold
face type, except that the words “notice of (utility service) termination”
shall be in 36-point bold face type if the notice is posted, and shall state:
            “It is unlawful for the landlord or his or her agent to alter,
deface, tamper with, or remove this notice. A landlord or his or her agent who
violates this provision is guilty of a Class C misdemeanor.”
   (B)   Service discontinuation.
      (1)   If an owner, tenant, or other user of village utility services
wishes to discontinue service, a final reading of the water meter must be
requested, and a final bill prepared. The consumption determined from the final
meter reading will be rounded up to the next whole billing unit as provided
under §§
50.023C,
51.094D, and
51.095B for purposes of computing the final bill. Said final bill must be paid
in full before service can be transferred into the name of a new owner, tenant,
or other user.
      (2)   In the case of a delinquent account (i.e., a past due balance on a
utility account), if the bill remains unpaid, and the owner, occupant or user
does not request a hearing within the time allowed under division (E), fails to
appear for a scheduled hearing, does not successfully dispute the bill at the
hearing, or come to a settlement in relation to the bill, such utility service
shall be disconnected at the village’s convenience.
   (C)   Lien. If the amounts owed remains unpaid, and the owner, occupant or
user does not request a hearing within the time allowed under division (E),
fails to appear for a scheduled hearing, does not successfully dispute the bill
at the hearing, or come to a settlement in relation to the bill, a notice of
lien may be prepared consisting of a sworn statement setting out a description
of the real estate upon or for which service was supplied, the amounts of
moneys due, and the date or dates when the amounts became delinquent.
      (1)   A copy of the notice of lien shall be sent to the taxpayer whose
name appears on the real estate tax bill for the parcel as the owner of the
premises (also known as the “owner of record”) and shall be recorded by the
village in the office of the County Recorder in the county in which the
property is located. In all cases where a lien, or a release the lien, has been
recorded, a fee shall be charged in addition to the delinquent and any current
charges, including such additional charges as provided under this section, §§
50.029,
50.030 or
50.056, as listed in the Comprehensive Fee Schedule (Tinley Park Code of
Ordinances, Table of Special Ordinances,
Table XI) in addition to the recording fees charged by the county. Each
recorded document (e.g., lien or lien release) will incur a separate fee.
      (2)   Property subject to a lien for unpaid utility charges may be sold
for nonpayment of same at the discretion of the village. The proceeds of the
sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting the costs, as is the
case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. A foreclosure shall be by bill in
equity in the name of the village. When directed by the President and Board of
Trustees of the village, the Village Attorney is authorized and directed to
institute proceedings in a civil action in the name of the village in any court
having jurisdiction of such matters, to recover the money due for services
rendered plus reasonable attorneys’ fees as provided under §
50.030. Judgment in such a civil action shall operate as a release and waiver
of the lien for the amount of the judgment.
   (D)   Purchasers of a property which has accumulated and outstanding unpaid
charges for utility services are liable, as subsequent owners of the property,
for the unpaid charges, plus any fees or fines related thereto. Future utility
service will be denied if said amounts are not paid upon purchase, and/or the
village may act to foreclose any utility lien filed against the property as
provided in this section.
   (E)   Hearing.
      (1)   The owner, occupant, or user of village utility services has an
opportunity to dispute or discuss a utility bill, or delinquent account by
requesting a hearing prior to the date that discontinuation of service will
occur as provided in the notice of discontinuation issued under this section.
      (2)   Upon receipt of said request, a hearing will be scheduled before
the Village Manager, or designee, prior to discontinuation of service.
      (3)   The village may, at its discretion, provide the owner, occupant, or
user an opportunity to come to a settlement in relation to the amounts owed.

including all additional charges thereon, are paid in full.
   (B)   A delinquency processing fee (also known as a reinstatement of service
fee) as listed in the Comprehensive Fee Schedule (Tinley Park Code of
Ordinances, Table of Special Ordinances,
Table XI) shall be imposed against a utility account where payment the
delinquent amounts owed has not been received by the deadline provided under §
50.028(A).

§ 50.076 EXTENSIONS; SERVICE OUTSIDE CORPORATE LIMITS.
   (A)    Before any extension to the existing water main supply system is
installed other than extensions constructed by the village itself, detailed
plans and specifications of the proposed work shall be submitted to the
Director of Public Works and the Village Engineer for their approval. When
approved, the work shall be carried on strictly in accordance with the
submitted plans and specifications under the general supervision of the
Director. No change in the plans will be permitted without the express written
approval in advance by the Director. Anyone installing any such extension shall
give prior written approval to the provisions of division (B) below.
   (B)    All extensions to the village water main supply system hereafter made
shall become the property of the village immediately upon installation without
regard to who may have paid for the cost of installation.
   (C)    Anyone who may hereafter construct water supply mains outside the
village limits which become a part of the water distribution system of the
village, shall maintain at their expense the mains so constructed to keep them
in good operating condition for a period of five years after installation. To
guarantee this maintenance, a person shall furnish a surety bond or other
security acceptable to the village, approved by the village, in the amount
specified by the village, but not less than $5,000, and conditioned upon the
village being reimbursed for or the person paying all expenses incurred in
maintenance of these mains. After the five-year period has expired, the village
will assume full maintenance of the mains, and the bond or other security will
be cancelled. Failure to keep a bond or other security in full force for the
period required shall be sufficient cause to shut off the water, after notice
and an opportunity for a hearing as provided in §

drawings of the water main and all appurtenances with sufficient detail to
satisfy the Director of Public Works. This shall be accompanied by the
certificate of the designing engineer, certifying the correctness of the as-
built drawings.
   (E)    Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as giving any person,
firm, or corporation a vested right to water service or to the continuance of
water service to any property outside the village limits. The President and
Board of Trustees reserve the right to deny, consistent with law, any
application for an extension of the village water supply mains or for the
furnishing of water to any property outside of the village from existing mains
if it deems such denial in the interest of the public welfare, or if such
extension of water service creates an unreasonable demand upon the water
system.
Penalty, see § 50.999
§ 50.077 PRIVATE AGREEMENTS.
   Private agreements to contribute to the cost of a water main installation by
a subsequent customer are permissible, but the village shall assume no
responsibility for the enforcement of any agreements. No property located
outside the village limits will be allowed to connect to a water supply main
unless otherwise agreed to by the President and Board of Trustees. The
foregoing rules shall not apply to contracts or agreements previously entered
into by the village which may be in conflict therewith, except as those
agreements may hereafter be modified. Nor shall any rules or other provisions
of this chapter be construed to imply a grant or right to anyone outside the
village limits to connect to the village's water system.
CONSTRUCTION AND CONNECTIONS
§ 50.090 CONNECTION PERMIT REQUIRED.
   All applications to connect service pipes with the village supply mains, for
the installation of water meters, or for any other use of the village water
supply as may now or hereafter be authorized, shall be filed with the Director
of Public Works, who shall issue all permits therefor upon forms provided for
that purpose. However, no permit shall be issued by the Director until all fees
for same, as provided in this chapter, shall have been paid to the village and
a receipt issued. No permit will be issued to any plumber who has not fully
complied with all regulations of the village concerning plumbing.
Penalty, see § 50.999

§ 50.093 USE OF WATER DURING CONSTRUCTION; FEES.
   Whenever a building permit is issued, the minimum water service charge shall
be paid, in addition to the building permit fee, to the village for each three-
month period while the building is under construction and before the permanent
water meter is installed and protected from freezing to cover the cost of
unmetered water used during the construction period and anticipated use in the
building prior to installation of the permanent meter. If, in the opinion of
the Director of Public Works, the use of water during the construction period
may be excessive, the Director may require the installation at the owner's
expense of a temporary outside meter to measure water used, which shall then be
paid for at the regular metered water rates.
§ 50.094 TURNING ON WATER.
   No plumber or other person shall turn on the supply of water to any building
or premises prior to the installation of a meter on all service lines
installed, or shall allow the same to be done, without a permit from the
Director of Public Works. However, this section shall not be construed to
prevent plumbers from turning on water to test the piping and fixtures and to
provide water for construction purposes, in which case the plumber shall turn
off the water as soon as these needs are met.
Penalty, see § 50.999
§ 50.095 WATER MAINS: HORIZONTAL SEPARATION.
   (A)   A water main shall be laid at least ten feet horizontally from any
existing or proposed drain or sewer line. However, should local conditions
prevail which would prevent a lateral separation of ten feet, a water main may
be laid closer than ten feet to, or in the same trench as a storm or sanitary
sewer provided the main is laid in a separate trench or on an undisturbed earth
shelf located to one side of the sewer and at such an elevation that the bottom
of the water main is at least 18 inches above the top of the sewer.
   (B)   If it is impossible to obtain proper horizontal and vertical
separation as stipulated in this section and §
50.096, both the water main and sewer shall be constructed of mechanical-joint,
ductile-iron pipe and shall be pressure-tested to assure watertightness before
backfilling.
(Ord. 2013-O-036, passed 8-20-13)
§ 50.096 WATER MAINS: VERTICAL SEPARATION.
   (A)   Whenever water mains must cross house sewers, storm drains, or
sanitary sewers, the water main shall be laid at such an elevation that the
bottom of the water main is 18 inches above the top of the drain or sewer. This
vertical separation shall be maintained for that portion of the water main
located within ten feet, horizontally, of any sewer or drain crossed, this ten
feet to be measured as the normal distance from the water main to the drain or
sewer.
   (B)   However, where conditions exist such that the minimum vertical
separation set forth in division (A) cannot be maintained, or it is necessary
for the water main to pass under a sewer or drain, the water main shall be laid
with mechanical-joint, ductile-iron pipe; and the mechanical-joint pipe shall
extend on each side of the crossing until the normal distance from the water
main to the sewer or drain line is at least ten feet. Where a water main must
cross under a sewer, a vertical separation of 18 inches between the bottom of
the sewer and the top of the water main shall be maintained, along with means
to support the larger-sized sewer lines to prevent their settling and breaking
the water main.
(Ord. 2013-O-036, passed 8-20-13)
§ 50.097 WATER SERVICE LINES.
   The horizontal and vertical separation between water service lines and all
sanitary sewers, storm sewers, or any drain shall be the same as for water
mains, as detailed in §§
50.095 and
50.096 above. However, when minimum horizontal and vertical separation cannot
be maintained, brass, or copper, in addition to mechanical-joint, ductile-iron
pipe, may be used for water service lines.
(Ord. 2013-O-036, passed 8-20-13)
REPAIRS; MAINTENANCE
§ 50.110 PERMIT REQUIRED FOR REPAIRS.
   No water service line or connection shall be repaired or altered without
first securing a permit from the Director of Public Works.
Penalty, see § 50.999
§ 50.111 REPAIRS REQUIRING STREET OPENING.
   (A)    Before opening any street for the construction or repair of any
supply main or service line, a permit must first be obtained from the Director
of Public Works. This permit requirement shall be waived for any work done by
contract with the village or by authorized village employees.
   (B)    Any street opening made for installation or repair of village supply
lines or service lines shall be repaired in accordance with the applicable
provisions of all village ordinances. All user service lines shall be augered
if crossing pavements maintained by the village.
Penalty, see § 50.999
§ 50.112 MAINTENANCE OF SERVICE LINES.
   It shall be the responsibility of the customer to maintain the entire length
of the customer's service line from its connection with the curb stop.
Penalty, see § 50.999
§ 50.113 MAINTENANCE OF PIPES AND FIXTURES.
   It shall be the responsibility of the owner of a building or premises to
maintain all water piping and fixtures on the owner's property in good repair
and free from leakage of water. In case of leakage or faulty plumbing resulting
in unnecessary waste of water, the owner shall make necessary repairs promptly
on notice from the Director of Public Works. On failure to do so within the
time specified, the water supply will be discontinued until such repairs are
made and approved, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in the same
manner as provided for in §
50.021.
Penalty, see § 50.999
ADMINISTRATION
§ 50.125 DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS.
   The system of water mains and pipes, pumping station, wells, reservoirs,
grounds, buildings, and appurtenances shall be under the administrative control
of the Director of Public Works. When any action herein is to be taken by the
Director, this action may also be taken by the Director's duly authorized agent
or agents.
§ 50.126 INSPECTIONS.
   The Director of Public Works and his agents or representatives shall have
free access during all reasonable hours, in accordance with law, to all parts
of any building or premises on or in which village water is delivered or
consumed, in order to examine the pipes and fixtures to ascertain whether there
is any unnecessary waste. If access is refused, the supply of water may be shut
off after notice and an opportunity for a hearing as provided in §
50.021.
§ 50.998 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE FOR VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Whenever two or more properties are already supplied by one existing
service line, the failure on the part of any party owning, residing on, or
otherwise occupying any of the properties to comply with the provisions of this
chapter, or if the single service line becomes unserviceable, shall be
sufficient grounds for the Water Superintendent to discontinue utility
services, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing as provided in §
50.028, and without any liability whatsoever to any one or all parties.
   (B)   The President and Board of Trustees reserve the right to discontinue
the supply of utility services to any customer for a violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter after notice and an opportunity for hearing as
provided in §
50.028, and not to restore service until the violation has been corrected and

(Ord. 83-0-028, passed 7-19-83)
§ 51.061 CONTROL MANHOLE.
   (A)   Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole and, when
required by the village or MWRD, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with those necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. A manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located, and
shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the village and MWRD.
The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be
maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (B)   (1)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the village or MSDGC.
      (2)   The number, type, and frequency of laboratory analyses to be
performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the village and MWRD, but no
less than once per year the industry must supply a complete analysis of the
constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the
federal, state, and local standards are being met. The owner shall report the
results of measurements and laboratory analyses to the village and MWRD at
those times and in a manner as prescribed by the village. The owner shall bear
the expense of all measurements, analyses, and reporting required by the
village or MWRD. At those times as deemed necessary, the village or MWRD
reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside
laboratory service.
   (C)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater", published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH's are determined from periodic
grab samples.)

RETENTION OF STORMWATER
§ 51.075 RETENTION OF STORMWATER IN CENTRAL DETENTION FACILITIES REQU IRED;
EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)    No sewerage system permit of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation
District of Greater Chicago will be approved by the village unless the permit
shall provide for the retention of stormwater in the area covered by the permit
in a central basin as provided for herein.
   (B)   The President and Board of Trustees of the village recognize that in
certain circumstances it may not be feasible for an applicant for a sewer
permit to retain its stormwater in a central basin. In those circumstances an
exception may be granted by the President and Board of Trustees after
recommendation to it by the Village Engineer, to an applicant for a
Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago sewerage system
permit, when any one or more of the following circumstances warrants an
exception:
      (1)    Where the uniqueness of the land as it relates to topographical,
geological, and geographical considerations warrant an exception.
      (2)    Where the nature of the development, whether it be single-family,
multi-family, commercial, or industrial, and recognized engineering standards,
would warrant an exception.
      (3)    Where the timeliness of the development as it relates to other
development in the area and the overall status of the central basin program
warrants an exception.
      (4)    In the event an exception shall be granted by the village for any
one or more of the foregoing reasons, then the applicant shall provide for the
retention of stormwater runoff as heretofore established for wet central basin.
   (C)    The President and Board of Trustees may grant an exception in favor
of dry retention, only after recommendation by the Village Engineer and only
when one or more of the following factors are present:
      (1)    The natural rate of flow-through from upstream would not support a
wet pond.
      (2)    When the ecological balance of the pond, such as the quality of
the water to maintain plant and fish life, is that the quality of water could
not reasonably be maintained.
      (3)    When the nature of the recreational needs of the area dictates a
dry pond.
      (4)    When the aesthetic considerations as they pertain to the
surrounding development dictate a dry pond.

Penalty, see § 51.999
§ 51.076 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR CENTRAL RETENTION FACILITIES.
   The central retention facilities shall meet the following minimum criteria:
   (A)    A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff
is required for all nonresidential developments exceeding five acres in area,
for all residential developments exceeding ten acres in area and for all
residential developments between five and ten acres which have an impervious
area of 60% or greater. However, a residential development of ten acres or less
must have an adequate outlet as signified on the permit by the Village
Engineer. If the outlet is not adequate, then detention, as determined by the
Village Engineer, will be required to store that portion of the runoff
exceeding the outlet capacity.
   (B)    (1)    The release rate of storm-water from all developments
requiring detention shall not exceed the storm- water runoff rate from the area
in its natural undeveloped state. Because of the flat conditions of the land in
this area, channel configurations cut by nature are generally unable to handle
the runoff from high intensity rainfalls and results in flood plain storage or
spreading of runoff over the land areas during the larger storm periods. In
order not to increase the runoff from those areas after development, the
release rate must be limited to the carrying capacity of these natural
channels. The village will accept the release rate of not greater than that
calculated from a storm of three-year frequency with a runoff rate coefficient
of 0.15, unless the applicant can show by his detail calculations, which are
acceptable by the village, that the discharge rate of the natural outlet
channel serving the area is greater.
      (2)    Channels, road crossings, and other conveyance systems that
connect new developments with central retention facilities that require
improvement must be incorporated into the overall design. Calculations and
drawings showing the proposed improvements are to be submitted for approval of
the Village Engineer.
   (C)    Drainage systems shall have adequate capacity to bypass through the
development the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of design frequency of
ten years assuming that the land is in a fully developed state under present
zoning or zoning proposed under the Comprehensive Plan. The bypass flow rate
shall be computed utilizing a runoff coefficient of not less than 0.35. An
allowance will be made for upstream detention when such upstream detention and
release rate has previously been approved by the village and that evidence of
its construction can be shown.
   (D)    The live detention storage to be provided will be calculated on the
basis of the 100-year frequency rainfall as published by the U.S. Weather
Bureau for this area. The detention volume required will be that necessary to
handle the runoff of a 100-year rainfall, for any and all durations, from the
fully developed drainage area tributary to the reservoir, less that volume
discharged during the same duration at the approved release rate.
   (E)    Construction, filling or other similar physical occupation of the
flood plain, may be permitted if adequate compensatory storage volume is
provided.

§ 51.077 SUBMISSION OF CALCULATIONS, DRAWINGS REQUIRED BEFORE PERMIT APPROVED.
   Before any Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago
sewerage system permit is approved by the village, the applicant therefore,
shall submit to the village calculations and detailed drawings of the
stormwater retention facilities. The drawings must include topography, size,
capacity, slope of banks, soil borings, type of landscaping, inlets, outlet
control, and other pertinent data. In the event the Village Engineer determines
that there is unsuitable soil in pond areas, and so recommends to the Village
Board, then the Village Board shall require the applicant to remove the
undesirable soil as a condition of the applicant's development and relocate the
same as shall be approved by the Village Board on the advice of the Village
Engineer.

   After recommendation by the Village Engineer to the Village Board of
Trustees, that oversizing of any retention structure is required of an
applicant for a permit, then and in that event, the applicant shall be entitled
to a recapture of his cost for oversizing to benefit other property. Details of
the agreement shall be determined by the President and Board of Trustees based
on the recommendation of the Village Engineer and as provided by law.

§ 51.094B WASTEWATER COLLECTION SERVICES — MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.
   The basic wastewater collection charge shall be based on water usage as
recorded by water meters. The volume of flow used for computing basic user
charges shall be the same as determined for the purposes of metered water
consumption.
   (A)   If a person, business, or other entity who is discharging wastes into
the village public sanitary sewers procures any part, or all, of their water
from sources other than the village's water system, all or a part of which is
discharged into the public sewers, the party shall install and maintain, at
their expense, additional water meters of a type approved by the village for
the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from the other sources.
   (B)   Devices for measuring the volume of wastewater discharged may be
required by the village if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from
metered water consumption.
      (1)   Such metering devices for determining the volume of wastewater
shall be in accordance with village specifications for this purpose. Such
devices shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the party receiving
wastewater collection services. Following approval and installation, the meters
may not be removed without the consent of the village unless service is
cancelled.
      (2)   If an accurate determination of wastewater generated and entering
the village’s wastewater collection system facilities can be made by the
village’s Public Works Department, or the owner or occupant of the property, by
means of actual sewerage flow monitoring and or metering, then the wastewater
collection charge shall be based on the number of gallons of wastewater
produced for the billing period in 1,000-gallon increments. Any fractional
billing increment shall be rounded up to the next billing unit.
   (C)   If the user can prove through additional metering devices approved by
the village, and installed at the user’s expense, that a portion of the water
used is not entering the wastewater collection system, such usage shall be
excluded from the wastewater collection service charges.
   (D)   Non metered users. All non-metered users of the wastewater collection
system facilities (a sanitary sewer connection only, without a corresponding
water service connection) shall have a measurement of wastewater flow imputed
for purposes of computing the wastewater collection service charge if
measurement of wastewater flow is not otherwise determined by measurement as
identified in division (A)(2) of this section.
      (1)   Imputed residential per person usage.
         (a)   In the case of a residential dwelling unit, the amount of
wastewater generated per person shall be imputed to be 3,000 gallons per month
(based on United States Geological Survey statistics regarding the typical
gallons of domestic consumption of water per person, per day). This imputed
usage rate shall be multiplied times the number of occupants of the dwelling
unit and the number of months in the billing period.
         (b)   The resident or owner of the dwelling unit shall be required to
provide an accurate number of occupants of the home for such billing purposes
at least on an annual basis.
         (c)   If the number of occupants cannot be reasonably determined, a
minimum residential per person charge shall be computed using three occupants
(based on United States Census Bureau statistics of local population in
relation to units of housing).
      (2)   Imputed non-residential per person usage.
         (a)   If an accurate determination of wastewater generated and
entering the village’s wastewater collection system facilities cannot be
determined by measurement, then the additional charge shall be calculated by
means of the actual, or average (in the case where occupancy fluctuates from
day to day) number of occupants of said property for the billing period,
following the per person formula provided under division (A)(4)(a)1. of this
section.
         (b)   For non-residential properties where non-metered use of the
wastewater collection system facilities (sanitary sewer connection only,
without corresponding water service connection) is provided, and neither
wastewater produced can be determined as provided under division (A)(2) of this
section, or the number of actual or average occupants as provided under
division (A)(4)(a)1. of this section can reasonably be determined, the
additional charge shall be based on ten residential per person charges as
provided under division (A)(4)(a)1. of this section.

§ 51.096 SEWER TREATMENT CHARGES.
   (A)   All property located in Frankfort Township, Will County, either within
the corporate limits of the village, or otherwise connected to the village’s
wastewater collection systems is subject to a wastewater or sewer treatment
charge for treatment and disposal of sewerage wastes (also known as “water
reclamation”).
   (B)   The computed sewer treatment charges are in addition to the charges
set forth in §§
51.094A through
51.094D,
51.095A and
51.095B.
   (C)   The amount of the wastewater treatment charges provided under this
section shall be presented separately on the utility bill from any other
charges contained therein.
   (D)   Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Chicago Service Area.
      (1)   For that portion of the village which lies within Frankfort
Township, Will County and within the wastewater service area under an agreement
between the village and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater
Chicago (formerly the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago,
hereinafter “MWRD”), an amount shall be charged for wastewater treatment
services and computed under the formula provided within the agreement as
follows:
         (a)   The most currently available equalized assessed valuation for
the property at the time the utility bill is being rendered shall be multiplied
by the most recent available real estate tax rate of the MWRD for property
within its district boundaries (primarily in Cook County) and the result
thereof shall be multiplied by 140% to obtain the annual wastewater treatment
charge for such property.
         (b)   This amount shall be divided by 12, and the applicable number of
months corresponding to the utility billing cycle shall be added to each
utility bill rendered, (e.g., if a bi-monthly billing cycle is used, two months
shall be added; if a quarterly billing cycle is used, three months shall be
added.)
         (c)   Each year, as a new equalized assessed valuation becomes
available for the subject property and a new tax rate becomes available for the
MWRD, the amount of such user charge shall be recomputed utilizing such new
equalized assessed valuation and tax rate and shall apply to the subsequent
utility bills rendered.
         (d)   If the sewer treatment fee computed for one sewer treatment
service year under the agreement has not been wholly recouped from the property
prior to the computation of the next sewer treatment service year, the
remaining sewer treatment service fee will be added to the next available
billing period in addition to the pro-rata share of the new year’s sewer
treatment service fee.
      (2)   This sewer treatment charge is applicable to all properties which
lie within the corporate limits of the Village in Frankfort Township, Will
County and within the designated wastewater service area under an agreement
between the village and the MWRD regardless of whether the property is vacant
land or otherwise developed in any manner (i.e., if the property is subject to
a property tax bill, the property is also subject to the sewer treatment charge
under this section).
      (3)   From time to time, a property owner may have had cause to appeal
the valuation of property for property tax purposes, or have a property tax
billing error corrected that affects the property’s equalized assessed
valuation for a tax year, and which may have resulted in the recalculation of
the related annual property tax bill. Should a property valuation (equalized
assessed valuation) for a given tax year be reduced, the village utility
customer may be eligible for a reduction in the related sewer treatment charge
which is based on the equalized assessed valuation.
         (a)   The recalculation of an annual sewer treatment charge under this
section due to a subsequent adjustment to equalized assessed valuation will not
occur automatically as the village is not notified of such changes as they
occur. It is solely the property owner’s responsibility to notify the village
of such changes to initiate the recalculation of the annual sewer treatment
charges.
         (b)   The property owner must provide the village with valid and
legible documentation of the revised or adjusted equalized assessed valuation.
Upon verification and validation of the information provided, the calculation
of the revised annual sewer treatment charges based on that tax year’s adjusted
equalized assessed valuation can be performed.
         (c)   Any such adjustment reducing the sewer treatment charge will be
provided as a credit against the current and/or future utility bills.
   (E)   Village of Frankfort Service Area.
      (1)   This sewer treatment charge is applicable to all properties which
lie within Frankfort Township, Will County and within the wastewater Facility
Planning Area of the Village of Frankfort (hereinafter “Frankfort”).
      (2)   Under an agreement between the Village and Frankfort, an amount
shall be charged for wastewater treatment services and computed as follows:
The amount of water consumption billed under §
50.023C times the Village of Frankfort basic user charge rate per 1,000 gallons
in effect on the date the bill is being rendered.
   (F)   Illinois-American Water Company Service Area.
      (1)   This sewer treatment charge is applicable to all properties which
lie within Frankfort Township, Will County and within the wastewater Facility
Planning Area of the Illinois-American Water Company (formerly known as
Citizens Utilities Company of Illinois, hereinafter “IAW”).
      (2)   For that portion of the village which lies within Frankfort
Township, Will County and within the wastewater service area under an agreement
between the village and IAW, an amount shall be charged for wastewater
treatment services and computed as follows:
         (a)   The difference between the IAW “Collection and Treatment
Service” and “Collection Service” rates from the most recent tariff rate
schedule approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission then in effect during the
billing period shall be used to compute the wastewater treatment charges.
         (b)   It is recognized and acknowledged that the terms “Collection and
Treatment Service” and “Collection Service” may change from time to time in
relation to the IAW tariff schedules. These terms shall also cover such other
terminology that may be used to distinguish between the charges applicable to
sewer collection and sewer treatment such that the charges applicable to sewer
treatment alone can be separately determined.
         (c)   Such charges may include both fixed and volumetric (consumption)
based rates as may be included in the Illinois Commerce Commission approved
tariff schedules in effect during the village billing period. The current IAW
rate structure of the tariff schedules is based on monthly billing. The
computation of the applicable wastewater treatment charges herein shall be
adjusted to correspond with the village billing cycle in effect when the
utility bill is rendered.

determination that the bidder is not a responsible bidder.
      The submission requirements also apply to all subcontractors, except that
the successful bidder shall submit all subcontractor submissions to the Village
of Tinley Park prior to the subcontractor commencing work on the project.
Failure of a subcontractor to submit the required information shall disqualify

comply with this requirement is grounds for the contractor to be deemed a non-
responsible bidder.

   (B)   The submission requirements also apply to all subcontractors, except
that the contractor shall submit all subcontractor submissions to the village
prior to the subcontractor commencing work on the project. Failure of a
subcontractor to submit the required information shall not disqualify the
successful bidder from performing work on the project and shall not constitute
a contractual default and/or breach by the successful bidder. However, the
village may withhold all payments otherwise due for work performed by a
subcontractor, until the subcontractor submits the required information and the
village approves such information. Further, where the village deems necessary,
the village may also require that the successful bidder remove the
subcontractor from the project and replace it with a responsive and responsible
subcontractor.

in combination, only the colors green, red, and yellow shall be used, except
for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)    Green indication.
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is
exhibited.
      (2)    Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of- way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)    Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as
provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 § 11-307, pedestrians facing any green signal,
except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the
roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (B)    Steady yellow indication.
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or
that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter.
      (2)    Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in
ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 § 11-307, are thereby advised that there is insufficient
time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian
shall then start to cross the roadway.
   (C)    Steady red indication.
      (1)    Except as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly
marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such
crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing
until an indication to proceed is shown.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, vehicular
traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to
make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection
to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a clearly marked
stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on
the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such crosswalk, then
before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication
permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is shown.
      (3)    Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and local
authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit
any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously
enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street
into a one-way street, after stopping as required by division (C)(1) or (C)(2)
of this section. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any
vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to
constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or
within the intersection or junction of roadways. Such driver shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.
      (4)    Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 § 11-307, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or red arrow signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
   (D)    In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can
have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made or, in the absence of
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (E)    The motorman of any streetcar shall obey the above signals as
applicable to vehicles.

§ 72.001 SPEED LIMITS.
   (A)   No vehicle may be driven upon any highway of this village at a speed
which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic
conditions and the use of the highway, or which endangers the safety of any
person or property. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the
applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to
decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching
and going around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when traveling upon any
narrow or winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists with respect to
pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions.
Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person
or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and
the duty of all persons to use due care.
   (B)   No person may drive a vehicle upon any street at a speed which is
greater than the applicable statutory maximum speed limit established by
division (C) below, by §
72.002, or by a regulation or ordinance made under this chapter.
   (C)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit in an urban district for all vehicles is:

children are present.
      (4)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the use of electronic speed-
detecting devices within 500 feet of signs within a special school speed zone

a highway construction or maintenance speed zone special speed limit sign.
         (b)   Highway construction or maintenance speed zone special speed
limit signs shall be of a design approved by the Department. The signs must
give proper due warning that a construction or maintenance speed zone is being
approached and must indicate the maximum speed limit in effect. The signs must
also state the amount of the minimum fine for a violation.
      (4)   A first violation of division (B) of this section is a petty
offense with a minimum fine of $250. A second or subsequent violation of
division (B) of this section is a petty offense with a minimum fine of $750.

warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train;
      (2)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagman gives or continues to
give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train;
      (3)   A railroad train approaching a highway crossing emits a warning
signal and the train, by reason of its speed or nearness to the crossing, is an
immediate hazard;
      (4)   An approaching railroad train is plainly visible and is in
hazardous proximity to the crossing;
      (5)   A railroad train is approaching so closely that an immediate hazard

authorized holder of the disability license plate or parking decal or device or
is not transporting the authorized holder of the disability license plate or
parking decal or device to or from the parking location, and the person uses
the disability license plate or parking decal or device to exercise any
privileges granted through the disability license plate or parking decals or
devices under this code.
      (3)   It shall not be a defense to a charge under this section that
either the sign posted pursuant to this section of the intended accessible
parking place does not comply with the technical requirements of ILCS Ch. 625,
Act 5 § 11-301, Illinois Department of Transportation regulations, or
regulations of the village, of a reasonable person would be made aware by the
sign or notice on or near the parking place that the place is reserved for a
person with disabilities.
   (B)   Any person or local authority owning or operating any public or
private off- street parking facility may, after notifying the Police
Department, remove or cause to be removed to the nearest garage or other place

§ 80.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide a fair and efficient method
of enforcement of the village's regulations through administrative adjudication
of charges of non-vehicular violations of this Code. All provisions of this
Code may be enforced through the administrative adjudication system, provided
the system shall have no authority to impose a penalty of incarceration or
adjudicate an offense under the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code, which is a traffic
regulation governing moving vehicles, or to impose a fine in excess of $50,000.
The village reserves its right to employ all other means and methods available
under the law to enforce this Code, including direct application to the courts.
   (B)   PA 90-0516 to be found at Section 1-2.1-2 of the Illinois Municipal
Code, ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 1-2.1-2, allows home rule municipalities to provide
by ordinance for a system of administrative adjudication of municipal code
violations to the extent permitted by the Illinois Constitution. The village is
a home rule municipality. The Illinois Constitution provides that a home rule
unit may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its
government and affairs (Illinois Constitution, Art. VII, Sec. 6(a)(1970)). The
Illinois Constitution also provides that a home rule unit may exercise and
perform concurrently with the state any power or function of a home rule unit
to the extent that the General Assembly by law does not specifically limit the
concurrent exercise or specifically declare the state's exercise to be
exclusive (Illinois Constitution, Art. VII, Sec. 6(i)(1970)). The Illinois
Constitution further provides that the powers and functions of home rule units
shall be construed liberally (Illinois Constitution, Art. VII, Sec. 6(m)
(1970)).
(Ord. 2004-O-009, passed 1-27-04)

which a person has failed to comply with a hearing officer's judgment ordering
the correction of a Village Code violation or imposing any fine or other

the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of § 11-306 of the Illinois
Vehicle Code (ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 § 11-306), or similar provision of this
village code, as described in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 § 11-208.6. If the technician
determines that the vehicle entered the intersection as part of a funeral
procession or in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle, a
citation shall not be issued. Nor shall a citation issue where a motor vehicle
comes to a complete stop and does not enter the intersection, as defined by
ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5 § 1-132, during the cycle of the red signal indication
unless one or more pedestrians or bicyclists are present, even if the motor
vehicle stops at a point past a stop line or crosswalk where a driver is
required to stop. All determinations by a technician that an automated traffic
law violation occurred must be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement
officer or retired law enforcement officer of the village prior to a citation
being issued.

shall become final: (a) upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that
determination, or (b) upon expiration of the period for filing such a petition

liability within ten days after such determination is made. Such a petition
shall be filed by sending the same, together with any documentation in support
thereof, to the Administrator by certified mail, return receipt requested, or
by personal delivery to the Administrator. The grounds for such a petition
shall be limited to: (a) the person not having been the owner or lessee of the
cited vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued, (b) the person
having already paid the fine or penalty for the violation in question, (c)
excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing. A hearing
on such a petition shall be held within 30 days after the filing of same. In

subsequently makes a certified report to the Secretary, the subject vehicle
owner may challenge the accuracy of the certified report in writing. To do so,
the vehicle owner must submit to the Administrator a written statement under
oath, together with any supporting documentation, establishing one of the
following grounds for challenging the accuracy of the certified report: (1)
that the person was not the owner or lessee of the subject vehicle or vehicles
receiving five or more automated traffic law violations on the date or dates
such violation notices were issued, or (2) that the person already paid the
fines or penalties for the five or more automated traffic law violations
indicated on the certified report. Such statement and supporting documentation
must be sent to the Administrator by certified mail, return receipt requested,
or hand-delivered to the Administrator within five days after the person
receives notice from the Secretary that the person’s driver’s license will be
suspended at the end of a specified period of time unless the Secretary is
presented with a notice from the village certifying that the fines or penalties
due and owing have been paid or that the inclusion of the person’s name on the
certified report was in error.
(Ord. 2010-O-059, passed 12-21-10)

hearing by sending a signed statement, under oath, together with any supporting
documentation, to the Administrator via certified mail, return receipt
requested, within ten days after
service of the violation notice. Such a statement shall set forth the reasons
why a finding of liability should not be entered. The Administrator shall rule
on such a statement within ten days after receipt of same, and shall inform the
non-resident of his or her decision within ten days thereafter.

of the violation, the owner of the motor vehicle is subject to a penalty of
$100 per violation. In the event that such penalty has not been paid by the
time a determination notice is issued (no earlier than 35 days following a
final determination of liability), the penalty shall increase to $125. In no
case shall an additional fee be charged to an alleged violator for exercising
his or her right to an administrative hearing.

inquiry shall be made of the Secretary of State of the particular jurisdiction
for the furnishing of the most current registered name and address of the owner
of the vehicle, and notice shall be mailed as provided herein to the address

seven days after the date of the mailing of the notice if no request for a
hearing has been received within that seven-day period.
      (3)    A notice of intent to tow sticker with the earliest date upon
which the tow may take place and the address and phone number of the Police
Department shall be placed on the vehicle.

towed as an abandoned vehicle, shall have seven days after the date of mailing
or personal delivery of the notice to request, in writing, a pre-tow hearing.
Subsequent to this seven-day period, the vehicle may be towed. If the owner has
not filed a written request for a hearing within the seven-day period, the
hearing provisions of this subchapter will be deemed waived.

the vehicle from the improper location to a proper, lawful location and

the vehicle, post-tow hearing procedures are available, upon request of the

the vehicle, the Hearing Officer shall direct that the vehicle shall not be
towed. The village shall furnish a copy of the decision to the owner. No
vehicle about which the decision has been rendered shall be towed by the
village unless the circumstances under which the decision was rendered have
changed. If at some subsequent time the village should wish to tow the vehicle
from the same location, it shall follow the same procedures required for the
towing of any other similarly situated vehicle.

revoke any permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, if he
determines that:
      (1)   An alarm has been installed, maintained or operated in violation of

   (C)   Notice and hearing. Prior to revoking any alarm user permit issued
pursuant to this chapter, the Alarm Director shall provide the alarm user with
written notice, via certified mail or personal delivery, setting forth the
grounds for said revocation. The alarm user shall be entitled to submit a

of the Alarm Director's notice of the revocation. In the report, the alarm user
may describe actions that have been taken or will be taken to identify and
eliminate the cause or causes of the false alarm(s). The Alarm Director shall
determine whether the actions that have been taken or that will be taken will
substantially reduce the likelihood of false alarms, if such revocation is
based on the occurrence of eleven or more false alarms; or, whether the alarm
user has effected compliance with the provisions of this chapter, if the
revocation is based on any grounds for revocation other than excessive false
alarms. Within 14 days of the Alarm Director's receipt of the alarm user's
written report, the Alarm Director shall issue a written notice to the alarm
user via certified mail or personal delivery, regarding whether or not the
alarm user permit will be revoked.
   (D)   Appeal of Alarm Director's decision. An alarm user whose permit has
been revoked by the Alarm Director may, within 14 days of his receipt of the
notice of revocation, appeal the Alarm Director's decision by filing a written
request for an informal hearing with the Chief of Police in accordance with the
following:
      (1)   The Alarm User shall be entitled to an informal hearing with the
Chief of Police provided that the alarm user requests said informal hearing, in
writing via personal delivery or certified mail to the Chief of Police, within

notice. The Chief of Police shall serve written notice of the time and place of
the informal hearing on the alarm user, by certified mail or personal delivery,
within 14 days of the alarm user's request for the informal hearing. Unless
otherwise mutually agreed to by the Chief of Police and the alarm user, the
informal hearing shall occur within 21 days of the alarm user's request for the
hearing.
      (2)   At the informal hearing, the alarm user may offer evidence of his
compliance with the provisions of this chapter and/or, in the case of
revocation based on excessive false alarms, evidence of actions that the alarm
user has taken or will take to identity and eliminate the cause or causes of
the false alarms. In the case of revocation based on eleven or more false
alarms in a calendar year, the Chief of Police shall determine whether the
alarm user's remedial efforts (or proposed efforts) will substantially reduce
the likelihood of false alarms and the Chief of Police shall issue to the alarm
user, via certified mail or personal delivery, written findings regarding such
determination and a written order regarding the revocation of the alarm user's
permit. In the case of revocation based on grounds other than excessive false
alarms, the Chief of Police shall determine whether the alarm user has effected
compliance with the provisions of this chapter and shall issue to the alarm
user, via certified mail or personal delivery, written findings regarding such
determination and a written order regarding the revocation of the alarm user's
permit. In either case, the Chief of Police shall render a final decision
regarding the revocation within 14 days of the hearing.

   (B)   No liability. Issuance of any permit required under this chapter shall
be specifically subject to the village's immunity from liability as set forth

occupant of any lands, or the owners of any property abutting any public
street, road or way, on which weeds are found growing, tall grass, or other
nuisance exists, in writing of such fact. Failure of the Director of Public

parkway abutting the owner's property, as provided for in this section, shall,

danger of becoming a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain the
following information:
         (a)   The street address or legal description sufficient for
identification of the property;
         (b)   A statement that the Police Department has information that the

(Ord. 2020-O-065, passed 11-17-20)
§ 98.43 JUDICIAL REMEDIES.
   (A)   In the event the village pursues a judicial abatement remedy and in
the event that a court determines a property to be a chronic nuisance property,
the court may order that the property be closed and secured against all use and
occupancy for a period of not less than five consecutive days, but not more
than 30 consecutive days, or the court may employ any other remedy deemed by it
appropriate to abate the nuisance.
   (B)   In addition to the remedy provided in division (A) above, the violator

      (2)   The disturbance of neighbors;
      (3)   The occurrence of other nuisance on or from the property;
      (4)   The property's general reputation;
      (5)   The extent of village resources required to resolve the nuisance.
   (D)   The court may authorize the village to physically secure the property
against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so within the time
specified by the court. In the event that the village is authorized to secure
the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the village to affect the
closure shall be made and assessed as a lien against the property and debt to
the village. As used herein, "COSTS" mean those costs actually incurred by the
village for the physical securing of the property.
   (E)   The village employee effecting the closure shall prepare a statement
of costs, and the village shall thereafter submit said statement to the court
for its review. If no objection to the statement is made within the period
described by the court, a lien in said amount may be recorded against said
property.

   (C)   Each day a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter shall
continue shall constitute a separate offense. Imposition of any penalty for a
violation of this chapter shall not be construed as a waiver of the right of
the village to collect the costs of removal of any nuisance or nuisances as
provided by the provisions of this chapter and/or to file such costs as a lien
against the property on which the nuisance exists.

dwelling, or otherwise make unavailable or deny a dwelling to any buyer or
renter because of a handicap of:
      (1)   That buyer or renter;

refusing to permit, at the expense of that person, reasonable modifications of

pay for the restorations at the end of the tenancy, the landlord may negotiate
as part of such a restoration agreement a provision requiring that the tenant
pay into an interest bearing escrow account, over a reasonable period, a
reasonable amount of money not to exceed the cost of the restorations. The
interest in any such account shall accrue to the benefit of the tenant. A

assurances that the work will be done in a workmanlike manner and that any
required building permits will be obtained.

dwellings are sufficiently wide to allow passage by handicapped persons in
wheelchairs; and
      (3)   All premises within such dwellings contain the following features
of adaptive design:
         (a)    An accessible route into and through the dwelling;
         (b)    Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other
environmental controls in accessible locations;
         (c)    Reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of
grab bars; and
         (d)    Usable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual in a
wheelchair can maneuver about the space.
      (4)    Compliance with the appropriate requirements of ANSI A117.1 or the
Illinois Accessibility Code for buildings and facilities providing
accessibility and usability for physically handicapped people shall suffice to
satisfy the requirements of subdivision (3) of this division.
   (E)   Guide, hearing or support dogs. Discriminate against any handicapped
person by refusing to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, or
refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or in the terms, conditions, or
privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling or in the provision of services or
facilities in connection with such dwelling, or otherwise make unavailable or
deny a property to any buyer or renter because such person has a guide, hearing
or support dog or require an extra charge in a lease, rental agreement, or
contract of purchase or sale, other than for actual damage done to the premises

   (B)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the public

located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise,
license or similar agreement.
   (C)   Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this chapter.
   (D)   Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (E)   Conflicts with other chapters. This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (F)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (G)   Sound engineering judgment. The Village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the Village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
Village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare.

   (A)   Village review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Village
Director of Public Works within a reasonable time after filing. If the

   (B)   Additional village review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, ILCS Ch. 220,

§ 103.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
   (B)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and
regulations.

material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
103.21 of this chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor.

may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the village within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the village.
   (D)   (1)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. The insurance

section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insured under division (A), or the requirements of divisions (B), (C) and (D)
of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) of
this section, such as evidence that the utility is a “private self insurer”
under the Workers Compensation Act.

legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.

damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting solely and exclusively from the negligence,
misconduct or breach of this chapter by the village, its officials, officers,
employees, agents or representatives.
(Ord. 2007-O-050, passed 8-21-07)
§ 103.10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee’s sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this division (B) shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Village Director of Public Works, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village Director
of Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee
to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of
the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this division (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days’ advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division (D), may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that
the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within the 14-day
notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the
permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in division
(C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of the revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of any right with respect to the security fund shall
affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

   (A)   Tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming shall not be considered a
normal maintenance operation, but shall require the application for, and the
issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this
chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (B)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

be permitted on rights-of-way unless the utility demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Village Director of Public Works that such spraying is the
only practicable method of vegetation control.

   (A)   Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the village, a
utility shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate,
change or alter the position of any utility facilities within the rights-of-way
whenever the village has determined that such removal, relocation, change or
alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance,
or installation of any village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the
village in or upon, the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the public rights-of-way
shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the public rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and
subject to removal in the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the village shall attempt to notify the utility, if
known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if
known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
public rights-of-way of the village, the utility shall notify the village
within 90 days. Following receipt of such notice the village may direct the
utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the Village Director of
Public Works determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the
public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not
direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice
of abandonment to the village the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent
to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another
utility or person.

of entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made
using materials and methods approved by the Village Director of Public Works.

within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the village and at the utility’s expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking of equipment on the shoulder in order to make repair
operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the
shoulder in such an emergency will be permitted only when no other means of
access to the facility is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Village Director of Public Works or his or her duly authorized agent of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection
of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary
repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free
movement of traffic, the utility shall immediately notify the village police.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the village a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after

application. The request shall identify each provision of this chapter from
which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Village Director of Public Works
shall decide on an individual basis whether a variance is authorized for each
provision of this chapter identified in the variance request.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Village Director of Public
Works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Village Director of Public Works may require the
utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry
out the purposes of this chapter.

removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related t

§ 107.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose and intent of the Village of Tinley Park to establish a
process to address the deterioration, crime, and decline in value of Village
neighborhoods caused by property with defaulted mortgages located within the
village, and to identify, regulate, limit, and reduce the number of these
properties located within the village. It is the village’s further intent to
establish a registration program as a mechanism to help protect neighborhoods
from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance of properties
that are in default or defaulted.

FEES
§ 110.25 CERTAIN FEES BASED ON SQUARE FOOT AREA; FEE SCHEDULE.
   (A)    Business license fees based upon square foot area are predicated upon
the premise that there is a finite amount of square footage in all of the
commercial zoning districts within the village. These commercial districts
require substantial services over and above the services provided for single-
family homes and other residential districts. The business activities conducted
within the village require these extra services regardless of the activity
being conducted within each commercial space. Therefore, the fee is based
equitably upon the square foot area of each place of business as a minimum fee.
Minimum fee schedule shall be based on square feet of floor/land area. "Floor/
land area" being the sum total of the gross horizontal areas of all of the
several floors of a building and its accessory buildings measured in square
feet from the exterior faces of the exterior walls or from the center line of
party walls separating two buildings or business establishments on each floor,
cellar floor, motor vehicle parking space when the floor space is used in
conjunction with a drive-in commercial establishment (excluding however all
common area parking provided for any four or more stores or offices in any
shopping or business area) and commercial establishment, devoted to the sale,
service, or repair of motor vehicles (including the sale of gasoline and
related petroleum products), floor space used for mechanical equipment, whether
open or enclosed, penthouse attic space, balconies, mezzanines, porches and
verandas, floor area devoted to and occupied by accessory used. Special
enumerated fees shall be a substitution for a fee based on square footage
unless otherwise slated.

       In the absence of provision to the contrary all fees and charges for
licenses of permits shall be paid in advance at the time of application
therefor. Except otherwise provided all license fees shall become a part of the
corporate fund. In no event shall any rebate or refund be made of any business
regulation certificate of permit fee, or part thereof, by reason of death or
departure of the certificate holder or permittee; nor shall any rebate or
refund be made by reason of the nonuse of the business regulation certificate
or discontinuance of the operation or conduct of the regulated establishment,
business, or activity.
(Ord. 84-0-050, passed 11-27-84)
§ 110.27 EXEMPTIONS.
       The foregoing licensing and registration requirements are not applicable
to any business which is specifically and expressly preempted from local
regulation and control by state or federal law. However, when a business which
is preempted from local control is operated as a portion of a commercial
establishment which also engages in business activities which are not so
preempted, the registration fee shall apply to the entire commercial
establishment, and the registration fee shall be computed based on that portion
of the floor/land area of the commercial establishment which is not devoted to

§ 110.28 TERM OF LICENSE; PRORATION OF FEES.

   (C)   The Village Clerk shall mail to all licensees of the village, other
than contractor licensees, a statement at the time of the expiration of the
license held by the licensee. However, if the license is an annual license,
then the notice of expiration shall be mailed three weeks prior to the date of
expiration. A failure to send out the notice, or the failing of the licensee to
receive it shall not excuse the licensee from a failure to secure a new
license, or a renewal thereof, nor shall it be a defense in any action for
operation without a license.
   (D)   The term of a contractor license shall be one year from the date of
issuance.

time of renewal of the license. However, this section shall not be applicable

§ 110.30 TEMPORARY BUSINESS LICENSE.
   Provided that there is no danger to the public health and safety, and
further provided that a temporary or permanent occupancy permit has been issued
to a particular business for a particular location within the village, a
temporary business license may also be issued in accordance with procedures
established herein and any applicable administrative regulations of the
village. A temporary or permanent occupancy permit does not permit the
operation of any business required to have a business license under the
provisions of this chapter. A person seeking a temporary business license must
apply in writing to the Assistant Village Manager setting forth with
specificity the reasons why a temporary business license should be issued, and
the hardship or other conditions which justify such issuance. No temporary
business license shall be issued hereunder for a period in excess of 45 days.
It is the intent of this provision that a temporary business license may, under
appropriate circumstances, be issued, but that temporary licenses will only be
issued where the deficiencies in the application are minor in nature and can be
rectified within a set timetable. The Assistant Village Manager shall be
empowered to establish necessary conditions to make certain that before the
expiration of the temporary business license the applicant shall be in a
position to fully comply with the provisions of this chapter and all other
applicable ordinances, rules and regulations of the village. The Assistant
Village Manager in granting a temporary business license shall specifically
indicate in writing the length of time for which such license is applicable. It
shall be the responsibility of the recipient of the temporary business license
to rectify all deficiencies prior to the expiration of said temporary business
license, and the failure to do so may constitute sufficient grounds to deny
issuance of a permanent business license. Any temporary business license shall
be presented to the Chair of the Licensing Committee prior to issuance.

appropriate, but not greater than six months. A separate offense shall be
deemed committed on each day during or on which a violation occurs or
continues.

building or space in a building of such extent and character as may be suitable
and adequate for the reasonable and comfortable use and accommodation of its
members and their guests and is provided with suitable and adequate kitchen and
dining room space and equipment. However, such a club shall file with the Local
Liquor Control Commissioner at the time of its application for an original
license or renewal thereof, a list of the names, resident addresses, and phone

of the Local Liquor Control Commissioner to investigate and consider the

that he or she deems necessary to complete the investigation. The investigation
shall include a background search via fingerprinting to be completed at the
Tinley Park Police Department. The investigation may also include a credit
check and review of any outstanding fees owed to the village. At any time
during the pendency of an application the Local Liquor Control Commissioner
shall have the right to compel the applicant to submit to any examination and
to produce any books and records which, in the judgment of the Local Liquor
Control Commissioner, are material to the determination of whether the
applicant is qualified to receive a license under the provisions of this code,

The Local Liquor Control Commissioner shall also have the right to require the
applicant to answer any charges made in any objection to the issuance of the
license made by the Chief of Police, a prosecuting official, or by the sheriff
or prosecuting attorney of the county relative to the same. The failure of any
applicant to appear at the time and place fixed by the Local Liquor Control
Commissioner for his or her examination or to produce books and records when
requested, unless for good cause shown, shall be deemed to be an admission that
the applicant is not qualified to receive a license and, therefore, a basis for
denial of the license.

Commissioner shall approve or disapprove the issuance of a license based on the

a suspension order is filed as provided above, then such order shall remain in

the Building Commissioner, and/or his/her designee, upon inspection of the
multi-family rental dwelling structure. If, after two months from the effective
date of the suspension, the violations in question are not corrected
sufficiently to bring the property into compliance with this chapter, the

unless all applicable towing vehicles are unavailable.

special heavy-duty vehicle towing list pursuant to §
122.06(A) if the vehicle towing service first called cannot provide heavy-duty
towing service, or cannot subcontract for such service within a reasonable
time.

indefinite period of time, the Police Department shall do so by completing the
necessary form (a “hold order”) at the scene of the tow. The hold order shall

order will not be sufficient.
   (D)   A marked police squad car shall remain on the scene of an accident to
protect the tow truck driver during debris cleanup on the roadway or other
hazardous location.

vehicle towing service shall confirm the tow request within a maximum response
period of five minutes. The responding tow driver or vehicle towing service
agent shall contact the Village 9-1-1 Center to confirm the tow request and to
verify the location and type of tow required. Failure to confirm the tow
request within the five minute period shall be cause to request a tow from the
next scheduled vehicle towing service on the towing list.

towing service. Reasonable and customary rates for the towing and storage of
oversized vehicles shall be followed.
   (O)   The vehicle towing service shall provide reasonable disabled vehicle
service when on call, including but not limited to flat tire changing service,

service, the next vehicle towing service in the rotation will be contacted.

debris receptacle, and oil dry. The driver shall be responsible for the cleanup
of all accident debris and vehicle fluids where cleanup is practical and can be

authorized to weigh or issue certificates for any weighing done on any scales
other than those the locations of which appear on the license application of
the public weigh master appointing him, provided, however, that in a case of an

or articles contained in such vehicles, or the net weight of the commodity,
produce, article, or articles when not contained in a vehicle at the time of
weighing. In no case shall any public weigh master state in his certificate the
tare weight of any vehicle until after he shall have weighed the vehicle in
such manner as to secure the weight as specified herein; provided, however,
that in the case of a divided load, by which is meant a load containing more
than one order for the same or different purchasers or consignees no penalty
shall be imposed under this chapter by reason of the fact that the tare weight
shown on the weight certificate is only the original tare weight of the vehicle
and equipment before loading if in such case each order has been weighed
separately and the net weight of each order or delivery is correctly shown on
the weight certificate and such correct net weight is delivered.

commodity, produce, or other article or articles of merchandise is removed from
the vehicles, or such certificates shall be delivered to the members of the
Police Department or any officer or employee designated by the Village
President and Board of Trustees upon his or their demand. When delivery is
made, in case no person is present to receive such commodity, produce, or other
article or articles of merchandise, and if the purchaser or consignee or his or
their agent cannot be located, then the memorandum or certificate of weight
hereinbefore provided for shall be posted conspicuously at the place of
delivery, before any of the commodity, produce, or other article or articles of
merchandise is removed from the vehicle.
(Ord. 84-0-050, passed 11-27-84)
Penalty, see § 123.99
§ 123.09 FALSE WEIGHT CERTIFICATES.

deliver any load lot of any commodity, produce, or other article or articles of
merchandise sold in load lot by weight, delivered by wagon, truck, or other
vehicle within the village, of a quantity less than called for by the delivery
ticket, or any public weigh master or deputy who shall provide the driver or
person in charge of the vehicle used in the delivery thereof with a certificate
or memorandum of delivery which does not correctly state the information
required to be given herein or with a certificate or memorandum which does not
give the result of the actual weighing of such load lot and any driver or
person in charge of such delivery who shall fail, neglect, or refuse to deliver
to any member of the Police Department upon demand, the aforesaid public weigh
master's certificate before such load or any part thereof is removed from the
vehicle, or who shall refuse to comply with his or their demand to reweigh the
same in order that the weights stated in such certificate may be verified,
shall be fined as provided in §
123.99. Whenever the reweighing is done on a scale other than the scale of
which the weighing was originally done a variance of 1% less in the net weight
of a load lot between the net weight as set forth in the public weigh master's
certificate and the net weight as ascertained by reweighing such reweighing
such load shall not be considered a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 84-0-050, passed 11-27-84)
Penalty, see § 123.99
§ 123.10 RECORDS TO BE KEPT.
   Each public weigh master shall keep and preserve a carbon copy of each
weight certificate issued which collectively shall be an accurate record of all
weighing performed by him or his deputies. Such weight certificates shall be
numbered and all certificates must be accounted for and the records shall be
retained and preserved by such public weigh master for a period of at least two
years after the weighing is performed. Such records shall be open to inspection
by the Village President and the Board of Trustees and to any member of the
Department of Police.

chapter.

§ 128.01 LICENSE; LOCATION.
   (A)   In addition to the general licensing requirements set forth in
Chapter 110 of Title XI of this code, each firearms dealer located in this
village shall be required to apply for and obtain a special firearms dealer's
license. For purposes of this chapter, "FIREARMS DEALER" shall mean any
federally licensed firearms dealer, excluding any person licensed solely as a
"collector" pursuant to Section 923(b) of Title 18 of the United States Code
and possessing only a Type 03 federal license. The term "FIREARMS DEALER" shall
mean and include any "GUN SHOP" which term is defined as the premises of any
federally licensed firearms dealer where the purchase or sale of firearms or
firearms ammunition is conducted.
   (B)   A license is hereby required for any firearms dealer and/or for the
maintenance, operation or conduct of a gun shop business by a firearms dealer
within this village, or for doing such business or engaging in any such
activity or occupation within the village. Any person, firm or corporation
shall be subject to such requirement if by himself or through an agent,
employer or partner he holds himself forth as being engaged in the business or
occupation, or solicits patronage therefor, actively or passively; or attempts
to perform any part of such business or occupation in the village. This chapter
shall not apply to the one-time sale of the personal gun of its owner;
provided, however, if the same individual sells six or more guns within any
three year period, such person shall be conclusively deemed to be conducting
the business of a gun shop. Possession of a valid federal firearms dealer's
license from an address or for a location in the village shall be deemed proof
of being engaged in the business of dealing in firearms in the village and thus
requiring a village firearms dealer's license. It shall be unlawful for any
person to engage in the business of dealing in firearms or maintaining a gun
shop at any address within the village without having first applied for and
obtained a firearms dealer's license pursuant to this provision.
   (C)   No license shall be provided for any location within the village other
than in an appropriately zoned business or commercial area.
   (D)   No license shall be provided for any location within one-quarter of a
mile of the grounds of a school (which means any public or private elementary
or secondary school, community college, college or university) or public park
(which means any land or building set aside for public recreation and owned by
a public park district), as measured from the closest property lines of the
respective properties (actual distance, ["as the crow flies"] not by route of
human travel), unless the entity which has applied for a license was lawfully
in business prior to September 15, 1994 and either is in its original location
as of September 15, 1994 or relocates to another location in the village with
appropriate zoning for such business and its uses.
   (E)   Any person in the village who becomes a federally licensed firearms
dealer after September 15, 1994 and is thus required under this chapter to
obtain a village firearms dealer's license shall apply for such license within
45 days of receipt of the federal firearms dealer's license (anyone who, as of
September 1, 1994, has a federal firearms dealer's license shall apply for such
license within 45 days of September 1, 1994). Any persons licensed under
federal law at more than one location within the village must obtain a license
from the village for each individual location in the village. A separate
application license fee is required for each location. No license issued under
this section shall be transferrable or assignable to any other person or any
other location.
   (F)   No license shall be issued hereunder to any person who fails to
provide proof of a valid federal firearms dealer's license and a valid Firearm
Owners Identification Card issued by the State of Illinois.

110.03 through
110.07,
110.09 and
110.10 shall apply to the required licenses for federal firearms dealers and/or
gunshops. In addition, §
110.10(E)(6) which is incorporated herein shall be and is hereby amended as
incorporated herein to read, only in relation to licenses issued under this
chapter, in its entirety as follows:
   "Denial, suspension or revocation by any other public body of a comparable
license or permit for comparable or similar reasons as stated above."
   (B)   Moreover, a license may be denied and/or suspended or revoked if the
licensee violated the provisions of §
133.41 of this code and/or any other federal, state, county or local law
dealing in any way whatsoever, directly or indirectly, with the ownership,
possession, sale or use of guns (including discharge thereof).

fee, or any part thereof, for any reason including non-use of the license and/
or discontinuance of the operation or conduct of the regulated business.

   Each license shall be for a period of one year and all such licenses shall
terminate on December 31 of each year.
   The Village Clerk shall mail to all licensees a notice of expiration three
weeks prior to the date of expiration. A failure to send out the notice, or the
failing of the licensee to receive it, shall not excuse the licensee from a
failure to secure a new license, or a renewal thereof, nor it shall be a
defense in any action for operation without a license.

the event that any license fee is not paid when due, such license fee shall be
increased $100 if paid within the first week after the date it was due, $200 if

§ 129F.08 CRIME-FREE LEASE ADDENDUM.
   Every lease or other agreement for rental of any residential property
entered into after the effective date of this chapter shall include a "Crime-
Free Lease Addendum" in substantially the following form, unless otherwise
prohibited by law:
 
   Crime-Free Lease Addendum
In addition to all other terms of the lease, Landlord and Tenant agree as follows:
1.   The Tenant, any member of the Tenant’s household, any guest or any other person
associated with the Tenant on or near the leased premises:
      a)   Shall not engage in criminal activity, including drug-related criminal
activity, on or near the rental unit, common areas or appurtenances. “Drug related
criminal activity” means the illegal manufacture, sale, distribution, use, or possession
of any illegal or controlled substance as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.
      b)   Shall not engage in any act intended to facilitate criminal activity on or
near the rental unit, common areas, or appurtenances.
      c)   Shall not permit the rental unit, common areas, or appurtenances to be used
for or to facilitate any criminal activity.
      d)   Shall not engage in, facilitate, or permit on or near the rental unit, common

2.   ANY ACTIVITY PROHIBITED BY THIS AGREEMENT SHALL CONSTITUTE A SUBSTANTIAL VIOLATION
OF THE LEASE, MATERIAL NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE LEASE, AND GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION OF
TENANCY AND ABATEMENT.  It is understood that a single violation shall be good cause for
immediate termination of the lease. Proof of violation shall not require criminal
conviction, but the Tenant understands and agrees that an arrest or citation (supported
by admissible corroborating evidence that activity in violation of the above provisions
has occurred) for a described violation or criminal activity shall be sufficient
evidence of a violation and grounds for termination of Tenant’s tenancy and occupancy.
Corroborating evidence may include, but is not limited, to police reports detailing the
circumstances of the arrest, witness statements, and other relevant documentation to
assist in making a determination that the conduct underlying the arrest occurred.
3.   A Tenant who is an innocent party or the victim of a crime, including but not
limited to actual or threatened domestic violence, or sexual violence will not be in
violation of this Crime Free Lease Addendum or subject to eviction. Nothing in this
Addendum prohibits the abatement of the perpetrator of the domestic violence, or sexual
violence, or other criminal activity. A TENANT IS ENCOURAGED TO REPORT CRIMES WITHOUT
FEAR OF HIS/HER STATUS AS A TENANT.
4.   A Tenant will not be in violation of this Crime Free Lease Addendum or subject to
abatement based on:
      a)   Contact made to the police or seeking other emergency services, if (i) the
contact was made with the intent to prevent or respond to domestic violence or sexual
violence; (ii) the intervention or emergency assistance was needed to respond to or
prevent domestic violence or sexual violence; or (iii) the contact was made by, on
behalf of, or otherwise concerns an individual with a disability and the purpose of the
contact was related to that individual’s disability;
      b)   An incident or incidents of actual or threatened domestic violence or sexual
violence against the tenant, household member, or guest occurring in the rental unit or
on the premise; or
      c)   Criminal activity or a local ordinance violation occurring in the rental unit
or on the premises that is directly relating to domestic violence or sexual violence,
engaged in by a tenant, member of a tenant’s household, guest, or other party, and
against a tenant, household member, guest or other party.

seq.

publication shall be allowed to be displayed in each individual village-owned
newspaper dispensing device.
   (D)   The applicant shall pay a combined permit fee of [TBD] for each space

      (3   The indirect interest in real property as reflected by a controlling
interest in a real estate entity.
   “CONTROLLING INTEREST”
      (1)   Fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power or fair
market value of all ownership interests or beneficial interests in a real
estate entity, whether the interests are owned by one or by several persons; or

any distribution 50% or more of the income or profits of a real estate entity.
   “PERSON.” Any natural person, receiver, administrator, executor,

individuals acting as a unit, whether mutual, cooperative, fraternal,
nonprofit, or otherwise, and the United States or any instrumentality thereof.
Whenever the term "PERSON" is used in any clause prescribing and imposing a
penalty, the term as applied to associations shall mean the owners or part
owners thereof, and as applied to corporations, the officers thereof.
   “REAL ESTATE ENTITY.” Any person (other than an Illinois land trust)

holding directly or indirectly title to or beneficial interest in real property

income, or investment. It shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, that an
entity is a real estate entity if it owns directly or indirectly real property

§ 129M.09 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   In the event a deed is filed for recordation or there is an assignment

transfer stamps provided by this chapter, it is deemed a violation of the code
and is subject to a lien being declared against said real estate conveyed or
assignment of beneficial interest in the amount no less than $250 and no more
than $750. The fact that the deed or assignment does not contain a Tinley Park
transfer stamp shall constitute constructive notice of the lien. The lien may
be enforced by proceedings to foreclose, as in cases of mortgages or mechanics’
liens. Suit to foreclose this lien must be commenced within three years after
the date of recording the deed. Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing
the village from bringing a civil action to collect the fee imposed by this

the village by the grantor or subject property.

VANDALISM AND PARENTAL IRRESPONSIBILITY
§ 131.15 PURPOSE.
   The corporate authorities find that the incidence of acts of vandalism and
similar offenses by juveniles resulting in damage to real and personal property
within this village have increased, thus posing a threat to the value of the
property within the village, and also threatening the general health, safety,
and welfare of the residents of the village, and also recognize the need to
provide the means to eliminate such problems in order to insure the safety of
the property and residents of the village. The corporate authorities further
find that increased parental responsibility is essential for the effective
control and elimination of such juvenile offenses. Furthermore, the corporate
authorities further find that it is in the best interests of the village that
such acts be prosecuted by the village as a local offense; that penalties
therefore be imposed which are related to the nature of the act and the type of
offender; and that parents or legal guardians of minors found guilty of such
acts be held responsible for any monetary penalty or order of restitution or
reparation imposed. The diligent pursuit of such interest will tend to increase
parental supervision of minors and reduce the incidence of juvenile vandalism,
thus advancing the welfare of residents of the village.
§ 131.16 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "LEGAL GUARDIAN." A person appointed guardian, or given custody, of a minor
by the Circuit Court of this state, but does not include a person appointed
guardian, or given custody, of a minor under the Illinois Juvenile Court Act,
ILCS Ch. 705, Act 405 §§ 1-1 et seq.
   "MINOR." A person who has attained 11 years of age, but who has not yet
reached 18 years of age.

   (B)    Whoever violates any provision of division (A) above shall be subject

   Every person found guilty of an offense as defined in §
131.17 hereof shall be subject to either or both of the following penalties for
each offense:
   (A)    A fine as specified in §
131.99.
   (B)    A period of conditional discharge not to exceed one year.
      (1)    The conditions of a conditional discharge shall include that the
defendant:
         (a)   Not violate any criminal statute of quasi-criminal ordinance of
any jurisdiction; and
         (b)   Report to and appear in person before such person or agency as
directed by the court.
      (2)    The conditions of conditional discharge may, in addition, require
that the defendant:
         (a)   Work or pursue a course of study or vocational training;
         (b)   Undergo medical or psychiatric treatment, or treatment for drug
addiction or alcoholism;
         (c)   Make restitution or reparation in an amount not to exceed actual

to his or her own support at home or in a foster home.
      (3)    When a court orders restitution or reparation as a condition for a
conditional discharge, the court shall determine the amount and conditions or
payment. When the conditions of payment have not been satisfied, the court, at
any time prior to the expiration or termination of the period of conditional
discharge, may impose an additional period of not more than two years. Only the
conditions of payment shall continue to apply during such additional period.
The court shall retain all of the incidents of the original sentence, including
the authority to modify or enlarge the original conditions and to revoke the
penalty of conditional discharge if the conditions of payment are violated
during such additional period.

admit the offender to bail pending the hearing.
         (c)    Shall receive evidence in the open court with the right of
confrontation, cross-examination, and representation by counsel. The village
has the burden of going forward with the evidence and proving the violation by
the preponderance of the evidence.
         (d)    Shall not revoke a conditional discharge for failure to comply
with conditions of a sentence which imposed financial obligations upon the
offender unless such failure is due to his or her willful refusal to pay.
         (e)    May modify the conditions of a conditional discharge on motion
of the village or in its own motion or at the request of the offender after
notice to all parties and a hearing.
      (5)    If the court finds that the offender has violated a condition at
any time prior to the expiration or termination of the period, it may continue
to the offender on the existing period, with or without modifying or enlarging
the conditions, or may impose any other penalty that was available at the time
of the initial penalty.
      (6)    A judgment revoking probation or conditional discharge is a final
appealable order.
§ 131.19 OFFENSE OF PARENTAL IRRESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)    Offense. It shall be unlawful for a parent or legal guardian of an
unemancipated minor residing with that parent or legal guardian to fail to
exercise proper parental responsibility by allowing or permitting the minor to
commit any violation of a village ordinance or state statute concerning
vandalism, battery, curfew, disorderly conduct, obscene conduct, trespass,
graffiti, or possession or use of alcoholic liquor, cannabis, or controlled
substances, or any other offense of willful or malicious acts to persons or
property.
   (B)    Presumption. A parent or legal guardian shall be presumed to have
allowed or permitted the minor to have committed a violation of a village
ordinance or state statute under all of the following conditions:
      (1)   The minor has been either adjudicated to be in the violation of the
provisions of §
131.17 above or §
131.20 below, or has been charged with any such violation (except if found to
be not guilty); or has incurred non-judicial sanctions from any peace officer
or conservator of the peace resulting from an admission of guilt to any such
offense; and
      (2)   The parent or legal guardian has received a written notice by
certified mail (return receipt requested) or by personal service in
substantially the following form:
LEGAL NOTICE
      TO: (Parents' Names)
      FROM: Village of Tinley Park

violation of an ordinance or state statute concerning vandalism, battery,
curfew, disorderly conduct, obscene conduct, trespass, graffiti, or possession
or use of alcoholic liquor, cannabis, or controlled substances, or any other
offense of willful or malicious acts to persons or property. If said minor is
again involved with a violation of one of the above-type ordinances or state
statutes you may be found guilty of the offense of parental irresponsibility.
Conviction for said offense can result in a fine of not less than $25 nor more
than $500. You are hereby notified that you must exercise proper parental
responsibility over said minor by controlling his unlawful conduct.
      (3)    Said minor, within two years of the receipt of said notice by the
parent or legal guardian, has been either adjudicated to have committed, has
been charged with the violation (except if found not to be guilty) of, or has
admitted to have committed any violation of any ordinance or state statute as
described in (1) above.
   (C)    Notice. It is the policy of the village that a parent or legal

that a notice in substantially the following form be sent to the parents or
legal guardians of the minor:
LEGAL NOTICE
               TO: (Parents' Names)
               FROM: Village of Tinley Park

which is a violation of a village ordinance or state statute and which requires
the appearance of said minor in court. You are further notified that one of the
parents of said minor must appear in court before the case will be tried or be
disposed.
   If you fail to appear, the Village Prosecutor has been directed to have
issued a subpoena to bring you into court. Failure to obey a subpoena can
result in contempt of court, with a fine of imprisonment as the penalty.
   (D)    Subpoenas. The Village Prosecutor is hereby directed to have
subpoenas issued whenever a parent or legal guardian of a minor does not appear
in court after the first two times the case has been before the court.
(Am. Ord. 2006-O-021, passed 4-25-06)
§ 131.20 GRAFFITI.
   (A)   Purpose and objectives. The placement or maintenance of graffiti
anywhere within public view in the village poses a serious threat to the
orderly and proper maintenance of the village and to the safety, health, and
welfare of the general public. Accordingly, the village has determined that it
is necessary to deal strictly with any person who commits or intends to commit
the offense of placing graffiti within public view in the village. The village
recognizes that the perpetrator is the principal offender under this section,
and thus intends that every such perpetrator be punished accordingly. The
village also recognizes, however, that graffiti must be eradicated and,
therefore, that the owner or person in control of any property or place on
which graffiti has been placed in public view, while also a victim, must be
required to remove that graffiti for his or her own good and for the protection
of the safety, health, and welfare of all residents of the village. The purpose
of this section is to prevent the propagation of graffiti and to cause any
graffiti that does appear to be removed as quickly as possible, with the
objective of protecting the public safety, health, and welfare.
   (B)   Definition of graffiti. For purposes of this section, the word
"GRAFFITI" shall mean any symbol, announcement, insignia, name identification,
inscription, picture, or similar marking, including without limitation any
letter, word, numeral, emblem, or combination thereof, that is painted,
written, drawn, scratched, etched, or in any other way placed on any wall,
fence, sign, building, or other structure, or sidewalk, pavement, post, stone,
tree, or any other real or personal property or place, private or public,
except as specifically permitted by state law or regulation or Village Code,
ordinance, or regulation.
   (C)   Graffiti prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person to place
graffiti upon the real or personal, public or private, property of another
without the express, written permission of the owner of said real or personal
property.
   (D)   Placement with owner's permission. It shall be unlawful for any owner/
occupant or person having control of any real or personal property which is in
the public view within the village to place, permit, or otherwise tolerate
graffiti to be placed or to remain on that property or place if such graffiti,
as described in division (B), incites violence by reference to gang or criminal
activity, depicts or expresses obscenity by referring to sexual activity,
contains defamatory materials about a public or private person, or is such that
the Code Enforcement Commissioner, or his or her agent, in their sole
discretion, deems said graffiti to be inappropriate for the purposes rendered.
   (E)   Possession of graffiti materials prohibited. It shall be unlawful for
any person to possess any spray paint, paint, ink, marking pen containing any
nonwater soluble fluid, brush, applicator, or other tool or material for
painting, drawing, marking, scratching, or etching with the intent to use such
tool or material in violation of division (C) above.
   (F)   Duty to remove graffiti. Every owner of any real or personal property
or place within the village, and every person having control of any real or
personal property or place within the village, shall remove, cover, or
otherwise eradicate, at his or her own expense, any graffiti that is placed in
public view on that property or place within three business days after receipt
of a notice from the village to do so. Such notice from the village shall
describe the graffiti generally, shall order its immediate removal by said
third business day and shall set forth the possible results of non-removal
discussed in division (G) below.
   (G)   Nuisance declared. Every violation of any provision of this section is
hereby declared to be a public nuisance. Where the owner or other person upon
whom notice was served pursuant to division (F) above, fails to remove the
graffiti described in the notice within seven days of service of the notice,
the village may take all such steps to remove, cover, or otherwise eradicate or
abate the graffiti in conformance with this section and the nuisance abatement
procedures set forth in §§
98.35 through
98.37. All costs incurred by the village in removing or otherwise abating the
graffiti shall be borne by the property owner and may be a lien on the property
as set forth in §
98.37 upon filing of a notice of lien.

§ 132.02 PUBLIC INDECENCY.
   (A)    For purposes of this section, "PUBLIC PLACE" means any place where

   (C)    Public indecency is a misdemeanor. A person convicted of a third or
subsequent violation for public indecency is guilty of a Class 4 felony, which
is punishable under state law.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 11-9)
Penalty, see § 132.99
§ 132.03 OBSCENITY.
   (A)    For the purpose of this section, a material or performance is
"OBSCENE" if:
      (1)    The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;
      (2)    The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or
perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions or lewd
exhibition of the genitals; and
      (3)    Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
   (B)    A person commits obscenity when, with knowledge of the nature or
content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection which
would have disclosed the nature or content thereof, he:
      (1)    Sells, delivers, or provides, or offers or agrees to sell,
deliver, or provide any obscene writing, picture, record, or other
representation or embodiment of the obscene; or
      (2)    Presents or directs an obscene play, dance, or other performance
or participates directly in that portion thereof which makes it obscene; or
      (3)    Publishes, exhibits, or otherwise makes available anything
obscene; or
      (4)    Performs an obscene act or otherwise presents an obscene
exhibition of his body for gain; or
      (5)    Creates, buys, procures, or possesses obscene matter or material
with intent to disseminate it in violation of this section, or of the penal
laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction; or
      (6)    Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented
or held out by him to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
   (C)    Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)    Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults,
except that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      (2)    Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
      (3)    In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
         (a)    The character of the audience for which the material was
designed or to which it was directed;
         (b)    What the predominant appeal of the material would be for
ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would
probably have on the behavior of such people;
         (c)    The artistic, literary, scientific, educational, or other
merits of the material, or absence thereof;
         (d)    The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in
this state;
         (e)    Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising
or other promotion of the material;
         (f)    Purpose of the author, creator, publisher, or disseminator.
   (D)    Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement, or
possession of a mold, engraved plate, or other embodiment of obscenity
specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more
than three copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an
intent to disseminate.
   (E)    Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      (1)    Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age;
      (2)    Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.
   (F) Forfeiture of property. A person who has been convicted previously of
the offense of obscenity and who is convicted of a second or subsequent offense
of obscenity is subject to the property forfeiture provisions set forth in
Article 124B of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.
 
   (G) Obscenity is a misdemeanor. A second or subsequent offense is a felony
and shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law.

purpose of obtaining the material advertised is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor
under the laws of the State."
   (D)   The predominant appeal to prurient interest of the material shall be
judged with reference to average children of the same general age of the child
to whom such material was sold, lent, distributed or given, unless it appears
from the nature of the matter or the circumstances of its dissemination or
distribution that it is designed for specially susceptible groups, in which
case the predominant appeal of the material shall be judged with reference to
its intended or probable recipient group.
   (E)   Distribution of harmful material in violation of this section is a
Class A misdemeanor. A second or subsequent offense is a Class 4 felony.
   (F)   Any person under the age of 18 that falsely states, either orally or

No establishment licensed by the Illinois Gaming Board shall be permitted to

the village. No license may issue where the license applicant owes a debt,
fine, fee or penalty to the village.
      (1)   The licensing fee through December 31, 2021 shall be in the amount
of $1,000 for each video gaming terminal.
      (2)   The licensing fees beginning January 1, 2022 shall be:

shall meet and provide for the following criteria as part of said application:
      (1)   A copy of the applicant’s active state video gaming license;
      (2)   The location of the premises where the video gaming terminal is to
be located, maintained and/or operated;
      (3)   The charge to be made to the player for operating the device;
      (4)   That the applicant is over the age of 21;
      (5)   That the applicant or any principal officer therein has not held a
license under this section or had an interest therein that was revoked for
cause;
      (6)   That the applicant or any principal officer therein has not
furnished false or misleading information on the application;
      (7)   For a new applicant, that said applicant applying for a license to
operate video gaming terminals, has been operating under a valid C/O at its
current address for at least 365 days and that the applicant's establishment
has generated at least 60% of its revenue from the sale of food or beverages.
However, if an applicant currently operates an establishment in compliance with
this section and wishes to operate another establishment similar to the initial
establishment, the applicant will be exempt from the one-year waiting period
described above. Whether the new establishment is similar to the previously
operated establishment is determined by the Liquor Commissioner in the
Commissioner's sole discretion;
      (8)   For an applicant who has been previously issued a license under
this section, the applicant's establishment must adhere to the same guidelines
as stated above in division (B)(7) of this section;

barrier wall. If said barrier walls prohibit applicant from complying with ILCS
Ch. 230, Act 40, § 58, applicant shall maintain video surveillance of the
gaming area at all times. If applicant provides sufficient evidence that the
gaming area is fully contained in an area of the establishment that can only be
accessed by persons 21 or older, the requirement of a seven-foot barrier wall
is not applicable;
      (12)   Such other information as the village may determine is necessary.
   (C)   No more than six video gaming terminals may be located, maintained or
operated in any one establishment. However, any holder of a local Class UV-
2 liquor and video gaming license who has a large truck stop license from the
State of Illinois Gaming Board, may operate up to ten video gaming terminals.
No license issued hereunder shall permit the operation of a video gaming
terminal in a manner which will disturb the peace of persons otherwise properly

constitute a nuisance.

that obtains a license to locate, maintain and/or operate any video gaming
terminal on its premises. The license must be displayed by the applicant in a
conspicuous place and must indicate the number of video gaming terminals

no provision to the contrary is made.
   (F)   The Village Clerk shall mail to all licensees a statement three weeks
prior to the date of expiration informing the licensees of the upcoming
expiration date. Failure to send out the notice, or failure of any licensee to
receive it, shall not excuse the licensee from failure to secure a new license,
or a renewal thereof, nor shall it be a defense in any action for operation
without a license.
   (G)   Any licensee who fails to pay the fees and charges for the renewal of
a license by January 31 of the year following expiration of the license shall
be charged a penalty of $50. The penalty shall be paid at the time of renewal

§ 151.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The Village President and Board of Trustees of the village find as
follows:
      (1)   Excessive quantities of soil are eroding from areas that are
undergoing development for certain non-agricultural uses, including but not
limited to, the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and
industrial plants, the building of roads and highways, filling of land, and the
creation of recreational facilities;
      (2)   The washing, blowing, and falling of eroded soil across and upon
roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision
and reducing traction of road vehicles;
      (3)   Said soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gulleys,
washed-out fills, and embankments;
      (4)   The sediment from said soil erosion tends to clog sewers and
ditches and to pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs;
      (5)   Said sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most
beneficial purposes, destroying fish and other aquatic life, and that said
sediment is costly and difficult to remove; and
      (6)   Said sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways, resulting
in greatly increased chances of flooding at grave danger to public health and
safety.
   (B)   The Mayor and Board of Trustees therefore declare that the purpose of
this chapter is to provide minimum standards to safeguard persons, to protect
property and prevent the despoliation of the environment, and to promote the
public welfare, by regulating and controlling the design, construction, quality
of materials and use and maintenance of any development or other activity which
disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on
land situated in the village.

§ 151.05 GENERAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.
   Unless judged by the village to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following
performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water management at all
sites:
   (A)   All site designs shall, to the maximum extent possible, establish
storm water management practices to control the peak flow rates of storm water
discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of
storm water runoff. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for
storm water treatment and to infiltrate storm water runoff from driveways,
sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent
practical.
   (B)   To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel
protection criterion shall be provided as prescribed in the Illinois Urban
Manual.
   (C)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a storm
water pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under
the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
general permit. The Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan requirement applies
to both existing and new industrial sites.
   (D)   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the village
to determine if they are subject to additional storm water design requirements.
   (E)   The calculations for determining peak flows as required by the MWRDGC
shall be used for sizing all storm water management practices where applicable.
(Ord. 2008-O-004, passed 2-26-08)
§ 151.06 BASIC STORM WATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (A)   Detention basins shall incorporate design features to capture storm
water runoff pollutants. In particular, designers shall give preference to wet
bottom and wetland designs in locations adjacent to or near existing wetlands
or in other areas where they are suitable and acceptable to the village and all
flows from the development shall be routed through the basin.
   (B)   Dry basins with low flow bypasses may be preferred in certain
developments to enhance multiple uses where suitable and acceptable to the
village. Retention and infiltration of storm water shall be promoted throughout
the property's drainage system to reduce the volume of storm water runoff and
to reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants.
   (C)   The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where
practicable. Uses considered compatible with storm water management include
open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation, wetlands, and water
quality mitigation. The applicant should try to avoid using portions of the
property exclusively for storm water management.
(Ord. 2008-O-004, passed 2-26-08)
§ 151.07 POST CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   The requirements of Section IV (D)(2)(b) of NPDES permit No. ILR10
including management practices, controls and other provisions at least as
protective as the requirements contained in the Illinois Urban Manual, 2002 or
most recent edition.
   (B)   The long-term operation and maintenance of all BMP's shall be
provided.
(Ord. 2008-O-004, passed 2-26-08)
§ 151.08 WAIVERS TO STORM WATER MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Waiver eligibility criteria. Every applicant shall provide for storm
water management as required by this chapter, unless this requirement is waived
by the village. The minimum requirements for storm water management may be
waived in whole or in part upon request of the applicant, provided that at
least one of the following conditions applies:
      (1)   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely
to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter.
      (2)   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of storm
water discharges have been established in a storm water management plan that
has been approved by the village and the implementation of the plan is required
by local ordinance.
      (3)   Provisions are made to manage storm water by an off-site facility.
The off-site facility is required to be in place, designed and adequately sized
to provide a level of storm water control that is equal to or greater than that
which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally obligated
entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the storm water
practice.
      (4)   The village finds that meeting the minimum on-site management
requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site.
      (5)   Non-structural practices will be used on the sites that reduce: the
generation of storm water from the site; the size and cost of storm water
storage; and the pollutants generated at the site. These nonstructural
practices are explained in detail in the Illinois Urban Manual.
   (B)   Assurances required for waiver. In instances where one of the
conditions above applies, the village may grant a waiver from strict compliance
with these storm water management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation
measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant
must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the village that the variance will not
result in the following impacts to downstream waterway:
      (1)   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures.
      (2)   Degradation of biological functions or habitat.
      (3)   Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation.
      (4)   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and
property.
(Ord. 2008-O-004, passed 2-26-08)
§ 151.09 OPERATION STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Applicability. All earth moving grading and grading operations not
specifically exempted by the provisions of this chapter shall comply with the
applicable standards and requirements set forth in this section in addition to
the other requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Handbook adopted by reference. The standards and specifications of the
Illinois Urban Manual are hereby incorporated into this section and made a part
hereof by this reference, for the purpose of delineating procedures and methods
of operation under development plans approved in §
151.04 and methods of operation under development plans approved in §
151.04. In the event of conflict between provisions of the said manual and
other provisions of this chapter, the said provisions of this chapter shall
govern. The village "Erosion Control Practice Standards" are hereby
incorporated into this section and made a part hereof by this reference, for
the purpose of delineating procedures and methods of operation under
development plans approved in §
151.04 and methods of operation under development plans approved in §
151.04. In the event of conflict between provisions of the said standards and
other provisions of this chapter, the said provisions of this chapter shall
govern.
   (C)   Special precautions.
      (1)   If at any stage of the grading the Village Engineer or Director of
Public Works determines by inspection that the nature of the formation is such
that further work as authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any
property, public way, watercourse or drainage structure they may require, as a
condition to allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable safety
precautions be taken as he considers advisable to avoid the likelihood of such
peril. "Special precautions" may include, but shall not be limited to,
specifying a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage
facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, leveling, or cribbing, installation
of plant materials for erosion control and reports of a registered engineering
geologist whose recommendations may be made requirements for further work.
      (2)   Where it appears that flood damage may result because the grading
is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install
temporary planting to control erosion, install temporary structures or take
such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or the
public safety. On large operations or where unusual site conditions prevail,
the Village Engineer or Director of Public Works may specify the time of
starting grading and time of completion or may require that the operations be
conducted in specific stages so as to insure completion of protective measures
or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.
   (D)   Expiration of permit. Every site development permit shall expire by
limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit has
not been commenced within 180 days, or is not completed within one year from
date of issue; except that the Director of Public Works may, if the permit
holder presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented
work being started or completed within the specified time limits, grant a
reasonable extension of time if written application is made before the
expiration date of the permit.

any given year. The “BASE FLOOD” is often referred to as the “100-YEAR FLOOD.”
   “BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).” The height in relation to the North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD] of 1988 (or other datum, where specified) of the crest of
the base flood. Application of the BFE at any location is as defined in §
152.03
   “BASEMENT.” Any area of the building, including any sunken room or sunken
portion of a room, having its floor below ground level (subgrade) on all sides.
   “BUILDING.” A walled and roofed building, including gas or liquid storage
tank, which is principally above ground, including manufactured homes, mobile
homes and prefabricated buildings. The term also includes recreational vehicles

dimensions of all existing and proposed buildings and additions to buildings.
      (4)   For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted
plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of §
152.23.
      (5)   Upon receipt of a development permit application, the Director of
Community Development shall compare the elevation of the site to the BFE.
      (6)   Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher than
the BFE of the current FIRM and which has not been filled after the date of the
site’s first floodplain designation on a FIRM, is not in the floodplain and,
therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter.
      (7)   Any development located on land shown to be below the BFE that is
hydraulically connected to the floodplain, but not shown on the current FIRM,
is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
      (8)   The Director of Community Development shall maintain documentation
of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that
this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site’s first FIRM
identification in the floodplain.
      (9)   The Director of Community Development shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local
permits, approvals or waivers that may be required for this type of activity,
as specified in §
152.35. The Director of Community Development shall not issue a permit unless
all other federal, state, and local permits have been obtained.
      (10)   A development permit or approval shall become invalid unless the
actual start of construction, as defined in §
152.02, for work authorized by such permit, is commenced within 180 days after
its issuance, or if the work authorized is suspended or abandoned for a period
of 180 days after the work commences. All permitted work shall be completed
within 12 months after the date of issuance of the permit or the permit shall
expire. Time extensions, of not more than 180 days each, may be granted, in
writing, by the Director of Community Development. Time extensions shall be
granted only if the original permit is compliant with this chapter and the FIRM
and FIS in effect at the time the extension is granted.
   (B)   Preventing increased damages.
      (1)   No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public
health and safety.
      (2)   If fill is being used to elevate the site above the BFE, the
applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a LOMR from FEMA for the
purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
      (3)   Compensatory storage.
         (a)   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the BFE shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically
equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the BFE.
         (b)   The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and one-
half times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.
         (c)   In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall
be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.
         (d)   All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10% annual chance
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10% annual chance flood
elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10% annual chance
flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10% annual chance flood
elevation.
         (e)   All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse.
   (C)   Construction of a building under a LOMR based on fill.
      (1)   A person who has obtained a LOMR based on fill, which removes a
site in the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate the site above the
BFE, may only apply for a permit from the village to construct the lowest floor
of a building above the BFE in the floodplain. The Director of Community
Development shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant has demonstrated
that the building will be reasonable safe from flooding. The Director of
Community Development shall require a professional certification from a
qualified design professional that indicates the land or buildings to be
removed from the SFHA are reasonably safe from flooding, according to the
criteria established in FEMA Technical Bulletin (TB) 10. Professional
certification may come from a professional engineer, professional geologist,
professional soil scientist, or other design professional qualified to make
such evaluations. Analysis by a structural engineer may be required.
      (2)   The Director of Community Development shall maintain records,
including but not limited to, all correspondence, professional certification,
existing and proposed grading, sump pump sizing, foundation plans, elevation
certificates, compensatory storage calculations, soil testing and compaction
data.
      (3)   The Building Department shall not issue a permit to construct the
lowest floor of a building below the BFE on a site removed from the floodplain
through a LOMR based on fill.

         (m)   A licensed P.E. under the employ or contract of the village
shall review and approve applications reviewed under this section.
   (B)   Preventing increased damages and a list of appropriate uses.
      (1)   The only development in a floodway allowed are appropriate uses
that will not cause a rise in the BFE and will not create a damaging or
potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity, be a threat to
public health and safety and welfare, impair the natural hydrologic and
hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing
water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by
appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only those
appropriate uses listed in 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3708 will be allowed. The
approved appropriate uses are as follows:
         (a)   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife.
         (b)   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring
access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities,
and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
         (c)   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls;
         (d)   Underground and overhead utilities;
         (e)   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail
systems, including any related fencing [at least 50% open when viewed from any
one direction] built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including
open air pavilions and toilet facilities (four-stall maximum) that will not
block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage.
         (f)   Detached garages, storage sheds, or other non-habitable
accessory structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway
storage;
         (g)   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto;
         (h)   Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
            1.   The depth of flooding during the base flood will not exceed
one foot; or
            2.   The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility
parking lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events
and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all
overbank flooding events.
         (i)   Aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevation where
the depth of flooding during the base flood will not exceed one foot;
         (j)   Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a
positive non-erosive slop toward a watercourse.
         (k)   Flood proofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
buildings including the construction of water tight window wells, elevating
buildings, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal buildings where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing building,
and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the building.
         (l)   The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged
building, provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the
building was damaged to 50% or more of the market value before the damage
occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the FPE.
         (m)   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase
the enclosed floor area of the building below the BFE, and which will not block
flood flows including but not limited to, fireplaces, bay windows, decks,
patios, and second story additions. If the building is improved to 50% or more
of the market value before the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial
improvement), the building will be protected from flooding to the FPE.
      (2)   Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of
any new buildings, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or
channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the
floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a
fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an
appropriate use.
      (3)   Within the designated floodway, the construction of an appropriate
use, will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets
the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing
with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered P.E. and provided
that any building meets the protection requirements of §
152.24:
         (a)   Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood
stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the base flood. In calculating effective designated floodway conveyance, the
following factors shall be taken into consideration:
            1.    Designated floodway conveyance, “K” = (1.486/n)(AR 2/3) where
“n” is Manning’s roughness factor, “A” is the effective flow area of the cross-
section, and “R” is the ratio of the area to the  wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te
Chow, Open Channel Hydraulics, (McGraw-Hill, New York 1959)).
               A.   The same Manning’s “n” value shall be used for both
existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a
federal, state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions
will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-
vegetative land cover.
               B.    Transition sections shall be provided and used in
calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following
expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant’s engineer
can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more
abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
                  (i)    When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream’s length.
                  (ii )   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream’s length.
                  (ii i)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one-foot vertical transition for every ten feet of
stream length shall be used.
                  (iv )   Transition sections shall be provided between cross-
sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated
floodway delineation on adjacent properties.
                  (v)    All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be
located perpendicular to flood flows.
         (b)   Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase
downstream flooding.
            1.    Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or
structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
            2.    Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to
one and one-half times the volume of floodplain storage lost.
            3.    Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head
loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
            4.   The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed
between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed BFE. All
designated floodway storage lost below the existing 10% annual chance flood
elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-percent annual chance flood
elevation. All designated floodway storage lost above the existing 10% annual
chance flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10% annual chance
flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse.
            5.   If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location
of the proposed construction, the applicant’s engineer shall demonstrate
through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that
the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent.
            6.   There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area, as a
result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to
reduce flooding at an existing structure.
         (c)   Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream
erosion or flood heights.
            1.   For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on-
stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the
average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events
up to and including the base flood event.
            2.   In the case of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures
built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood
flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and
sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
         (d)   Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway
approaches.
            1.   The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of
upstream flood stages greater than one- tenth of a foot when compared to the
existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the base flood
event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the
channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks]
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or
within recorded flood easements.
            2.   If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood
stages greater than one-tenth of a foot, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to
obtain a permit for a dam or waiver.
            3.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in §
152.23. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any commonly accepted FEMA
approved hydraulic models.
            4.   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per division (B)
(3)(b) above.
            5.   Velocity increases must be mitigated per division (B)(3)(c)
above.
            6.   If the crossing is proposed over a public body of water that
is used for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be
received.
            7.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge
showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by division
(B) above.
            8.   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be
designed per division (B)(3)(h) below.
         (e)    Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts,
and approach roads.
            1.   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than one-tenth of one foot
increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies
up to and including the base flood event, if the existing structure is not a
source of flood damage.
            2.   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to structures in the upstream floodplain, the
applicant’s engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the existing
bridge or culvert and roadway approach to reduce the existing backwater, taking
into consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream
properties.
            3.   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing
is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3708 (Floodway Construction in
Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued.
         (f)   On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water.
            1.   Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than zero feet
when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and
including the base flood event shall be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the
design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded
flood easements.
            2.   A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be
obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flow.
            3.   All dams and impoundment structures, as defined in § 152.02,
shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702
(Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a
modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall
be demonstrated that:
               A.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest
by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater
detention;
               B.   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of
indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of
their life cycle, such as for spawning;
               C.   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded
water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual
bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation
basin;
               D.   A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
               E.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of
this section.
         (g)   Excavation in the floodway.
            1.   When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and
culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing
bridge and culvert Structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other
appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation.
            2.   The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used
unless an applicant’s engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the
same efficiency:
               A.    When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream’s length; and
               B.    When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream’s length; and
               C.    When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one-foot vertical transition for every ten feet of
stream length shall be used; and
               D.    Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream
and downstream of the transition sections.
         (h)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations.
            1.   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in §
152.20, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data
appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted
for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
            2.   If the floodway elevation at the site of the proposed
construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a
larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet:
               A.   The requirements of this section for the BFEs of the
designated floodway conditions; and
               B.    Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water
elevations.
            3.   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a public flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
         (i)   Conditional letter of map revision.
            1.   If the appropriate use would result in a change in the
designated floodway location or the BFE, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR
and FEMA all information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a
conditional designated floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a
conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is
issued.
            2.   The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA
until as-built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging,
or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. All
field surveys shall be conducted under the supervision of a registered P.E. or
registered land surveyor and shall be sealed. All required engineering analyses
shall be conducted under the supervision of a registered P.E., or in the case
of a federal project, by the federal agency and shall be so sealed or stated.
            3.   In the case of non-government projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the
proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval
can be given.
            4.   No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued.
            5.   After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating no
activities shall take place until a final LOMR is issued by FEMA with
concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
         (j)   Professional engineer’s supervision. All engineering analyses
shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered P.E.
         (k)   After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway
change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision,
construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed but no
buildings - or structures - or other construction that is not an appropriate
use may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and
a final letter of map revision is received. The designated floodway map will be
revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the as-built
plans.
      (4)   Permits for dams.
         (a)   Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of
a dam as defined in § 152,92 per 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Rules for

§ 152.23 PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOODPLAIN AREAS AND
PROTECTION OF BUILDINGS.
   In addition to the requirements found in §§
152.20 through
152.22 for development in flood fringes, designated floodways, and floodplains
where no floodways have been identified, the following requirements shall be
met.
   (A)   Public health and other standards.
      (1)   No developments in the floodplain shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal wastes, fertilizers, flammable
liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic materials below the FPE unless
such materials are stored in a floodproofed and anchored storage tank and
certified by a P.E. or floodproofed building constructed according to the

      (4)   New and replacement water supply systems, wells, sanitary sewer
lines and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted providing all
manholes or other above ground openings located below the FPE are watertight.
New and replacement on-site sanitary sewer lines or waste disposal systems
shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination
from them during flooding.
      (5)   All other activities, defined as development, such as pools,
fences, filling, paving, etc., shall be designed so as not to alter flood flows
or increase potential flood damages.
   (B)   Carrying capacity and notification of adjacent communities.
      (1)   For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream
maintenance (including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse
shall be maintained.
      (2)   In addition, the village shall notify adjacent communities in
writing 30 days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or
relocation of the watercourse.
   (C)   Protecting buildings.
      (1)   In addition to the damage prevention requirements in §§

152.21, all buildings located within a floodplain, shall be protected from
flood damage below the FPE. This building protection criteria applies to the
following situations:
         (a)   New construction or placement of a new building or alteration or
addition to an existing building valued at more than $1,000 or 70 square feet.
         (b)   Substantial improvements, including any combination of
alteration, repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, addition, or other
improvements made to an existing building that equal or exceed the market value
by 50%, or that increase the floor area by more than 20%. Alteration shall be
figured cumulatively ten-year period. If substantially improved, the existing
building and the addition must meet the flood protection standards of this
section.
         (c)   Any repairs made to a substantially damaged building.
Substantial damage shall be figured cumulatively ten-year period by comparing
the cost to repair the building to its pre-damage condition with the market
value of the building immediately prior to the damage, for each event in which
the building sustains damage, and adding the percentages of damage for each
event. If substantially damaged, the entire building must meet the flood
protection standards of this section.
         (d)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a manufactured
home on an existing site. (The building protection requirements do not apply
when returning a manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied before
it was removed to avoid flood damage).

foot minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies an alternative
method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures.
            4.   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or other structural measure.
            5.   The fill shall be composed of clean rock or soil and not
include debris or refuse material.
            6.   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface
drainage from or onto neighboring properties.

welfare, to adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to interpret and
implement the provisions of this Code to secure the intent thereof and to

kept on the site of operations open to village inspection during the entire
time of execution of the work and until the completion of the same.
         D.   Compliance with Code: The permit shall be a license to proceed

aside any of the provisions of this Code, except as specifically stipulated by
modification or legally granted variation as described in the application.
         E.   Time limitation of application: If, after such permit has been
granted, the operation covered by said permit is not initiated within three (3)
months of the date thereof, or if such operations are not diligently pursued to
completion without any extensive delays (more than thirty (30) days) in the
construction process, then such permit shall expire by the terms thereof, and

lien may be enforced by proceedings to foreclose as in case of mortgage or
mechanic’s lien.

development occurs and the time the respective entities receive tax revenue to
service such developments; and
      (4)    In order to preserve land values within the village and to provide
for the orderly growth of all services supporting the village and its
residents, it is essential that a one-time cash contribution be made for each
new residential and nonresidential building at the time of the issuance of a
building permit to cover the gap between the time that any such building is
occupied and the time any tax revenue is generated by reason of the
construction of such a building.

shall be made within 60 days following the date of the closing of the public
hearing.
      (3)   Action by Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees shall review the
proposed designation, the recommendations of the Historic Preservation
Commission, along with the Director of Community Development and staff, and
shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed historic district
designation within 60 days of receipt of the recommendation of the Historic
Preservation Commission. If the Board approves the application for a
designation, a notice will be sent to the property owner(s), the Director of
Community Development, the Building Commissioner, and the Village Clerk's
office that the area has been designated as such and that the buildings located
within the boundaries of the Historic District shall be subject to issuance of
certificate of appropriateness.
   (D)   Applications for nominations of landmarks and historic districts. Any
person, group of persons, or association may apply to the Historic Preservation
Commission for the designation of a landmark or historic district. Applications
for a nomination shall be filed with the Director of Community Development.
Persons wishing guidance or advice prior to completing an application may
contact the Historic Preservation Commission. The form of the application shall
be determined by the Historic Preservation Commission with consideration of
recommendations from the Director of Community Development and staff. At a
minimum, the application shall include the following:
      (1)   For a landmark:
         (a)   the name(s) and address(es) of the property owner(s).
         (b)   The legal description and common street address of the property.

§ 157.08 ZONING AMENDMENTS IN HISTORIC DISTRICTS.
   (A)   The Director of Community Development and the Director of Economic
Development shall advise the Historic Preservation Commission of all
applications for zoning amendments, variances, special use permits, or planned
unit development ordinances in any historic district.
   (B)   The Historic Preservation Commission may, at its discretion, present
evidence at a public hearing on the application, whether in support or in
opposition, or may recommend modifications.
(Ord. 88-0-029, passed 5-17-88)
§ 157.09 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   Certificate required. Except as provided in this section, no
construction, alteration, demolition, or removal of a designated landmark, or a
development within a Historic Preservation District shall be permitted without
a receipt of a certificate of appropriateness. Exterior siding, porch
improvements, railings, fences, satellite dishes, and exterior lighting which
are subject to other village regulations and building code requirements shall
also require a certificate of appropriateness.
   (B)   Review. Upon the filing of an application for a demolition or building
permit on property within a Historic Preservation District or designated as a
historic landmark, the Director of Community Development shall notify the
applicant of the need for a certificate of appropriateness, and shall notify
the Historic Preservation Commission of receipt of the application. The
application shall be reviewed by the Historic Preservation Commission
considering recommendations of the Director of Community Development and staff
shall decide whether the certificate should be approved, approved with
conditions or denied.
   (C)   Standards for issuing a certificate of appropriateness. In considering
whether to grant a certificate of appropriateness, the Historic Preservation
Commission shall consider the effect of the proposed construction, alteration,
removal, or demolition upon the historic, cultural, or architectural value,
character and significance of a landmark, or of a Historic Preservation
District. The standards to be used by the Commission in making its
determination shall include, but not limited to:
      (1)   Whether the project is compatible with the landmark or historic
district as a whole in terms of size, scale, and massing. As a guideline for
alterations or new construction, the building height shall be no greater than
that of the tallest existing structure and no less than the lowest existing
structure in the same block. The building street facade of the proposed
alterations or new construction shall be no wider or narrower than the widest
or narrowest street facade on the same block.
      (2)   The extent to which the alteration affects the distinctive
character of architectural features of the structure, including consideration
of the harmony of materials, details, height, mass, proportion, rhythm, scale,
setback, shape, street accessories, and workmanship. Proposed exterior
materials shall be compatible in type, scale, texture, and color with other
buildings in the same block. As a general guideline, asbestos siding, asphalt
siding, cast stone, artificial brick, aluminum, vinyl, or masonite clapboard
siding more than eight inches wide are not acceptable materials to be used
where visible from the street.
      (3)   The degree to which the proposed work would isolate the structure
from its historical or architectural surroundings.
      (4)   The compatibility of the architectural style and design of the
proposed work with the original architecture of the landmark or styles within a
historic district.
      (5)   The degree to which the proposed work is compatible with the
original design concept of the structure or with the general design
characteristics of the era which the structure represents.
      (6)   The degree to which the proposed building materials are compatible
with the aesthetic and structural appearance of the structure, including the
texture, style, and color of the materials and the proposed combination of
materials such as brick, stone, concrete, shingle, wood, and stucco.
      (7)   The degree to which the proposed work is compatible with additional
development guidelines adopted from time to time by the Historic Preservation
Commission for landmarks or historic districts.
      (8)   The relationship of the location of the proposed work to the
streets, public or semi-public ways and any other structures or property
contiguous to a landmark or within a historic district.
      (9)   The degree to which the proposed work involves the removal or
alteration of any historic or distinctive architectural features.
      (10)     The degree to which the proposed work is compatible with the US
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation (codified in 36 CFR
67), as may be amended from time to time. The following standards are to be
applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner, taking into
consideration economic and technical feasibility:
         (a)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed
in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of
the building and its site and environment.
         (b)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
         (c)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from
other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
         (d)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have
acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and
preserved.
         (e)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be
preserved.
         (f)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.
         (g)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that
cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
         (h)   Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
         (i)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
         (j)   New additions and adjacent or related construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the property and its environment shall be unimpaired.
         (k)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (D)   Guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings. The following
guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings are outlined in the US
Secretary of the Interior's publication, Standards for Rehabilitation and
Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings ("Standards for
Rehabilitation", or "Standards"). These principles shall apply to historic
buildings of all sizes, materials, occupancy and construction types whether
designated as a landmark or part of a Historic District. Please refer to
Standards for Rehabilitation for further details, which document is hereby
incorporated by reference into this chapter to the extent that it is not
inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter or Illinois law. The Village
Clerk shall at all times have at least three copies of the Standards for
Rehabilitation on file in his or her office for public use, and has had said
copies on file for at least 30 days prior to the adoption of this chapter.
      (1)   As stated in the definition, the treatment "REHABILITATION" assumes
that at least some repair or alteration of the historic building will be needed
in order to provide for an efficient contemporary use; however, these repairs
and alterations must not damage or destroy materials, features, or finishes
that are important in defining the building's historic character. For example,
certain treatments - if improperly applied - may cause or accelerate physical
deterioration of a historic building. This can include using improper
repainting or exterior masonry cleaning techniques, or introducing insulation
that damages historic fabric. In almost all of these situations, use of these
materials and treatments will result in a project that does not meet the
Standards. Similarly, exterior additions that duplicate the form, material, and
detailing of the structure to the extent that they compromise the historic
character of the structure will fail to meet the Standards.
      (2)   Identify, retain, and preserve. The guidance that is basic to the
treatment of all historic buildings: identifying, retaining, and preserving the
form and detailing of those architectural materials and features that are
important in defining the historic character is always recommended and
encouraged. Those actions that are most apt to cause the diminution or even
loss of the building's historic character are not recommended and are to be
discouraged.
      (3)   Protect and maintain. After identifying those materials and
features that are important and must be retained in the process of
rehabilitation work, then protecting and maintaining them should be addressed.
Protection generally involves the least degree of intervention and its
preparatory other work.
      (4)   Repair. When the physical condition of character-defining materials
and features warrants additional work, repairing is recommended. Guidance for
the repair of historic materials such as masonry, wood, and architectural
metals again begins with the least degree of intervention methods. Repairing
also includes the limited replacement in kind--or with a compatible substitute
material--of extensively deteriorated or missing parts of features when there
are surviving prototypes. Although using the same kind of material is always
the preferred option, substitute material is acceptable if the form and design
as well as the substitute material itself convey the visual appearance of the
remaining parts of the feature.
      (5)   Replace. Following repair in the hierarchy, guidance is provided
for replacing an entire character-defining feature with new material because
the level of deterioration or damage of materials precludes repair. If the
essential form and detailing are still evident so that the physical evidence
can be used to re-establish the feature as an integral part of the
rehabilitation project, then its replacement is appropriate.
      (6)   Design for missing historic features. When an entire interior or
exterior feature is missing, it no longer plays a role in physically defining
the historic character of the building unless it can be accurately recovered in
form and detailing through the process of carefully documenting the historical
appearance. Where an important architectural feature is missing, its recovery
is always recommended in the guidelines as the first, or preferred, course of
action. However, a second acceptable option for the replacement feature is a
new design that is compatible with the remaining character-defining features of
the historic building. The new design should always take into account the size,
scale, and material of the historic building itself and, most importantly,
should be clearly differentiated so that a false historical appearance is not
created.
      (7)   Alterations/additions to historic buildings. Some exterior and
interior alterations to the historic building are generally needed to assure
its continued use, but it is most important that such alterations do not
radically change, obscure, or destroy character defining spaces, materials,
features, or finishes. The construction of an exterior addition to a historic
building should be avoided, if possible, and considered only after it is
determined that those needs can not be met by altering secondary, i.e., non-
character defining interior spaces. If, after a thorough evaluation of interior
solutions, an exterior addition is still judged to be the only viable
alternative, it should be designed and constructed to be clearly differentiated
from the historic building and so that the character-defining features are not
radically changed, obscured, damaged, or destroyed.
      (8)   Health and safety code requirements; energy retrofitting. Work done
to meet health and safety code requirements (for example, providing barrier
free access to historic buildings); or retrofitting measures to conserve energy
(for example, installing solar collectors in an unobtrusive location on the
site) is quite often an important aspect of rehabilitation projects, but it is
usually not part of the overall process of protecting or repairing character-
defining features. Rather, such work is assessed for its potential negative
impact on the building's historic character. For this reason, particular care
must be taken not to radically change, obscure, damage, or destroy character-
defining materials or features in the process of rehabilitation work to meet
code and energy requirements.
   (E)   Care and maintenance of designated property. Any property, real estate
or improvement that is designated as a landmark, or which is within the
Historic Preservation District, whether owned or controlled privately or
publicly, shall receive reasonable care, maintenance and upkeep appropriate for
the preservation, protection, enhancement and perpetuation of the historic,
architectural and cultural atmosphere of the District.
   (F)   Action by the Historic Preservation Commission. At the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the Historic Preservation Commission following receipt of
a complete application for a certificate of appropriateness and the
recommendation of the Director of Community Development and appropriate staff,
and following written notification to the owner, the Commission shall review
the application.
      (1)   If the Commission finds that the activity proposed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Will not adversely affect the significant historical, cultural,
architectural, or archaeological character or significance of the designated
landmark or Historic Preservation District or cited in the application for
landmark designation;
         (b)   Is appropriate and consistent with the criteria established for
landmark designation set forth in division (A)(4); and/or
         (c)   Will remedy conditions imminently dangerous to life, health, or
safety as determined by the Building Department.
      Then, the certificate of appropriateness shall be granted.
      (2)   If the Historic Preservation Commission finds the activity proposed
by the applicant does not meet the provisions included in division (F)(1)
above, and will adversely affect the historic, architectural, archaeological,
or cultural character or significance of the landmark or Historic Preservation
District, then the Commission shall recommend to the Board of Trustees that the
certificate of appropriateness be denied and so advise the applicant and the
Building Department in writing of the denial.
         (a)   Upon receipt of notice of a recommended denial of an application
for a certificate of appropriateness, the applicant may submit evidence to the
Historic Preservation Commission of any hardship from the denial of the
application that would result in substantial economic loss. For a landmark or
landmark eligible structure:
            1.   If the Commission determines that a denial of a certificate of
appropriateness does not cause an undue economic hardship, the Commission may
recommend to the Board of Trustees to postpone the alteration, demolition, or
removal, and the Commission shall so notify the owner in writing. During the
period set forth for postponement, the Commission shall explore alternatives to
alteration, demolition, or removal. Such alternatives may include consultation
with private civic groups, interested private individuals and public agencies
in an effort to find a persuasive means of preserving the structure. If the
sale of the property is considered a feasible alternative to the owner, the
building must remain on the open market for six months. If, after a period not
to exceed six months, no alternative agreement has been reached with the
applicant, the Commission shall recommend to the Board that a certificate of
appropriateness be issued for alteration, demolition, or removal of the
structure in question.
         (b)   For any structure existing in the Historic District that is not
a landmark or landmark eligible structure:
            1.   If the Historic Preservation Commission determines that a
denial of a certificate of appropriateness does not cause an undue economic
hardship, every effort should be made to reach a compromise with the applicant
that would allow approval of a certificate of appropriateness.
      (3)   In recommending that the certificate of appropriateness be
approved, the Commission shall recommend conditions necessary to minimize the
adverse impact of the requested activity.
      (4)   The right of appeal.
         (a)   All persons shall have the right to appeal the Historic
Preservation Commission's decision pertaining to interpretation of the codes
contained in the Historic Preservation Chapter of the village. All appeals
shall be directed to the Building Committee which is appointed by the Board of
Trustees of the village. An application for appeal shall be based on a claim
that the true intent of this chapter or rules legally adopted thereunder have
been incorrectly interpreted.
         (b)   The application for appeal shall be filed in writing, addressed
to the Chairman of the Building Committee, and shall contain the following
information:
            1.   Name and address of the appellant.
            2.   Location of premises or property in question.
            3.   Division, article, and section of the chapter being contested.
            4.   Interpretation being contested.
            5.   Appellants' reasons for challenging the Committee's
interpretation stating the relief or solution requested.
            6.   Request for a hearing by the Building Committee to review the
matter.
         (c)   The Chairman shall respond to the appellant, and shall establish
a date and time for a meeting or hearing to be held within 60 days of receipt
of the appeal.
         (d)   The Building Committee shall conduct an open meeting or hearing
allowing the appellant an opportunity to be heard, and shall have the right to
seek counsel from professional and technical staff and consultants who may be
called upon to offer testimony which will aid the Committee in attempting to
arrive at a just decision in the matter being heard. The procedures shall not
require compliance with strict rules of evidence, but shall mandate that only
relevant information be received.
         (e)   The Building Committee, after due deliberation, shall render a
decision in writing within 21 days of completion of the hearing process. A
simple majority vote by the Committee shall constitute the Committee decision.
   (G)   Action by Board of Trustees. If there is still a dispute concerning
the denial of a certificate of appropriateness and all of the preceding options
have been explored, the concerned person, group of persons, or association may
request an appeal to the Board of Trustees. In making its decision, the Board
shall consider the recommendations of the Historic Preservation Commission, the
Director of Community Development and staff, and the criteria in division (A)
(4), and grant, grant with conditions, or deny the certificate of
appropriateness.

§ 158.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish high standards of landscaping
and buffering for all public and private properties within the village, promote
and enhance the village's aesthetic qualities and natural heritage, and
preserve and enhance property values within the village. These regulations are
intended to be a benefit to the owners and users of property, as an asset of
the neighborhoods, and as a source of identity and pride to the village. The
requirements of this chapter are also intended to promote the public health and
welfare by protecting to the maximum extent possible the village's existing
landscaping and buffering and by fostering and encouraging new or increased
creative and attractive landscaping and buffering. It is intended that these
requirements will improve the appearance of the village, as well as assist in
the natural control of air pollution and soil conservation. Standards for the
installation, and maintenance of bufferyards are also provided in this chapter
to ensure the compatibility of different land uses.

(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.05 CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL OF LANDSCAPING PLANS.
   The following criteria shall be used to evaluate proposed landscaping plans:
   (A)   Landscaping should be designed to be natural looking while having
proportion, balance, unity, variety of species, and variety of color throughout
the seasons;
   (B)   Landscaping materials that are native to the area should be selected
wherever feasible;
   (C)   As an architectural feature, landscaping should visually soften the
mass of the buildings, parking areas, and other structures;
   (D)   Landscaping should provide massings of natural colors and shapes to
offset the mass of a building and to provide a visual relief to the straight
lines of building architecture, parking lots and other man made features.
   (E)   Landscaping should reduce the intrusion of headlights and other glare;
   (F)   Landscaping should provide a safety barrier between vehicles and
pedestrians;
   (G)   Landscaping should offer a visual separation or screen between land
uses that have intense activities or significantly different appearances, or
that are otherwise incompatible to some degree;
   (H)   Landscaping should shade seating, walking, and outdoor activity areas,
shield buildings from winter wind and summer sun so as to conserve energy, and
should not interfere with clear access to the sun where solar energy collection
is anticipated;
   (I)   Landscaping should be designed to trap noise, odor and dust, control
erosion, and allow groundwater recharge;
   (J)   Landscaping should provide a natural habitat for birds and other
animal life, and should preserve existing natural vegetation and other natural
features of a site so as to enhance overall site design and protect animal
populations and other ecological systems;
   (K)   Landscaping should be innovative and creative, and should ensure the
proper long-term maintenance and replacement of landscaping as needed; and
   (1)   The best professional practices of the American Society of Landscape
Architects regarding planting, installation, and other maintenance should be
followed.
(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.06 TIME FOR INSTALLATION OF REQUIRED LANDSCAPING.
   (A)   All landscaping, including mulching and seeding, shall be completed in
accordance with the approved site plan or special use approval prior to
issuance of an occupancy permit for the site. This shall apply to all types of
developments, except single family detached residential developments of less
than seven units.
   (B)   The village may issue a temporary occupancy permit until the earliest
planting season if landscaping is delayed due to unusual conditions, such as
drought, ice, over-saturated soil (deep mud), or inappropriate planting season
for the plant species, unavailability of plant species, or other circumstances
beyond the applicant's control, provided that the developer or property owner
provides the village with a letter of credit approved by the Village Attorney
ensuring the installation of the remaining landscape materials.
   (C)   All landscaping for single family residential developments of seven
units or more shall be completed in accordance with the approved site plan at
the time that 80% of the development is completed or within the next planting
season following occupancy, whichever comes first. If the development is built
in phases, than the landscaping shall be completed as 80% of each phase is
completed or within the next planting season following occupancy, whichever
comes first. The developer or property owner shall provide the village with a
letter of credit approved by the Village Attorney ensuring the installation of
the landscape materials. The developer or property owner shall be notified by
the Planning Department of any incomplete landscape installation and shall be
given 15 days to respond to the notice.
(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.07 VEGETATED BUFFERYARD REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Bufferyards shall be required to provide open space and natural
barriers around the perimeter of a proposed land use in order to separate and
screen the proposed use from adjacent development, vacant land, or roads.
   (B)   Bufferyard requirements supplement the minimum setbacks required in a
given zoning district by imposing vegetation protection, landscaping and
fencing or screening requirements. The width, amount of vegetation and other
features of a bufferyard will vary depending on the nature of adjacent
development, vacant land, or road.
(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.08 LOCATION OF BUFFERYARD.
   The buffers required by this chapter shall be located along the entire
perimeter of a lot or parcel, except at approved entrances or exits to the
property or in required sight triangles. Bufferyards shall extend to the lot
line, parcel boundary line or right of way line, except where easements,
covenants or natural features may require the bufferyard to be set back from
the property line.
(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.09 REQUIRED BUFFERYARD FOR SPECIAL USES PROPOSED IN RESIDENTIAL
DISTRICTS.
   Any special use proposed in the R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 districts shall be
separated from any residential lot by a Class C bufferyard. Refer to Appendix A
for all other bufferyard requirements.
(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.10 REQUIRED BUFFERYARD FOR ANY USES PROPOSED IN A NONRESIDENTIAL
DISTRICT.
   The class of the bufferyard required between a proposed land use in any
nonresidential district and an adjacent land use shall be determined by
referring to Appendix A of this chapter for the appropriate type of zoning
district. The required bufferyard is determined by cross-referencing the
"proposed land use" with the appropriate "adjacent land use." If a proposed
land use is not shown on the chart, the Village Staff shall determine the
appropriate bufferyard. Any decision by the Village Staff may be appealed to
the Plan Commission.
(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.11 REDUCED BUFFERYARD REQUIREMENTS FOR IRREGULARLY SHAPED PARCELS.
   When a parcel contains a "panhandle" or other narrow shape, the bufferyard
requirements may be reduced along the irregular portion of the parcel
perimeter.
(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.12 BUFFERYARD SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   The bufferyard illustrations, which follow graphically, indicate the
width and number of plants required per 100 linear feet. To determine the total
number of plants required, the length of each side of the property requiring a
given class of buffer shall be divided by 100 and multiplied by the number of
plants shown in any of the options in the illustration.
Any buffer area, which overlaps another buffer area, shall be subtracted from
the total to avoid double counting. If the calculations required by this
section yield a fractional number, that number shall be rounded up to the next
highest whole number.
   (B)   The developer or owner of the property shall determine the arrangement
of plants in the bufferyard.
   (C)   Existing trees and vegetation within a required buffer, which meet
these requirements may be counted toward the total bufferyard plant material
requirements. If existing trees and plants do not fully meet the standards for
the type of buffer required, additional vegetation shall be planted. Other
existing site features within the required buffer area which do not otherwise
function to meet the standards for the required buffer shall be screened from
the view of other properties or removed, as determined during review and
approval of the site plan or major special use.
(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.13 FENCES, WALLS, BERMS AND HEDGES.
   Fences, walls, berms and/or hedges may be required to supplement required
plant materials if the Department of Community Development determines that
additional screening is necessary to shield a proposed land use from adjacent
uses. Fences, walls or berms may be used to replace one-half of the required
plantings in bufferyards D or E with the approval of the Planning Department.
If required, fences, walls, berms or hedges shall be constructed in accordance
with the following specifications:
   (A)   Fences, walls and solid hedgerows shall be not less than five feet in
height nor more than six feet in height in residential areas and eight feet in
height in nonresidential areas around the perimeter of the property.
   (B)   Fences and walls for residential developments over seven units and all
nonresidential development shall be made of natural materials, such as wooden
picket fences, wood stockade fences or brick or masonry walls.
   (C)   Hedges shall consist of densely planted compact evergreens.
   (D)   Earthen berms shall not be less than three feet in height and shall be
covered with grass or other living vegetative ground cover.
(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.14 USE OF BUFFERYARDS.
   A bufferyard may be used for passive recreation or for utility or drainage
easements, provided that the utility requirements and the bufferyard
requirements are compatible.
(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.15 OWNERSHIP OF BUFFERYARDS.
   Bufferyards may remain in the ownership of the owner of the lot, or they may
be subjected to deed restrictions and subsequently conveyed to a homeowners'
association, provided that any such conveyance adequately guarantees the
protection and maintenance of the bufferyards for the purposes of this chapter.
(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.16 NO DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE REQUIRED BUFFER.
   The required buffer shall not contain any development, impervious surfaces,
or site features that do not function to meet the standards of this chapter. No
grading, development, or land-disturbing activities shall occur within the
buffer unless approved by the Plan Commission at the time of site plan, if
required, or special use approval, if required.
(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.17 EASEMENTS.
   Nothing shall be planted or installed within an underground or overhead
utility easement or a drainage easement without the consent of the village.
(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.18 INTERIOR LOT LANDSCAPING.
   Except for parking lot interiors provided for in §
158.20 below, the following interior lot landscaping standards apply to single
family detached residential developments of seven or more units, and to all
other types of multi-family and nonresidential development:
   (A)   Areas of the lot not covered by structures or pavement shall be
planted with live landscaping.
   (B)   Decorative stone, brick, or pavement may be used for edging planting
beds but may not cover more than 20% of the landscaped area.
   (C)   Live species shall be planted along the front and sidewalls of non-
residential buildings and along the rear walls of non-residential buildings
wherever feasible.
   (D)   Shade trees should be located on the south side of buildings wherever
feasible to block summer sun.
   (E)   Plantings shall be clustered along long walls and fences to soften the
visual effect of the horizontal lines.
   (F)   Building foundations shall be landscaped to provide massings of
natural colors and shapes to offset the mass of the building and to provide
visual relief to the straight lines of building architecture, parking lots and
other man-made features.
   (G)   The precise location of all plantings shall be shown on the
landscaping plan. The plantings shall be far enough away from the foundation
and pavement to allow roots to spread and mature growth to occur. Plantings may
be clustered along the building wall.
   (H)   Only small trees, small shrubs and flowers may be planted in raised
containers.
   (I)   Courtyards, berms and other landscaping features may be allowed if
approved in the landscaping plan.
   (J)   A minimum ten foot wide landscaped area shall front not less than 70%
of the side of all buildings which front dedicated streets or major interior
access lanes.
   (K)   A minimum of one tree is required per dwelling for multi-family
residential development, one tree per 10,000 square feet of lot area for
commercia1/office development, and one tree per 25,000 square feet of lot area

(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.19 PARKWAY STANDARDS.
   All uses which require site plan or special use approval shall install and
maintain trees along any parkway which abuts the perimeter of the property.
   (A)   The parkway shall be grass or low ground cover, except where covered
by driveway pavement, trees, or shrubs or a strip of paver bricks, or stones
(six inches or more in diameter) set in mortar, that strip being two feet wide
or less and being located along the curb. This applies to all zoning districts
except the following: R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6 and R-7.
   (B)   A minimum of one parkway tree per 50 feet of frontage is required for
all development; provided, however, a minimum of one parkway tree per 25 feet
of frontage is required for all non-residential development in the B-1, B-2, B-
3, B-4 and B-5 Districts and also in the ORI Office and Restricted Industrial
District and M-1 General Manufacturing District under the Tinley Park Zoning
Ordinance.
   (C)   The use of loose stone, rock, or gravel is prohibited on public
parkways. Compacted cobbles, flagstone, or other rocks may be approved if these
features are compacted firmly into the ground or mortared, reducing risk of
being scattered in the street.
   (D)   Trees shall be planted on the centerline of parkways or as close to
five feet from the sidewalk as possible and located so as not to interfere with
overhead wires or traffic or pedestrian safety.
   (E)   A minimum parkway width of four feet is required for trees in a
parkway.
   (F)   Wherever feasible, parkway trees shall be planted on the public
parkway and not on the private property side of the sidewalk.
   (G)   Parkway trees shall consist of shorter trees if overhead utilities
exist or if the street is subject to widening in the future. Otherwise, taller
trees are required as shown in the following list. A mixture of trees shall be
planted whenever feasible.
(Ord. 99-0-053, passed 8-17-99)
§ 158.20 PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING.
   In addition to the interior lot landscaping required by §
158.18 the following standards shall apply to parking lots:
   (A)   Design Standards. The design of the landscaped areas, the selection of
plant materials, and the vehicular use area shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   All open automobile parking areas shall have parking lot
landscaping that is evenly placed throughout the lot.
      (2)   All parking lot areas shall be screened from the view of adjacent
properties and streets by evergreen plantings that will attain a height of,

The use of shrubs and ground covers is encouraged in parking area islands and
along the borders of parking areas.
      (3)   Each canopy tree shall be provided with at least 300 square feet of
pervious ground area for root growth. This dimension shall be measured from the
insides of the curbs.
      (4)   The size of the planting area and the size of plant material at
maturity shall allow for a three foot bumper overhang from the face of the
curb.
      (5)   All sidewalks shall be at least ten feet from the trunks of large
trees, unless otherwise approved by the Village Engineer where the placement of
the sidewalk would require the removal of an existing large tree to meet this
requirement or where there is not enough space on the site to accommodate both
the tree and the sidewalk.
      (6)   Curbs shall be provided between vehicular use areas and landscaped
areas.
      (7)   Parking lots shall be graded so that landscape islands do not
impound water, unless surface impoundment is required as a method of on-site
retention of stormwater.
      (8)   Groves of trees, as well as isolated islands with single trees, are
encouraged.
      (9)   At least 15% of the parking lot shall be covered by landscaping,
that 15% being exclusive of required bufferyards and foundation planting areas.
   (B)   Parking Lot Island Standards.
      (1)   Each island shall be at least 200 square feet and at least ten feet
wide. Larger islands are encouraged, however, especially where canopy trees are
provided.
      (2)   Each island shall include at least one tree and one shrub per 200
square feet of island green area.
      (3)    Landscaping on each island shall be located so as not to cause a
traffic hazard.
      (4)   The islands shall be located at the end of each row of parking
stalls or as otherwise approved in the landscaping plan.
      (5)   Evergreen trees may be used in islands of at least 400 square feet.
   (C)   Installation Standards.
      (1)   Basic vegetation size standards shall include the following:

to determine how the berms shall relate to drainage and public utilities.
   (D)   Maintenance Standards.
      (1)   The plantings in any landscaped area must be properly maintained in
order for the landscaped area to fulfill the purposes for which it was
established. The owner of the property and any tenant on the property where a
landscaped area is required shall be jointly and severally responsible for the
maintenance of all plant material within the landscaped area. Such maintenance
shall include all actions necessary to keep the landscaped areas free of litter
and debris and to keep plantings healthy and orderly in appearance.
      (2)   All landscape materials required by this chapter in any business or
commercial, industrial and/or office developments shall be installed in
accordance with the standard practices of horticultural professionals and in
good and workmanlike manner and shall be maintained by the property owner in
good condition. All applicants for landscape plan approval shall file a
maintenance schedule and the scope of maintenance work with the Planning
Director and the Code Enforcement Officer. Such maintenance schedule shall be
subject to the approval of the village. Any damaged or dead trees, shrubs or
ground cover shall be replaced promptly. Maintenance of landscaped areas shall
include continuous operations for removal of weeds; mowing; trimming; edging;
cultivation; reseeding; plant replacement; appropriate fertilization; spraying;
control of pests, insects and rodents by non-toxic methods wherever possible;
watering; and any other operations necessary to assure normal plant growth and
good health. The obligation for continuous maintenance shall be binding on the

      (4)   The adjacent property owner shall maintain a parkway unless an
agreement for maintenance has been reached with the village.
      (5)   The plantings, fences, walls or berms that constitute a buffer must
be properly maintained in order for the buffer to fulfill the purpose for which
it is established. The owner of the property and any tenant on the property
where a buffer is required shall be jointly and severally responsible for the
maintenance of all buffer materials. Such maintenance shall include all actions
necessary to keep the buffer free of litter and debris, to keep walls, fences,
and berms in good repair and neat appearance. All buffer materials shall be
protected from damage by motor vehicles or pedestrians, which could reduce the
effectiveness of the buffer.
      (6)   In the event that any vegetation or physical element functioning to
meet the standards of this section is severely damaged due to an unusual
weather occurrence or natural catastrophe, the owner shall have one year or one
growing season, whichever is sooner, to replace or replant.
