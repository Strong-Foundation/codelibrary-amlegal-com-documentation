consideration, as the case may be, shall have the right to open and close
debate.
      (2)   The Village Board, by motion, may limit debate. The presiding
officer shall have the right to participate in debate.
      (3)   While a member is speaking, no Trustee shall hold any private
discussion, nor pass between the speaker and the Chair.
   (G)   Call of Trustees to order. A Trustee, when called to order by the
Chair, shall thereupon discontinue speaking and take his or her seat and the
order or ruling of the Chair shall be binding and conclusive, subject only to
the right to appeal.
   (H)   Appeals from decision of the Chair.
      (1)   Any Trustee may appeal to the Board from a ruling of the Chair, and
if the appeal is seconded, the Trustee making the appeal may briefly state his
or her reason for the same, and the Chair may briefly explain his or her
ruling; but there shall be no debate on the appeal and no other person shall
participate in the discussion. The presiding officer shall have the right to
participate in debate.
      (2)   The Chair shall then put the question, “Shall the decision of the
Chair be sustained?”. If a majority of the Trustees present vote “No”, the
decision of the Chair shall be overruled; otherwise, it shall be sustained.
   (I)   Question of personal privilege. The right of a member to address the
Board on a question of personal privilege shall be limited to cases in which
his or her integrity, character or motives are assailed, questioned or
impugned.
   (J)   Voting. Every other member who shall be present when a question is
stated from the Chair shall vote thereon, unless he or she is personally
interested in the question, in which case, he or she shall take whatever steps
are necessary to ensure that his or her vote is not taken.
   (K)   Special order of business. Any matter before the Village Board may be
set down as a special order of business at a time certain if two-thirds of the
Trustees present vote in the affirmative, but not otherwise.
   (L)   Seconding of motions required; written motions. No motion shall be put
or debated in the meeting or in committee unless it be seconded. When a motion
is seconded, it shall be stated by the presiding officer before debate, and
every motion in the Board, except motions of procedure, shall be reduced to
writing if required by a member, and the proposer of the motion shall be
entitled to the floor.
   (M)   Division of questions. If any question under consideration contains
several distinct propositions, the Trustees, by a majority vote of the Trustees
present, may divide such question.
   (N)   Record of motions. In all cases where a resolution or motion is
entered in the journal, the name of the Trustee moving the same shall be
entered also.
   (O)   Announcement and changes of vote. The result of all votes by yeas and
nays shall not be announced by the Clerk, but shall be handed by him or her to
the Chairperson for announcement, and no vote shall be changed after the tally
list has passed from the hands of the Clerk.
   (P)   Precedence of motions. When a question is under debate, the following
motions shall be in order and shall have precedence over each other in order,

   (Q)   Motions to adjourn.
      (1)   A motion to adjourn the Village Board shall always be in order,

         (a)   When a Trustee is in possession of the floor;
         (b)   While the yeas and nays are being called;
         (c)   When the members are voting;
         (d)   When adjournment was the last preceding motion; and
         (e)   When it has been decided that the previous question shall be
taken.
      (2)   A motion simply to adjourn shall not be subject to amendment or
debate, but a motion to adjourn to a time certain shall be.
      (3)   The Village Board may, at any time, adjourn over one or more
regular meetings on a vote of a majority of all the Trustees authorized by law
to be elected.
   (R)   Previous question. When the previous question is moved on the main
question and seconded, it shall be put on this form: “Shall the main question
now be put?”. If such motion be carried, all further amendments and all further
motions and debate shall be excluded, and the question put without delay upon
the pending amendment in proper order and then upon the main question.
   (S)   Motions to lay on the table and to take from the table.
      (1)   A motion simply to lay the question on the table shall not be
debatable, but a motion to lay on the table and publish, or with any other
condition shall be subject to amendment and debate.
      (2)   A motion to take any motion or other proposition from the table may
be proposed at the same meeting at which such motion or proposition was laid
upon the table, provided two-thirds of the Trustees vote therefor.
      (3)   A motion to lay any particular motion or proposition on the table
shall apply to that motion or proposition only. An amendment to the main
question or other pending question may be laid on the table and neither the
main question nor such other pending question shall be affected thereby.
   (T)   Indefinite postponement; motion to defer or postpone without any
reference to time.
      (1)   When consideration of a motion or other proposition is postponed
indefinitely, it shall not be again taken up at the same meeting.
      (2)   A motion to postpone indefinitely shall not open the main question
to debate.
      (3)   A motion to defer or postpone without any reference to time shall
not be construed as a motion to postpone indefinitely, but shall be considered
to be of the same general nature and to possess the same general attributes so
far as applicable under these rules, as a motion to postpone indefinitely or to
a time certain.
   (U)   Motion to refer. A motion to refer to a standing committee shall take
precedence over a similar motion to refer to a special committee.
   (V)   Motion to amend.
      (1)   A motion to amend an amendment shall be in order, but one to amend
an amendment to an amendment shall not be entertained.
      (2)   An amendment modifying the intention of a motion shall be in order;
but an amendment relating to a different subject shall not be in order.
      (3)   On an amendment to “Strike Out and Insert”, the paragraph to be
amended shall first be read as it stands, then the words proposed to be
stricken out, then those to be inserted, and finally, the paragraph as it will
stand if so amended shall be read.
      (4)   An amendment to the main question or other pending questions may be
referred to a committee and neither the main question nor such other pending
question shall be affected thereby.

times proposed, the question shall be taken first on the least sum or the
longest time.
   (X)   Motion to substitute. A substitute for any original proposition under
debate or for any pending amendment or such proposition may be entertained
notwithstanding that at such time, further amendment is admissible; and if
accepted by the Trustees by a vote shall entirely supersede such original
proposition or amendment, as the case may be, and cut off all amendments
appertaining thereto.
   (Y)   Reconsideration.
      (1)   (a)   A vote or question may be reconsidered at any time during the
same meeting, or at the first regular meeting held thereafter.
         (b)   A motion for reconsideration having been once made and decided
in the negative shall not be renewed, nor shall a motion to reconsider be
reconsidered.
      (2)   A motion to reconsider must be made and seconded by Trustees who
voted on the prevailing side of the question to be reconsidered, unless
otherwise provided by law; provided, however, that where a motion has received
a majority vote in the affirmative, but is declared lost solely on the ground
that a greater number of affirmative votes is required by statute for the
passage or adoption of such motion, then in such case, a motion to reconsider
may be made and seconded only by those who voted in the affirmative on such
question to be reconsidered.
   (Z)   Adoption of Robert’s Rules of Order Revised. The rules of
parliamentary practice comprised in the latest published edition of Robert’s
Rules of Order Revised shall govern the Board in all cases to which they are
applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with the special rules of the
Board.
   (AA)   Temporary suspension of rules; amendment of rules. These rules may be
temporarily suspended by a vote of two-thirds of the corporate authorities
entitled by law to be elected and shall not be repealed, altered or amended,
unless by concurrence of two-thirds of all the corporate authorities entitled
by law to be elected.
   (BB)   Censure of Trustees; expulsion of Trustees. Any Trustee acting or
appearing in a lewd or disgraceful manner, or who uses opprobrious, obscene and

members present, or expelled by a two-thirds vote of all Trustees elected.

(2009 Code, § 1-2-11) (Ord. 17-22, passed 4-10-2017)
§ 31.21 AGENDA.
   (A)   An itemized agenda, along with all necessary supporting documentation
shall be furnished to each member of the Village Board no later than 48 hours
prior to the regular Village Board meeting.
   (B)   In the case of matters of emergency which could not have been
reasonably foreseen in sufficient time to comply with this section, a revised
agenda shall be furnished to each member of the Village Board prior to the
opening of the Board meeting.
(5 ILCS 120/2.02) (2009 Code, § 1-2-12)
ORDINANCES
§ 31.35 ORDINANCES.
   (A)   Attorney. It shall be the duty of the Village Attorney to prepare such
ordinances as may be required by the Village Board.
   (B)   Introduced. When a proposed ordinance is introduced, it may be read
one time by title only and referred to the proper committee unless the Board of
Trustees shall otherwise specifically direct.
   (C)   Vote required; yeas and nays record.
      (1)   The passage of all ordinances for whatever purpose, and of any
resolution or motion:
         (a)   To create any liability against a village; or
         (b)   For the expenditure or appropriation of its money, shall require
the concurrence of a majority of all members then holding office on the Village
Board, including the President, unless otherwise expressly provided by the code
or any other act governing the passage of any ordinance, resolution or motion;
provided that, where the Board consists of an odd number of Trustees, the vote
of the majority of the Trustees shall be sufficient to pass an ordinance.
      (2)   The yeas and nays shall be taken upon the question of the passage
of the designated ordinances, resolutions or motions and recorded in the
journal of the Village Board. In addition, the corporate authorities at any
meeting may by unanimous consent to take a single vote by yeas or nays on the
several questions of the passage on any two or more of the designated
ordinances, orders, resolutions or motions placed together for voting purposes
in a single group. The single vote shall be entered separately in the journal
under the designation “omnibus vote”, and in such event the Clerk may enter the
words “omnibus vote” or “consent agenda” in the journal in each case in lieu of
entering names of the members of Village Board voting “yea” and of those voting
“nay” on the passage of each of the designated ordinances, orders, resolutions
and motions included in such omnibus group or consent agenda. The taking of
such single or omnibus vote and such entries of the words “omnibus vote” or
“consent agenda” in the journal shall be a sufficient compliance with the
requirements of this section to all intents and purposes and with like effect
as if the vote in each case had been separately by yeas and nays on the
question of the passage of each ordinance, order, resolution and motion
included in such omnibus group, and separately recorded in the journal.
Likewise, the yeas and nays shall be taken upon the question of the passage of
any other resolution or motion at the request of any Trustee and shall be
recorded in the journal.
(65 ILCS 5/3.1-40-40)
   (D)   Ordinances; approval; veto.
      (1)   All resolutions and motions:
         (a)   Which create any liability against the village;
         (b)   That provide for the expenditure or appropriation of its money;
or
         (c)   To sell any village property, and all ordinances, passed by the
Village Board shall be deposited with the Village Clerk.
      (2)   If the President approves an ordinance or resolution, the President
shall sign it. Those ordinances, resolutions and motions which the President
disapproves shall be returned to the Village Board, with the President’s
written objections, at the next regular meeting of the Village Board occurring
not less than five days after their passage. The President may disapprove of
any one or more sums appropriated in any ordinance, resolution or motion making
an appropriation, and, if so, the remainder shall be effective. However, the
President may disapprove entirely of an ordinance, resolution or motion making
an appropriation. If the President fails to return any ordinance or any
specified resolution or motion with his or her written objections, within the
designated time, it shall become effective despite the absence of the
President’s signature.
(65 ILCS 5/3.140-45) (2009 Code, § 1-2-14)
§ 31.36 RECONSIDERATION; PASSING OVER VETO.
   Every resolution and motion, specified in §
31.35 and every ordinance, that is returned to the Village Board by the
President, shall be reconsidered by the Village Board at the next regular
meeting following the regular meeting at which the Village Board receives the
President’s written objection. If, after reconsideration, two-thirds of all the
Trustees then holding office on the Village Board agree at that regular meeting
to pass an ordinance, resolution or motion, notwithstanding the President’s
refusal to approve it, then it shall be effective. The vote on the question of
passage over the President’s veto shall be by yeas and nays, and shall be
recorded in the journal.
(65 ILCS 5/3.1-40-50) (2009 Code, § 1-2-15)
§ 31.37 NO VOTE TO BE RECONSIDERED AT SPECIAL MEETING.
   No vote of the Village Board shall be reconsidered or rescinded at a special
meeting unless there are present at the special meeting at least as many
Village Trustees as were present when the vote was taken.

days nor more than ten days after the removal. If the President fails or
refuses to report to the corporate authorities the reasons for the removal, or
if the corporate authorities by a two-thirds vote of all members authorized by
law to be elected disapprove of the removal, the officer thereupon shall be
restored to the office from which the officer was removed. The vote shall be by

the village that every effort shall be made to provide funds for disaster
emergencies.
   (B)   It is the Village Board’s intent that the first recourse shall be to
funds regularly appropriated to the agency. If the President finds that the
demands placed upon these funds in coping with a particular disaster are
unreasonably great, and the Governor has proclaimed the village a disaster, he
or she may make application for funds from the state disaster relief fund. If
monies available from the fund are insufficient, and if the President finds

sources. If less than a quorum of the members of the Village Board is capable

Board. Any order or proclamation declaring, continuing or terminating a local
disaster emergency shall be given prompt and general publicity, and shall be
filed promptly with the Municipal Clerk.
   (B)   The effect of a declaration of a local disaster emergency is to
activate any and all applicable local emergency operations plans and to
authorize the furnishing of aid and assistance thereunder.
   (C)   During a local disaster emergency, the President may suspend the
provisions of any municipal ordinance prescribing procedures for the conduct of
municipal business, or the orders, rules and regulations of any municipal
agency, if strict compliance with the provisions of any ordinance, rule or
regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping
with the emergency, as authorized by the Illinois Emergency Management Agency
Act, provided that, if the Village Board meets at such time, he or she shall
act subject to the directions and restrictions imposed by that body.

corporations or bodies politic as are parties thereto, in the manner provided

management operations to render assistance in accordance with the provisions of
such mutual aid arrangements.
(2009 Code, § 30-3-9)
§ 34.059 COMMUNICATIONS.
   The local Emergency Management Agency shall ascertain what means exist for

character and feasibility of any system or its several parts, the agency shall
evaluate the possibility of multipurpose use thereof for general municipal and
local governmental purposes. The agency shall make recommendations to the
President as appropriate.

practice any profession, trade or occupation are required in this village to

licensed or registered in this village to practice such profession, trade or
occupation may be insufficient for such purpose, then any persons who are
licensed elsewhere to practice any such profession, trade or occupation may, if
a member of another political subdivision rendering aid in this village
pursuant to the order of the head of that political subdivision and upon the
request of the village, or if otherwise requested so to do by the president or
the coordinator of this village, during the time the disaster condition

emergency by the President as is described in §

INVESTMENT POLICY
§ 36.001 INVESTMENT POLICY.
   It is the policy of the village to invest public funds in a manner which
will provide the highest investment return with the maximum security while
meeting the daily cash flow demands of the village and conforming to all state
and local statutes governing the investment of public funds.
(2009 Code, § 1-5-1)
§ 36.002 SCOPE.
   This policy includes all public funds governed by the Board of Trustees.
(2009 Code, § 1-5-2)
§ 36.003 PRUDENCE.
   (A)   Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances
then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence
exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for
investment, considering the probable safety of their capital, as well as the
probable income to be derived.
   (B)   The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be
the “prudent person” standard and shall be applied in the context of managing
an overall portfolio.
(2009 Code, § 1-5-3)
§ 36.004 OBJECTIVE.
   (A)   The primary objective, in order of priority, shall be:
      (1)   Legality. Conformance with federal, state and other legal
requirements;
      (2)   Safety. Preservation of capital and protection of investment
principal;
      (3)   Liquidity. Maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet operating
requirements; and
      (4)   Yield. Attainment of market rates of return.
   (B)   The portfolio should be reviewed periodically as to its effectiveness
in meeting the village’s needs for safety, liquidity, rate of return,
diversification and its general performance.
(2009 Code, § 1-5-4)
§ 36.005 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
   Management and administrative responsibility for the investment program is
hereby delegated to the Treasurer who may establish written procedures for the

(2009 Code, § 1-5-5)
§ 36.006 ETHICS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from

make impartial decisions.
(2009 Code, § 1-5-6)
§ 36.007 AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL DEALERS AND INSTITUTIONS.
   (A)   The Treasurer will maintain a list of financial institutions

§ 36.009 COLLATERALIZATION.
   Collateralization may be required, at the discretion of the village, on all

security for all funds, the collateralization level will be a minimum of 102%
of market value of principal and accrued interest.
(2009 Code, § 1-5-9)
§ 36.010 SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY.
   All security transactions, including collateral for repurchase agreements,

custodial agreement.
(2009 Code, § 1-5-10)
§ 36.011 DIVERSIFICATION.
   The village shall diversify its investments to the best of its ability based

in, and length of maturity.
(2009 Code, § 1-5-11)
§ 36.012 MAXIMUM MATURITIES.
   (A)   To the extent possible, the village shall attempt to match its
investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a
specific cash flow, the village will not directly invest in securities maturing
more than two years from the date of purchase.
   (B)   Reserve funds may be invested in securities exceeding two years if the
maturity of such investments are made to coincide as nearly as practicable with
the expected use of the funds.
(2009 Code, § 1-5-12)
§ 36.013 INTERNAL CONTROL.
   (A)   The Treasurer is responsible for establishing and maintaining an
internal control structure designed to insure that the assets of the village

      (2)   Separation of transaction authority from accounting;
      (3)   Custodial safekeeping; and

wire transfers.
(2009 Code, § 1-5-13)
§ 36.014 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The investment portfolio will be managed in accordance with the parameters
specified within this policy. The portfolio should obtain a comparable rate of
return during a market/economic environment of stable interest rates. Portfolio
performance should be compared to benchmarks with similar maturity, liquidity
and credit quality as the portfolio maintained by the Illinois Public
Treasurer’s Investment Pool (IPTIP).
(2009 Code, § 1-5-14)
§ 36.015 REPORTING.
   The Treasurer shall prepare an investment report at least monthly. The
report should be provided to the Village Board and available upon request. The
report should be in a format suitable for review by the general public. An

market value of the portfolio shall be issued to the Village Board quarterly.
(2009 Code, § 1-5-15)

   (B)   Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge
where the village determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the

benefitting the general public. Waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public
interest if the principal purpose of the request is to access and disseminate
information regarding the health, safety and welfare or the legal rights of the
general public and is not for the principal purpose of personal or commercial

§ 36.072 EXTENSION OF TIME LIMIT; NOTICE.
   (A)   The time limit prescribed in §
36.071 may be extended in each case for not more than seven additional working
days for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   The requested records are stored in whole or in part at other
locations other than the office having charge of the requested records;
      (2)   The request requires the collection of a substantial number of
specified records;
      (3)   The request is couched in categorical terms and requires an
extensive search for the records responsive to it;
      (4)   The requested records require examination and evaluation by
personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they
are exempt from disclosure under the terms of the Illinois Freedom of
Information Act or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions;
      (5)   The request for records cannot be complied with by the village
within the time limits prescribed by this division (A) without unduly burdening
or interfering with the village;
      (6)   The requested records have not been located in the course of
routine search and additional efforts are being made to locate them; and

practicable speed, with another public body or among two or more components of
a public body having a substantial interest in the determination or in the
subject matter of the request.
   (B)   When additional time is required for any of the above reasons, the
Clerk shall notify the person making the request, by letter, within the time
limits specified in this section, of the reasons for the delay and the date by
which the records will be made available or denial will be forthcoming. In no
instance may the delay in processing last longer than seven working days. A
failure to render a decision within seven working days shall be considered a
denial of the request.
(2009 Code, § 15-1-8)
§ 36.073 UNDULY BURDENSOME REQUEST.
   (A)   (1)   Requests calling for all records falling within a category shall
be complied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome
for the village, there is no method of narrowing the request, and the burden on
the village strongly outweighs the public interest in the information.
      (2)   If the village responds to a categorical request by stating that
compliance would unduly burden its operation, it shall do so in a writing
signed by the Clerk specifying the reasons why it would be unduly burdensome
and the extent to which compliance will so burden the operation of the village.
   (B)   (1)   After receipt of this response in writing, the person making the
request shall have an opportunity to reduce the request to manageable
proportions.
      (2)   If the person making the request fails to reduce the request to
manageable proportions, the response of the village shall be treated as a
denial of the request information.
(2009 Code, § 15-1-9)
§ 36.074 CERTAIN INFORMATION EXEMPT FROM INSPECTION AND COPYING.
   Information exempted by 5 ILCS 140/7 of the Freedom of Information Act shall
be exempt from inspection and copying. If a record contains both exempt and
nonexempt information, the exempt information shall be deleted and the
remainder of the record made available for inspection and copying.

requestor, by letter, of the decision to deny the information, and the reason
for the denial. Each notice of denial by the Clerk shall inform the person of
his or her right to appeal to the Village President in accordance with 5 ILCS
140/10 of the Freedom of Information Act. When a request is denied on the
grounds that the records are exempt under the provisions of this subchapter,

denial and briefly explain how the exemption applies to the specified records
withheld.
   (B)   A requestor may appeal a denial of a request for public records to the
Village President. All appeals shall be in writing, shall be addressed to the
Village President in an envelope clearly marked “FOIA APPEAL”, and shall
include a copy of the original request, a copy of the denial or a statement
that the village failed to respond within seven working days; and a written
statement setting forth the reasons the requestor believes the appeal should be
granted.

(2009 Code, § 15-1-15)
IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION POLICY
§ 36.090 COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW.
   (A)   General. The village is committed to comply with the Federal Fair and
Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, as well as provide customers,
particularly customers with utility accounts, the maximum identity theft
protection possible. Situations that lead to identity theft would hurt and
inconvenience the village’s customers, while at the same time damage the
village’s reputation and place the village at risk for losses. The village
developed this identity theft prevention policy with the oversight and approval
of the village board after considering the size and complexity of the village’s
operations and account systems and the nature and scope of the village’s
activities.
   (B)   Examples of identity theft.
      (1)   An identity thief uses another person’s Social Security number to
open a utility account.
      (2)   An identity thief uses a victim’s information to obtain
unauthorized services from the village.
      (3)   An identity thief opens a utility account using a victim’s name and
good credit.
      (4)   An identity thief files for bankruptcy using a victim’s name.
      (5)   An identity thief gives a victim’s name as his or her own when
arrested by police.
(2009 Code, § 22-1-1)
§ 36.091 RISK ASSESSMENT/IDENTIFYING RELEVANT RED FLAGS.
   (A)   While the overall risk of identity theft involving the village appears
low, the village will focus on detection and prevention from identity theft on
the following covered accounts: accounts to individual customers; all of the
village’s accounts that are individual utility service accounts held by
customers of the utility whether residential, commercial or industrial; any
account the village offers or maintains primarily for personal, family or
household purposes that involves multiple payments or transactions; and any
other account for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or
to the safety and soundness of the village from identity theft, as well as
automatic deposits to the accounts of the village employees. There will be a
periodic review to determine if the covered accounts are still accurate due to
any changes such as changes of address or other changes which may occur
relating to an account.
   (B)   Each type of covered account will be examined and reviewed for
relevant red flags in part by considering:
      (1)   The methods provided to open covered accounts;
      (2)   The methods provided to access covered accounts; and
      (3)   Previous experiences with identity theft.
   (C)   As part of the process, the village will consider the relevant red
flags provided by the regulatory guidance, as well as incidents of identity
theft that the village and/or the village customers have experienced and
applicable supervisory guidance.
(2009 Code, § 22-1-2)
§ 36.092 DETECTED RED FLAGS.
   (A)   The village is committed to detecting situations in which identity
theft might have or may have occurred.
   (B)   A RED FLAG is a pattern, practice or specific activity that indicates
the possible existence of identity theft. In order to identify relevant red
flags, the village considered risk factors such as the types of accounts that
it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its accounts, the
methods it provides to access its accounts and its previous experiences with
identity theft.
   (C)   Identity theft will be combated by detecting red flags in connection
with the opening of covered accounts and existing covered accounts, such as by:
      (1)   Obtaining identifying information about, and verifying the identity
of, a person opening a covered account;
      (2)   Authenticating customers’ transactions, including photo ID if
necessary, plus possible additional verification methods such as a user ID and
password;
      (3)   Monitoring transactions with emphasis on a change of address
closely followed by a new service request or a material change in a customer’s
credit use; and
      (4)   Verifying the validity of change of address requests, in the case
of existing covered accounts in order to monitor the diversion of statements as
a prelude to possible account manipulation.
(2009 Code, § 22-1-3)
§ 36.093 PREVENTING AND MITIGATING IDENTITY THEFT.

      (4)   Receiving an application for service that appears to have been
altered or forged.
   (C)   Suspicious personal identifying information.
      (1)   The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to

personal identifying information that is on file with the village.
      (3)   A person’s identifying information is the same as shown on other
applications found to be fraudulent.
      (4)   A person’s identifying information is consistent with fraudulent

      (5)   An account being used in a way that is not consistent with prior
use (such as late or no payments when the account has been timely in the past).
      (7)   The village receives notice that a customer is not receiving his or
her paper statements.
   (E)   Notice from customers, victims of identity theft, law enforcement
authorities or other persons regarding possible identity theft in connection
with covered accounts held by the village.
      (1)   The village is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft,
a law enforcement authority or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in identity theft.
      (2)   (a)   Should any of the above instances of suspicious activity that
could be identity theft occur, the village will take immediate actions to
either prevent or mitigate the situation.
         (b)   In order to detect any of the red flags identified above with
the opening of a new account, village personnel will take the following steps
to obtain and verify the identity of the person opening the account. Steps can
include:
            1.   Requiring certain identifying information such as name, date

information (in person, via telephone, via facsimile, via e-mail);
            2.   Verifying the validity of requests to change billing
addresses; and
            3.   Verifying changes in banking information given for billing and
payment purposes. Responses to these red flags are commensurate with the degree
of risk posed based on the village’s risk assessment. Appropriate responses may
include the following:
               a.   Complete verification of identification for fraud, active
duty, credit freeze or address discrepancy alert for any of these types of

(2009 Code, § 22-1-4)
§ 36.094 DUTIES REGARDING CHANGE OF ADDRESS.
   If a notice of change of address for an existing account is received and
then within 30 days a request for a change to the account is made, the village
will assess the validity of the change of address or requested change to the
account.
(2009 Code, § 22-1-5)
§ 36.095 UPDATING THE PROGRAM.
   (A)   The village will periodically review and update this policy (including
the red flags determined to be relevant) to reflect changes in risks to
customers or to the safety and soundness of the village from identity theft,
based on factors such as:
      (1)   Experiences with identity theft;
      (2)   Changes in methods of identity theft;
      (3)   Changes in methods to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft;
      (4)   Changes in the types of accounts or services that the village
offers or maintains; and
      (5)   Changes in our business arrangements, including services provided
and service provider arrangements.
   (B)   After considering these factors, the Program Administrator will
determine whether changes to the program, including the listing of red flags,
are warranted. If warranted, the Program Administrator will update the program
or present the Village Board with his or her recommended changes, and the
Village Board will make a determination of whether to accept, modify or reject
those changes to the program.
(2009 Code, § 22-1-6)
§ 36.096 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   The ultimate oversight of the program is the Village Board. The
Village Board has assigned specific responsibility for the program’s
implementation to the Program Administrator.
   (B)   The Program Administrator will report to the Village Board, at least
annually, on compliance by the village with all identity theft issues.
   (C)   The report will address material matters related to the program and
evaluate issues such as:
      (1)   The effectiveness of the policies and procedures of the village in
addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered
accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts;
      (2)   Service provider arrangements;
      (3)   Significant incidents involving identity theft and management’s
response; and
      (4)   Recommendations for material changes to the program.
   (D)   The Village Board will take any additional steps necessary to support
this program.
(2009 Code, § 22-1-7)
§ 36.097 SERVICE PROVIDER ARRANGEMENTS.
   The village will oversee any service provider who performs an activity in
connection with one or more covered accounts. The village will take steps to
ensure that the activity of the service provider is conducted in accordance
with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent and
mitigate the risk of identity theft and require the service provider to report
any red flag to the Program Administrator.
(2009 Code, § 22-1-8)
§ 36.098 TRAINING.
   The village staff responsible for implementing the program will be trained
to recognize and detect red flags and properly react to unauthorized or
fraudulent attempts to obtain customer information. The village directs the
Program Administrator to conduct annual training for all employees regarding
identity theft and to supplement that training throughout the year as more
schemes are uncovered.
(2009 Code, § 22-1-9)
§ 36.099 EDUCATION OF CUSTOMERS.
   Educating consumers about preventing identity theft and identifying
potential pretext calls may help reduce their vulnerability to these fraudulent
practices. The village will have brochures available to consumers and an
identity theft prevention section on the village’s website that describes
preventative measures consumers can take to avoid becoming victims of these
types of fraud.
(2009 Code, § 22-1-10)
§ 36.100 OTHER APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.
   As part of the overall program, the village will include other legal
requirements when needed, such as:
   (A)   Filing a suspicious activity report; and
   (B)   Implementing any requirements under which accounts may be created,
changed or altered when the village detects a fraud or active duty alert.
(2009 Code, § 22-1-11)
§ 36.101 ASSISTANCE FOR VICTIMS.
   In the event one of the village’s customers becomes a victim of identity
theft, the following steps will be taken, as appropriate, to assist them:
   (A)   Have trained personnel respond to customer calls regarding identity
theft or pretext calling;
   (B)   Determine if it is necessary to close an account immediately after a
customer reports unauthorized use of that account and create a new customer
account when appropriate. Where a customer has multiple accounts, an assessment
will be made as to whether any other account has been the subject of potential
fraud; and
   (C)   Help educate the customer about appropriate steps to take if they have
been victimized.
(2009 Code, § 22-1-12)
POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
§ 36.115 PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s sex. The courts
have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title
VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have
a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual
harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders
and sexual orientations. It is a policy of this village to prohibit harassment
of any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal
officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof.
(2009 Code, § 22-2-1) (Ord. 17-45, passed 12-11-2017)
§ 36.116 DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
State Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
   (A)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
      (1)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly
a term or condition of an individual’s employment;
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   (B)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
      (1)   Verbal. Sexual innuendoes, suggestive comments, insults, humor and
jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates or statements about other employees, even
outside their presence, of a sexual nature;
      (2)   Non-verbal. Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, “catcalls”, “
      (3)   Visual. Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites;
      (4)   Physical. Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault; and
      (5)   Textual/electronic. “Sexting” (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyberstalking or threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/ video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
   (C)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a “reasonable person”.
(2009 Code, § 22-2-2) (Ord. 17-45, passed 12-11-2017)
§ 36.117 PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes himself
or herself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident
(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating his or her
position to the offending employee, and his or her immediate supervisor. It is
not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the
report.
   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following.
      (1)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express his or her objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      (2)   Contact with supervisory personnel.
         (a)   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person
making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics
officer, the village manager or administrator, or the chief executive officer
of the municipality.
         (b)   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
      (3)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
be filed within 300 days.
   (C)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited
to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
   (D)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
(2009 Code, § 22-2-3) (Ord. 17-45, passed 12-11-2017; Ord. 18-28, passed 11-13-
2018)
§ 36.118 PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
ALLEGATIONS.
   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:
      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy;
      (2)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy; or
      (3)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (B)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
      (1)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy or practice of any officer, member, state agency or
other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule or regulation;
      (2)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state
employee; or
      (3)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer
may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule or regulation.
(740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
   (F)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to
retaliate against a person because he or she has opposed that which he or she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because he or she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or
participated in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under the State Human
Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge due within 300 days of the alleged retaliation.
(2009 Code, § 22-2-4) (Ord. 17-45, passed 12-11-2017; Ord. 18-28, passed 11-13-
2018)
§ 36.119 CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant
to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks
and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or
the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be
subject to a fine.
(2009 Code, § 22-2-5) (Ord. 17-45, passed 12-11-2017) Penalty, see §
36.999
§ 36.120 CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.
   (A)   A FALSE REPORT is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
   (B)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the state police, a
State’s Attorney, the Attorney General or any other law enforcement official is
guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.
(2009 Code, § 22-2-6) (Ord. 17-45, passed 12-11-2017) Penalty, see §
36.999
§ 36.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter, for which no other
penalty is provided, shall be subject to the penalty provisions of §
10.99.
   (B)   Any person violating §
36.119, or the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65,
may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or
discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the

delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be
assessed equal to 25% of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period
for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty

ordinance.

§ 38.031 ABATEMENT.

local tax administrator that the payment is 30 days delinquent, the taxpayer
shall have 14 working days to cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to
cure the delinquency within the 14-day period or fails to demonstrate good
faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local administrator,
the installment contract shall be canceled without further notice to the
taxpayer.
(2009 Code, § 36-2-13)
§ 38.033 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   The village, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax

and owing.
   (B)   The taxpayer shall have 45 days after receiving notice of the reviewed

owing.
      (1)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four
years maximum after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
      (2)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four-year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village, the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the statute of
limitations shall be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in
which return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in
which the return for the applicable period was filed.
      (3)   No statute of limitations shall not apply if a fraudulent tax
return was filed by the taxpayer.
(2009 Code, § 36-2-14)
§ 38.034 VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.
   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the filing
of the application but not more than four years before the date of filing the
application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not
be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for any period before the
date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined
and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid
tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.
(2009 Code, § 36-2-15)
§ 38.035 PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES.
   Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the Village
Clerk’s office.
(2009 Code, § 36-2-16)
§ 38.036 INTERNAL REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review
procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes.
Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the
lien shall remain in full force and effect.
   (B)   If the lien is determined to be improper, the local tax administrator
shall:
      (1)   Timely remove the lien at the village’s expense;
      (2)   Correct the taxpayer’s credit record; and
      (3)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
(2009 Code, § 36-2-17)
§ 38.037 APPLICATION.
   This subchapter shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement
all of the village’s tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in
conflict with or inconsistent with this subchapter, this subchapter shall be
controlling.

      (2)   For each billed user of more than two million (2,000,000) gallons
of water per year, the minimum charge per month shall be determined by the
village at least annually for each user based upon the following formula:
 
Total number of users x $4.51
 
      (3)   The annual water usage of the user will be calculated using the
most recent 12 calendar months of information available prior to the date of
the determination, provided that if it is a new user or if there is not at
least 12 months of usage information available for any such user, the village
will estimate the annual water usage of the user. The average annual water
usage of all residential users will be calculated using the most recent 12
calendar months of information available for all residential users of the
village’s sanitary sewer system.
         (a)   All metered water users within the corporate limits of both the
village and the Sangamon County Water Reclamation District shall be subject to
and pay the minimum charge set forth above for capital improvements and non-
flow related OM&R.
         (b)   All metered water users within the corporate limits of both the

periodically to reflect any change in local capital costs or OM&R costs.
         (d)   Computation of wastewater service charge:
            1.   The wastewater service charge shall be computed by the
following formula:
 
   CW = CU(Vu) + CC + CM
Where CW = amount of wastewater service charge $ per billing period
CU = basic user charge for operation, maintenance and replacement
Vu = wastewater volume for the billing period
CC = capital improvement charge
CM = minimum charge for operation, maintenance and replacement
 
            2.   The users of the wastewater treatment services will be
notified annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that
portion of the user charges which are attributable to the wastewater operation,
maintenance and replacement. The volume of flow used for computing basic user
charges and surcharges shall be metered water consumption read to the lowest
even increments of 1,000 gallons.
         (e)   1.   If any person discharging wastes into the public sewers
procures any part, or all, of his or her water from sources other than the
public waterworks system, all or part of which is discharged into the public
sewers, the person shall install and maintain, at his or her expense, water
meters of a type approved by the Superintendent of Sewage Works for the purpose
of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources.
            2.   Devices for measuring the volume of water discharge may be
required by the Superintendent of Sewage Works if these volumes cannot
otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records.
            3.   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the Superintendent of Public Works.
   (C)   Sewer deduct meters. The village will maintain six deduct meters that
will be available to residents. The deduct meters will allow residents to
utilize water and not be charged sewer rates for the water; instead, use of
water through the sewer deduct meters will be measured by the sewer deduct
meter and the village will reduce the resident’s bill by the sewer rate for the
amount of water used through the sewer deduct meter. Sewer deduct meters shall
be able to be utilized for the purpose of filling a residential swimming pool,
residential landscaping, and special events as defined in the village zoning
code. A sewer deduct meter shall not be allowed to be utilized by a resident
for more than three consecutive days. The resident shall sign an agreement
provided by the village that requires the resident to return the sewer deduct
meter within three days of checking it out in the same condition in which it
was given to the resident. Failure to abide by the terms of the agreement shall
result in a fine of $150 which the village may assess on the resident’s water
bill.

§ 54.103 INDUSTRIAL WASTE TESTING.
   (A)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the village or regulatory agencies
having jurisdiction over the discharge.
   (B)   The number, type and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed
by the owner shall be as stipulated by the village, but no less than once per
year the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the
sewer discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state and local
standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of measurements and
laboratory analyses to the village at such times and in such a manner as
prescribed by the village. The owner shall bear the expense of all
measurements, analyses and reporting required by the village. At such times as

accordance with the latest edition of IEPA Division of Laboratories Manual of
Laboratory Methods, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or
upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required the control manhole shall be considered to be
the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples.)

concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted by the village for treatment, subject to payment therefor, in
accordance with the chapter, hereof, by the industrial concern provided such
payments are in accordance with federal and state guidelines for user charge

are to be considered as part of a substructure, the permittee shall promptly
notify the owner thereof. All damaged facilities shall be repaired by the
agency or person owning them and the expense of such repairs shall be charged
to the permittee. It is the intent of this section that the permittee shall
assume all liability for damage to facilities and any resulting damage or
injury to anyone because of such facility damage and such assumption of
liability is a contractual obligation of the permittee. The only exception will
be such instances where damage is exclusively due to the negligence of the
owning utility. The village shall not be made a party to any action because of

protection of such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for
the purpose of taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall
obtain consent from the owner of such private property for such purpose and if
he or she cannot obtain such consent, the Superintendent may authorize him or
her to enter the private premises solely for the purpose of making the property
safe.
   (B)   At the permittee’s own expense, all buildings, walls, fences or other
property likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work shall
be shored up and protected, and the permittee shall be responsible for all
damage to public or private property or highways resulting from failure to
properly protect and carry out the work. Whenever it may be necessary for the
permittee to trench through any lawn area, said area shall be reseeded or the
sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been
backfilled as required in this subchapter. All construction and maintenance
work shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth
and debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed
before such work began. The permittee shall not remove, even temporarily any
trees or shrubs which exist is parking areas without first obtaining the
consent of the appropriate village department or official having supervision of
such property.

any street shall be piled and maintained in such a manner as to eliminate
danger to those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and
so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets
and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as
might be the case in a narrow alley, the Superintendent shall have the
authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a
storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling.
It shall be the permittee’s responsibility to secure the necessary permission
and make all necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal
sites.
All material excavated shall be laid compactly along the side of the trench and
kept trimmed so as to cause as little inconvenience as reasonably possible to
vehicular and pedestrian traffic, or as specified by the Superintendent,
whenever necessary, in order to expedite the flow of traffic or to abate the
dirt or dust nuisance. Toe boards or bins may be required by the Superintendent
to prevent the spreading of dirt into traffic lanes. Trench excavations shall
follow OSHA recommendations.

satisfaction of the Superintendent. From time to time as may be ordered by the
Superintendent, and in any event, immediately after completion of the work, the
permittee shall, at his, her or its own expense, clean up and remove all refuse
and unused materials of any kind resulting from the work, and upon failure to
do so within 24 hours after having been notified to do so by the
Superintendent, said work may be done by the Superintendent and the cost
thereof charged to the permittee and the permittee shall also be liable for the
cost thereof under the surety bond provided hereunder.
(2009 Code, § 34-4-18)
§ 95.083 PROTECTION OF WATERCOURSES.
   (A)   The permittee shall maintain all gutters free and unobstructed for the
full depth of the adjacent curb and for at least one foot in width from the
face of such curb at the gutter line. Whenever a gutter crosses an intersecting
street, an adequate waterway shall be provided and at all times maintained. The
permittee shall make provisions to take care of all surplus water, muck, silt,
slickings or other run-off pumped from excavations or resulting from sluicing
or other operations and shall be responsible for any damage resulting from its
failure to so provide.
   (B)   In no case shall these operations deposit sediment or sediment laden
water into the village storm or sanitary sewer system or watercourse. All
runoff shall be filtered of all soil particles before entering either the storm
sewer system or watercourse.

§ 95.187 NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
   In the event any situation is not covered by the illustrations contained in
this subchapter, any driveway which provides access to any village street or
roadway shall comply with the requirements established by the Village Engineer.
(2009 Code, § 34-9-3) (Ord. 01-04, passed 3-12-2001)
§ 95.188 EXISTING NONCONFORMING ACCESS.
   To the extent that there exists any driveway which provides access to any
village street or roadway which was lawful prior to the date on which this
subchapter became effective, but which would not comply with the minimum
standards specified in §
95.187 above, such nonconforming driveway may continue to provide access, so
long as it otherwise remains lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   No such nonconforming driveway shall be enlarged, increased, altered
or extended unless it is to make such nonconforming driveway comply with the
minimum standards specified in §
95.187;
   (B)   Should such nonconforming driveway is destroyed by any means to an
extent of more than 50% of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it
shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the minimum standards
specified in this section; and

(2009 Code, § 34-9-4) (Ord. 01-04, passed 3-12-2001)
CONSTRUCTION OF UTILITY FACILITIES IN THE RIGHTS-OF-WAY
§ 95.200 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the village’s
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage and visual qualities of the village
rights-of-way and the village as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this subchapter, the village intends to exercise
its authority over the rights-of-way in the village and, in particular, the use
of the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards
to address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation
to:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased storm water run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the village’s residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this subchapter. This subchapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the rights-of-
way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this subchapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses or similar agreements. The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this subchapter.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this subchapter and the provisions of
any franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other subchapter or chapters. This subchapter
supersedes all subchapters or chapters or parts of subchapters or chapters
adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such
conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
subchapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this subchapter
to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or
regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this subchapter and may vary the standards,
conditions and requirements expressed in this subchapter when the village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare.

§ 95.205 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this subchapter on village rights-of-way, and
does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge
upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this subchapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this subchapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village with
such village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-6)
§ 95.206 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this subchapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
95.220. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee
shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility
so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-7)
§ 95.207 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license or similar
agreement, each utility occupying the right-of-way or constructing any facility
in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance
policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the village, and its
elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional
insureds on the policies listed in divisions (A)(1)(a) and (A)(1)(b) below:
         (a)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse and underground hazard (commonly referred as
“X”, “C”, and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
            1.   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each
person;
            2.   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any
one accident; and
            3.   Five million dollars for all other types of liability;
         (b)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles
with a combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property
damage for each accident;
         (c)   Worker’s compensation with statutory limits; and
         (d)   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident.
      (2)   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the village within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the village.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement: “It is hereby
understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention
not to renew be stated until 30 days after receipt by the village, by
registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written
notice addressed to the Village Administrator of such intent to cancel or not
to renew.” Within ten days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in
no event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) above. A
utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-
insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds
under division (A) above, or the requirements of divisions (B), (C) and (D)
above. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) above,
such as evidence that the utility is a “private self-insurer” under the Workers
Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility’s liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the state. All insurance
carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rates “A-“ or better and of a class
size “X” or higher by A.M. Best Company.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-8)
§ 95.208 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the village and its elected
and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this subchapter or by a franchise, license or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
subchapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-9)
§ 95.209 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee’s sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve a security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this subchapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
subchapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this subchapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this subchapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this subchapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this division (B) shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
state at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Superintendent of Public Works, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Superintendent
of Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee
to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of
the construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this division (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days’ advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division (D), may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided that
the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14-day
notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this subchapter that the
village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the
Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the
permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in division
(C) above.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) above.
   (G)   Closing and return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
subchapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the
permit, the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall
become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any
reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said
revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage
shall be refunded to the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this subchapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-10)
§ 95.210 PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (A)   Village right to revoke permit. The village may revoke or suspend a
permit issued pursuant to this subchapter for one or more of the following
reasons:
      (1)   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting or materially incomplete

suspension.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the village, the permittee shall have the following options:
         (a)   Immediately provide the village with evidence that no cause
exists for the revocation or suspension;
         (b)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the village, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the village within five working days after receipt of the written
notice of revocation; or
         (c)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above,
along, upon, under, across or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-
of-way to the satisfaction of the village providing written proof of such
removal to the village within ten days after receipt of the written notice of
revocation.
      (2)   The village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend
the time periods provided in this division (C).
   (D)   Stop work order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the village may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within division (A)
above.
   (E)   Failure or refusal of the permittee to comply. If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of division (C) above, the village or its
designee may, at the option of the village:
      (1)   Correct the deficiencies;
      (2)   Upon not less than 20 days’ notice to the permittee, remove the
subject facilities or equipment; or
      (3)   After not less than 30 days’ notice to the permittee of failure to
cure the noncompliance, deem them abandoned and property of the village. The
permittee shall be liable in all events to the village for all costs of
removal.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-11)
§ 95.211 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER’S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS.
   (A)   Notification of change. A utility shall notify the village no less
than 30 days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the right-
of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility or
the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and all applicable laws, ordinances,
rules and regulations, including this subchapter, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
   (B)   Amended permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the village’s right-
of-way.
   (C)   Insurance and bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-12)
§ 95.212 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Standards and principles. All construction in the right-of-way shall
be consistent with applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations,
and commonly recognized and accepted traffic control and construction
principles, sound engineering judgment and, where applicable, the principles

circumstances.
   (E)   Compliance. The utility shall take immediate action to correct any
deficiencies in traffic protection requirements that are brought to the
utility’s attention by the village.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-14)
§ 95.214 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this division
(A).
      (1)   No interference with village facilities. No utility facilities
shall be placed in any location if the Superintendent of Public Works
determines that the proposed location will require the relocation or
displacement of any of the village’s utility facilities or will otherwise
interfere with the operation or maintenance of any of the village’s utility
facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable
from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of
the curb, where available;
         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         (d)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         (e)   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (0.3
m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way line.
      (2)   Underground parallel facilities. An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line;
         (b)   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         (c)   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line and any abovegrounded
appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line
or as near as practicable.
   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts or drainage facilities. Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts or drainage facilities.
      (3)   Ninety degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a 90 degree angle to the centerline as practicable.
      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:

maximum maintenance-free service life; and
         (b)   Capacity for the utility’s foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations.
(49 C.F.R. §192.707 (1989)).
   (D)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. The village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways.
   (E)   Freestanding facilities.
      (1)   The village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   The village may require any freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way to be screened from view.
   (F)   Facilities installed aboveground. Aboveground facilities may be
installed only if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         (g)   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         (h)   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   (H)   Appearance standards.
      (1)   The village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-15)
§ 95.215 CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS.
   (A)   Standards and requirements for particular types of construction
methods.
      (1)   Boring or jacking.
         (a)   Pits and shoring. Boring and jacking under rights-of-way shall
be accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance specified by the
Superintendent of Public Works from the edge of the pavement. Pits for boring
or jacking shall be excavated no more than 48 hours in advance of boring or
jacking operations and backfilled within 48 hours after boring or jacking
operations are completed. While pits are open, they shall be clearly marked and
protected by barricades. Shoring shall be designed, erected, supported, braced
and maintained so that it will safely support all vertical and lateral loads
that may be imposed upon it during the boring or jacking operation.
         (b)   Wet boring or jetting. Wet boring or jetting shall not be
permitted under the roadway.
         (c)   Borings with diameters greater than six inches. Borings over six
inches (0.15 m) in diameter shall be accomplished with an auger and following
pipe, and the diameter of the auger shall not exceed the outside diameter of
the following pipe by more than one inch (25 mm).
         (d)   Borings with diameters six inches or less. Borings of six inches
or less in diameter may be accomplished by either jacking, guided with auger,
or auger and following pipe method.
         (e)   Tree preservation. Any facility located within the drip line of
any tree designed by the village to be preserved shall be bored under or around
the root system.
      (2)   Trenching. Trenching for facility installation, repair or
maintenance on rights-of-way shall be done in accord with the applicable
portions of § 603 IDOT’s Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction.
         (a)   Length. The length of open trench shall be kept to the
practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipe-line testing. Only
one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless special
permission is obtained from the Superintendent of Public Works.
 
         (b)   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by Chapter 6 of the Illinois
Manual on Uniform Traffic- Control Devices. Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         (c)   Drip line of trees. The utility shall not trench within the drip
line of any tree designated by the village to be preserved.

activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable state laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the village as permitted by law.
   (B)   Other utilities - tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable state laws and regulations specifically
governing the same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this subchapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

§ 95.217 REMOVAL, RELOCATION OR MODIFICATION OF UTILITY FACILITIES.
   (A)   Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the village, a
utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently
disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility
facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have
determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably
necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance or installation of any
village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or upon,
the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall,
at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this subchapter; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if
known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if
known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights-of-way of the village, the utility shall notify the village within 90
days. Following receipt of such notice, the village may direct the utility to
remove all or any portion of the facility if the Superintendent of Public Works
determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health,
safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not direct the utility
that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to
the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the
alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility
or person.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-18)
§ 95.218 CLEANUP AND RESTORATION.
   The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and
terrain and other property within ten days after any portion of the rights-of-
way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or maintenance by
the utility, all to the satisfaction of the village. This includes restoration
of entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made
using materials and methods approved by the Superintendent of Public Works.
Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading,
reseeding, resodding or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a
condition substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the
commencement of the project. The time period provided in this section may be
extended by the Superintendent of Public Works for good cause shown.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-19)
§ 95.219 MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or
within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the village and at the utility’s expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify
noncompliance with normal procedures for securing a permit.
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flags. If a hazard does not
exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Superintendent of Public Works or his or her duly authorized agent of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection
of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary
repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free
movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the village a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after
an emergency repair.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-20)

   (A)   Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this subchapter must do so in writing to the
Superintendent of Public Works as a part of the permit application. The request
shall identify each provision of this subchapter from which a variance is
requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Superintendent of Public Works shall
decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this subchapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Superintendent of Public
Works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Superintendent of Public Works may require the
utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this subchapter but which
carry out the purposes of this subchapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the
Superintendent of Public Works under the provisions of this subchapter shall
have the right to appeal to the Village Board, or such other board or
commission as it may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted
in writing to the Village Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. The Village Board shall commence its
consideration of the appeal at the Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting
occurring at least seven days after the filing of the appeal. The Village Board
shall timely decide the appeal.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-21)
§ 95.221 ENFORCEMENT.
   Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of this subchapter.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-23)
§ 95.222 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, division, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
subchapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and
independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions hereof.
(2009 Code, § 34-10-24)
§ 95.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter, for which no other
penalty is provided, shall be subject to the penalty provisions of §
10.99.
   (B)   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to
comply with any of the provisions of §§
95.200 through
95.222 shall be subject to fine in accordance with the penalty provisions of
this code of ordinances. There may be times when the village will incur delay
or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility will not or
cannot perform its duties under its permit and §§
95.200 through
95.222. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village’s costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

   (A)   Authority to grant franchise. The grantor may grant a franchise to any
person who offers to provide a system under and pursuant to this chapter.

an ordinance, license, permit, contract, agreement, resolution or any other
form elected by the grantor.
   (C)   Grants not required. Consistent with applicable state and federal law,
no provision of this chapter shall require the granting of a franchise when, in
the opinion of the grantor, it is in the public interest not to do so.
   (D)   Purpose. The purpose of a franchise shall be to identify and authorize
its specific grantee and to identify and specify those terms, conditions,
definitions, itemizations, specifications and other particulars of the
agreement between the grantor and grantee which it represents. In so doing a
franchise may clarify, extend and interpret the provisions of this chapter.
Where a franchise and this chapter conflict both shall be liberally interpreted
to achieve a common meaning or requirement. In the event this is not possible
within reasonable limits, the franchise shall prevail.
   (E)   Mutual consideration. The award of a franchise authorizing the use of
public property or public rights for private purposes shall be deemed
consideration by the grantee in the form of agreement to provide the system and
services offered in accordance with the provisions hereof and of the franchise.
   (F)   Compliance with law. Neither this chapter nor a franchise granted
under it relieves the grantee of any requirement of the grantor or of any
ordinance, rule, regulation or specification of the grantor now or hereafter in
effect, including, but not limited to, the payment of all normal permit and
inspection fees so long as said ordinance, rules, regulations or specifications
do not materially conflict with or alter the express terms of this chapter and
the franchise.
   (G)   Franchise nonexclusive. The grantor may, at its option, grant one or
more franchises to construct, operate, maintain and reconstruct a cable
communications system. Said franchises shall constitute both a privilege and an
obligation to provide the system and services required by this chapter and the
franchise.
   (H)   Limitation. No privilege shall be granted or conferred by a franchise
except those specifically prescribed herein or in the franchise agreement.
   (I)   Duration. The term of any franchise, and all rights, privileges,
obligations and restrictions pertaining thereto shall be specified in the
franchise agreement. The effective date of any franchise shall be as specified

maintaining a cable communications system in the franchised area, a grantee may

system. Prior to construction or alteration of plants in public rights-of-way,
the grantee shall apply for and receive all necessary permits.
   (L)   Use of other utilities. Any person or entity who provides a system or
services as defined herein shall be deemed a grantee and shall not do so except
in accordance with a franchise granted hereunder. If such grantee uses

“licensee”, and the term “grantee” herein shall include “licensee” in its
meaning.

assigned, sold or transferred, either in whole or in part, nor shall title
thereto, either legal or equitable, or any right, interest or property therein,
pass to or vest in any person except the grantee, either by act of the grantee
or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of the grantor, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The granting of such consent shall
not render unnecessary, disapprove or conditionally approve said request within
a reasonable period of time upon the receipt of all reasonably necessary
requested information.
   (N)   Change in control.
      (1)   The grantee shall promptly notify the grantor of any proposed
change in control of the grantee. Such change in control shall make the
franchise null and void unless the grantor shall have consented thereto, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The grantor may condition said
transfer upon reasonable terms and conditions.

the grantee, or affiliates of the grantee which are wholly-owned by the same
parent, for the purpose of this section, a change in control will exist upon

imposed upon the grantor, or any commission, officer, employee, department or

any route on his or her property, and in any manner he or she may elect which
is technically and economically feasible if he or she so elects, require that
any such request be made in writing. If the subscriber requests installation
other than a standard installation, then the subscriber may be required to pay
a reasonable fee for the time and materials occasioned by the installation and
to sign an agreement releasing the grantee from liability for poor service or
damage to person or property resulting from the nonstandard installation.
      (3)   For purposes of this section, a STANDARD INSTALLATION shall include
installation of drop cable with fittings up to 150 feet from the CATV
distribution system measured along the cable from the centerline of the street
or utility easement through the house wall or at the customer’s option through
the floor from a house vent or crawl space directly to the customer’s entry to
the television set. Also included as part of a standard installation is the
grounding cable, fine tuning of the television set and the provisions of the
appropriate literature.
   (F)   Converters/terminals. At such time as a converter or terminal becomes
necessary for subscribers to have access to services on its system, the grantee
shall make them available to subscribers. The grantee may require each
subscriber who elects to take a converter or terminal to furnish a security
deposit therefor and/or pay a monthly fee.
      (1)   Each device shall be and remain the property of the grantee unless
the grantor approves its sale to the subscriber. The grantee shall be
responsible for maintenance and repair of all equipment owned by the grantee
and may replace it as he or she may from time to time elect, except that
subscriber shall be responsible for loss of or damage to any such device while
in his or her possession.
      (2)   Upon termination or cancellation of subscriber’s service, the
subscriber shall promptly return the grantee’s property to the grantee in the
same condition as received, reasonable wear and tear excepted.
      (3)   The grantee may apply the security deposit against any sum due from
subscriber loss of or damage to such converter exceeding reasonable wear and
tear. In the event that no security deposit has been required, the grantee may
charge the subscriber for any such damage exceeding reasonable wear and tear.
      (4)   If the grantee has no claim against the deposit, the grantee shall
return it, or the balance, to the subscriber.
   (G)   Nonstandard installations. For each nonstandard drop installed, the
grantee may charge the subscriber for the cost of material and labor in excess
of that for a standard drop. The grantee shall provide each subscriber an

cables and appurtenances from the property in question. Except for service
drops, the grantee shall give at least 48 hours’ advance notice to all property

grantee to cause any construction, repair or other necessary work to comply
with the terms of the franchise agreement to be properly completed in, on, over
or under any right-of-way within a time prescribed in the franchise agreement
or the construction permit, the grantor may (but shall not be required to)
cause such work to be completed in whole or in part, and upon so doing shall
submit to the grantee an itemized statement of costs thereof. The grantee shall
be given reasonable notice of the grantor’s intent to exercise this power and
15 days to cure thereafter. The grantee shall, within 30 days of billing, pay
to the grantor the actual costs thereof.

highway or portion thereof used by the grantee shall be vacated by the grantor,
or the use thereof discontinued by the grantee, upon reasonable notice, the
grantee shall forthwith remove its facilities therefrom unless specifically
permitted to continue the same, and on the removal thereof, restore, repair or
reconstruct the area where such removal has occurred, to such condition as may

deactivated for a continuous period of 30 days except for reasons outside the
grantee’s control, without prior written notice to and approval by the grantor,
then the grantee shall, at the grantor’s option and at the expense of the
grantee and at no expense to the grantor, and upon demand by the grantor,
promptly remove from any streets or other area all property of the grantee, and
the grantee shall promptly restore the street or any other area from which such
property has been removed to its condition prior to the grantee’s use thereof;
provided, that the grantee shall not be required to remove conduit from
underground, where the grantor may determine no damage to the surface of any
structures may result from such nonremoval.
   (L)   Movement of facilities. In the event it is necessary to temporarily
move or remove any of the grantee’s property at the grantor’s direction for a
public purpose in order lawfully to remove a large object, vehicle, building or
other structure, the grantee, upon reasonable notice, at least seven business
days, shall move, at the expense of the grantee, its property as may be
required to facilitate such movements. No such movement shall be deemed a
taking of the grantee’s property. Nothing herein shall limit the right of the
grantee to seek reimbursement from any party.
   (M)   Undergrounding of cable. Cables shall be installed underground at the
grantee’s cost where all existing utilities are already underground. Previously

portion of the monetary expenses for similar easement users, the grantor shall
reimburse the grantee in like manner.

obligations involved in obtaining pole or conduit space from any department of
the grantor, utility company or from others maintaining utilities in streets.
   (O)   Extension of franchise area. If the grantor elects to grant one or
more franchises hereunder, and if thereafter one or more of the franchises
expires or is otherwise ended, the grantor may, if it so elects, require a
remaining grantee, or more than one, to extend its system to provide service to
the area served by the ended franchise; provided, that it is financially
reasonable and the grantee shall not be required to overbuild any existing
system. The terms and requirements of such extension shall not exceed those
contained herein or in the grantee’s franchise.
   (P)   Repair of streets and public ways. Any and all streets and public ways
disturbed or damaged by the grantee or its contractors, during the
construction, operation, maintenance or reconstruction of the system, shall be

otherwise authorized in writing by the grantor.

a prior agreement with the owner of property on which they stand, or as
otherwise authorized in writing by the grantor.
   (R)   Reservations of street rights. Nothing in franchise shall prevent the
grantor from constructing, repairing and/or altering any public work. All such
work shall be done, insofar as practicable, in such manner as not to
unnecessarily obstruct, injure or prevent the free use and operation of any
property of the grantee. However, if any such property of the grantee shall
interfere with the construction, maintenance or repair of any public
improvement, all such property shall be removed or replaced in such manner as
directed by the grantor so that the same shall not interfere with the said
public work, such removal or replacement shall be at the expense of the grantee
if other affected utilities also remove or replace his, her or its property at
his, her or its expenses.

         (e)   A proposed schedule for the installation and completion of each
small wireless facility covered by the application, if approved;
         (f)   Certification that the collocation complies with the collocation
requirements and conditions contained herein, to the best of the applicant’s
knowledge; and
         (g)   In the event that the proposed small wireless facility is to be
attached to an existing pole owned by an entity other than the village, the
wireless provider shall provide legally competent evidence of the consent of
the owner of such pole to the proposed collocation.
      (2)   Application process. The village shall process applications as
follows.
         (a)   The first completed application shall have priority over
applications received by different applicants for collocation on the same
utility pole or wireless support structure.
         (b)   An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement of an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the village fails to
approve or deny the application within 90 days after the submission of a
completed application. However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the
permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the
village in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no
sooner than 75 days after the submission of a completed application. The permit
shall be deemed approved on the latter of the ninetieth day after submission of
the complete application or the tenth day after the receipt of the deemed
approved notice by the village. The receipt of the deemed approved notice shall
not preclude the village’s denial of the permit request within the time limits
as provided under this chapter.
         (c)   An application to collocate a small wireless facility that
includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the village fails to approve or
deny the application within 120 days after the submission of a completed
application. However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the village in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than
105 days after the submission of a completed application. The permit shall be
deemed approved on the latter of the one hundred-twentieth day after submission
of the complete application or the tenth day after the receipt of the deemed
approved notice by the village. The receipt of the deemed approved notice shall
not preclude the village’s denial of the permit request within the time limits
as provided under this chapter.
         (d)   1.   The village shall deny an application which does not meet
the requirements of this chapter. If the village determines that applicable
codes, ordinances or regulations that concern public safety, or the collocation
requirements and conditions contained herein require that the utility pole or
wireless support structure be replaced before the requested collocation,
approval shall be conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or
wireless support structure at the cost of the provider. The village shall
document the basis for a denial, including the specific code provisions or
application conditions on which the denial is based, and send the documentation
to the applicant on or before the day the village denies an application. The
applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the village and resubmit the
revised application once within 30 days after notice of denial is sent to the
applicant without paying an additional application fee. The village shall
approve or deny the revised application within 30 days after the applicant
resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to resubmit the
revised application within 30 days of denial shall require the application to
submit a new application with applicable fees, and recommencement of the
village’s review period. The applicant must notify the village in writing of
its intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved
basis, which may be submitted with the revised application.
            2.   Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the
deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not
apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different
structure to be collocated upon, new antennas or other wireless equipment
associated with the small wireless facility.
         (e)   Pole attachment agreement: within 30 days after an approved
permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the
village and the applicant shall enter into a master pole attachment agreement,
provided by the village for the initial collocation on a municipal utility pole
by the application. For subsequent approved permits to collocate on a small
wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the village and the applicant
shall enter into a license supplement of the master pole attachment agreement.
      (3)   Completeness of application. Within 30 days after receiving an
application, the village shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the village must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the village fails to provide notification to the applicant within
30 days after all documents, information and fees specifically enumerated in
the village’s permit application form are submitted by the applicant to the
village. Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the village sends the
notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing
information.
      (4)   Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         (a)   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the
village; or
         (b)   A local, state or federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      (5)   Consolidated applications. An applicant seeking to collocate small
wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the village shall be allowed, at
the applicant’s discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the
collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless
facility and substantially the same type of structure. If an application
includes multiple small wireless facilities, the village may remove small
wireless facility collocations from the application and treat separately small
wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has been
provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment or that are denied.
The village may issue separate permits for each collocation that is approved in
a consolidated application.
      (6)   Duration of permits. The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of not less than five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
durations unless the village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities
or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable village
codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this chapter. If
the Act is repealed as provided in § 90 therein, renewals of permits shall be
subject to the applicable village code provisions or regulations in effect at
the time of renewal.
      (7)   Means of submitting applications. Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information and notices to the village by personal
delivery at the village’s designated place of business, by regular mail
postmarked on the date due or by any other commonly used means, including
electronic mail.
   (C)   Collocation requirements and conditions.
      (1)   Public safety space reservation. The village may reserve space on
municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the village’s
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the village reasonably
determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      (2)   Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      (3)   No interference with public safety communication frequencies. The
wireless provider’s operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications. A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of
the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a
public safety agency’s communications equipment. Unacceptable interference will
be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the
FCC’s regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety
spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. If a small
wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been
given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the
wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a
manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference
with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 C.F.R. §§
22.970 through 22.973 and 47 C.F.R. §§ 90.672 through 90.675. The village may
terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if
the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations
cited in the previous sentence. Failure to remedy the interference as required
herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      (4)   Collocation on electric distribution utility poles. The wireless
provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on village utility poles
that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the
communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the
pole. However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility
may be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on
the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. For
purposes of this division (C)(4), the terms COMMUNICATIONS SPACE, COMMUNICATION
WORKER SAFETY ZONE and ELECTRIC SUPPLY ZONE have the meanings given to those
terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      (5)   Public safety. The wireless provider shall comply with all
applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public
safety.
      (6)   Written design standards. The wireless provider shall comply with
written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility
poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are
set forth in a village ordinance, written policy adopted by the village, a
comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers
of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic
district.
      (7)   Alternate placements. Except as provided in this division (C), a
wireless provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities
on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to
collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with
respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility
associated with a new utility pole, the village may propose that the small
wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing
wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which
the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure
on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure
does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by
the applicant. If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the village,
the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does
not satisfy the criteria in this division (C)(7).
      (8)   Height limitations.
         (a)   The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more
than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the
small wireless facility is collocated.
         (b)   New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures
on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
            1.   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way
within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures
shall control the height limitation for such facility; or
            2.   Forty-five feet above ground level.
      (9)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in conformance with and utilizing the same
procedures, terms and conditions set forth in the village’s development
ordinance.
      (10)   Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall
comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and
a private property owner that concern design or construction standards
applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-
of-way.
      (11)   Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      (12)   Under grounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply
with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding
requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of
existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the
requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests
to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do
not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.
      (13)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
   (D)   Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows.
      (1)   The applicant shall pay an application fee of $650 for an
application to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing
utility pole or wireless support structure, and $350 for each small wireless
facility addressed in a consolidated application to collocate more than one
small wireless facility on existing utility poles or wireless support
structures.
      (2)   The applicant shall pay an application fee of $1,000 for each small
wireless facility addressed in an application that includes the installation of
a new utility pole for such collocation.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of state law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
      (4)   The village shall not require an application, approval or permit,
or require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:
         (a)   Routine maintenance;
         (b)   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless
provider notifies the village at least ten days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of
equipment consistent with division (B)(1)(d) above; or
         (c)   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable safety codes.
      (5)   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the village to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   (E)   Exceptions to applicability. Nothing in this chapter authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      (1)   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled
by the village or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately-owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      (2)   Property owned, leased or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district or conservation district for public park, recreation or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
      (3)   (a)   Property owned by a rail carrier registered under § 18c-7201
of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter
rail service or an electric utility as defined in § 16-102 of the Public
Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail
service or electric utility. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to an
electric or gas public utility or such utility’s wireless facilities if the
facilities are being used, developed and maintained consistent with the
provisions of § 16-108.5(i) of the Public Utilities Act or the purposes of this
division (E)(3), PUBLIC UTILITY has the meaning given to that term in § 3-105
of the Public Utilities Act.
         (b)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to relieve any person
from any requirement:
            1.   To obtain a franchise or a state-issued authorization to offer
cable service or video service; or
            2.   To obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain
or operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities
subject to this chapter.
   (F)   Pre-existing agreements. Existing agreements between the village and
wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities
in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on
village utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for
all small wireless facilities collocated on the village’s utility poles
pursuant to applications submitted to the village before June 1, 2018, subject
to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this chapter. A wireless provider that
has an existing agreement with the village on the effective date of the Act may
accept the rates, fees and terms that the village makes available under this
chapter for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation of
new utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities that are the
subject of an application submitted two or more years after the effective date
of the Act by notifying the village that it opts to accept such rates, fees and
terms. The existing agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable
termination provisions, for the small wireless facilities the wireless provider
has collocated on the village’s utility poles pursuant to applications
submitted to the village before the wireless provider provides such notice and
exercises its option under this division (F).
   (G)   Annual recurring rate.
      (1)   A wireless provider shall pay to the village an annual recurring
rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a village utility pole located
in a right-of-way that equals:
         (a)   Two hundred dollars per year; or
         (b)   The actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the wireless
provider’s use of space on the village utility pole.
      (2)   If the village has not billed the wireless provider actual and
direct costs, the fee shall be $200 payable on the first day after the first
annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to
collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.
   (H)   Abandonment. A small wireless facility that is not operated for a
continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned. The owner of the
facility shall remove the small wireless facility within 90 days after receipt
of written notice from the village notifying the wireless provider of the
abandonment. The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, by the village to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within 90 days
of such notice, the village may remove or cause the removal of such facility
pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery. A wireless provider shall provide
written notice to the village if it sells or transfers small wireless
facilities within the jurisdiction of the village. Such notice shall include
the name and contact information of the new wireless provider.
(Ord. 18-23, passed 7-23-2018)
§ 116.04 DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
   The Circuit Court of the county shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve
all disputes arising under the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act.
Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small
wireless facilities on municipal utility poles within the right-of-way, the
village shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual
rates of no more than $200 per year per municipal utility pole, with rates to
be determined upon final resolution of the dispute.
(Ord. 18-23, passed 7-23-2018)
§ 116.05 INDEMNIFICATION.
   A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the village harmless against
any and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting
from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the
village improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the
wireless provider or its employees, agents or contractors arising out of the
rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless
provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the
village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any
claims that it may have against the village with respect to consequential,
incidental or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of
liability.
(Ord. 18-23, passed 7-23-2018)
§ 116.06 INSURANCE.
   (A)   The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider’s own cost
and expense, the following insurance:
      (1)   Property insurance for its property’s replacement cost against all
risks;
      (2)   Worker’s compensation insurance, as required by law; or
      (3)   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its
activities on the village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum
protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of village
improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and
property damage.
   (B)   The wireless provider shall include the village as an additional
insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification
and documentation of inclusion of the village in a commercial general liability
policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility. A wireless provider
may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit
requirement required by the village. A wireless provider that self-insures is
not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with the
requirement for the name of additional insureds under this division (B).
   (C)   A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage limits required by the village.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.001 TITLE.
   These regulations shall be known as the “Property Maintenance Code of the
Village of Rochester”, hereinafter referred to as “this Code”.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-1)
§ 151.002 SCOPE.
   The provisions of this Code shall apply to all existing residential and
nonresidential structures and all existing premises and constitute minimum
requirements and standards for premises, structures, equipment and facilities
for light, ventilation, space, heating, sanitation, protection from the
elements, life safety, safety from fire and other hazards, and for safe and
sanitary maintenance; the responsibility of owners, operators and occupants;
the occupancy of existing structures and premises, and for administration,
enforcement and penalties.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-2)
Editor’s note:
   (A)   This section establishes the broad purpose of the Code—to protect the
pubic health, safety and welfare in both existing residential and
nonresidential structures and on all existing premises.
   (B)   Four specific areas are addressed in greater detail in subsequent
sections:
      (1)   Establishing minimum maintenance standards for such elements as
basic equipment, light, ventilation, heating, sanitation and fire safety;
      (2)   Fixing responsibility among owners, operators and occupants for
following the Code;
      (3)   Regulating the use of existing structures and premises; and
      (4)   Providing for administration, enforcement and penalties.
   (C)   These four categories provide communities with the tools to reduce
risks created by deteriorated or unsafe buildings and help communities upgrade
and maintain other existing structures.
§ 151.003 INTENT.
   This Code shall be construed to secure its expressed intent, which is to
ensure public health, safety and welfare insofar as they are affected by the
continued occupancy and maintenance of structures and premises. Existing
structures and premises that do not comply with these provisions shall be
altered or repaired to provide a minimum level of health and safety as required
herein. Repairs, alterations, additions to and change of occupancy in existing
buildings shall comply with the International Existing Building Code.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-3)
Editor’s note:
   This Code is intended to provide requirements addressing the public health,
safety and welfare as they relate to the use and maintenance of existing
structures and premises. The Code requires existing structures and premises
that are not in compliance with the Code to be altered or repaired to meet the
Code. The Code requirements are intended to represent the minimum acceptable
level of public health and safety. The International Existing Building Code®
(IEBC®) is listed as the required Code for all repairs, alterations, additions
and change of occupancies to existing structures.
§ 151.004 SEVERABILITY.
   If a section, division, sentence, clause or phrase of this Code is, for any
reason, held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions of this Code.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-4)
Editor’s note:
   Only invalid sections of the Code (as established by the court of
jurisdiction) can be set aside. This is essential to safeguard the application
of the Code text to situations whereby a provision of the Code is declared
illegal or unconstitutional. This section would preserve the legislative action
that put the legal provisions in place.
APPLICABILITY
§ 151.015 GENERAL.
   The provisions of this Code shall apply to all matters affecting or relating
to structures and premises, as set forth in §§
151.001 through
151.004. Where, in a specific case, different sections of this Code specify
different requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-5)
§ 151.016 MAINTENANCE.
   Equipment, systems, devices and safeguards required by this Code or a
previous regulation or Code under which the structure or premises was
constructed, altered or repaired shall be maintained in good working order. No
owner, operator or occupant shall cause any service, facility, equipment or
utility which is required under this section to be removed from or shut off
from or discontinued for any occupied dwelling, except for such temporary
interruption as necessary while repairs or alterations are in progress. The
requirements of this Code are not intended to provide the basis for removal or
abrogation of fire protection and safety systems and devices in existing
structures. Except as otherwise specified herein, the owner or the owner’s
designated agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of buildings,
structures and premises.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-6)
Editor’s note:
   This section contains general maintenance requirements. The Code
specifically prohibits the disconnection of any required utilities for an
occupied dwelling. This helps to safeguard persons who have a physical
condition and are dependent on these systems. Some examples of this include:
    a person who has to have electricity to power a kidney dialysis machine; a
patient who is on an oxygen system full time; or someone with particularly bad
allergies who needs to have an air conditioning system to help filter the air.
Any safety system that exists in a building must be maintained. A fire
protection or safety system is not to be removed from a building if it is
required by the Code or a previous regulation or code that was in effect when
the building was built. This section also specifies that the owner or the
owner’s agent is responsible for maintenance, not the tenants of rental
property.
§ 151.017 APPLICATION OF OTHER CODES.
   Repairs, additions or alterations to a structure, or changes of occupancy,
shall be done in accordance with the procedures and provisions of the
International Existing Building Code. Nothing in this Code shall be construed
to cancel, modify or set aside any provision of the village zoning regulations
as codified in
Chapter 156 of this code of ordinances.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-7)
§ 151.018 EXISTING REMEDIES.
   The provision in this Code shall not be construed to abolish or impair
existing remedies of the jurisdiction or its officers or agencies relating to
the removal or demolition of any structure which is dangerous, unsafe and
unsanitary.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-8)
§ 151.019 WORKMANSHIP.
   Repairs, maintenance work, alterations or installations which are caused
directly or indirectly by the enforcement of this Code shall be executed and
installed in a workmanlike manner and installed in accordance with the
manufacturer’s installation instructions.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-9)
§ 151.020 HISTORIC BUILDINGS.
   The provisions of this Code shall not be mandatory for existing buildings or
structures designated as historic buildings when such buildings or structures
are judged by the Code Official to be safe and in the public interest of
health, safety and welfare.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-10)
§ 151.021 REFERENCED CODES AND STANDARDS.
   The codes and standards referenced in this Code shall be those that are
listed in §
94.075 of this code of ordinances and considered part of the requirements of
this Code to the prescribed extent of each such reference. Where differences
occur between provisions of this Code and the referenced standards, the
provisions of this Code shall apply.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-11)
§ 151.022 REQUIREMENTS NOT COVERED BY CODE.
   Requirements necessary for the strength, stability or proper operation of an
existing fixture, structure or equipment, or for the public safety, health and
general welfare not specifically covered by this Code shall be determined by
the Code Official.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-12)
PROPERTY MAINTENANCE INSPECTION
§ 151.035 GENERAL.
   The Department of Property Maintenance Inspection is hereby created and the
executive official in charge thereof shall be known as the Code Official.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-14)
§ 151.036 APPOINTMENT.
   The Code Official shall be appointed by the President with the advice and
consent of the Village Board; and the Code Official shall not be removed from
office except for cause and after full opportunity to be heard on specific and
relevant charges by and before the appointing authority.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-15)
§ 151.037 DEPUTIES.
   In accordance with the prescribed procedures of this jurisdiction and with
the concurrence of the appointing authority, the Code Official shall have the
authority to appoint a Deputy Code Official, other related technical officers,
inspectors and other employees.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-16)
§ 151.038 LIABILITY.
   (A)   The Code Official, officer or employee charged with the enforcement of
this Code, while acting for the jurisdiction, shall not thereby be rendered
liable personally, and is hereby relieved from all personal liability for any
damage accruing to persons or property as a result of an act required or
permitted in the discharge of official duties.
   (B)   Any suit instituted against any officer or employee because of an act
performed by that officer or employee in the lawful discharge of duties and
under the provisions of this Code shall be defended by the legal representative
of the jurisdiction until the final termination of the proceedings. The Code
Official or any subordinate shall not be liable for costs in an action, suit or
proceeding that is instituted in pursuance of the provisions of this Code; and
any officer of the department of property maintenance inspection, acting in
good faith and without malice, shall be free from liability for acts performed
under any of its provisions or by reason of any act or omission in the
performance of official duties in connection therewith.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-17)
§ 151.039 FEES.
   The fees for activities and services performed by the department in carrying
out its responsibilities under this Code shall be set by the village and made
available to the public.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-18)
DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE CODE OFFICIAL
§ 151.050 GENERAL.
   The Code Official shall enforce the provisions of this Code.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-21)
§ 151.051 RULE-MAKING AUTHORITY.
   The Code Official shall have authority as necessary in the interest of
public health, safety and general welfare, to adopt and promulgate rules and
procedures; to interpret and implement the provisions of this Code; to secure
the intent thereof; and to designate requirements applicable because of local
climatic or other conditions. Such rules shall not have the effect of waiving
structural or fire performance requirements specifically provided for in this
Code, or of violating accepted engineering methods involving public safety.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-22)
§ 151.052 INSPECTIONS.
   The Code Official shall make all of the required inspections, or shall
accept reports of inspection by approved agencies or individuals. All reports
of such inspections shall be in writing and be certified by a responsible
officer of such approved agency or by the responsible individual. The Code
Official is authorized to engage such expert opinion as deemed necessary to
report upon unusual technical issues that arise, subject to the approval of the
appointing authority.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-23)
§ 151.053 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   The Code Official is authorized to enter the structure or premises at
reasonable times to inspect, subject to constitutional restrictions on
unreasonable searches and seizures. If entry is refused or not obtained, the
Code Official is authorized to pursue recourse as provided by law.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-24)
Editor’s note:
   This section establishes the right of the Code Official to enter the
premises in order to make the inspections required by §
151.052. The right to enter structures or premises is limited. First, to
protect the right of privacy, the owner or occupant must grant the Code
Official permission before an interior inspection of the property can be
conducted. Permission is not required for inspections that can be accomplished
from within the public right-of-way. Second, such access may be denied     by
the owner or occupant. Unless the inspector has reasonable cause to believe
that a violation     of the Code exists, access may be unattainable. Third,
Code Officials must present proper     identification and request admittance
during reasonable hours, usually the normal business hours of the
establishment, to be admitted. Fourth, inspections must be aimed at securing or
determining compliance with the provisions and intent of the regulations that
are specifically within the established scope of the Code Official’s authority.
   Searches of a private residence to gather information for the purpose of
enforcing codes, ordinances or regulations are considered unreasonable and are
prohibited by the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. “Reasonable cause”
in the context of this section must be distinguished from “probable cause”,
which is required to gain access to property in criminal cases. The burden of
proof establishing reasonable cause may vary among jurisdictions. Usually, an
inspector must show that the property is subject to inspection under the
provisions of the Code; that the interests of the public health, safety and
welfare outweigh the individual’s right to maintain privacy; and that such an
inspection is required solely to determine compliance with the provisions of
the Code.
   Many jurisdictions do not recognize the concept of an administrative warrant
and may require the Code Official to prove probable or reasonable cause in
order to gain access upon refusal. This burden of proof is usually more
substantial, often requiring the Code Official to stipulate in advance why
access is needed (usually access is restricted to gathering evidence for
seeking an indictment or making an arrest), what specific items or information
is sought, its relevance to the case against the individual subject, how
knowledge of the relevance of the information or items sought was obtained and
how the evidence sought will be used. In all such cases, the right to privacy
must always be weighed against the right of the Code Official to conduct an
inspection to verify that the public health, safety and welfare are not in
jeopardy. Such important and complex constitutional issues should be discussed
with the jurisdiction’s legal counsel. Jurisdictions should establish
procedures for securing the necessary court orders when an inspection is deemed
necessary following a refusal.
§ 151.054 IDENTIFICATION.
   The Code Official shall carry proper identification when inspecting
structures or premises in the performance of duties under this Code.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-25)
§ 151.055 NOTICES AND ORDERS.
   The Code Official shall issue all necessary notices or orders to ensure
compliance with this Code.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-26)
§ 151.056 DEPARTMENT RECORDS.
   The Code Official shall keep official records of all business and activities
of the department specified in the provisions of this Code. Such records shall
be retained in the official records as long as the building or structure to
which such records relate remains in existence, unless otherwise provided for
by other regulations.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-27)
§ 151.057 COORDINATION OF INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   Whenever in the enforcement of this Code or another code or ordinance,
the responsibility of more than one Code Official of the jurisdiction is
involved, it shall be the duty of the Code Officials involved to coordinate
their inspections and administrative orders as fully as practicable so that the
owners and occupants of the structure shall not be subjected to visits by
numerous inspectors or multiple or conflicting orders.
   (B)   Whenever an inspector from any agency or department observes an
apparent or actual violation of some provision of some law, ordinance or code
not within the inspector’s authority to enforce, the inspector shall report the
findings to the Code Official having jurisdiction.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-28)
APPROVAL
§ 151.070 MODIFICATIONS.
   Whenever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying out the
provisions of this Code, the Code Official shall have the authority to grant
modifications for individual cases, provided the Code Official shall first find
that special individual reason makes the strict letter of this Code impractical
and the modification is in compliance with the intent and purpose of this Code
and that such modification does not lessen health, life and fire safety
requirements. The details of action granting modifications shall be recorded
and entered in the department files.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-30)
§ 151.071 ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS, METHODS AND EQUIPMENT.
   The provisions of this Code are not intended to prevent the installation of
any material or to prohibit any method of construction not specifically
prescribed by this Code, provided that any such alternative has been approved.
An alternative material or method of construction shall be approved where the
Code Official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with
the intent of the provisions of this Code, and that the material, method or
work offered is, for the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of that
prescribed in this Code in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance,
durability and safety.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-31)
§ 151.072 REQUIRED TESTING.
   (A)   General. Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with
the provisions of this Code, or evidence that a material or method does not
conform to the requirements of this Code, or in order to substantiate claims
for alternative materials or methods, the Code Official shall have the
authority to require tests to be made as evidence of compliance at no expense
to the jurisdiction.
   (B)   Test methods. Test methods shall be as specified in this Code or by
other recognized test standards. In the absence of recognized and accepted test
methods, the Code Official shall be permitted to approve appropriate testing
procedures performed by an approved agency.
   (C)   Test reports. Reports of tests shall be retained by the Code Official
for the period required for retention of public records.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-32)
§ 151.073 MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT REUSE.
   Materials, equipment and devices shall not be reused unless such elements
are in good repair or have been reconditioned and tested when necessary, placed
in good and proper working condition and approved.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-33)
VIOLATIONS
§ 151.085 UNLAWFUL ACTS.
   It shall be unlawful for a person, firm or corporation to be in conflict
with or in violation of any of the provisions of this ode.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-35) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 151.086 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   The Code Official shall serve a notice of violation or order in accordance
with §§
151.100 through
151.104.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-36)
§ 151.087 PROSECUTION OF VIOLATION.
   Any person failing to comply with a notice of violation or order served in
accordance with §§
151.100 through
151.104 shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and the violation shall be
deemed a strict liability offense. If the notice of violation is not complied
with, the Code Official shall institute the appropriate proceeding at law or in
equity to restrain, correct or abate such violation, or to require the removal
or termination of the unlawful occupancy of the structure in violation of the
provisions of this Code or of the order or direction made pursuant thereto. Any
action taken by the authority having jurisdiction on such premises shall be
charged against the real estate upon which the structure is located and shall
be a lien upon such real estate.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-37)
§ 151.088 VIOLATION PENALTIES.
   (A)   Any person who shall violate a provision of this Code, or fail to
comply therewith, or with any of the requirements thereof, shall be prosecuted
within the limits provided by §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
   (B)   Each day that a violation continues after due notice has been served
shall be deemed a separate offense.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-38) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 151.089 ABATEMENT OF VIOLATION.
   The imposition of the penalties herein prescribed shall not preclude the
legal officer of the jurisdiction from instituting appropriate action to
restrain, correct or abate a violation, or to prevent illegal occupancy of a
building, structure or premises, or to stop an illegal act, conduct, business
or utilization of the building, structure or premises.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-39)
Editor’s note:
   Despite the assessment of a penalty in the form of a fine against a
violator, the violation itself must still be corrected. Failure to make the
necessary corrections will result in the violator being subject to additional
penalties as described in the proceeding section.
NOTICES AND ORDERS
§ 151.100 NOTICE TO PERSON RESPONSIBLE.
   Whenever the Code Official determines that there has been a violation of
this Code or has grounds to believe that a violation has occurred, notice shall
be given in the manner prescribed in §§
151.101 and
151.102 to the person responsible for the violation as specified in this Code.
Notices for condemnation procedures shall also comply with §
151.117.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-41)
§ 151.101 FORM.
   Such notice prescribed in §
151.100 shall be in accordance with all of the following:
   (A)   Be in writing;
   (B)   Include a description of the real estate sufficient for
identification;
   (C)   Include a statement of the violation or violations and why the notice
is being issued;
   (D)   Include a correction order allowing a reasonable time to make the
repairs and improvements required to bring the dwelling unit or structure into
compliance with the provisions of this Code;
   (E)   Inform the property owner of the right to appeal; and
   (F)   Include a statement of the right to file a lien in accordance with §
151.087.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-42)
§ 151.102 METHOD OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Such notice shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy thereof
is:
      (1)   Delivered personally;
      (2)   Sent by certified or first-class mail addressed to the last known
address; or
      (3)   If the notice is returned showing that the letter was not
delivered, a copy thereof shall be posted in a conspicuous place in or about
the structure affected by such notice.
   (B)   All of the services noted above may be expensive and time consuming.
In some communities, the courts may consider service to be valid if the notice
was sent to the last known address of the owner or owner’s agent by regular
postage and the notice was not returned by the post office. This method of
service is obviously much cheaper and usually faster than waiting for the
return of a certified letter. It must, however, be acceptable to the court
system. The jurisdiction’s attorney should be consulted to determine that the
type of service is legally acceptable, reasonably cost effective and timely.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-43)
§ 151.103 PENALTIES.
   Penalties for noncompliance with orders and notices shall be as set forth in
§
151.088.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-44) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 151.104 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP.
   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dwelling unit or structure who has
received a compliance order or upon whom a notice of violation has been served
to sell, transfer, mortgage, lease or otherwise dispose of such dwelling unit
or structure to another until the provisions of the compliance order or notice
of violation have been complied with, or until such owner shall first furnish
the grantee, transferee, mortgagee or lessee a true copy of any compliance
order or notice of violation issued by the Code Official and shall furnish to
the Code Official a signed and notarized statement from the grantee,
transferee, mortgagee or lessee, acknowledging the receipt of such compliance
order or notice of violation and fully accepting the responsibility without
condition for making the corrections or repairs required by such compliance
order or notice of violation.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-45)
Editor’s note:
   When a property has a pending violation order, it is unlawful for an owner
to sell, transfer, mortgage, lease or otherwise dispose of the property without
either following the order or advising the buyer, mortgagee and the like of the
pending violation. The owner must prove that the buyer has received notice of
pending violations by providing the Code Official with a signed, notarized
receipt from the new transferee.
   Determining who is the current owner of a building is a frustrating and
difficult activity. To evade code enforcement action, owners will frequently
transfer ownership of their property. This provision of the Code permits the
Code Official to cite the seller if he or she did not provide the Code Official
with the required notification when the property was transferred; thus, even
though the seller may avoid complying with the outstanding violation orders, he
or she can still be charged with a violation for failing to provide proof that
the transferee was aware of the pending orders.
UNSAFE STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENT
§ 151.115 GENERAL.
   When a structure or equipment is found by the Code Official to be unsafe, or
when a structure is found unfit for human occupancy, or is found unlawful, such
structure shall be condemned pursuant to the provisions of this Code.
   (A)   Unsafe structures. An unsafe structure is one that is found to be
dangerous to the life, health, property or safety of the public or the
occupants of the structure by not providing minimum safeguards to protect or
warn occupants in the event of fire, or because such structure contains unsafe
equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe or of
such faulty construction or unstable foundation, that partial or complete
collapse is possible.
   (B)   Unsafe equipment. Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating
equipment, elevator, moving stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable
liquid containers or other equipment on the premises or within the structure
which is in such disrepair or condition that such equipment is a hazard to
life, health, property or safety of the public or occupants of the premises or
structure.
   (C)   Structure unfit for human occupancy. A structure is unfit for human
occupancy whenever the Code Official finds that such structure is unsafe,
unlawful or, because of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or
lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains filth and
contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or heating
facilities or other essential equipment required by this Code, or because the
location of the structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the
structure or to the public.
   (D)   Unlawful structure. An unlawful structure is one found in whole or in
part to be occupied by more persons than permitted under this Code, or was
erected, altered or occupied contrary to law.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-47)
Editor’s note:
   This section provides a brief description of conditions where the Code
Official is given the authority to condemn an existing structure or equipment.
Where a structure or equipment is “unlawful”, as described in the text of this
section, that structure or equipment does not comply with the requirements of
the Code. The deficiencies are such that an unsafe condition or a condition
that is unfit for human occupancy exists.
   An unlawful structure is one that has serious deficiencies such that an
unsafe condition or a condition that is unfit for human occupancy exists. An
unlawful structure does not mean one where there are criminal activities.
§ 151.116 CLOSING OF VACANT STRUCTURES.
   If the structure is vacant and unfit for human habitation and occupancy, and
is not in danger of structural collapse, the Code Official is authorized to
post a placard of condemnation on the premises and order the structure closed
up so as not to be an attractive nuisance. Upon failure of the owner to close
up the premises within the time specified in the order, the Code Official shall
cause the premises to be closed and secured through any available public agency
or by contract or arrangement by private persons and the cost thereof shall be
charged against the real estate upon which the structure is located and shall
be a lien upon such real estate and may be collected by any other legal
resource.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-48)
§ 151.117 NOTICE.
   Whenever the Code Official has condemned a structure or equipment under the
provisions of this subchapter, notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place in
or about the structure affected by such notice and served on the owner or the
person or persons responsible for the structure or equipment in accordance with
§
151.102. If the notice pertains to equipment, it shall also be placed on the
condemned equipment. The notice shall be in the form prescribed in §
151.101.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-49)
§ 151.118 PLACARDING.
   (A)   General. Upon failure of the owner or person responsible to comply
with the notice provisions within the time given, the Code Official shall post
on the premises or on defective equipment, a placard bearing the word
“Condemned” and a statement of the penalties provided for occupying the
premises, operating the equipment or removing the placard.
   (B)   Placard removal. The Code Official shall remove the condemnation
placard whenever the defect or defects upon which the condemnation and
placarding action were based have been eliminated. Any person who defaces or
removes a condemnation placard without the approval of the Code Official shall
be subject to the penalties provided by this Code.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-50)
Editor’s note:
   Only the Code Official is authorized to remove a condemnation placard. The
Code Official is to remove the placard only when the defect or defects have
been corrected as required by the Code.
    Any other person who removes or defaces a placard is in violation of the
Code and subject to its penalties.
§ 151.119 PROHIBITED OCCUPANCY.
   Any occupied structure condemned and placarded by the Code Official shall be
vacated as ordered by the Code Official. Any person who shall occupy a
placarded premises or shall operate placarded equipment, and any owner or any
person responsible for the premises who shall let anyone occupy a placarded
premises or operate placarded equipment shall be liable for the penalties
provided by this Code.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-51)
EMERGENCY MEASURES
§ 151.130 IMMINENT DANGER.
   (A)   When, in the opinion of the Code Official, there is imminent damage of
failure or collapse of a building or structure which endangers life, or when
any structure or part of a structure has fallen and life is endangered by the
occupation of the structure, or when there is actual or potential danger to the
building, occupants or those in the proximity of any structure because of
explosives, explosive fumes or vapors or the presence of toxic fumes, gases or
materials, or operation of defective or dangerous equipment, the Code Official
is hereby authorized and empowered to order and require the occupants to vacate
the premises forthwith.
   (B)   The Code Official shall cause to be posted at each entrance to such
structure a notice reading as follows: “This Structure is Unsafe and its
Occupancy has been Prohibited by the Code Official.”
   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any person to enter such structure except for
the purpose of securing the structure, making the required repairs, removing
the hazardous condition or of demolishing the same.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-60) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 151.131 TEMPORARY SAFEGUARDS.
   Notwithstanding other provisions of this Code, whenever, in the opinion of

boarding-up of openings, to render such structure temporarily safe whether or
not the legal procedure herein described has been instituted; and shall cause
such other action to be taken as the Code Official deems necessary to meet such
emergency.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-61)
§ 151.132 CLOSING STREETS.
   When necessary for public safety, the Code Official shall temporarily close
structures and close, or order the authority having jurisdiction to close,
sidewalks, streets, public ways and places adjacent to unsafe structures, and
prohibit the same from being utilized.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-62)
§ 151.133 EMERGENCY REPAIRS.
   For the purposes of this section, the Code Official shall employ the
necessary labor and materials to perform the required work as expeditiously as
possible.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-63)
§ 151.134 COSTS OF EMERGENCY REPAIRS.
   Costs incurred in the performance of emergency work shall be paid by the
jurisdiction. The legal counsel of the jurisdiction shall institute appropriate
action against the owner of the premises where the unsafe structure is or was
located for the recovery of such costs.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-64)
§ 151.135 HEARING.

dilapidated or has become so out of repair as to be dangerous, unsafe,
unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human habitation or occupancy, and such that
it is unreasonable to repair the structure, to demolish and remove such
structure; or if such structure is capable of being made safe by repairs, to
repair and make safe and sanitary or to demolish and remove at the owner’s

Editor’s note:
   Before the Code Official can pursue action to demolish a building in
accordance with §§
151.150 or
151.152, it is imperative that all owners and any other persons with a recorded
encumbrance on the property be given proper notice of the demolition plans (see
§§
151.100 through
151.104 for notice and order requirements.)
§ 151.152 FAILURE TO COMPLY.
   If the owner of a premises fails to comply with a demolition order within
the time prescribed, the Code Official shall cause the structure to be
demolished and removed, either through an available public agency or by
contract or arrangement with private persons, and the cost of such demolition
and removal shall be charged against the real estate upon which the structure
is located and shall be a lien upon such real estate.
(2009 Code, § 29-1-69)
§ 151.153 SALVAGE MATERIALS.

body or other designated officer under said contract or arrangement aforesaid
shall have the right to sell the salvage and valuable materials at the highest
price obtainable. The net proceeds of such sale, after deducting the expenses
of such demolition and removal, shall be promptly remitted with a report of
such sale or transaction, including the items of expense and amounts deducted,
for the person who is entitled thereto, subject to any order of a court. If

violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (2)   The Village Manager is authorized to issue an order requiring the
suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing,
indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary,
to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      (3)   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the Village Board of Trustees. Written
notice of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
         (a)   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation; and
         (b)   The time and place of the hearing.
      (4)   At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on his or her behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the
Village Board of Trustees shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended
or revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

§ 153.07 SUSPENSION OF STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM ACCESS.
   (A)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
village may, without prior notice, suspend storm drainage system discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge, which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
system or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the village may take such steps as
deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the system or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the storm drainage system in violation of this chapter may have
his, her or its storm drainage system access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The village shall notify a violator
of the proposed termination of its storm drainage system access. The violator
may petition the village for a reconsideration and hearing.
   (C)   Reinstatement of storm drainage system. A person violates this chapter
if the person reinstates storm drainage system access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the village.

153.99
§ 153.08 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof
of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the
village prior to the allowing of discharges to the storm drainage system.
(2009 Code, § 32-1-8) (Ord. 04-03, passed 4-12-2004)
§ 153.09 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with residential, commercial and industrial
activity, including construction activity.
   (B)   Access to facilities.
      (1)   The village shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures
in force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry into
its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow
access to representatives of the village.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the village ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      (3)   The village shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the village to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s storm water discharge. Parameters
to be tested shall include, but not be limited to, total suspended solids
(TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), fecal coliform and pH.
      (4)   The village has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the village and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the village access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this chapter.
A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the village reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the village has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which storm water is discharged, and the village representative is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety
and welfare of the community, then the village may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

shall provide, at his, her or its own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person’s expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the system. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a
storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with
requirements of the NPDES permit.
(2009 Code, § 32-1-10) (Ord. 04-03, passed 4-12-2004)

day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the village within three business days of the phone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from private
property, a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of
such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge
and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained
for at least three years by the owner or operator.

DEVELOPMENT DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 154.070 GENERAL.
   The following standards and principles of design shall guide the laying out
of commercial and industrial developments.
   (A)   The design of the commercial development shall be in harmony with and
shall conform with the comprehensive plan (including the overall goals of the
village) and the official map and shall be in accordance with good commercial
development design principles not otherwise set forth herein.
   (B)   Natural features, such as topography, distinctive trees or vegetation,
streams, ponds, hilltops, bluffs, creek bottoms and outlook views, shall be
preserved and enhanced wherever possible. In laying out a commercial
development due consideration shall be given to such aesthetic features
existing within the tract being developed and which may add to the aesthetic
quality of existing nearby development.
(2009 Code, § 41-4-1) (Ord. 10-09-01, passed  10-09-2001 )
§ 154.071 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS.
   In all commercial development, measures are required to be taken to assure
that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of 25 year
frequency or less and that the following principles will be applicable in the
area to be developed.
   (A)   Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site
so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes where
high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible and
natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.
   (B)   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible.
Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left undisturbed
wherever possible.
   (C)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest
practical time during development.
   (D)   Sediment basins, debris basins, de-silting basins, or silt traps or
filters should be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off
waters from land undergoing development.

will not be changed by the construction of such subdivision or any part
thereof, or, that if such surface water drainage will be changed, reasonable
provision has been made for collection and diversion of such surface waters
into pubic areas, or drams which the subdivider has a right to use, and that
such surface waters will be planned for in accordance with generally accepted
engineering practices so as to reduce the likelihood of damage to the adjoining
property because of the construction of the subdivision.”

calculations shall utilize a hydrograph method acceptable to the Village
Engineer that generates runoff volumes through inflow hydrographs that account
for the watershed features being drained. Inflow hydrographs shall be generated
by the design formula using a design storm with a range of rainfall durations
(one to 24 hours) associated with a recurrence interval of 100 years (1% chance
of occurrence in any given year) and the post development watershed runoff
conditions. The critical rainfall duration shall be used to size the detention
basin. Rainfall depths and durations shall be as provided by the State Water
Survey Bulletin 70 - Frequency Distributions and Hydroclimatic Characteristics
of Heavy Rainstorms in Illinois, latest edition. Rainfall distribution shall be
as provided for in the Illinois State Water Survey Circular 173 - Time
Distributions of Heavy Rainstorms in Illinois, latest edition. The allowable
release rate from the detention facility shall be computed using a recurrence
interval of 100 years (1% chance of occurrence in any given year) for the storm
period calculated by the time of concentration and the pre-developed watershed
runoff conditions. The Village Engineer shall have the discretion to require
the use of a recurrence interval less than 100 years (1% chance) to protect
inadequate downstream infrastructure or sensitive downstream areas.
   (N)   For tributary areas of less than five acres, the rational method may
be used to calculate runoff volumes and allowable release rates as outlined in
the latest version of the Illinois Department of Transportation Drainage
Manual. The allowable release rate from the detention facility shall be
calculated using a recurrence interval of 100 years (1% chance of occurrence in
any given year) for the storm period calculated by the time of concentration
and the pre-developed watershed runoff conditions. The Village Engineer shall
have the discretion to require the use of a recurrence interval less than 100
years to protect inadequate downstream infrastructure or sensitive downstream
areas.
   (O)   Detention ponds serving tributary areas greater than five acres shall
include a forebay (sediment trap) to capture sediment and pollutants contained
in the storm water runoff. The forebay shall be sized for a range of 15% to 25%
of the design capture runoff volume and designed to reduce the incoming channel
velocity to less than four feet/second. Where a sediment trap is not practical
or feasible as determined in concert with the Village Engineer, other means
shall be utilized to control sediment.
   (P)   Detention ponds shall include an emergency spillway that is designed
to safely pass the 100-year critical duration storm event to protect the
integrity of the pond embankment.
   (Q)   Development covenants shall provide village officials or their
representative’s access to the detention pond for inspection immediately after
completion of construction and annual inspections as required by their national
pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit issued by the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA).

that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of 25-year
frequency or less and that the following principles will be applicable in the
area to be developed:
   (A)   Site design should be related to the topography and soils of the site
so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes where
high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible and
natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.
   (B)   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible.
Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left undisturbed

(2009 Code, § 35-1-7) (Ord. 91-4, passed 5-6-1991)
§ 155.008 SUITABILITY OF LAND FOR SUBDIVISION.
   (A)   Land subject to flooding. Land subject to flooding and land deemed to
be topographically unsuitable for development, or lands in environmentally
sensitive areas shall not be subdivided for residential purposes, nor for such
other uses as may increase danger to health, life or property or aggravate
erosion or flood hazard.
   (B)   Suitable land for subdivision.
      (1)   To be suitable for subdivision, land proposed to be subdivided
shall have essential utilities and public services available within a
reasonable distance and time period. Land to which these essential utilities
and services will not be provided shall be deemed unsuitable for subdividing.
      (2)   Essential utilities and services and criteria for determining if
they can adequately be provided shall include the following:
         (a)   Sanitary sewer system. Sanitary sewer system shall be provided
in accordance with §
155.093, provided that if the land cannot be served with sanitary trunk sewers,
the land shall be unsuitable for subdividing unless it can be shown that
adequate private sewage systems can be provided, as required by §
155.093. Due to various environmental factors and considerations, some land
will not be suitable for private sewage systems.
         (b)   Water main supply system. Water main supply system shall be
provided in accordance with §
155.095 and only as may be approved by the village’s water supplier pursuant to
the village’s agreement to obtain water service, provided that private wells
may be permitted for developments outside the village if the developer can
demonstrate that it is not feasible to extend water mains to the land proposed
to be subdivided. As a minimum guideline, the extension of 120 feet of water
main per each individual lot of the preliminary plan shall be deemed feasible.
This distance shall be measured between the nearest suitable public water main
and the proposed development. Mains within the development shall not count
toward this extension footage.
         (c)   Streets, curbs and gutters.
            1.   Land proposed to be subdivided shall be suitable for street
construction and shall not have limitations which adversely affect construction
conditions. Factors to be considered include:
               a.   Soil type as it affects shrinkage, swelling, frost heave
and related considerations;
               b.   Water table as it affects subgrade; and
               c.   Slope as it affects maintenance, snow plowing, sight
distance, parking safety and need for large amounts of fill.
            2.   The Village Engineer shall make the final determination on
suitability for street construction, including §
155.096 for further requirements which may affect suitability.
            3.   The suitability of existing streets for access to the proposed
subdivision and/or for incorporation into the proposed subdivision’s street
system shall also be considered. A street shall be considered suitable if:
               a.   The street is constructed of all weather material
(concrete, asphalt, oil mat);
               b.   The pavement has the equivalent strength to carry emergency
and safety vehicles (minimum two-inch asphalt on six-inch crushed rock);
               c.   The paved area is at least 20 feet wide with a road bed 24
feet wide;
               d.   There is a minimum vertical clearance of 13 feet six
inches; and
               e.   The street has good positive drainage and is not subject to
frequent flooding.
   (C)   Other requirements.
      (1)   The site must be in conformance with the village’s comprehensive
plan.
      (2)   Development must be in accord with appropriate jurisdictional flood
plain regulations.
      (3)   The site must be of a shape, size and terrain so that usable lots
and streets in conformance with this chapter can and will be created. To
achieve conformance, the site may require special design or may require the
contemporaneous subdividing of adjacent property.
      (4)   Development must not have a major conflict with existing use of
adjacent property unless it is shown that factors which cause the conflict can
and will be mitigated.
      (5)   Development must not cause major off-site impacts and problems
relating to, but not limited to, streets, drainage, water system and parks. If
it is determined that major off-site impacts will result, the subdivider must
agree to mitigate the portion of the impact caused by the subdivision.
(2009 Code, § 35-1-8) (Ord. 91-4, passed 5-6-1991; Ord. 97-6, passed 4-14-1997)
§ 155.009 CONNECTION TO VILLAGE UTILITIES.
   Storm sewers, sanitary sewers and water mains shall not be connected or tied
into the village storm sewer, sanitary sewers or water mains until:
   (A)   The subdivision has been annexed to the village;
   (B)   Construction plan approval has been reviewed and approval recommended
by the Village Engineer;
   (C)   All fees and assessments have been paid;
   (D)   All necessary permits for such connections have been granted by the
appropriate governing agency; and
   (E)   Inspection and approval has been made by an authorized agent for the
village.
(2009 Code, § 35-1-9) (Ord. 91-4, passed 5-6-1991)
§ 155.010 FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
   Any subdivision which contains or is a part of “A” Zones as delineated on
the flood hazard boundary map must observe all rules and regulations outlined
in Chapter 152 of this code of ordinances, and ordinance regulating development
in special flood hazard areas, as now in force or as may be amended from time
to time, which ordinance regulates the construction, substantial improvements,
subdivision of land, placement of structures or other development in relation
to flood hazard areas.
(2009 Code, § 35-1-10) (Ord. 91-4, passed 5-6-1991)
§ 155.011 PUBLIC LANDS.
   (A)   Planned public improvement sites indicated on the official map, which
is adopted herein by reference, may be required by the village as part of the
approval of the subdivision. Such public improvements may include, but are not
limited to, roadways and the widening of existing roadways, school sites,
parks, recreational and conservation area sites, public building sites, storm
drainage sites, bikeways and utility easements.
   (B)   Whenever the official map of the village has indicated the necessity
to provide public improvements within a proposed subdivision, the Planning and
Zoning Commission and the Village Board shall require that certain lands be
designed for such public purpose before granting approval to such plat; except,
however, that if the governing board of the agency responsible for that
proposed public site by formal action indicates disinterest in the site, the
Planning and Zoning Commission and the Village Board may permit the designated
site to be used for any other purpose consistent with this chapter and the
zoning provisions of
Chapter 156 of the village code of ordinances. Furthermore, such site shall be
held for that specific public improvement for a period of one year from the
date of final plat approval by the Village Board.
   (C)   Whenever a site for public improvements has been indicated on an
approved final plat, the appropriate public agency shall acquire such land or

1998)
DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 155.070 GENERAL.
   (A)   The design of the subdivision shall be in harmony with and shall
conform with the comprehensive plan (including the overall goals of the
village) and the official map and shall be in accordance with good subdivision
design principles not otherwise set forth herein.
   (B)   Natural features, such as distinctive trees or vegetation, streams,
ponds, hilltops, bluffs, creek bottoms and outlook views, shall be preserved

subdivisions.
(2009 Code, § 35-4-1) (Ord. 91-4, passed 5-6-1991)
§ 155.071 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS.
   In all subdivision development, measures are required to be taken to assure
that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of ten year
frequency or less and that the following principles will be applicable in the
area to be subdivided.
   (A)   Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site
so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes where
high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible and
natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.
   (B)   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible.
Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left undisturbed
wherever possible.
   (C)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest
practical time during development.
   (D)   Sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins or silt traps or
filters should be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off
waters from land undergoing development.
   (E)   The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be
based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events
likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs and
benefits involved.
   (F)   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics
and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered.
   (G)   Provision shall be made to accommodate the increased run-off caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways
should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities
of discharges will not create additional erosion, and should be protected
against erosion and sedimentation during development.
   (H)   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as
practical during development.
   (I)   During construction of public improvements, measures shall be taken to
control erosion and sedimentation to ensure that sediment will not be
transported from the site by a storm event of ten year frequency or less. The
erosion and sediment control plan shall include measures to stabilize and
protect disturbed areas, keep run-off velocities low, retain sediment on site
and protect disturbed areas from runoff. The location, type and configuration
of controls such as swales, berms, dams, sediment basins and release mechanisms
shall be included with the construction plans.
   (J)   Temporary or permanent soil stabilization measures, whichever is
applicable, shall be applied within 14 days after final grading to all areas
where the soil has been disturbed or the vegetative cover removed. Seeding
mixtures and rates, types of sod, method of seed bed preparation, expected
seeding dates, type and rate of lime and fertilizer application and kind and
quantity of mulch for temporary and permanent vegetative control measures shall
be included with the construction plans.
(2009 Code, § 35-4-2) (Ord. 91-4, passed 5-6-1991)
§ 155.072 STREETS.
   All streets are to be designed in accordance with the State Department of
Transportation Bureau of Design and Environment (BDE) and/or Local Roads
Manual, or any replacement or substitute therefor, as such may be in effect
from time to time.
   (A)   General. The course, general location, pavement and right-of-way width
and grade of all streets shall conform to the comprehensive plan, official map
and standards contained herein. The location of streets in the proposed
subdivision shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned
streets, to topographic conditions, to flood plains and wetlands, to public
convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of the land to be served by such streets.
   (B)   Arrangement of streets. Where not shown on the comprehensive plan or
the official map, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
      (1)   Provide for the continuation or projection of existing streets in
surrounding areas; or
      (2)   Conform to topographic or other conditions where continuance or
projection of existing streets is impractical or undesirable from the community
viewpoint.
   (C)   Minor residential streets. Minor residential streets shall be so laid
out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
   (D)   Access to existing or proposed major street. Access to an existing or
proposed major street shall be limited to a minimum number of intersections and
be determined with due regard for sight distance, distance between intersection
and approach grades.
   (E)   Street grades. No street grade as measured along the centerline shall
be less than 0.5% or more than 7%. The maximum grade on arterial streets shall
not exceed 5%.
   (F)   Street intersections.
      (1)   Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 60
degrees.
      (2)   Street intersections with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet
are prohibited.
      (3)   Curb corners at street intersections shall have a minimum radius of
25 feet.
   (G)   Horizontal deflection of street lines.
      (1)   Where connecting street lines deflect from each other more than ten
degrees, they shall be connected with a curve with a radius adequate to assure
sight distance.
      (2)   A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between curves
on collector streets where the curve radius is less than 500 feet.
   (H)   Alleys. Alleys shall not be permitted in proposed residential
districts.
   (I)   Right-of-way.
      (1)   Street right-of-way widths for streets shown on the comprehensive
plan or the official map shall follow §
155.096(L) but in no case shall be less than as follows:
Alleys                    20
Arterial streets (other)* 100
Arterial streets (state)  IDOT requirements
Collector streets         60
Cul-de-sac                50
Marginal access           40
Minor streets             50
Pedestrianways            10
*Right-of-way width of streets and roads should be in accord with the more
restrictive requirements of county, township or village having jurisdiction
over right-of-way width. Extensions of collector streets and arterial streets,
indicated on the official map, will, for the purpose of determining required
right-of-way, carry the same classification
 
      (2)   In a subdivision that adjoins or includes an existing street that
does not conform to the right-of-way width required above, one-half of the
additional width shall be provided along each side of such street for the
entire frontage included within the land being subdivided.
   (J)   Dead-end or cul-de-sac streets. Dead-end or cul-de-sac streets shall
not be longer than 500 feet. They shall be provided with a circular turnaround
having an outside surface diameter of the paved surface of at least 80 feet and
right-of-way line diameter of at least 100 feet. The center of the turnaround
shall be located on the centerline or between the centerline of the street and
its left right- of-way line, facing into the turnaround.
   (K)   Dedication to public. All streets shall be dedicated to the public.
   (L)   Reserved strips. Reserved strips controlling access to street rights-
of-way shall not be permitted except upon approval of the Planning and Zoning
Commission and when control and disposition of the reserved strip is vested in
the Village Board.
   (M)   Street names and numbers.
      (1)   The continuation of an existing street shall have the same name.
The name of a new street shall not duplicate the name of an existing street
within the area served by the same post office or Fire Department.
      (2)   If a proposed subdivision is in close proximity to a municipality
which has adopted a street numbering system, the lots within the subdivision
shall be assigned street numbers in accordance with that municipal street
numbering system, where practicable.
   (N)   Vertical curves. All grade changes shall be connected by vertical
curves. The length of vertical curves shall not be less than 30 times the
algebraic difference in rates of grade for crest curves and 35 times the
algebraic difference for sag curves. When speed limits are to be posted greater
than 30 mph, vertical curvature shall be used as contained within the latest
revision of A Policy on Geometric Design on Highways and Streets (AASHTO) for
urban, local, collector and arterial streets by the respective classification.
The minimum length of vertical curves on all types of streets shall be 30 feet.
   (O)   Horizontal curves. When a centerline deflection angle is greater than
one degree, the following curves will be required in the street: major and
minor arterials and collector streets shall have a minimum centerline radius of
300 feet and a minimum length of curve of 100 feet; arterials and collectors
having a design speed and/or expected posted speed greater than 30 mph shall be
consistent with the latest revision of the horizontal curvature requirements of

§ 155.094 STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM.
   (A)   The subdivider, through the subdivider’s engineer, shall submit
drainage calculations supporting the storm drainage and detention system signed
and sealed by a licensed professional engineer in the state. Included in the
drainage calculations shall be a signed statement by the licensed professional
engineer that the construction plans account for changes in the drainage of
surface waters in the subdivision, as required in 765 ILCS 205/2 (Plat Act).
Language for this statement shall be as follows:
      “To the best of my knowledge and belief the drainage of surface waters
will not be changed by the construction of such subdivision or any part
thereof, or, that if such surface water drainage will be changed, reasonable
provision has been made for collection and diversion of such surface waters
into public areas, or drains which the subdivider has a right to use, and that
such surface waters will be planned for in accordance with generally accepted
engineering practices so as to reduce the likelihood of damage to the adjoining
property because of the construction of the subdivision.”
   (B)   The storm drainage system shall be adequate to properly drain the
subdivision and all other upstream areas that are tributary to the subdivision.
Runoff from such upstream areas shall be calculated as if they were fully
developed according to their existing zoning classifications.
   (C)   The storm drainage system shall be designed using a minimum five-year
storm at the upstream end of the system and a minimum ten-year storm for the
remainder of the system. Drainage calculations to support the storm sewer and
storm water detention facility design shall be submitted along with the
construction plans. Drainage calculations shall include a narrative and summary
of the existing and proposed drainage patterns, surface cover types, times of
concentration, flow rates, rainfall intensities and pipe and storage
capacities. Said calculations shall be signed and sealed by a state registered
professional engineer. The subdivider is strongly encouraged to utilize
recognized best management practices (BMPs), such as conserving open space,
reducing imperviousness, utilizing bio-swales, creating depression storage,
installing permeable pavement and the like, for reducing the quantity of storm
water runoff and improving the quality of storm water runoff to mimic the
natural watershed hydrology.
   (D)   The storm drainage system discharge onto adjacent downstream
properties shall be designed so as not to increase the rate of runoff in
conformance with the drainage laws of the state.
   (E)   The storm drainage system discharge points shall be provided with
erosion control and velocity dissipation structures adequate to prevent damage
to downstream properties.
   (F)   Drainage structures shall be as specified by the village or as
approved by the Village Engineer. Storm drain structures shall utilize
resilient connectors between storm sewer pipes and laterals as specified in
ASTM C 1478.

pipe being proposed. All storm sewers shall be backfilled with approved trench
backfill material and compacted by approved methods.
   (H)   All field tiles encountered during construction shall be repaired as
directed by the village, with the size, pipe material, location, and depth
indicated on the record drawings. Where field tiles are damaged and it is
determined by the Village Engineer that it cannot be repaired, provisions shall
be made to reroute the field tile to the nearest available storm sewer.
   (I)   Sump pump discharge lines shall connect to a storm sewer, where
available. When a storm sewer is not available, a sump pump collector line
shall be provided by the subdivider. All sump pump discharge lines are to

Engineer.
   (L)   For tributary areas of five acres or more, storm water detention
calculations shall utilize a hydrograph method acceptable to the Village
Engineer that generates runoff volumes through inflow hydrographs that account
for the watershed features being drained. Inflow hydrographs shall be generated
by the design formula using a design storm with a range of rainfall durations
(one to 24 hours) associated with a recurrence interval of 100 years (1% chance
of occurrence in any given year) and the post development watershed runoff
conditions. The critical rainfall duration shall be used to size the detention
basin. Rainfall depths and durations shall be as provided by the State Water
Survey Bulletin 70 - Frequency Distributions and Hydroclimatic Characteristics
of Heavy Rainstorms in Illinois, latest edition. Rainfall distribution shall be
as provided for in the State Water Survey Circular 173 - Time Distributions of
Heavy Rainstorms in Illinois, latest edition. The allowable release rate from
the detention facility shall be calculated using a recurrence interval of 100
years (1% chance of occurrence in any given year) for the storm period
calculated by the time of concentration and the pre-developed watershed runoff
conditions. The Village Engineer shall have the discretion to require the use
of a recurrence interval less than 100 years (1% chance) to protect inadequate
downstream infrastructure or sensitive downstream areas.
   (M)   For tributary areas of less than five acres, the rational method may
be used to calculate runoff volumes and allowable release rates as outlined in
the latest version of the State Department of Transportation Drainage Manual.
The allowable release rate from the detention facility shall be calculated
using a recurrence interval of 100 years (1% chance of occurrence in any given
year) for the storm period calculated by the time of concentration and the pre-
developed watershed runoff conditions. The Village Engineer shall have the
discretion to require the use of a recurrence interval less than 100 years to
protect inadequate downstream infrastructure or sensitive downstream areas.
   (N)   Detention ponds serving tributary areas greater than five acres shall
include a forebay (sediment trap) to capture sediment and pollutants contained
in the storm water runoff. The forebay shall be sized for a range of 15% to 25%
of the design capture runoff volume and designed to reduce the incoming channel
velocity to less than four feet/second. Where a sediment trap is not practical
or feasible as determined in concert with the Village Engineer, other means
shall be utilized to control sediment.
   (O)   Detention ponds shall include an emergency spillway that is designed
to safely pass the 100-year critical duration storm event to protect the
integrity of the pond embankment.
   (P)   Subdivision covenants shall provide village officials or their
representative’s access to the detention pond for inspection immediately after
completion of construction and annual inspections as required by their national
pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit issued by the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA).

§ 155.130 FAIR SHARE ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. The village’s comprehensive plan adopted May 6 and
effective May 31, 1991. It contains information on household and population
projections to the year 2010. The numbers are relevant to planning for and
meeting new growth demands.
      FACILITIES PLAN SECOND AMENDMENT. The village report dated May 1990 on
the existing municipal sanitary sewer system and needed capital improvements to
meet new growth.
      FAIR SHARE ASSESSMENT. A monetary charge imposed on developers by the
village through the subdivision process. It is designed to permit the village
to provide for and to cover the proportional costs of utility improvements that
are specifically and uniquely attributable to the development activity. The
developer being assessed pays only a proportional share of the cost of capital
improvements to permit development activity.
      HOUSEHOLDS. The number of residential units of any type in the village as
identified by the U.S. Bureau of Census in 2000. The census totaled 1,075
households.
      INTERIOR PLUMBED FIXTURE. Devices located within a building structure
that have the capability of regularly receiving water and discharging it into
the sewer system. This shall include, but not be limited to, sinks, toilets,
washing machines and stub end plumbing installations. A STUB END PLUMBING
INSTALLATION is a device designed to take water or waste water and discharge it
into the sewer system, but is not yet in service and may be capable of use in
the future. This shall not include floor drains and fire prevention devices.
      QUANTIFIABLE CONTRIBUTION. A capital improvement, land or other
measurable item of value offered to the village that may be deemed by the
village to be beneficial.
      QUANTIFIED BENEFIT. A quantifiable contribution accepted by the village.
The monetary value of the benefit can be off-set against the per interior
plumbed fixture fair share assessment.
      SPECIFICALLY AND UNIQUELY ATTRIBUTABLE. An identifiable portion of the
need for additional public facilities or capital improvement projects resulting
from proposed subdivision development. The need has been identified as
improvements to the water and sewer system to accommodate new growth. The cost
is proportionally assessed by use of a fair share formula.
      SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE. The village’s subdivision chapter adopted on May 6
and effective on May 31, 1991, as amended from time to time.
      VILLAGE. The Village of Rochester or the President and Board of Trustees;
depending upon the context.
      WATER DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS, REPORT ON. The village report dated March
1990 on the existing municipal water system and needed capital improvements to
meet new growth.
      ZONING ORDINANCE. The village’s zoning chapter adopted May 6 and
effective May 31, 1991, as amended from time to time. This is the source for
the development types referenced in this section.
   (B)   Establish fair share assessment. As a condition of approval of a final
plat of subdivision, each subdivider or developer will be required to
compensate the village in accordance with the criteria and formula stipulated
in the following divisions.
(Ord. 17-01, passed 1-9-2017)
   (C)   Utility improvement cost factors.
      (1)   The engineering report entitled Report on Water Distribution
Analysis concerning the water supply and distribution system identified needed
capital improvements to serve existing and new growth areas. The engineering
report entitled Facilities Plan Second Amendment concerns sanitary sewage
distribution and treatment identified needed capital improvements to serve
existing and new growth areas. The report recommended and the village selected
the treatment destination to be the Springfield, Metropolitan Sanitary District
Sugar Creek Plant.
      (2)   Phase IA and IB water capital improvements and Phase I and II
sanitary sewage capital improvements were approved with a current engineering
cost estimate of $2,897,000. It is estimated that $661,000 of that amount can
be attributed to meeting Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandates to
improve the system serving the existing developed areas of the village. The
remaining $2,236,000 estimate represents the cost of serving new subdivisions
and developments in accordance with EPA standards. The $2,236,000 figure shall
serve as the cost factor base for the formula enumerated in this section.
Appendix A in this section identifies the pertinent engineering studies and
updates on capital improvement costs. The figures exclude legal, administrative
or financing costs.
   (D)   Formula factors. Residential and industrial/business properties are
included within the scope of this section. Appendix A delineates the factors on
interior plumbed fixtures for residential, school and commercial types used as
the baseline for the fair share assessment formula.
   (E)   Formula. The formula is set forth in
Appendix B in this section.
   (F)   Fees. The fair share assessment for each interior plumbed fixture is
$231. See
Appendix B in this section for a sampling of fees based upon the number of
interior plumbed fixtures.
   (G)   Payment. A fair share assessment imposed pursuant to this section
shall be charged to the developer and collected in full from the developer, as
follows:
      (1)   Residential. Assessments shall be paid in full prior to the
issuance of the building permit;
      (2)   Business/industrial. Assessments shall be paid in full prior to the
issuance of the building permit;
      (3)   Payment at other times. Payment of any assessments may at the sole
discretion of the Village Board for good cause shown, be authorized at some
time other than as specified in divisions (G)(1) and (G)(2) above. This is
permissible provided that the village receives security ensuring such later
payment of assessment. Security may be in the form of a cash bond, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or other acceptable method. Nothing contained in
this section shall preclude the payment of the fair share assessment at the
time when the building permit is issued or at an earlier stage of development
if agreed to by the village and the person paying the assessment;
      (4)   Written condition. In any event, payment of the fair share
assessment shall be a written condition of final plat approval; and
      (5)   Payment. Any person desiring to pre-pay the fair share assessment
in full for an entire subdivision within the village shall make the payment as
calculated under the formula set forth in
Appendix C in this section as a condition of approval of a final plat of
subdivision.
   (H)   Modified assessment and quantifiable contributions. The Village Board
may consider alternative forms of contribution that may modify the final
assessment. This may occur when a developer offers a quantifiable contribution
or cash. After sufficient review of the offer, the village may determine that
it should be accepted. Upon formal acceptance, the quantified benefit may be

EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
§ 155.175 INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE.
   (A)   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. Erosion of soil endangers water resources by reducing water
quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species. Sedimentation necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and
the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during construction
cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic
habitat.
   (B)   As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard
persons, protect property and prevent damage to the environment in the Village
of Rochester, hereinafter called the village. This subchapter will also promote
the public welfare by guiding, regulating and controlling the design,
construction, use and maintenance of ay development or other activity that
disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land
within the corporate limits of the village.

NONCONFORMING USES
§ 156.125 INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may
later be adopted there exist:
   (A)   Lots, structures, uses of land and structures and characteristics of
use, which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which
would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or
future amendments. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district;
   (B)   Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a
structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of structure and
land in combination may be contained but shall not be extended or enlarged
after the effective date hereof, shall not have attached on a building or
premises, additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or shall
not have the addition of other uses, of a nature which would be prohibited
generally in the district involved;
   (C)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building
construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner; and
   (D)   Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has
been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that
work shall be carried on diligently.

§ 156.126 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (A)   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record at the effective date of this chapter or amendment
thereof, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage
with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though
such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district; provided, that yard dimensions and
requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot
shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (B)   If two or more lots or combinations of lots or portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be
considered to be undivided parcels for the purposes of this chapter, and no
portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this chapter,
nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot width or area
below the requirements stated in this chapter.

to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter;

   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date hereof of amendment of
this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reason
of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot
or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity;

$1,000 or more, of structure and premises in combination, exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, that would not be

continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:

in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located;
   (B)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building;
   (C)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may as a special exception be changed to
another nonconforming use provided that the Planning and Zoning Commission,
either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find
that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the
district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the
Planning and Zoning Commission may require appropriate conditions and
safeguards in accord with the provisions of this chapter;
   (D)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 18

combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located; and

nonconforming status of the land. DESTRUCTION for the purpose of this division
(E) is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50% of the replacement cost
at time of destruction.

cost of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of the structure
as the case may be; provided, that the cubic content existing when it became
nonconforming shall not be increased.
   (B)   If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs

restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the
district in which it is located.

   (A)   Aesthetics.

aesthetic environment, and quality of the Village of Rochester in ways that
will attract commerce, businesses, economic development, new residents and
visitors;
      (2)   Exercise reasonable controls over the physical characteristics and
structural design of signs in a manner that promotes and enhances the
aesthetics of all Village zoning districts and that complements the natural
surroundings of the village in such a way as to retain economic advantage for
this community; and
      (3)   Reduce visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the
proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height,
and excessive sign area (size) of signs that compete for the attention of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic.

      (1)   Promote the public health, safety, and general welfare through
reasonable, consistent, and non-discriminatory standards for signs;
      (2)   Maintain and improve traffic and pedestrian safety through properly
located signs;
      (3)   Regulate signs in a manner so as to not obstruct the vision of, or
distract motorists, bicyclists, or pedestrians; and
      (4)   Allow for those traffic-control devices that are consistent with
national standards and whose purpose is to promote roadway safety and
efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of road users on streets and
roadways, that notify users of regulations, and that provide warning and
guidance necessary for the safe, uniform and efficient operation of all
elements of the traffic stream.
   (C)   Economic Development.
      (1)   Promote economic development and the value of nonresidential
properties through sensitivity to surrounding land uses and maintenance of an
attractive community appearance.
      (2)   Assist the public and private sectors to identify the location of
goods, properties and services.
   (D)   Effective Communication.
      (1)   Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication;
and
      (2)   Encourage signs that are clear and legible.
   (E)   Historical Character. Emphasize the village' s small-town historical
character by promoting pedestrian-oriented and appropriately scaled signage.
   (F)   Compatibility with Surroundings.
      (1)   Allow signs compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation;
      (2)   Preclude the placement of signs concealing or obstructing adjacent
land uses or signs;

private property.

zoning district in which they are located.

      (1)   Relate signage to the basic principles of good architectural and
landscape design;
      (2)   Establish sizing of signs in relationship to the scale of the lot
and/or building on which a sign is to be placed or to which it pertains;

encouraging signs to be constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and
satisfactory manner, except as may be expressly preempted by state or Federal
law.
   (J)   Property Values.
      (1)   Protect neighborhood property values by precluding, to the maximum
extent possible, sign types that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of
other properties as a result of their number and physical characteristics such
as sign area (size), height, illumination, and movement; and
      (2)   Protect property values by ensuring that the number of signs are in
harmony with buildings, neighborhoods, and conforming signs in the area and to
avoid the adverse effects and visual blight caused by temporary signs.
   (K)   Enforcement.
      (1)   Enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign
regulations;
      (2)   Provide standards regarding the non-communicative aspects of signs
that are consistent with local, county, state, and Federal law.

      (1)   Censor speech or regulate viewpoints;
      (2)   Extend, for purpose of regulation, the ordinance as it relates to
objects that are not traditionally considered signs.

§ 156.175 NON-CONFORMING SIGNS.
   It is reasonable that special conditions be placed upon the continuance of
existing non-conforming signs. This special non-conforming program permits the
current owner to continue using the non-conforming sign while at the same time
assuring that the district in which the non-conforming sign exists will
eventually comply:
   (A)   Continuance of non-conforming signs. 
      (1)   A non-conforming sign is any sign which was lawfully erected and
maintained prior to such time as it came within the purview of this section and
any amendments hereto, and which fails to conform to all applicable regulations
and restrictions contained in this section.
      (2)   Subject to the termination provisions of this section, any non-
conforming sign may be continued in operation and maintained after the
effective date of this subchapter provided, however, that no such sign shall be
changed in any manner; and, provided further, that the burden of establishing a
sign to be non-conforming under this section rests entirely upon the person or
persons, firm or corporation claiming a non-conforming status for a sign.
   (B)   Termination of non-conforming signs.
      (1)   By abandonment. Abandonment or cessation for a period of 90 days or
the change of the principal use to which the non-conforming sign is accessory
shall terminate immediately the right to maintain such sign.
      (2)   By violation of the subchapter. Any violation of the provisions of
this section shall terminate immediately the right to maintain a non-conforming
sign.
      (3)   By destruction, damage, or obsolescence. The right to maintain any
non-conforming sign shall terminate whenever the sign:
         (a)   Is damaged or destroyed, from any cause whatsoever, to the
extent that its repair or replacement cost exceeds 50% of its replacement cost
as of the date it became non-conforming; or
         (b)   Becomes a hazard or a danger to the safety or welfare of the
general public.
      (4)   By new ownership or change in tenant or use. Transfer of ownership
or change in the use or tenant shall terminate immediately the right to
maintain a non-conforming sign. The new owner has 180 days from close of sale
within which to bring the non-conforming sign into compliance.
      (5)   By new development on the zoning lot. Where new construction occurs
on a zoning lot, any non-conforming sign which may exist on said lot shall be
removed or modified as necessary to conform to the requirements of this
section. This shall occur before permits are issued for site development and
building construction on the premises.
      (6)   By redevelopment. Non-conforming signs which are moved or affected
by the redevelopment of a property; facade improvement program; or roadway
widening shall not be reinstalled but shall instead be brought into conformance
with all elements of this code.
   (C)   Notification to remove.
      (1)   If the village finds that any sign is unsafe or insecure, or is a
menace to the public, or has been constructed or erected or is being maintained
in violation of the provisions of this section, the village shall issue written
notice of such condition or violation to the person to whom the permit for said
sign has been issued.
      (2)   All notices issued by the village shall describe the sign and its
location and shall specify the manner in which the sign is in violation of the
ordinance(s) of the Village of Rochester. All notices issued by the village
shall be sent by certified mail and regular mail to the current owner. Any time
period provided for in this section shall be deemed to commence on the postmark
on the notice of violation of the certified mail.
      (3)   If the party to whom such notice is issued fails to remove or alter
the sign so as to comply with the provisions of this section, within 15 days of
the postmark on the notice of violation of the certified mail, the village may
remove or alter the sign at the expense of the owner.
      (4)   The cost of removing the sign may be recovered by the Village of
Rochester through any appropriate legal proceeding or by assessment against the
property. The cost of removal shall be deemed to include any and all incidental
expenses, as well as all direct and indirect costs, incurred by the village in
connection with removal of the sign.
      (5)   The village may cause any sign which is an immediate peril to
persons or property to be removed summarily and without notice.
      (6)   The village shall not issue any sign permit to any person who
refuses to pay costs or expenses incurred by the village in removing or
altering any sign for which they have previously obtained a permit, regardless
of whether legal proceedings have been initiated for the purpose of recovering
such costs.

approved for construction prior to the adoption of this subchapter shall not be
required to modify or change the approved plans for off-street parking and
loading; provided, that such construction is completed within one year from the

   (C)   Reduction in parking or loading need. When a building or structure
shall undergo any decrease in number of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity, number of employees or other unit of measurement specified
hereinafter for required parking or loading facilities, and further, when said
decrease would result in a requirement for fewer total parking or loading
spaces through application of the provisions of this subchapter, parking and
loading facilities may be reduced accordingly; provided, that existing parking
or loading facilities remaining would at least equal the parking or loading
requirements resulting from application of the provisions of this subchapter to
the entire building or structure as modified.
   (D)   Increase in parking or loading need. When a building or structure
shall undergo any increase in the number of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity or other unit of measurement specified hereinafter for
required parking or loading facilities, and further, when said increase would
result in a measurement for additional parking or loading spaces through
application of the provisions of this subchapter thereto, parking and loading
facilities shall be increased to accommodate only the additional need as a
result of such change.
   (E)   Existing parking or loading not to be reduced. Accessory off-street
parking and loading spaces in existence on the effective date of this
subchapter may not be reduced in number unless already exceeding the
requirements of this subchapter for equivalent new construction; in which
event, said spaces shall not be reduced below the number required herein for
such equivalent new construction.
   (F)   Parking and loading for reconstructed nonconforming uses. Any
nonconforming building, structure or use in existence on the effective date of
this subchapter shall, if partially destroyed by fire, collapse or other cause
and permitted to rebuild or reconstruct under appropriate provisions of this
subchapter, provide off-street parking and loading equivalent to those
maintained prior to such damage being sustained.
   (G)   Schedule of requirements for off-street parking and loading;

§ 156.206 PROCEDURE FOR ZONING ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Zoning certificate procedure.
      (1)   No zoning permit pertaining to the use of land, structures or
buildings shall be issued by any officer, department or employee of the village
unless the application for such permit has been subjected to administrative
review by the Village Manager for compliance with this chapter. Any permit
issued in conflict with the provisions of this chapter shall be null and void.
Zoning permits shall not be issued to any applicant so long as that applicant
is indebted to the village for any prior fees of any type.
      (2)   Applications for zoning permits shall be filed in written form with
the Village Manager on forms prescribed by him or her indicating:
         (a)   Legal description of the property;
         (b)   Name and address of applicant, owner and contractor;
         (c)   Uses to be established or expanded; and
         (d)   Other information deemed appropriate by the Village Manager to
clearly denote the nature and character of the intended improvement and use.
      (3)   For all uses, except one- and two-family residential structures on
platted regular shaped lots, the applications for a zoning certificate shall be
accompanied by a drawing to scale showing the actual dimensions as certified by
a land surveyor or licensed civil engineer as a true copy of the lot on which
the improvement or use is to be placed, accompanied by a drawing to scale of
the location on such lot of the proposed building, structure or use, and
accessory buildings; and location and height of any fences or landscape
screening proposed to be installed. For one- and two-family structures on
platted regular shaped lots, the application for a zoning permit shall be
accompanied by a dimensioned freehand sketch drawing showing the proposed
building, structure or use, nearest distances to lot lines, height of buildings
or portions of buildings and location and height of fences or landscape
screening proposed to be installed.
      (4)   The Village Manager shall approve or deny the issuance of a zoning
certificate within seven days of the date of filing for such certificate. If
not approved within time limit, the zoning permit shall be deemed to be denied.
      (5)   Such zoning certificate, once issued, shall be maintained in a
prominent location at the premises for which it is issued, and shall not be
removed until final inspection and issuance of a certificate of occupancy by
the Village Inspector.
      (6)   Work or change in use authorized by zoning certificate but not
started within 90 days shall require a new certificate. Certificates issued for
new building construction or expansion shall require the completion of the
exterior of building(s) within 360 days. A certificate shall be revoked and
notice of violation issued when it shall be found from personal inspection or
competent evidence that the rules or regulations under which it has been issued
are being violated.
   (B)   Zoning certificate of occupancy procedure.
      (1)   No building or building addition constructed after the effective
date of this chapter and no land vacant on the effective date of this chapter,
shall be used for any purpose until a certificate of occupancy has been issued
by the Village Inspector. No change in use shall be made until such certificate
of occupancy shall state that the use or occupancy complies with the provisions
of this chapter.
      (2)   Every application for a zoning certificate shall be deemed to be an
application for certificate of occupancy.
      (3)   No certificate of occupancy for the use of a premises for which a
zoning permit has been issued shall be issued until construction has been
completed, a final inspection made and the premises certified to be in
compliance with the plans and specifications for which the zoning certificate
was issued. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued to any applicant so
long as that applicant is indebted to the village for any prior fees of any
type. The zoning certificate of occupancy shall be issued or denied within
seven days after the Village Inspector is notified that the building or
premises is ready for occupancy.
   (C)   Variation procedure.
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Commission, after a public hearing, may
recommend to the Village Board the varying of the regulations of this chapter
in harmony with their general purpose and intent only in the specific instances
hereinafter set forth, where the Planning and Zoning Commission makes finding
of fact in accordance with the standards hereinafter prescribed and further,
finds that there are practical difficulties or particular hardships in the way
of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of this chapter.
      (2)   An application for variation shall be filed in writing with the
Village Manager. The application shall contain such information as the Planning
and Zoning Commission may, by rule, require. Notice of such public hearing
shall be made as prescribed by law. The required legal notice may be
supplemented by such additional form of notice as the Planning and Zoning
Commission, by rule, may require.
      (3)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall not recommend to the
Village Board varying the regulations of this chapter, as authorized by this
section, unless it shall first make findings of fact based upon the evidence
presented to it in each of the following evidence of which the petitioner is
responsible for demonstrating:
         (a)   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations
governing the zoning district in which it is located;
         (b)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures or buildings in the same district;
         (c)   Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this chapter;
         (d)   The plight of the applicant is due to unique circumstances and
does not result from the actions of the applicant;
         (e)   Granting the variation requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district; and
         (f)   The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality.
      (4)   No nonconforming uses of neighboring lands or structures, in the
same district and no permitted, special or nonconforming uses or lands or
structures in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a
variance.
      (5)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may require such conditions and
restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a variation as may be necessary to
comply with the standards set forth in this subchapter to reduce or minimize
the injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood
and to implement the general purpose and intent of this chapter.
      (6)   The following situations, and only those situations, are
permissible areas in which variations from the regulations of this chapter are
allowed to be recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission and granted by
the Village Board when in accordance with the standards established in this
section:
         (a)   To permit a yard less than required by the applicable
regulations;
         (b)   To permit the use of a lot of record on the effective date of
this chapter for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of the insufficient
area of the lot, but in no event shall the area of the lot be less than 80% of
the required lot area;
         (c)   To permit the same off-street parking spaces to qualify as
required spaces for two or more uses; provided, that the maximum use of such
facility by each use does not take place during the same hours of the same days
of the week;
         (d)   To increase by not more than 25% the maximum distance that
required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use served;
         (e)   To allow any permitted nonresidential use in a residence
district to exceed the floor area ratio imposed by the applicable regulations;
         (f)   To permit a variation in number, size or location of accessory
use, accessory area, accessory buildings or structures; and
         (g)   Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give or grant to
the Planning and Zoning Commission the power to recommend through variations or
to the Village Board the authority to alter or change the zoning
classifications of the zoning district map or to permit a use not otherwise
permitted by variation, such power and authority being exercised only by the
zoning amendment procedure as outlined in division (E) below.
   (D)   Appeals procedure.
      (1)   An appeal may be taken to the Planning and Zoning Commission by any
person or by any officer, department, board or bureau aggrieved by a decision
of the Village Manager or his or her authorized agent. Such an appeal shall be
taken within 45 days of the action complained of, by filing with the
Chairperson of the Planning and Zoning Commission a notice of appeal specifying
the grounds thereof. The Chairperson of the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall forthwith transmit to the Planning and Zoning Commission all the papers
constituting a record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
      (2)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed unless the Chairperson of the Planning and Zoning Commission certifies
to the Planning and Zoning Commission, after notice of the appeal has been
filed with the Village Clerk, that by reason of facts stated in the appeal, a
stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in
which case the proceedings shall not be stayed unless by a restraining order
which may be granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission or by a court of
record in application of the Village Manager and on due cause shown.
      (3)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall select a reasonable time
and place for the hearing of the appeal and give notice thereof to the parties
and shall render a written decision on the appeal without unreasonable delay.
The Planning and Zoning Commission may affirm or may reverse, wholly or in
part, or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination that, in its
opinion, ought to be done; and to that end, shall have all the powers of the
officer from whom the appeal is taken. The Village Manager shall maintain
records of all actions of the Planning and Zoning Commission relative to
appeals.
   (E)   Zoning amendment procedure.
      (1)   Amendments may be proposed by the Village Board of Trustees, the
Planning and Zoning Commission or any person; provided, that any person shall
have a freehold interest, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive
possession, a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest or any
exclusive possessory interest (with the concurrence of the person holding the
freehold interest) which is specifically enforceable in the land which is
described in the application for amendment. Any proposal shall set forth names
of owner of all benefitting interests in any land trusts wherein a land trust
is proposing such amendment.
      (2)   An application for an amendment shall be obtained from and filed
with the Village Manager. Such applications for zoning amendments shall be in a
form so that the application, when complete, including required accompanying
material, shall provide such information as required by Planning and Zoning
Commission for its review. Application for amendments initiated by the Planning
and Zoning Commission or Village Board of Trustees shall include a copy of the
minutes of that body approving the filing of an application for zoning
amendment. Applications for zoning amendments initiated by any person described
above as eligible to petition for a zoning amendment, shall not be considered
nor scheduled for public hearing until the zoning amendment fee has been
deposited with the Village Clerk to partially cover the cost of this procedure,
and under no condition shall such sum or any part thereof be refunded for
failure of said amendment to be enacted into law.
      (3)   Once the zoning regulations amendment has been filed with the
Village Manager, the Village Manager shall arrange proper legal notice, as
required by law, and schedule for public hearing the next regular Planning and
Zoning Commission meeting which fulfills minimum public notice requirement.
      (4)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing on
each application for zoning amendment at the time and place scheduled in the
public notice. The hearing shall be conducted and a record of proceedings
preserved in the manner as from time to time prescribed by the Planning and
Zoning Commission. Where additional information is required for the
Commission’s review, the Board, by official action, may continue the hearing to
the time and place of the next Planning and Zoning Commission meeting.
      (5)   (a)   Within 45 days after the close of the hearing on a proposed
amendment, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall make its recommendation to
the Village Board. On applications for zoning amendments which would change the
zoning classification of a particular property, the recommendation shall
include findings of fact bearing on the decision. Such findings of fact shall
relate to matters such as:
            1.   Existing uses of other property within the general area of the
subject property;
            2.   Evidenced recent trends in land use development of the general
area;
            3.   Any conditions which render the property less desirable or
inappropriate for the uses to which it is presently zoned;
            4.   Availability of other areas already zoned for such uses;
            5.   The zoning amendment, if granted, serves the public interest
and does not solely benefit the property of the applicant alone; and
            6.   The amendment would not be inconsistent with the objectives of
the comprehensive plan.
         (b)   In its findings of fact and recommendation to the Village Board,
the Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend approval or disapproval, or
recommend the change of zoning classification of the subject property to any
other more restrictive zoning classification than specified in the public
notice.
      (6)   The Village Board shall not act upon a proposed amendment to this
chapter until it shall have received a written report and recommendation from
the Planning and Zoning Commission except, however, that no action by the
Planning and Zoning Commission within 45 days of the public hearing of the
matter shall be deemed to be a favorable recommendation. A favorable vote of
two-thirds of the Trustees then holding office will be required to adopt a
zoning amendment not recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (7)   The Village Board, after receiving the recommendation of the
Planning and Zoning Commission, or after the above prescribed time period, if
no report is received and without further public hearing may grant or deny any
proposed zoning amendment, or may refer it back to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for further study. In case of a written protest against any proposed
zoning amendment signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20% of the frontage
proposed to be altered or by the owners of 20% of the frontage immediately
adjoining or across the alley therefrom or by the owners of 20% of the frontage
directly opposite the frontage proposed to be altered, as to regulations or
district, filed with the Village Clerk, such amendment shall not be passed
except by the favorable vote of two-thirds of the Trustees then holding office.
      (8)   The Village Manager shall cause to be published, no later than
March 31 of each year, a zoning district map clearly showing the existing
zoning uses, divisions, restrictions, regulations and classifications for the
preceding calendar year. If, in any calendar year, there are no changes in the
zoning uses, division, restrictions, regulations and classifications no map
need be published for such calendar year. The Village Board may establish a fee
to be charged each person desiring a copy of such map. Such fee shall be paid
to the village who shall account for such monies. Such fees shall be applied to
defray the costs of publishing the zoning map.
   (F)   Special use procedures.
      (1)   Applications for special use may be filed by any person having a
freehold interest in land or a possessory interest entitled to exclusive
possession (with the concurrent of the person holding the freehold interest) or
a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest or an exclusive
possessory interest which is specifically enforceable.
      (2)   An application for a special use permit shall be obtained from and
filed with the Village Manager. Such application for a special use permit shall
be in a form so that the application, when complete, including required
accompanying material, shall provide such information as required by the
Planning and Zoning Commission for its review. The accompanying material shall
include a written statement signed by the applicant as to how the standards for
the granting of the special use permit are met. These standards shall include:
         (a)   The proposed use will not adversely affect other property
developed or able to be developed to the uses already permitted;
         (b)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary
supporting facilities have been or are being provided;
         (c)   Adequate measures have been provided to accommodate ingress and
egress so as to avoid congestion, not unduly impede surrounding traffic flows
or create hazardous or unsafe conditions;
         (d)   The standards for site development, will be such as to enhance
the proposed use and its setting, screen or so locate parking, loading, storage
and less attractive accessory uses away from public view, and to otherwise
complement the visual appearance of the area in which the proposed project is
to be located. The applicant may offer or the Planning and Zoning Commission
may require a site development and landscape and screening plan as part of the
applicant’s written statement; and
         (e)   The proposed special use, if permitted, will conform to all
other requirements of the district in which it is to be located or if not
conforming, a listing of necessary variations which will be required subsequent
to the granting of the special use permitted by the Village Board.
      (3)   Once the special use application has been filed with the Village
Manager, the Village Manager shall arrange proper legal notice as required by
law and schedule the public hearing for the next regular Planning and Zoning
Commission meeting which fulfills minimum public notice requirements.
      (4)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing on
the proposed special use at the time and place scheduled in the public notice.
The hearing shall be conducted and a record of the proceedings preserved in the
manner as from time to time prescribed by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (5)   Within 45 days of the close of the hearing on the proposed special
use, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall make its recommendation to the
Village Board attaching the applicant’s signed statement and any other
conditions suggested by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Village Board
may recommend granting or denying the special use permit and may modify or
attach any additional conditions to which the proposed special use would be
subject.
      (6)   The granting of a special use by the Village Board shall constitute
authorization for the Village Manager to issue a zoning certificate for the
proposed use subject to any conditions imposed in the granting.
      (7)   Special uses approved by the Village Board shall be designated on
the zoning map by a symbol. Failure of the applicant or other subsequent person
continuing the special use, from continually maintaining the use in a manner
complying with the conditions under which the use was granted, shall constitute
a zoning violation subject to the penalties of this chapter. In the event of
termination of a special use, permitted uses under the applicable zoning
classification shall be the only uses allowed and for which subsequent building
permits or use permits may be issued.
