1-1-10 COURT PROCEEDINGS.
No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former ordinance,
whether such former ordinance is expressly repealed or not, as to any offense
committed against such former ordinance or as to any act done, any penalty,
forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising
under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any claim arising
under the former ordinance or in any way whatever to affect any such offense or
act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so
incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance takes
effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform to the
ordinance in force at the time of such proceeding, so far as practicable. If
any penalty, forfeiture or punishment be mitigated by any provision of a new
ordinance, such provision may be, by the consent of the party affected, applied

pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the City herein repealed
and the provisions of all general ordinances contained in this Code shall be
deemed to be continuing provisions and not a new enactment of the same
provision; nor shall this Chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating,
modifying or altering any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the
liability of any person, firm or corporation, or as waiving any right of the
City under any ordinance or provision thereof in force at the time of the
adoption of this Code.

DIVISION III - GENERAL PENALTY
1-1-20 PENALTY.
In accordance with 65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, it is hereby established by the City that
violations of the Revised Code of Ordinances, as may exist currently or such
ordinances as may be later adopted, shall subject the defendant to fines of not
less than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) nor more than Seven Hundred Fifty
Dollars ($750.00) per violation and injunctive relief. For the same offense(s),
the City may, concurrently, seek monetary fines against the defendant and
injunctive relief. For purposes of this Section, every day that a violation
exists shall be deemed a separate chargeable offense, potentially subjecting
the defendant to multiple citations. The City hereby waives the right to seek
jail time for any violation of the Revised Code of Ordinances, although the
defendant who violates an Order of the Court regarding an ordinance violation
may be subject to contempt proceedings with the Court, which may result in jail
time in the event the Court's Orders regarding disposition of an ordinance
violation are not followed.
   In addition to the above fines, costs, and injunctive relief, a penalty
imposed for violation of an ordinance may include, or consist of, a requirement
that the defendant do one or both of the following:
   (A)   Complete an education program, except that a holder of a valid
commercial driver's license who commits a vehicle weight or size restriction
violation shall not be required to complete an education program under this
Section.
   (B)   Perform some reasonable public service work such as but not limited to
the picking up of litter in public parks or along public highways or the
maintenance of public facilities.
   A default in the payment of a fine or penalty or any installment of a fine
or penalty may be collected by any means authorized for the collection of
monetary judgments. The municipal attorney of the municipality in which the
fine or penalty was imposed may retain attorneys and private collection agents
for the purpose of collecting any default in payment of any fine or penalty or
installment of that fine or penalty. Any fees and costs incurred by the
municipality with respect to attorneys or private collection agents retained by
the municipal attorney under this Section shall be charged to the offender.
   If a court awards injunctive relief to the City against the defendant, and
the defendant subsequently violates the injunction, the City may recover from
the defendant any attorney's fees and costs incurred by the municipality to
enforce the injunction.
   The Chief of Police is authorized to informally adjudicate ordinance
violations and allow the defendant the opportunity to pay a fine or cost, or
perform such public service as may be deemed necessary and appropriate and in
deviation of the fines and penalties as set forth herein, in advance of
submitting the ordinance violation to the Court System for formal adjudication.

certified mail, return receipt requested, whether service is to be within or
without the State. (See 65 ILCS Sec. 5/1-2-9.1)
1-1-23 APPLICATION.
   (A)   The penalty provided in this Chapter shall be applicable to every
section of this City Code, the same as though it were a part of each and every
separate section. Any person convicted of a violation of any section of this
City Code, where any duty is prescribed or obligation imposed, or where any act
which is of a continuing nature or declared to be unlawful, shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each
day such duty or obligation remains unperformed or such act continues, unless
otherwise specifically provided in this City Code.
   (B)   In all cases where the same offense is made punishable or is created
by different clauses or sections of this City Code, the prosecuting officer may
elect under which to proceed; but not more than one (1) recovery shall be had
against the same person for the same offense; provided that the revocation of a
license or permit shall not be considered a recovery or penalty so as to bar
any other penalty being enforced.
   (C)   Whenever the doing of any act or the omission to do any act
constitutes a breach of any section or provision of this City Code, and there
shall be no fine or penalty specifically declared for such breach, the
provisions of this Code shall apply and a separate offense shall be deemed
committed upon each day during or on which a breach or violation occurs or
continues.

entitled to the floor.

If any member required it, the “yeas” and “nays” upon any question shall be
taken and entered in the journal; but the yeas and nays shall not be taken
unless called for prior to any vote on the question. When the Clerk has
commenced to call the roll of the members for the taking of a vote by yeas and
nays, all debate on the question before the City Council shall be deemed
concluded, and during the taking of the vote, no member shall be permitted to
explain his vote, but shall respond to the calling of his name by the Clerk, by
answering yea or nay, as the case may be.
   (R)   Announcement and Changes of Vote. The result of all votes by yeas and
nays shall not be announced by the Clerk, but shall be handed by him to the

The City Council may, at any time, adjourn over one (1) or more regular
meetings on a vote of a majority of all the Aldermen authorized by law to be
elected.
   (U)   Previous Question. When the previous question is moved on the main
question and seconded, it shall be put on this form: “Shall the main question

Reference to Time. When consideration of a motion or other proposition is
postponed indefinitely, it shall not be again taken up at the same meeting.
      A motion to postpone indefinitely shall not open the main question to
debate.
      A motion to defer or postpone without any reference to time shall not be
construed as a motion to postpone indefinitely, but shall be considered to be
of the same general nature and to possess the same general attributes so far as
applicable under these rules, as a motion to postpone indefinitely or to a time

   (C)   Vote Required-Yeas and Nays Record. The passage of all ordinances for
whatever purpose, and of any resolution or motion (1) to create any liability

require the concurrence of a majority of all members then holding office on the
City Council, including the Mayor, unless otherwise expressly provided by the
Code or any other act governing the passage of any ordinance, resolution, or
motion; provided that, where the Council consists of an odd number of Aldermen,
the vote of the majority of the Aldermen shall be sufficient to pass an
ordinance. The yeas and nays shall be taken upon the question of the passage of
the designated ordinances, resolutions, or motions and recorded in the journal

orders, resolutions or motions placed together for voting purposes in a single
group. The single vote shall be entered separately in the journal under the
designation "omnibus vote", and in such event the Clerk may enter the words
"omnibus vote" or "consent agenda" in the journal in each case in lieu of
entering names of the members of City Council voting "yea" and of those voting
"nay" on the passage of each of the designated ordinances, orders, resolutions
and motions included in such omnibus group or consent agenda. The taking of
such single or omnibus vote and such entries of the words "omnibus vote" or
"consent agenda" in the journal shall be a sufficient compliance with the
requirements of this section to all intents and purposes and with like effect
as if the vote in each case had been separately by yeas and nays on the

included in such omnibus group, and separately recorded in the journal.

City Council, with his written objections, at the next regular meeting of the
City Council occurring not less than five (5) days after their passage. The

resolution, or motion, notwithstanding the Mayor's refusal to approve it, then
it shall be effective. The vote on the question of passage over the Mayor's

the neighborhood who are of ordinary sensibilities. Such dogs and cats are
hereby declared to be a public nuisance.
   (B)   Petitions of Complaint. Whenever any person shall complain to the
Police Department that a dog which habitually barks, howls or yelps or a cat

willfully or maliciously inflict unnecessary or needless cruelty, torture,

injury or death to any animal, whether such animal belongs to such person or to
another, except that reasonable force may be employed to drive away vicious or

DIVISION III - VICIOUS AND DANGEROUS DOGS
3-6-25 SCOPE.
   (A)   In order to have a dog deemed “vicious” as defined in Section
3-6-1 of this Code, the Administrator, Deputy Administrator, or law enforcement
officer must give notice of the infraction that is the basis of the
investigation to the owner, conduct a thorough investigation, interview any
witnesses, including the owner, gather any existing medical records, veterinary
medical records or behavioral evidence, and make a detailed report finding that
the dog is a vicious dog and give the report to the State’s Attorney Office and
the owner. The Administrator, State’s Attorney, or any citizen of the county in
which the dog exists may file a complaint in the circuit court in the name of
the People of the State of Illinois to deem a dog to be a vicious dog.
Testimony of a board certified veterinarian or another recognized expert may be
relevant to the court’s determination of whether the dog’s behavior is
justified. The Administrator may impound said dog upon finding the dog is a
vicious dog. The Administrator will determine where the animal shall be
confined during the pendency of the case.
   (B)   A dog may not be declared vicious if the Administrator determines the
conduct of the dog was justified because:
      (1)   The threat, injury, or death was sustained by a person who at the
time was committing a crime or offense upon the owner or custodian of the dog,
or upon the property of the owner or custodian of the dog;
      (2)    The injured, threatened, or killed person was abusing or
assaulting the dog.
      (3)   No dog shall be declared vicious if it is a professionally trained
dog for law enforcement in the performance of its duties. Vicious dogs shall
not be classified in a manner that is specific as to breed.
   (C)   No landlord or landlord’s agent shall knowingly permit any tenant to
move a vicious dog into or keep a vicious dog in any building or premises owned
or controlled by such landlord or agent. No landlord or landlord’s agent shall
knowingly permit any tenant to keep a vicious dog in any building or premises
owned or controlled by such landlord or agent. Any landlord or agent thereof
learning of any vicious dog in any building or premises owned or controlled by
such a landlord or agent thereof shall notify the person having such dog to
remove the dog from the premises immediately.
   (D)   Owner of rental property, landlord, or landlord’s agent that allows or
permits a vicious dog on his rental property, to stay in any of rental
buildings, or helps hide a vicious dog in any of the rental buildings, will be
responsible for any damage that the dog may cause if the animal attacks a
person or companion animal. The dog will be impounded and euthanized.
(510 ILCS 5/15)
3-6-26 VICIOUS DOGS - CONTROL, IMPOUNDMENT, APPEAL.
   (A)   Any dog which has been found to be a vicious dog shall be impounded by
the Administrator, animal control warden, or the law enforcement authority
having jurisdiction in such area.
   If a dog is found to be a vicious dog, the owner shall pay a One Hundred
Dollar ($100.00) public safety fine to be deposited into the Pet Population
Control Fund, the dog shall be spayed or neutered within ten (10) days of the
finding at the expense of its owner and microchipped, if not already, and the
dog is subject to enclosure. If an owner fails to comply with these
requirements, the animal control agency shall impound the dog and the owner
shall pay a Five Hundred Dollar ($500.00) fine plus impoundment fees to the
animal control agency impounding the dog. The judge has the discretion to order
a vicious dog be euthanized. A dog found to be a vicious dog will not be
released to the owner until the Administrator, an Animal Control Warden, or the
Director approves the enclosure. No owner or keeper of a vicious dog shall sell
or give away the dog without approval from the Administrator or court. Whenever
an owner of a vicious dog relocates, he or she shall notify both the
Administrator of County Animal Control where he or she has relocated and the
Administrator of County Animal Control where he or she formerly resided.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or maintain any dog which
has been found to be a vicious dog unless the dog is kept in an enclosure. The
only times that a vicious dog may be allowed out of the enclosure are (1) if it
is necessary for the owner or keeper to obtain veterinary care for the dog, (2)
in the case of an emergency or natural disaster where the dog’s life is
threatened, or (3) to comply with the order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, provided that the dog is securely muzzled and restrained with a
leash not exceeding six (6) feet in length, and shall be under the direct
control and supervision of the owner or keeper of the dog or muzzled in its
residence.
   Any dog which has been found to be a vicious dog and which is not confined
to an enclosure shall be impounded by the Administrator, an Animal Control
Warden, or the law enforcement authority having jurisdiction in such area. If
the owner of the dog has not appealed the impoundment order to the circuit
court in the county in which the animal was impounded within fifteen (15) days,
the dog may be euthanized.
   Upon filing a notice of appeal, the order of euthanasia shall be
automatically stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. The owner shall bear
the burden of timely notification to animal control in writing.
   Guide dogs for the blind or hearing impaired, support dogs for the
physically handicapped, and sentry, guard, or police-owned dogs are exempt from
this Section; provided, an attack or injury to a person occurs while the dog is
performing duties as expected. To qualify for exemption under this Section,
each such dog shall be currently inoculated against rabies in accordance with
Section 8 of this Act. It shall be the duty of the owner of such exempted dog
to notify the Administrator of changes of address. In the case of a sentry or
guard dog, the owner shall keep the Administrator advised of the location where
such dog will be stationed. The Administrator shall provide police and fire
departments with a categorized list of such exempted dogs, and shall promptly
notify such departments of any address changes reported to him.
   (C)   If the animal control agency has custody of the dog, the agency may
file a petition with the court requesting that the owner be ordered to post
security. The security must be in an amount sufficient to secure payment of all
reasonable expenses expected to be incurred by the animal control agency or
animal shelter in caring for and providing for the dog pending the
determination. Reasonable expenses include, but are not limited to, estimated
medical care and boarding of the animal for thirty (30) days. If security has
been posted in accordance with this Section, the animal control agency may draw
from the security the actual costs incurred by the agency in caring for the
dog.
   (D)   Upon receipt of a petition, the court must set a hearing on the
petition, to be conducted within five (5) business days after the petition is
filed. The petitioner must serve a true copy of the petition upon the
defendant.
   (E)   If the court orders the posting of security, the security must be
posted with the Clerk of the court within five (5) business days after the
hearing. If the person ordered to post security does not do so, the dog is
forfeited by operation of law and the animal control agency must dispose of the
animal through adoption or humane euthanization. (510 ILCS 5/15)
3-6-27 DANGEROUS DOGS; NUISANCE; EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   After a thorough investigation, including: sending notifications to
the owner of the alleged infractions within ten (10) business days, the fact of
the initiation of an investigation, and affording the owner an opportunity to
meet with the Administrator or Director prior to the making of a determination;
gathering of any medical or veterinary evidence; interviewing witnesses; and
making a detailed written report, an animal control warden, deputy
administrator, or law enforcement agent may ask the Administrator, or his/her
designee, or the Director, to deem a dog to be “dangerous”. The owner shall be
sent immediate notification of the determination by registered or certified
mail that includes a complete description of the appeal process. A dog may not
be declared dangerous if the Administrator, or his/her designee, or the
Director determines the conduct of the dog was justified because:

a crime or offense upon the owner or custodian of the dog;
      (2)   The threatened person was abusing or assaulting the dog;
      (3)    The injured, threatened, or killed companion animal was attacking
or threatening to attack the dog or its offspring; or
      (4)   The dog was responding to pain or injury.
   (B)   If deemed dangerous, the Administrator, or his or her designee, or the
Director shall order:
      (1)   The dog’s owner to pay a Fifty Dollar ($50.00) public safety fine
to be deposited into the Pet Population Control Fund,
      (2)   The dog to be spayed or neutered within seven (7) days at the
owner’s expense and microchipped, if not already, and
      (3)   One or more of the following as deemed appropriate under the
circumstances and necessary for the protection of the public:
         (a)   evaluation of the dog by a certified applied behaviorist, a
board certified veterinary behaviorist, or another recognized expert in the
field and completion of training or other treatment as deemed appropriate by
the expert. The owner of the dog shall be responsible for all costs associated
with evaluations and training ordered under this subsection; or
         (b)   direct supervision by an adult eighteen (18) years of age or
older whenever the animal is on public premises.
   (C)   The Administrator may order a dangerous dog to be muzzled and leashed
whenever it is off the owner’s real property in a manner that will prevent it
from biting any person or animal, but that shall not injure the dog or
interfere with its vision or respiration.
   (D)   It is unlawful for any person to maintain a public nuisance by
permitting any dangerous dog or other animal to leave the premises of its owner
when not under control by leash or other recognized control methods. (510 ILCS
5/15.2)
   (E)   All owners or keepers of dogs found to be dangerous must post in clear
view at all times, and in the most conspicuous or prominent point of entry to
the premises, a sign indicating dangerous dog on the premises. Such sign shall
be at least eight and one-half (8 ½) inches by eleven (11) inches in size, and
shall contain in words and pictures, a clear indication that a dangerous dog is
on the premises.
   (F)   The owner of a dog deemed dangerous shall supply a certificate of
insurance naming the host agency in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000.00) and has to keep the insurance as long as the person owns the dog.
If the owner allows the insurance to lapse, the dog will be impounded.

knowledge of all officers of the applicant and of each employee or agent of the
applicant involved with the proposed small wireless facility.
         (g)   In the event that the proposed small wireless facility is to be
attached to an existing pole owned by an entity other than the City, the
wireless provider shall provide legally competent evidence of the consent of
the owner of such pole to the proposed collocation.
      (2)   Application Process. The City shall process applications as
follows:
         (a)   The first completed application shall have priority over
applications received by different applicants for collocation on the same
utility pole or wireless support structure.
         (b)   An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement of an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the City fails to
approve or deny the application within ninety (90) days after the submission of
a completed application.
            However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the City, in
writing, of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than
seventy-five (75) days after the submission of a completed application; and
prior to the ninetieth (90th) day after the submission of the completed
application.
            Unless otherwise approved or rejected by the City within ninety
(90) days after the submission of the completed application, the permit shall
be deemed approved on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day after submission of
the complete application or the tenth (10th) day after the receipt of the
deemed approved notice by the City. The receipt of the deemed approved notice
shall not preclude the City’s denial of the permit request within the time
limits as provided under this Article.
         (c)   An application to collocate a small wireless facility that
includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the City fails to approve or
deny the application within one hundred twenty (120) days after the submission
of a completed application.
            However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the City in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than
one hundred five (105) days after the submission of a completed application;
and prior to the one hundred twentieth (120th) day after the submission of the
completed application.
            Unless otherwise approved or rejected by the City within one
hundred twenty (120) days after the submission of the completed application,
the permit shall be deemed approved on the later of the one hundred twentieth
(120th) day after submission of the completed application or the tenth (10th)
day after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the City. The receipt of
the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the City’s denial of the permit
request within the time limits as provided under this Article.
         (d)   The City may, on a non-discriminatory basis, deny an application
which does not meet the requirements of this Article.
            If the City determines that applicable codes, ordinances, or
regulations that concern public safety, or the Collocation Requirements and
Conditions contained herein require that the utility pole or wireless support
structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be
conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the applicant and/or the wireless provider.
            The City shall document the basis for a denial, including the
specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is
based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the
City denies an application.
            The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the City and
resubmit the revised application once within thirty (30) days after notice of
denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee.
The City shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30) days
after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure
to resubmit the revised application within thirty (30) days of denial shall
require the application to submit a new application with applicable fees, and
recommencement of the City’s review period. The application shall be reviewed
after completed applications that have been submitted before it.
            The applicant must notify the City in writing of its intention to
proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis (if denial is
not received within thirty (30) days after submission of the revised
application), which notification may be submitted with the revised application.
Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies cited
in the denial (so long as other provisions of the application have not been
changed). However, this limitation does not apply if the cure requires the
review of a new location, new or different structure to be collocated upon, new
antennas, or other new or different wireless equipment associated with the
small wireless facility.
         (e)   Pole Attachment Agreement. Within thirty (30) days after an
approved permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility
pole, the City and the applicant shall enter into a Master Pole Attachment
Agreement, in the form provided by the City, for the initial collocation on a
municipal utility pole by such approved application. For subsequent approved
permits to collocate on a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole,
the City and the applicant shall enter into a License Supplement of the Master
Pole Attachment Agreement.
      (3)   Completeness of Application. Within thirty (30) days after
receiving an application, the City shall determine whether the application is
complete and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the City
must specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be
deemed complete if the City fails to provide notification to the applicant
within thirty (30) days after all documents, information and fees specifically
enumerated in the City’s permit application form are submitted by the applicant
to the City.
         Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the City sends the
notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing
information.
      (4)   Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         (a)   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the City;
or
         (b)   A local, State or federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      (5)   Consolidated Applications. An applicant seeking to collocate small
wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the City shall be allowed, at
the applicant’s discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to twenty-five (25) small wireless
facilities, if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of
small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure.
         If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the
City may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and
treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The City may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      (6)   Duration of Permits. The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
durations unless the City makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or
the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable City codes
or any provision, condition, or requirement contained in this Article.
         If the Act is repealed as provided in Section 90 therein, renewals of
permits shall be subject to the applicable City code provisions or regulations
in effect at the time of renewal.
      (7)   Means of Submitting Applications. Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information, and notices to the City by personal
delivery at the City’s designated place of business, by regular mail postmarked
no later than the date due, or by any other commonly used means, including
electronic mail, by which the application is received by the City no later than
the date due.
   (C)   Collocation Requirements and Conditions.
      (1)   Public Safety Space Reservation. The City may reserve space on
municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the City’s electric
utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the City reasonably determines
that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both (or all three) uses.
      (2)   Installation and Maintenance. The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
Article. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents, and/or
contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards, laws, and regulations.
      (3)   No Interference with Public Safety Communication Frequencies. The
wireless provider’s operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
         A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the
type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public
safety agency’s communications equipment.
         Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC’s regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency.
         If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the
wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
         The City may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on
such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code
of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph (or the then applicable
regulations). Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall
constitute a public nuisance.
      (4)    The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless
facilities on City utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or
transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or
the electric supply zone of the pole.
         However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the City utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
         For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms “communications space”,
“communication worker safety zone”, and “electric supply zone” have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, as amended from time
to time.
      (5)    The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and
local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
      (6)    The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards
that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, and with reasonable
stealth, concealment, and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in any City
ordinance, written policy adopted by the City, the City’s comprehensive plan,
and any other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the
rights-of-way, including those applicable to historic landmarks and/or historic
districts.
      (7)   Alternate Placements. Except as provided in this Collocation
Requirements and Conditions Section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the City may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred
(100) feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as reasonably determined by the applicant.
         If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the City, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits, or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
      (8)   Height Limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten (10) feet above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
         New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on
which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         (a)   ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the City, that is located within
three hundred (300) feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the City, provided the City may designate which
intersecting right- of-way within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed
utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation
for such facility; or
         (b)   forty-five (45) feet above ground level.
      (9)   Height Exceptions or Variances. If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions
set forth in the Revised Code of Ordinances.
      (10)   Contractual Design Requirements. The wireless provider shall
comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the City and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
      (11)   Ground-mounted Equipment Spacing. The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in all applicable codes and
ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the
right-of-way if the requirements include a waiver, zoning, or other process
that addresses wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not
prohibit granting of such exceptions or variances.
      (12)   Undergrounding Regulations.   The wireless provider shall comply
with any and all local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding
requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of
existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the
requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests
to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do
not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.
      (13)   Collocation Completion Deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the City and the wireless provider agree to extend this
period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or
by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided
the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after
the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the
additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty
(360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void,
unless the City grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   (D)   Application Fees. Application fees are imposed as follows:
      (1)    Applicant shall pay an application fee of Six Hundred Fifty
Dollars ($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless
facility on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and Three
Hundred Fifty Dollars ($350.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in a
consolidated application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on
existing utility poles or wireless support structures.
      (2)    Applicant shall pay an application fee of One Thousand Dollars
($1,000.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that
includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of State law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this Section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
      (4)    The City shall not require an application, approval or permit, or
require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:
         (a)   routine maintenance;
         (b)   the replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless
provider notifies the City at least ten (10) days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of
equipment consistent with (d) under the Section titled Application
Requirements; or
         (c)   the installation, placement, maintenance, operation or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are string
between existing utility poles, so long as such installation, placement,
maintenance, operation, or replacement is in compliance with all applicable
safety codes.
      (5)    Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the City to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   (E)   Exceptions to Applicability. Nothing in this Article authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      (1)    property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled
by the City or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      (2)   property owned, leased, or controlled by a part district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation, or
conservation purposes, without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of- way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
      (3)   property owned by a rail carrier registered under Section 18c-7201
of the Illinois Vehicle Code, any public commuter rail service, or an electric
utility as defined in Section 16-102 of the Public Utilities Act, without the
consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail service, or electric utility.
The provisions of this Article do not apply to an electric or gas public
utility or such utility’s wireless facilities if the facilities are being used,
developed, and maintained consistent with the provisions of subsection (i) of
Section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act.
         For the purposes of this subsection, “public utility” has the meaning
given to that term in Section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in
this Article shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement (a)
to obtain a franchise or a State- issued authorization to offer cable service
or video service or (b) to obtain any required permission to install, place,
maintain, or operate communications facilities, other than small wireless
facilities subject to this Article.
   (F)   Pre-Existing Agreements. Existing agreements between the City and
wireless providers that relate to the collection of small wireless facilities
in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on
City utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, if any, remain in
effect for all small wireless facilities collocated on the City’s utility poles
pursuant to applications submitted to the City before June 1, 2018, subject to
applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this Article.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, a wireless provider that has an existing
agreement with the City on the effective date of the Act may opt, instead, to
accept the rates, fees, and terms that the City makes available under this
Article for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation of
new utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities by
submitting a completed application for such small wireless facilities no sooner
than two (2) years after the effective date of the Act, along with a
notification to the City that the wireless provider opts to accept the rates,
fees, and terms hereunder, rather than under its existing agreement. The
existing agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination
provisions, for the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has
collocated on the City’s utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to
the City before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its
option under this paragraph.
   (G)   Annual Recurring Rate. A wireless provider shall pay to the City an
annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a City utility
pole located in a right- of-way that equals (i) Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00)
per year or (ii) the actual, direct, and reasonable costs related to the
wireless provider’s use of space on the City’s utility pole.
      If the City has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs,
the fee shall be Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) payable on the first day after
the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent
to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter. If the City has
billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs prior to such annual
anniversary, the fee shall be such actual and direct costs; and shall be paid
(i) no later than the annual anniversary date, or (ii) within ten (10) business
days after the City has provided such actual and direct costs to the wireless
provider, whichever is later.
   (H)   Abandonment. A small wireless facility that is not operated for a
continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned. The
owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within ninety
(90) days after receipt of written notice from the City notifying the wireless
provider of the abandonment.
      The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, by the City to the owner at the last known address of the wireless
provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety (90) days
of such notice, the City may remove or cause the removal of such facility
pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery, and charge the wireless provider for
all costs incurred in such removal.
      A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the City if it sells
or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the City.
Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless
provider.
8-4-4 DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
The Circuit Court of Macoupin County, Illinois shall have exclusive
jurisdiction to resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless
Facilities Deployment Act. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for
collocation of small wireless facilities on municipal utility poles within the
right-of-way, the City shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its
poles at annual rates of no more than Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) per year
per municipal utility pole, with rates to be determined upon final resolution
of the dispute.
8-4-5 INDEMNIFICATION.
A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the City harmless against any and
all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting from or
arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the City
improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the wireless
provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and
privileges granted under this Article and/or the Act. A wireless provider has
no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses
as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the City or its employees
or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may
have against the City with respect to consequential, incidental, or special
damages, however caused, based on the theory of liability.
8-4-6 INSURANCE.
The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider’s own cost and
expense, the following insurance:
   (A)   property insurance for its property’s replacement cost against all
risks;
   (B)   workers’ compensation insurance, as required by law; or
   (C)   commercial general liability insurance with respect to its activities
on the City improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum protection limits
consistent with its requirements of other users of City improvements or rights-
of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and property damage.
   The wireless provider shall include the City as an additional insured on the
commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation
of inclusion of the City in a commercial general liability policy prior to the
collocation of any wireless facility.
   A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance
coverage and limit requirement required by the City. A wireless provider that
self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply
with the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this Section. A
wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the City evidence
sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance
coverage limits required by the foregoing.
8-4-7 SEVERABILITY.
If any provision of this Article or application thereof to any person or
circumstances is ruled unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such invalidity
shall not affect other provisions or applications of this Article that can be
given effect without the invalid application or provision, and each invalid
provision or invalid application of this Article is severable.

employee was incumbent prior to commencement of such leave. An employee's same
or similar position will not be protected for reductions in force or where the
position has been eliminated. Employees are subject to termination if they are
absent from work for more than six (6) months. No employee may be absent
without permission of the supervisor to which assigned. In the absence of
extenuating circumstances, an employee who is absent from work for any reason
and fails to notify his or her supervisor within two (2) working days will be

including termination. All department property, personal lockers, and personal
offices are subject to inspection. All department property shall be inspected
by the employee's immediate supervisor prior to issuance of the property.

between the City and the employee. Nothing contained in this Code shall be
construed as creating an employment agreement between the City and its
employees.

rights, authorities, duties, and responsibilities through and with the
cooperation of the administrative staff.
12-1-12 LENGTH OF SERVICE.
Length of service is defined as the length of continuous service of an employee
from the employee's last date of hire with the City within the employee's
department. In the event an employee is transferred from or to another
department of the City, the employee's total continuous employment with the

12-1-14 DISCIPLINE AND THE RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES AND THE CITY OF STAUNTON.
The City is an employment entity in the State of Illinois and as such is an at-
will employer. Unless an employee is covered by a duly executed contract or
collective bargaining agreement stating otherwise, either the employee or the
City may terminate the employee's employment at will, without notice or cause.
   (A)   Corrective Action. When it is evident that an employee is not
performing up to standards or is in violation of City policy, the employee is
subject to discipline up to and including termination. The extent of the
corrective action will be determined by the seriousness of the situation. The
corrective action may include a verbal warning, written warning, suspension,
and/or termination. The City reserves the right to bypass any or all steps in
the progressive discipline policy and reserves the right to proceed to more
severe discipline or termination depending on the circumstances. Discipline
Form is attached for documentation purposes.
   (B)   Inadequate Work Performance; Progressive Corrective Action.
Supervisors may use a progressive approach to performance improvement depending

      (2)   A written warning;
      (3)   A final written warning;
      (4)   A suspension; and/or

      (1)   Oral Warning. Supervisors issuing a verbal warning and request for
performance improvement will document the warning. This record is kept in the
department's files, and a copy is given to the employee. Supervisors should be
specific when giving verbal warnings and should include how the performance or
behavior falls short of expectations, what corrections must  be made, and the
consequences if the employee fails to take the corrective action requested. If
the performance does not improve, then a written warning will typically follow.
Discipline Form attached as Appendix C for documentation purposes.
      (2)   Written Warning. As with the verbal warning, the written warning
will document the specific performance deficiencies, steps necessary to correct
the deficiencies, and the consequences of failing to correct the behaviors. The
formal written warning is given to an employee whose response to a verbal
warning has been insufficient. Supervisors must work with the Personnel
Committee when preparing written warnings. A copy of this and any other written
warnings is kept in the department, provided to the Personnel Committee for
inclusion in the employee's personnel file, and a copy must be given to the
employee. Discipline Form attached as Appendix C for documentation purposes.
      (3)   Final Written Warning. If the unacceptable performance or
misconduct continues or recurs, a final written warning may be given. The
warning may give a specific deadline for meeting the standards of performance
or taking corrective action, and may inform the employee that failure to
improve to the required standard by the deadline will result in termination. A
copy of the final written warning must be kept in the department files, with a
copy to the Mayor, the Personnel Committee Members, and to the employee. If,
after the issuance of the final written warning, the employee's performance
still fails to meet expectations, termination is the next step. However, prior
to termination, the employee must be provided an opportunity to hear the reason
(s) termination is being considered by the City. Between the time the City
decides termination is necessary and the actual pre-termination meeting is
conducted, the employee will be placed on paid administrative leave while the
department documents its rationale. Discipline Form attached as Appendix C for
documentation purposes.
      (4)   Suspension. Suspension of an employee would be at the
recommendation of the employee's immediate supervisor and with the approval of
the Mayor and the Personnel Committee with notice to the City Council. A
Personnel Committee meeting must be held within seventy-two (72) hours to
review the cause for suspension. If the suspension is recommended by the
Personnel Committee and approved by the Mayor, the suspension will result in a
loss of salary for the period of the suspension. Upon return to work the
suspended employee will be placed on probationary status for a period not to
exceed six (6) months. If the employee violates the conditions of the
probation, the employee may be subject to termination. Removal from
probationary status is based upon satisfactory completion of a probationary
period, a recommendation from the employee's immediate supervisor, and the
approval of a majority vote of the City Council. The period of suspension may
be up to, but not exceeding thirty (30) days off without pay in one (1)
calendar year. The suspension may include demotion at the recommendation of the
immediate supervisor and approval by a majority vote of the City Council.
Discipline Form attached as Appendix C for documentation purposes.
      (5)   Pre-Termination Hearing. The pre-termination meeting is conducted
under the direction of the Mayor and the Personnel Committee. At the hearing,
the department delineates its reasons for considering termination of the
employee. The employee, who can be accompanied by a representative of their
choosing if desired, will be given time to present evidence to address the
department's points. Upon completion of the hearing, the Mayor and the
Personnel Committee will make a decision regarding the recommendation to be
made to the City Council regarding the employee's future employment with the
City.
      (6)   Termination. A majority vote by the City Council to accept the
recommendation to terminate is required. If termination is decided upon, the
employee will receive written notification of the action being taken, the
reasons leading to the action, the date the action will occur, and what steps
should be followed if they decide to appeal the termination.
   (E)   Gross Misconduct.
      (1)   Definition.  Gross misconduct refers to acts or omissions on the
part of employees which are symptomatic of intolerable behavior. Gross
misconduct includes but is not limited to the following: theft or dishonesty;
gross insubordination; willful destruction of City property; falsification of
records; acts of moral turpitude; reporting for duty under the influence of
intoxicants; the illegal use, manufacturing, possessing, distributing,
purchasing or dispensing of controlled substances or alcohol; disorderly
conduct; provoking a fight; and other similar acts involving intolerable
behavior by the employee. In the event of gross misconduct, the employee may be
placed on paid administrative leave by the employee's supervisor pending an
investigation. The Mayor and the Personnel Committee must be notified
immediately. Discipline Form attached as Appendix C for documentation purposes.
      (2)   When a theft, shortage, or questionable loss of City funds or
property has occurred and an employee is suspected, the Mayor and the Personnel
Committee must be contacted immediately and the employee will be placed on paid
administrative leave during the investigation. The Mayor and the Personnel
Committee, along with the Staunton Police Department as needed, will
investigate the situation and, if gross misconduct is confirmed, the employee
will be recommended for a Pre-Termination Hearing. The employee should be
notified of the charge and supporting evidence, and be given the opportunity to
respond to the decision. Discipline Form attached as Appendix C for
documentation purposes.
      (3)   Pre-Termination Hearing. The pre-termination meeting is conducted
under the direction of the Mayor and the Personnel Committee. At the meeting,
the department delineates its reasons for considering termination of the
employee. The employee, who may be accompanied by a representative if desired,
will be given time to present evidence to address the department's points. Upon
completion of the meeting, the department, in consultation with the Mayor and
the Personnel Committee, the City Council will come to a decision by a majority
vote regarding the employee's  future employment with the City. If the
investigation identifies a less severe infraction on the employee's part, other
disciplinary action may result.
      (4)   Termination. If termination is decided upon, the employee will
receive written notification of the action being taken, the reasons leading to
the action, the date the action will occur, and what steps the former employee
should follow if they wish to appeal the termination. The termination will
become final when the final decision is submitted to the City Council for
review and a vote, majority vote of the Council is required to accept the
recommendation for termination and execute the recommendation.
   (F)   Political Activities. Employees will not be discriminated against or
retaliated against because of the employee's political activity or political
beliefs. This prohibition does not apply to individuals in policy making or
confidential positions or where an overriding interest or vital importance
exists which requires that an employee's political beliefs and activities
conform to those of the City's Elected Official/Department Head.
   The City also recognizes that false accusations can have serious effects on
innocent men and women. We trust that all employees will continue to act in a
responsible and professional manner to establish a pleasant working environment
free of discrimination. (Ord. No. 1618; 02-27-12)
12-1-15 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
The purpose of a grievance procedure is to establish and maintain harmonious
and cooperative working relationships between the City and its employees, to
assure equitable treatment of employees, and to provide expeditious means of
resolving employee dissatisfaction over circumstances or conditions of
employment.
   Strict adherence to the grievance procedures and time limits is mandatory,
except that the time limits may be extended for good cause.
   A grievance is defined as a dispute, disagreement, complaint, or any matter
concerning any terms or conditions of employment, or concerning the application
of any departmental policy, or concerning any employee relationship, or work
related issue.
   As used in this Section, the term days shall mean working days of the
employee filing the grievance. At any step, if a written response is not
provided to the grieving employee within the ten (10) day time frame, the
grievance will be considered denied at that step, and the employee may proceed
to the next step.
   If any Department Head is disciplined and/or discharged by the Mayor with
the advice and consent of the City Council, the discipline and/or discharge
shall constitute the final resolution of the matter and there shall be no
access in this instance to the various steps of the grievance procedure. If a
Department Head is not reappointed by the Mayor, this shall not be interpreted
to constitute discipline and/or discharge of an ongoing employment relationship
with the City.
   Steps:
      (1)   An employee wishing to file a grievance shall within five (5) days
after he learns of the circumstances or conditions which prompted the
grievance, submit the grievance to the employee's immediate supervisor, in
writing, informing such immediate supervisor of the grievance and the
particulars concerning the same. The immediate supervisor shall provide a
written response to the employee within ten (10) days after receiving the
grievance
      (2)   If the grievance is not resolved to the employee's satisfaction,
the employee may submit the grievance to the Mayor by summarizing the grievance
in writing. The grievance must be submitted to the Mayor within five (5) days
of the decision of the immediate supervisor.
For all other employees, the grievance shall be before the Mayor.
12-1-16 LAYOFFS.
In the event it becomes necessary to lay off employees for any reason, the
following is a non-exhaustive list of criteria that will be considered in
determining which employees will be laid off: Employee's knowledge, skills, and
abilities in relation to positions available, lack of work, lack of funds, the
employee's length of service, the employee's work record including
commendations as well as disciplinary action, the employee's attitude and
relations with other employees and agencies and change in duties of the
department. The employee shall receive two (2) weeks' notice.
12-1-17 RESIGNATION.
Sick leave, vacation and retirement fund benefits cease at midnight on the date
of termination. Life and health insurance will cease at the end of the month of
the termination. Employees may elect to continue participation in the health
insurance plan for a limited period of time on a self pay basis as provided by
federal statutes. The employee will be paid for each day of accrued and unused
vacation time. Monies accumulated in the employee's retirement account may be
refundable, according to IMRF Rules. Forms required to request this refund are
available from the City Clerk's office.
APPENDIX "A"
TAUNTON DRUG FREE WORKPLACE POLICY
PHILOSOPHY
Drug abuse affects all aspects of our lives - it threatens the workplace as
well as the home, the school, and the community. The City takes a firm stance
against illicit drug use. The use of drugs, which term for the purposes of this
policy shall include alcohol in the workplace, is unacceptable since it can
adversely affect health, safety, and productivity, as well as public confidence
and trust. When drug use and/or involvement interferes with an employee's
efficient and safe performance of work responsibilities and/or reduces the
employee's dependability and accountability, it creates a problem for the whole
organization.
Drug abuse inflicts notable human expense. Personal tragedies, feelings of
anxiety and depression, and diminishing coping skills are reflected on an
individual level. Dysfunctional and strained relationships mark the heavy
burden felt by the families of the drug and alcohol abuser.
The cost of drug abuse, both on a personal and organizational level, is
unacceptable. The rising incidence in substance abuse makes it imperative that
the City combat this issue by implementing a zero tolerance policy of drug use
in the workplace.
DRUG FREE WORKPLACE STATEMENT
The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a
controlled substance, including cannabis, is prohibited in the workplace.
Controlled substance means a controlled substance as defined in the Illinois
Controlled Substances Act or cannabis as defined in the Cannabis Control Act.
Disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal can be taken against
employees for drug violations.
All employees will, as a condition of employment:
1.   Agree not to manufacture, distribute, dispense or possess controlled
substances or alcohol in the workplace.
2.   Notify their respective Elected Official/Department Head of any arrest or
conviction of any local, state or federal criminal drug statute no later than
twenty-four (24) hours after such arrest or conviction.
3.   Abide by the conditions set forth in this statement.
VIOLATIONS
1.   Employees are subject to discipline, including discharge for violation of
the above policy.
2.   Employees who are not discharged for violating this policy may be
required, as a condition of continued employment, to satisfactorily participate
in and complete a State licensed drug rehabilitation program, as determined by
the employer.
3.   The City shall notify the appropriate Government Agency from which grant
funds were received of any employee's criminal drug statute conviction within
ten (10) days after receiving notice from an employee of any criminal drug
statute conviction for a violation in the workplace.
EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE
A referral network to assist those who may be experiencing problems with drugs
and/or alcohol has been established for all City employees.
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS
There is no requirement by the employer to keep an employee on active
employment status who is receiving rehabilitative treatment if it is determined
that the employee's current use of drugs prevents the individual from
performing work related duties or whose continuance on active status could
constitute a threat to the property and/or safety of others. The employee shall
pay for all costs of rehabilitation. The employee may use accumulated paid
leave, or take unpaid leave pending treatment, at the discretion of the
employer, and so long as the employee advised the Elected Official/Department
Head of use or abuse of drugs prior to occurrence of reasonable suspicion.
APPENDIX "B"
EMPLOYEE NOTIFICATION OF PERSONNEL CODE
AND DRUG FREE WORKPLACE POLICY AND DISCLAIMER OF EMPLOYMENT
The Employee Code of the City is not intended to create any employment
relationship with any employee that is contractual in nature. All employees are
employed at the will of the City, and employees can be terminated at will. All
employment policies of the City are subject to change without notice and/or
approval of any employee. Any and all discipline and/or discharge procedures
contained in this Code are illustrative in nature, and only provide examples of
the manner in which employees may be disciplined or terminated. Any and all
such procedures are not meant to be the sole or exclusive way in which
discipline or discharge could occur.
By signing this disclaimer, the employee understands that the employment
relationship between the employee and the City is NOT contractual in nature;
that employment can be terminated at the will of the City, that all employment
policies are subject to change without notice and/or approval of the employee;
and that any and all discipline and/or discharge procedures contained in the

APPENDIX "D"
SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY
PREAMBLE
The purpose of this policy is to (1) clearly define sexual harassment, and (2)
clearly state the policy of the City of Staunton regarding such behavior,
Sexual harassment is a violation of rights recognized under state and federal
law.
POLICY
It is the responsibility of each individual employee to refrain from sexual
harassment, and it is the right of each individual employee to work in an
environment free from sexual harassment. The City will not tolerate sexual
harassment in any form. Nor will it tolerate false or malicious accusations of
sexual harassment. The City will remain uncompromised in providing and
preserving a professional atmosphere free from sexual harassment of any kind.
DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT
According to the Illinois Human Rights Act, sexual harassment is defined as:
Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a
sexual nature when:
   (1)   submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment,
   (2)   submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as
the basis for employment decisions affecting such individuals, or
   (3)   such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
The courts have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination
under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991.
One such example is a case where a qualified individual is denied employment
opportunities and benefits that are, instead, awarded to an individual who
submits (voluntarily or under coercion) to sexual advances or sexual favors.
Another example is where an individual must submit to unwelcome sexual conduct
in order to receive an employment opportunity.
Other conduct commonly considered to be sexual harassment includes:
   -   Verbal:   Sexual innuendoes, suggestive comments, insults, humor and
jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside their presence, of a sexual nature.
   -   Non-Verbal:   suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcall", "smacking" or
"kissing" noises.
   -   Visual:      Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature.
   -   Physical:   Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing
the body, coerced sexual intercourse, or actual assault.
Sexual harassment most frequently involves a man harassing a woman. However, it
can also involve a woman harassing a man or harassment between members of the
same gender.
RESPONSIBILITY OF INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES
Each individual employee has the responsibility to refrain from sexual
harassment in the workplace.
The harassing employee will be subject to disciplinary action up to and
including discharge in accordance with the City's policy or a collective
bargaining agreement, as appropriate.
An employee who either observes or believes herself/himself to be the object of
sexual harassment is responsible for reporting the incident(s) to his/her
supervisor or the EEO Officer.
RESPONSIBILITY OF SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL
Each supervisor is responsible for maintaining the workplace free of sexual
harassment. This is accomplished by promoting a professional environment and by
promptly dealing with sexual harassment as you would deal with other forms of
employee misconduct.
The City will investigate incidents of sexual harassment or a complaint,
promptly and with seriousness, and will take prompt corrective action when
necessary. The City will attempt to investigate matters as confidentially as
possible, and to the extent permitted by law. This also applies to cases where
an employee tells the supervisor about behavior considered sexual harassment
but does not want to make a formal complaint.
Supervisors must report any incidents or complaints of sexual harassment to the
City's EEO Officer or to (insert alternate contact person) immediately on the
date of the alleged occurrence or upon receipt of the complaint.
The City prohibits retaliation against an employee making a sexual harassment
complaint or participating in any way in an investigation.
PROCEDURES FOR FILING A COMPLAINT
An employee who either observes or believes herself/himself to be the object of
sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as directly and firmly as
possible by clearly communicating her/his position to both the supervisor and
offending employee. It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at
the person making the complaint.
The following steps may also be taken: document or record each incident (what
was said or done, the date, the time, and the place). Documentation may also
include written records such as letters, notes, memos, and telephone messages.
No one making a complaint will be retaliated against even if the complaint made
in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will be protected
from retaliation. The process for making a complaint for sexual harassment
falls into several stages.
   -   Direct Communication. If there is sexually harassing behavior in the
workplace, the harassed employee is encouraged, if he or she is comfortable
doing so, to directly and clearly express his/her objection that the conduct is
unwelcome and request that the offending behavior stop.
   -   Contact with Supervisory Personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels uncomfortable
addressing the alleged offender, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor or the EEO Officer. If the harasser is the immediate
supervisor, the problem should be reported to the next level of supervisor or
the EEO Officer.
   -   Formal Written Complaint. An employee may also report incidents of
sexual harassment directly to the EEO Officer. The EEO Officer will counsel the
reporting employee and be available to assist with filing a formal complaint.
The EEO Officer will fully investigate the complaint and advise the complainant
and the alleged harasser of the results of the investigation.
   -   Resolution Outside City. An employee has the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) about filing a formal complaint. An IDHR complaint must be
filed within one hundred eighty (180) days of the alleged incident(s) unless it
is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must be filed within three
hundred (300) days.
An employee who has been physically harassed or threatened while on the job may
also have grounds for criminal charges of assault and battery.
TRAINING
The City will ensure that supervisors and staff are trained and made aware of
the full range of practices that might constitute sexual harassment.

CHAPTER 14
FLOOD PLAIN CODE
14-1-1 PURPOSE.
This Code is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to this City by the
Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, 5/11-12-12, 5/11-30-2, 5/11-30-8, and
5/11-31-2) in order to accomplish the following purposes:
   (A)   To prevent unwise developments from increasing flood or drainage
hazards to others;
   (B)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;
   (C)   To promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare
of the citizens from the hazards of flooding;
   (D)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control, repairs to
public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and relief operations;
   (E)   To maintain property values and a stable tax base by minimizing the
potential for creating blight areas;
   (F)   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available; and
   (G)   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses
and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve
water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat,
provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance
community and economic development.
14-1-2 DEFINITIONS.
For the purposes of this Code, the following definitions are adopted:
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) probability of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year flood.
The base flood elevation at any location is as defined in Section
14-1-3 of this Code.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the
crest of the base flood.
BUILDING: A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls
and a roof including manufactured homes, prefabricated buildings, and gas or
liquid storage tanks. The term also includes recreational vehicles and travel
trailers to be installed on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days
per year.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Any public or private facility which, if flooded, would
create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life
and health.
   Examples are public buildings, emergency operations and communication
centers, health care facilities and nursing homes, schools, and toxic waste
treatment, handling or storage facilities.
DEVELOPMENT: Any man-made change to real estate including, but not necessarily
limited to:
   (A)   Demolition, construction, reconstruction, repair, placement of a
building, or any structural alteration to a building;
   (B)   Substantial improvement of an existing building;
   (C)   Installation of a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer on a site for more than one
hundred eighty (180) days per year;
   (D)   Installation of utilities, construction of roads, bridges, culverts or
similar projects;
   (E)   Construction or erection of levees, dams, walls, or fences;
   (F)   Drilling, mining, filling, dredging, grading, excavating, paving, or
other alterations of the ground surface;
   (G)   Storage of materials including the placement of gas and liquid storage
tanks; and
   (H)   Channel modifications or any other activity that might change the
direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters.
“Development” does not include routine maintenance of existing buildings and
facilities; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar practices
that do not involve filling, grading, or construction of levees.
FEMA : Federal Emergency Management Agency.
FLOOD: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of
normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation,
or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
FLOOD FRINGE: That portion of the floodplain outside of the regulatory
floodway.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP: A map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency that depicts the floodplain or special flood hazard area (SFHA) within a
community. This map includes insurance rate zones and may or may not depict
floodways and show base flood elevations.
FLOOD PLAIN AND SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): They are synonymous. Those
lands within the jurisdiction of the City that are subject to inundation by the
base flood. The floodplains of the Ginseng Creek are generally identified as
such on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the City prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency and dated July 17, 1981. The floodplains of those
parts of unincorporated Macoupin County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the City or that may be annexed into the City are generally
identified as such on the Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared for Macoupin County
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated January 6, 1978.
Floodplain also includes those areas of known flooding as identified by the
community.
FLOOD PROOFING: Any combination of structural or nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate, property and their contents.
FLOOD PROOFING CERTIFICATE: A form published by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency that is used to certify that a building has been designed and
constructed to be structurally dry floodproofed to the flood protection
elevation.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION OR FPE: The elevation of the base flood plus one (1)
foot of freeboard at any given location in the floodplain.
FLOODWAY: That portion of the floodplain required to store and convey the base
flood. The floodways for each of the floodplains of the City shall be according
to the best data available from Federal, State, or other sources.
IDNR/OWR: Illinois Department of Natural Resources/Office of Water Resources.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure transportable in one (1) or more sections, that
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to required utilities.
NFIP: National Flood Insurance Program.
REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two separate
occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs at the
time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds twenty-five
percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SFHA: See definition of floodplain.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and
materials must be included in this determination.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is
started.
   “Substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration
of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of
the structure. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for
improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
safe living conditions or (2) any alteration of a structure listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic
Places.

truck; and
   (D)   designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
14-1-3 BASE FLOOD ELEVATION.
This Code’s protection standard is the base flood. The best available base
flood elevation data are listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best
available data, the party shall finance the detailed engineering study needed
to replace the existing data with better data and submit it to the FEMA and
IDNR/OWR for approval prior any development of the site.
   (A)   The base flood elevation for the floodplains of Ginseng Creek shall be
according to the best data available from Federal, State or other sources.
Should no other data exist, an engineering study must be financed to determine
base flood elevations.
   (B)   The base flood elevation for each floodplain delineated as an “AH
Zone” or “AO Zone” shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the Flood
Insurance Rate City of Staunton.
   (C)   The base flood elevation for each of the remaining floodplains
delineated as an “A Zone” on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the City shall be
according to the best data available from federal, state or other sources.
Should no other data exist, an engineering study must be financed to determine
base flood elevations.
   (D)   The base flood elevation for the floodplains of those parts of
unincorporated Macoupin County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the City, or that may be annexed into the City, shall be
according to the best data available from Federal, State or other sources.
14-1-4 DUTIES OF THE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR.
The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for the general administration of
this Code and ensure that all development activities within the floodplains
under the jurisdiction of the City meet the requirements of this Code.
Specifically, the Zoning Administrator shall:
   (A)   Process development permits in accordance with Section
14-1-5;
   (B)   Ensure that all development in a floodway (or a floodplain with no
delineated floodway) meets the damage prevention requirements of Section
14-1-6.
   (C)   Ensure that the building protection requirements for all buildings
subject to Section
14-1-7 are met and maintain a record of the “as-built” elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) or floodproof certificate;
   (D)   Assure that all subdivisions and annexations meet the requirements of
Section
14-1-8;
   (E)   Ensure that water supply and waste disposal systems meet the Public
Health standards of Section
14-1-9;
   (F)   If a variance is requested, ensure that the requirements of Section
14-1-10 are met and maintain documentation of any variances granted;
   (G)   Inspect all development projects and take any and all actions outlined
in Section
14-1-12 as necessary to ensure compliance with this Code;
   (H)   Assure that applicants are aware of and obtain any and all other
required local, state and federal permits;
   (I)   Notify IDNR/OWR and any neighboring communities prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse;
   (J)   Provide information and assistance to citizens upon request about
permit procedures and floodplain construction techniques;
   (K)   Cooperate with State and Federal floodplain management agencies to
coordinate base flood data and to improve the administration of this Code; and
   (L)   Maintain for public inspection base flood data, floodplain maps,
copies of state and federal permits, and documentation of compliance for
development activities subject to this Code.
   (M)   Perform site inspections and make substantial damage determinations
for structures within the floodplain.
   (N)   Maintain the accuracy of floodplain maps including notifying IDNR/OWR
and/or submitting information to FEMA within six (6) months whenever a
modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in
a change to the floodplain map.
14-1-5 DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator
shall not issue a development permit if the proposed development does not meet
the requirements of this Code.
   (A)   Application Documents. The application for development permit shall be
accompanied by:
      (1)   drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      (2)   existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      (3)   the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings, and
      (4)   the elevation of the lowest floor (including basements) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of Section
14-1-7 of this Code.
      (5)   cost of project or improvements as estimated by a licensed engineer
or architect. A signed estimate by a contractor may also meet this requirement.
   (B)   Elevation Comparisons. Upon receipt of an application for a
development permit, the Zoning Administrator shall compare the elevation of the
site to the base flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be
shown by survey data to be higher than the current base flood elevation and
which has not been filled after the date of the site’s first Flood Insurance
Rate Map is not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to the requirements
of this Code. Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the
base flood elevation and hydraulically connected, but not shown on the current
Flood Insurance Rate Map is subject to the provisions of this Code. The Zoning
Administrator shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at
the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior
to the date of the site’s first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.
14-1-6 PREVENTING INCREASED FLOOD HEIGHTS AND RESULTING DAMAGES.
Within all floodplains where a floodway has not been delineated, the following
standards shall apply:
   (A)   Except as provided in Section
14-1-6(B), no development shall be allowed which, acting in combination with
existing and anticipated development, will cause any increase in flood heights
or velocities or threat to public health and safety. The following specific
development activities shall be considered as meeting this requirement:
      (1)   Barge fleeting facilities meeting the conditions of IDNR/OWR
Statewide Permit No. 3;
      (2)   Aerial utility crossings meeting the conditions of IDNR/OWR
Statewide Permit No. 4;

elevation.
14-1-7 PROTECTING BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Requirements. In addition to the damage prevention requirements of
Section
14-1-6, all buildings located in the floodplain shall be protected from flood
damage below the flood protection elevation. This building protection
requirement applies to the following situations:
      (1)   Construction or placement of a new building valued at more than One
Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) or seventy (70) square feet;

   (B)   Notification of Applicant. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall notify an
applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of the building
protection standards of Section
14-1-7 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to Twenty-
Five Dollars ($25.00) for One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Variances to the building protection requirements of Section
14-1-7 of this Code requested in connection with the reconstruction, repair or
alteration of a site or building included on the National Register of Historic
Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places may be granted using
criteria more permissive than the requirements of Section
14-1-9 (A)(1-5).
14-1-11 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
The degree of protection required by this Code is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Code does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This Code does not create liability on the part of the
City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from
reliance on this Code or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
14-1-12 PENALTY.
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this Code. Upon due investigation, the Zoning Administrator may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this Code exist. The
Zoning Administrator shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails, after ten (10) days' notice, to correct the
violation:
      (1)   The City shall make application to the Circuit Court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this Code or make such other order as the
court deems necessary to secure compliance with this Code.
      (2)    Any person who violates this Code shall, upon conviction thereof,
be fined not less than Fifty Dollars ($50.00) nor more than Five Hundred
Dollars ($500.00) for each offense; and
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues.
      (4)   The Zoning Administrator shall record a notice of violation on the
title to the property.
   (B)   The Zoning Administrator shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
14-1-13 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
This Code repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the City Council to
fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program including:
City Code adopted April 28, 1997. However, this Code does not repeal the
original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the Program.
Nor does this Code repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants or deed restrictions. Where this Code and other ordinance easements,
covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.

(Ord. No. 1248; 06-14-04)
ARTICLE II - POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
22-2-1 PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of this City to prohibit harassment of any person
by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal
agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal officials,
municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or offices are
prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment
relationship or lack thereof.
22-2-2 DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
   (A)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
      (1)    Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly
a term or condition of an individual’s employment,
      (2)    Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      (3)    Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
   (B)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
      (1)   Verbal. Sexual innuendoes, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and
jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside their presence, of a sexual nature.
      (2)   Non-verbal. Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, “catcalls”, “smacking”
or “kissing” noises.
      (3)   Visual. Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
      (4)   Physical. Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
      (5)   Textual/Electronic. “Sexting” (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/ video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
   (C)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a “reasonable person.”
22-2-3 PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/
himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s)
as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating his/her position to
the offending employee, and his/her immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
      (1)   Electronic/Direct Communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express his/her objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      (2)   Contact with Supervisory Personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
director of human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or
administrator, or the chief executive officer of the Municipality.
   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment
must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no
witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible
officer, the Municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the
harassment.
      (3)   Resolution Outside Municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
Municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within three hundred (300) days
of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with
the EEOC must be filed within three hundred (300) days.
   (C)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited
to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
   (D)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
Municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
22-2-4 PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS.
   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:
      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy,
      (2)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy, or
      (3)    Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (B)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
      (1)    Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or
other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
      (2)    Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State
employee; or
      (3)    Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer
may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
   (F)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to
retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or
participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois
Human Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge – due within three hundred (300) days (IDHR) or three
hundred (300) days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation.
22-2-5 CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the
Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject
to a fine of up to Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) per offense, applicable
discipline or discharge by the Municipality and any applicable fines and
penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State law or Federal law.
Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
Municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
State or Federal agency.
22-2-6 CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.
A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the
sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual
harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is
not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness
of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe
offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a State’s
Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty
of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an administrative fine
of up to Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

ARTICLE III — E-MAIL RETENTION POLICY
22-3-1 GENERALLY.
   (A)   To establish guidelines and policies for appropriate operation and use
of the City's electronic mail (e-mail) systems and retention of e-mail
communication records in accordance with the Illinois Freedom of Information
Act ("FOIA") (5 ILCS 140/1, et al.) and the Illinois State Record Act (5 ILCS
160/1, et al.).
   (B)   Persons, Groups, Systems Affected.
         (1)   All City employees, elected officials, appointed officers,
officers, agents, contractors, and individuals communicating with City of
Staunton via e-mail correspondence. City e-mail accounts may be assigned to an
individual (e.g. employeefirstinitiallastname@stauntonil.com) or department

         (2)   It is each individual's responsibility to ensure all e-mails
pertaining to official City business sent or received on personal e-mail
accounts is retained and maintained in a manner that complies with all
applicable statutes and regulations as if all such e-mails were sent or
received on City devices and systems and/or on official City e-mail accounts.
All such e- mails are considered "public records" for the purposes of retention
under FOIA and the State Record Act.
   (D)   The City recommends that all official City e-mail accounts be used

         (3)   Send any messages or content that is or can be construed as
insulting, discriminatory, offensive or otherwise inappropriate.
         (4)   Intentionally spam other people with e-mails, including co-
workers.
         (5)   Use your position or employment with the City for your own
private gain or for that of persons or organizations with which you are
associated.
         (6)   Use your position, title, or employment with the City, including
use of your City e-mail account to endorse any product, service or enterprise.

   (E)   The City reserves the right to monitor and archive all e-mails sent to
or received by any City account. The City archival process should be backed up
on the City Server every 3 days. All users are encouraged to use their City e-
mail accounts for City-related purposes, including, but not limited to:
         (1)   Communicating with City employees, officials, officers, agents,

         (4)   Giving their e-mail address to people they meet at conferences
or other City events for City business purposes.
         (5)   Signing up for newsletters, platforms and other online services
to support and foster professional growth.
         (6)   It is important to remember all e-mails sent or received through
the City's email system, including by your City e-mail account, are not
considered private or confidential and may be subject to FOIA requests.
22-3-2 RETENTION POLICY AND GUIDELINES. 
   (A)   Definition of a Public Record.
         (1)   Any writing, paper, report, study, map, photograph, book, card,
tape recording, or other material that is created, received, retained,
maintained or filed by or with a public body and which is generated on paper,
paper substitutes, photographic media, chemically based media, magnetic or
machine readable media, electronically stored data, or any other material,
regardless of form or characteristics.
         (2)   Anything, on any medium, that is created for any governmental
purpose is subject to the terms of the public records law. Consequently, all e-
mail messages sent or received for a govermnent purpose are public records and
are subject to record retention requirements.
   (B)   How to Identify a Record.
         (1)   If you answer "yes" to any of these questions, you may have a
record:
            (a)   Was it created in the course of business? e.g.
correspondence, agreements, studies
            (b)   Was it received for action? e.g. FOIA requests, controlled
correspondence
            (c)   Does it document organizational activities and actions? e.g.
calendars, meeting minutes, project reports
            (d)   Is it mandated by statute or regulation? e.g. administrative
records, legal/financial records, dockets
            (e)   Does it support financial obligations or legal claims? e.g.
contracts, grants, litigation case files
            (f)   Does it communicate organizational requirements? e.g.
guidance documents, policies, procedures
         (2)   If you ansvver "yes" to any of these questions, you may have a
non-record:
            (a)   Is it reference material? e.g. vendor catalogs, phone books,
technical journals
            (b)   Is it a convenience copy? e.g. duplicate copies of
correspondence, memos or directives
            (c)   Is it a stock copy? e.g. organizational publications or forms
            (d)   Is it a draft or working paper? e.g. draft with no
substantive comments, rough notes, calculations
            Note: some drafts are needed to support a decision trail or are
required by a records schedule.
         (3)   If you answer "yes" to this question, you may have a personal
paper:
            Is it only related to your own affairs? e.g. soccer schedule, PTA
roster
         Note: personal planners and calendars may actually be records if they
document your organizational activities.
   (C)   Records Created with E-mail. Electronic mail systems can transmit a
wide variety of information; therefore, the length of time that an e-mail has
to be retained varies according to the content of the e-mail. In short, the
content and not the medium determines how long an email has to be retained. E-
mail messages fall within three broad categories:
         (1)   Transitory and duplicate messages or casual and routine
communications. No retention requirement. Public officials and employees
sending or receiving such communications may delete them immediately. Most e-
mails are transitory. See section below for specific guidance on transitory and
duplicate messages.
         (2)   Public records with a less than permanent retention period.
Follow retention period for equivalent hard copy records as specified in an
approved retention schedule. See Appendix A for common records that have a less
than permanent retention period.
      (3)   Public records with a permanent or permanent/archival retention
period. See Appendix A for common records that have a permanent retention
period.
   (D)   Defining Transitory and Duplicate Records.
         (1)   Transitory messages do not a) set policy, b) establish
guidelines or procedures, c) certify a transaction, or d) become a receipt.
Transitory documents serve to convey information of temporary importance. The
following types of e-mail can be deleted because they are considered
transitory:
            (a)   Incoming Listserv messages; The term Listserv is used to
refer to electronic mailing list software applications in general which allows
a sender to send one e-mail to the list, and then transparently sends it on to
the addresses of the subscribers to the list.
            (b)   Personal e-mails unrelated to City business;
            (c)   Spam or unsolicited advertisements or sales promotions;
            (d)   Non-policy announcements;
            (e)   Telephone messages;
            (f)   Published reference materials;
            (g)   Invitations and responses to meetings, etc.;
            (h)   Thank you's;
            (i)   Replies to routine questions, "we're open 8 - 5", "our
address is. " the deadline is.. , "
            (j)   Public meeting announcements including attachments to e-mail
that are identical to records that are stored and managed outside the e-mail
system pursuant to approved record retention schedules.
            (k)   Out of office auto-replies; and
         (2)   Internal duplicate records. E-mail as a medium promotes
expedited communication to multiple users with great ease. Consequently, e-mail
systems frequently contain duplicates of a record, such as copies or extracts
of documents distributed for convenience or reference. "All City Memorandums"
are often forwarded via e-mail within the City system in order to speed up
distribution of certain critical and/or time-sensitive information. Information
transmitted in this manner is simply a duplicate or non-record. If retention is
required of the original, the sender has the obligation.
         (3)   Accordingly, for an e-mail to qualify as a retainable "record"
under this definition it must be documentation of the informational,
communicative, or decision making process of City government that is:
            (a)   Made or received in connection with the transaction of the
public business or government functions; and
            (b)   Which is created, received, retained, maintained or filed by
the City or Department as evidence of its activities or because of the
informational value of the data in the document.
            Please see the Retention and Disposition Schedule for
Administrative Records for record retention requirements.
   (E)   Procedures.
         (1)   Procedures for managing e-mail that must be retained. Each City
department must determine which record retention schedules apply to their
commonly created and received records, including e-mail. Occasionally, areas
may also need to review their retention schedules and request amendments and
updates as necessary. Each employee is exclusively responsible for managing all
the e-mail they send and receive; managing those e-mails means that each
employee must sort, file, retrieve, and archive or delete the e-mail in
accordance with these procedures.
            (a)   Sorting involves promptly deleting e-mail when allowed
according to the applicable record retention schedule. Sorting also involves
routinely filing e-mail that must be retained for the applicable retention
period (see Appendix A for guidance on which record retention schedule may
apply to a particular e-mail). To avoid wasting computer storage space, e-mail
should be deleted promptly if it is not a record if it has no further value.
Filing e-mail for short-term storage involves moving the e-mail into folders
created within the e-mail software. For e-mails that must be retained for
longer timeframes, it may also mean printing and filing hard copies of e-mail
in a paper file or converting the e-mail into another software format for long-
term electronic filing. When filing e-mail that qualifies for confidential
treatment, it is a good idea to create a confidential folder and place it
within the project folder so you have a place for the confidential e-mail that
relate to that project. E-mail that qualifies as a retainable record must be
retained in accordance the applicable record retention schedule that has been
approved by the City Council for the City of Staunton. The content of the e-
mail will determine which record retention schedule applies.
            (b)   Retrieving e-mail means that, upon request, employees must
promptly retrieve e-mail for which they are exclusively responsible
(particularly, e-mails sent or received from accounts other than City e-mail
accounts). E-mail that is retrieved must include the transmission properties of
the email. Upon receipt of a public records request or discovery request, the
City employee responsible for the requested e-mail must find and retrieve it in
a timely manner just as he or she must be able to quickly retrieve and produce
paper documents in his or her possession or control. Each department of the
City will develop its own specific system for uniform file-folder creation and
filing. This system should be based on, or consistent with, the area's paper
filing system. Each area should also develop a system for how and when to
convert e-mail to paper for longterm storage. This long-term storage may be
required based on applicable record retention schedules. These area-specific
procedures will allow staff to more easily locate and retrieve e-mail. Even if
a record retention schedule provides for the destruction or alteration of a
record (including an e-mail), if that record is relevant to "pending or
reasonably anticipated litigation" it must be preserved as potential evidence
in that litigation. Such records will be subject to a "litigation hold" by the
City Attorney. If you believe a record is relevant to pending or anticipated
litigation, check with City Attorney before destroying the record.
            (c)   Archiving or deleting filed e-mail must be done according to
a record retention schedule approved by the City Council. Archiving involves
the long-term storage of a record, including e-mail, according to the
applicable retention schedule. The City requires all long-term archiving of
records to be done in paper and in PDF format (encrypted and password
protected) and stored appropriately on City computers. As always, the
transmission properties of the e-mail are considered part of the e-mail and
must be archived with the e-mail. City emails are scheduled for archival
through Illini Tech the City's service provider. All emails that may be sent
via a personal e-mail due to City's e-mail being unavailable should be sent to
the Collector City email address for proper back up storage. This should occur
at a minimum of a monthly basis. All employees, officers, elected and appointed
officers should work with Illini Tech to set their “retention policy on their
e-mail.”
         (2)   The content of the e-mail determines the applicable retention
schedule. Record retention schedules are maintained by each department for
department specific records and approved through the City Council as well as
the City Attorney in compliance with all applicable Open Meetings Act (5 ILCS
120/1, et al.) (“OMA”) regulations and the State Record Act. (See Appendix A
for guidance on how to ascertain which record retention schedule applies to an
e-mail.).
         (3)   To avoid wasting computer storage space, e-mail should be
deleted or archived promptly when authorized by the applicable retention
schedule. However, records relevant to pending or reasonably anticipated
litigation must be preserved even if a record retention schedule allows for its
destruction. Such records will be subject to a litigation hold by the City
Attorney.
   (F)   Procedures for Managing E-mail When Employees Cease Employment or
Elected Public Service.
         (1)   Each employee is responsible for organizing, filing and
archiving e-mail before leaving his or her position. The E-mail Administrator
will perform the archival process for the email account when the employee
leaves the City.
         (2)   Department Heads are responsible for ensuring that their staff
completes the final organization of e-mail before leaving. Supervisors are also
responsible for managing, filing, retrieving and archiving the e-mail of their
former staff.
   (G)   Exceptions to Public Records Requirement and Confidential E-mails
         (1)   Every e-mail written or received during the course of your work
as a public employee is considered a "public record" under FOIA. This means the
public has a right to inspect and copy every e-mail that a public employee
writes or receives as part of his or her job unless the e-mail fits a specific
exception to public disclosure. The City FOIA Officer responds to all public
records requests with a review by the City Attorney as necessmy or prudent.
Reminder employees have 3 days from the FOIA request to produce their emails or
reply to the FOIA officer that they do not have anything to report.
         (2)   Exceptions to public disclosure requirements.
            (a)   FOIA specifically lists the types of records that may be kept
confidential by a public agency. (5 ILCS 140/7)
            (b)   Every effort should be made to protect confidential
information from disclosure and from losing its confidential status. Questions
about an email and its "confidential status" should be directed to the City
Attorney. E-mail that is intentionally or accidentally fowarded to someone
outside the City can lose its privilege. To ensure confidential information is
properly protected, should do the following before including confidential
information in an e-mail:
               1.   Clearly label the e-mail as confidential, and warn the
recipient not to forward the e-mail to anyone who is not authorized to receive
it. Labeling the subject line of the e-mail as confidential in bold face type
will make the confidentiality claim apparent when the e-mail is still in the
recipient's inbox. This, in turn, will make it less likely that the recipient
will accidentally forward the confidential to someone who is not authorized to
see it.
               2.   Create a signature block that claims the e-mail as
confidential.
               3.   Name the exception(s) to disclosure you are relying upon
for the claim of confidentiality, including the statutory citation.
            (c)   Be aware that a public employee who intentionally or
knowingly discloses information that is classified as confidential commits a
Class A misdemeanor. In addition, an employee who recklessly discloses or fails
to protect confidential information may be disciplined under personnel
policies.
            (d)   Be aware that e-mail may be inadvertently transmitted to
parties outside the City which can waive any claim of privilege.
            (e)   Be aware when sending extremely sensitive information that it
is possible for e-mail transmitted over the Internet to be intercepted and
copied.
            (f)   Confirm whether a more secure form of communication is
available or appropriate.

ARTICLE VIII - CAMPING ON PUBLIC PROPERTY
27-8-1   PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this chapter is to prevent harm to the health and safety of the
public and to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by
prohibiting unauthorized camping and storage of personal property on public
property within the City, which interferes with the right of others to use the
areas for the purposes for which they were intended.

meanings herein prescribed:
   “Bridge” means a structure, including the approaches thereto, erected in

other right-of-way, or to afford passage under or over existing public roads,
railroads, or other rights-of-way.
   “Camp” or “Camping” means to pitch, use, or occupy camp facilities, or to
use camp paraphernalia, or both, for the purpose of habitation. Camp or camping
does not include the use of public property or public facilities for

use or authorized public or private event.
   “Camp Facilities” include, but are not limited to, tents, huts, temporary
shelters, campers, recreational vehicles, or trailers. Camp facilities do not
include tents, huts, or temporary shelters, when used temporarily in a park for
recreation or play during daylight hours when the park is open to the public.

beds, sleeping bags, hammocks, blankets, mattresses, or cooking facilities and

governmental entity for park purposes. Park also includes all associated areas,

27-8-3   UNLAWFUL CAMPING OR STORAGE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY IN PUBLIC PLACES. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to camp, or to engage in the activity of
unauthorized camping, or to store personal property, including camp facilities
or camp paraphernalia as defined in this Article, within the following areas:
   (A)   Any street; or
   (B)   Any bridge; or
   (C)   Any park; or
   (D)   Any public property, improved or unimproved; or

27-8-4   ENFORCEMENT; WARNINGS; REMOVAL AND CONFISCATION OF DEBRIS AND PERSONAL
PROPERTY. 
The Chief of Police, or their designee(s), will have primary responsibility for
the enforcement of the camping regulations herein. Nothing in this Chapter
shall prevent the Police Chief, or their designee(s), from obtaining voluntary
compliance by way of warning, notice, education, or coordination with other
willing public or private entities and/or community members.
   (A)   Prior to issuing any citation pursuant to this Chapter, the
investigating officer shall provide a verbal and written warning to cease such
unlawful conduct and a verbal and written referral for possible alternatives to
their present camping practices, such as, (without limitation), transportation,
shelter, and/or contact information to public or private agencies who may be
able to provide services or support. Any public or private entities who wish to
assist the Staunton Police Department ("Department") in effectively and
humanely transitioning individuals from unauthorized encampments on public
property to an environment consistent with City ordinances should contact the
Department with a description of what services they can provide and effective
contact information. The Department will develop and maintain a policy to
include procedural guidance regarding the implementation of this Article. The
Department shall consult relevant professional resources and engage interested
community members, service providers, or other willing public or private
entities when designing and implementing this policy. The policy shall be
published and implemented no later than six (6) months after the passage of
this Article. The policy shall provide for the collection of relevant data that
shall be used to review and revise the manual every three (3) years, or as
needed. Said revision shall be made in the same manner the policy is developed.
   (B)   Police shall exercise discretion to ensure that individuals are not
cited for violating this Article due only to a true personal necessity that
requires their present unauthorized camping practices. When possible, the
Department may work directly with community members, service providers or other
willing public or private entities to determine whether a true personal
necessity exists in a particular circumstance. The Department shall provide
specific support, guidance and contacts for officers. But it shall be construed
as direct evidence that no true personal necessity exists if the individual who
is camping refuses to take advantage of proffered alternatives to their present
camping practices (which could include, in the most extreme cases, short term
use of another location more easily monitored by the Department).
   (C)   Upon a determination by law enforcement that an area constitutes an
unauthorized encampment, regardless of whether an individual is cited for a
violation of this Article, City officials shall have the right to remove any
debris, contraband, or personal property that creates a legitimate health and
safety concern, or that creates an immediate and substantial danger to the
environment. No warning is required prior to such confiscation relating to
health and safety concerns.
   (D)   Materials confiscated pursuant to this Article that are unsanitary or
a danger to the health and safety of any person may be immediately disposed of.
Otherwise, the Department shall provide twenty-four (24)-hour written notice
prior to confiscating property. The Department shall retain personal property
confiscated pursuant to this Article in a manner consistent with the handling
of other confiscated property and must not dispose of such personal property
for a period of at least thirty (30) calendar days, during which time the owner
may retrieve such property from the Department, pursuant to the procedure
outlined in the policy. Nothing prevents Department members from disposing of
property with the consent of the property owner. When Department members have
received consent to dispose of property, City officials shall assist Department
members when necessary. (Ord. No. 2248A; 08-26-24)
27-8-5   PENALTIES.

may be punished by a fine of not more than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00). All
fines under this Article may be satisfied by cash payment or community service.
   (B)   Any person who commits a subsequent violation of this chapter,
occurring within one (1) year of a violation, may be punished by a fine of not
more than Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($750.00). All fines under this Article
may be satisfied by cash payment or community service.
   (C)   Each occurrence of a violation of this chapter or, in the case of a
continuous violation, each day a violation occurs or continues, constitutes a
separate offense and shall be punishable separately.

testing process (e.g. whether there is reasonable suspicion for ordering an
employee to take a test) may be grieved in accordance with the grievance and
arbitration procedure set forth in this Agreement. The Union, and/or the
employee, with or without the Union, shall have the right to file a grievance
concerning testing permitted by this Article, contesting the basis for the
order to submit to the tests, the right to test, the administration of the
tests, or the significance and accuracy of the test. It is agreed that the
parties in no way intend or have in any manner restricted, diminished or
otherwise impaired any legal rights that employees may have with regard to such
testing.
Section 7. Employee Duty to Disclose. Prior to submitting to the drug and
alcohol testing process, the employee must disclose, in writing, to the testing
facility, any prescription and/or over-the-counter medication, controlled
substances, and/or any over-the-counter supplement that the employee has
ingested within the past thirty (30) days, or that the employee believes may
affect the results of the drug and alcohol test. Failure to fully disclose
these medications or supplements shall constitute a basis for discipline under
this Agreement. The employee who is receiving the test shall make himself/
herself available at all reasonable times to the testing facility and/or its
Medical Review Officer for any post- testing questions and follow up.
Section 8. Voluntary Requests for Assistance and Discipline. All employees who
voluntarily seek assistance with drug and/or alcohol problems shall not be
subject to any disciplinary or other adverse employment action by the City,

incident as set forth in Section 3(3) of this Article; or, prior to the
employee’s name being randomly selected for testing in accordance with the
lottery provisions of Section 3(C) of this Article. The foregoing is
conditioned upon:
   (A)   An employee agreeing to appropriate treatment as determined by the
physician(s) involved; and

abuse of alcohol or prescription drugs; and

an aftercare group, for a period of up to twelve (12) months; and
   (D)   The employee agrees to submit to random testing during the hours of
work at all times requested by the employer, during the period of aftercare.
Employees who do not agree to or who do not act in accordance with the
foregoing or who test positive a second or subsequent time for the presence of
non-reported prescription drugs or alcohol during the hours of work shall be
subject to discipline, up to and including discharge.
The foregoing shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the City
to retain an employee on active status throughout the period of rehabilitation
if it is appropriately determined that the Employee’s current use of alcohol or
drugs prevents such individual from performing the duties of a police officer
or dispatcher, or whose continuance on active duty status would constitute a
direct threat to the safety or property of others.
Such employees shall be afforded the opportunity to use accumulated paid leave
or take an unpaid leave of absence pending treatment. The foregoing shall not
limit the City’s right to discipline employees for misconduct.
Employees who are taking prescribed or over-the-counter medication that has
adverse side effects which interfere with the employee’s ability to perform his
or her normal duties may be temporarily reassigned with pay for other, more
suitable duties.

initial test of the presence of drugs or their metabolites in the sample tested

33-4-14 RELOCATION AND PROTECTION OF UTILITIES.
The permittee shall not interfere with any existing facility without the
written consent of the Street Superintendent and the owner of the facility. If
it becomes necessary to relocate an existing facility, this shall be done by
its owner. The facility owned by the City shall be moved to accommodate the
permittee unless the cost of such work is borne by the permittee. The cost of
moving privately-owned facilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee
unless other arrangements are made with the person owning the facility. The
permittee shall support and protect, by timbers or otherwise, all pipes,
conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by
the excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain and
protect them under, over, along or across said work. The permittee shall secure
approval of method of support and protection from the owner of the facility.
In case of any said pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should be
damaged, and for this purpose, pipe coating or other encasement or devices are
to be considered as part of a substructure, the permittee shall promptly notify
the owner thereof. All damaged facilities shall be repaired by the agency or
person owning them and the expense of such repairs shall be charged to the
permittee. It is the intent of this Section that the permittee shall assume all
liability for damage to facilities and any resulting damage or injury to anyone
because of such facility damage and such assumption of liability is a
contractual obligation of the permittee. The only exception will be such

giving in detail the location of the substructure so abandoned. If such
abandoned substructure is in the way or subsequently becomes in the way of an
installation of the City or any other public body, which installation is
pursuant to a governmental function, the owner shall remove such abandoned
substructure or pay the cost of its removal during the course of excavation for
construction of the facility by the City or any other public body.
33-4-16 PROTECTION OF ADJOINING PROPERTY.
The permittee shall, at all times, and at his or its own expense, preserve and
protect from injury, any adjoining property by providing proper foundations and
taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where, in the protection of
such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of
taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall obtain consent from
the owner of such private property for such purpose and if he cannot obtain
such consent, the Street Superintendent may authorize him to enter the private
premises solely for the purpose of making the property safe.
At the permittee’s own expense, all buildings, walls, fences, or other property
likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work shall be shored
up and protected, and the permittee shall be responsible for all damage to
public or private property or highways resulting from failure to properly
protect and carry out the work. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee
to trench through any lawn area, said area shall be reseeded or the sod shall
be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been backfilled as
required in this Article. All construction and maintenance work shall be done
in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in

those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and so that
as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and
adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as
might be the case in a narrow alley, the Street Superintendent shall have the
authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a
storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling.
It shall be the permittee’s responsibility to secure the necessary permission
and make all necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal
sites.
All material excavated shall be laid compactly along the side of the trench and
kept trimmed so as to cause as little inconvenience as reasonably possible to
vehicular and pedestrian traffic, or as specified by the Street Superintendent,

repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements. The City, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the City
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the City enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the City may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this
Article.
   (E)   Effect of Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements.
      (1)   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,

agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications Providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this Article and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the City and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts With Other Articles or Chapters. This Article supersedes all
Articles or Chapters or parts of Articles or Chapters adopted prior hereto that
are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts With State and Federal Laws. In the event that applicable

the holder has complied with applicable City codes, ordinances, and
regulations.
33-9-6 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A
permit from the City authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this Article on City rights-of-way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this Article shall be valid for a
period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-Construction Meeting Required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this Article prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the City with
such City representatives in attendance as the City deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance With All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by the
City does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the City and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
33-9-7 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the City within ninety (90) days
after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this Article, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with Section
33-9-21 of this Article. If the City denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor.

combined single limit of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal
injury and property damage for each accident;
      (3)   Worker’s compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors
and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this Section.
   (B)   Excess or Umbrella Policies. The coverages required by this Section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies Required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this Section to the City within ten (10) days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the City.
   (D)   Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages. The insurance policies
required by this Section shall contain the following endorsement:
      “It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled
nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt
by the City, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of
a written notice addressed to the Mayor of such intent to cancel or not to
renew.”
   Within ten (10) days after receipt by the City of said notice, and in no
event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the City evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this Section.
   (E)   Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by paragraph (A) of this
Section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under paragraph (A), or the requirements of paragraphs (B), (C) and
(D) of this Section. A utility that elects to self- insure shall provide to the
City evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under paragraph (A) of
this Section, such as evidence that the utility is a “private self insurer”
under the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility’s Liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the City and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this Section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance Companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this Section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
33-9-9 INDEMNIFICATION.
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall be
deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the City and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this Article or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
Article by the City, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
33-9-10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this Section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this Section at the permittee’s sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve a security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this Article;
      (2)    Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned
by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the City issued pursuant to this
Article; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the City may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this Article including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this Article to perform that the City must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the City from the permittee pursuant to
this Article or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the City in the
form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the City, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
City. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this paragraph
shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
City and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the City of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the City and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Public Works Director, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the City estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the City, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Public Works
Director may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post
a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this paragraph (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The City, upon fourteen (14) days’ advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this paragraph, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the City for such amount within the
fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)    Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the City for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the City has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this Article that the City
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the City that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund,
the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in
paragraph (C) of this Section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the City,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the City, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in paragraph (C) of this Section.
   (G)   Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the City for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
Article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the City to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the City as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the City with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether
reserved by this Article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the City may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

   The City may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time
periods provided in this paragraph.
   (D)   Stop Work Order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the City may issue a stop work order immediately upon discovery
of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within paragraph (A) of this
Section.
   (E)   Failure or Refusal of the Permittee to Comply. If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of paragraph (C) of this Section, the City or its
designee may, at the option of the City:
      (1)   correct the deficiencies;
      (2)   upon not less than twenty (20) days notice to the permittee, remove
the subject facilities or equipment; or
      (3)   after not less than thirty (30) days notice to the permittee of
failure to cure the noncompliance, deem them abandoned and property of the
City. The permittee shall be liable in all events to the City for all costs of
removal.

practicable under the circumstances.
   (E)   Compliance. The utility shall take immediate action to correct any
deficiencies in traffic protection requirements that are brought to the
utility’s attention by the City.
33-9-15 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General Requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this paragraph.
      (1)   No Interference with City Facilities. No utility facilities shall
be placed in any location if the Public Works Director determines that the
proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the
City’s utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the City’s utility facilities.
      (2)   Minimum Interference and Impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      (3)   No Interference with Travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.

without disrupting the pavement); and
         (c)   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not
more than five (5) feet (1.5m) from the right-of-way line and any above-
grounded appurtenance shall be located within one (1) foot (0.3m) of the right-
of- way line or as near as practicable.
   (C)   Facilities Crossing Highways.
      (1)   No Future Disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of City highways may
require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement or
additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle Passes, Culverts, or Drainage Facilities. Crossing
facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage
facilities.
      (3)   90 Degree Crossing Required. Crossing facilities shall cross at or
as near to a ninety (90) degree angle to the centerline as practicable.
      (4)   Overhead Power or Communication Facility. An overhead power or

employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility Attachments to Bridges or Roadway Structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;

locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
33-9-16 CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS.
   (A)   Standards and Requirements for Particular Types of Construction
Methods.
      (1)   Boring or Jacking.
         (a)   Pits and Shoring. Boring and jacking under rights- of-way shall
be accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance specified by the Public
Works Director from the edge of the pavement. Pits for boring or jacking shall
be excavated no more than forty-eight (48) hours in advance of boring or
jacking operations and backfilled within forty-eight (48) hours after boring or
jacking operations are completed. While pits are open, they shall be clearly
marked and protected by barricades. Shoring shall be designed, erected,
supported, braced, and maintained so that it will safely support all vertical
and lateral loads that may be imposed upon it during the boring or jacking
operation.
         (b)   Wet Boring or Jetting. Wet boring or jetting shall not be
permitted under the roadway.
         (c)   Borings With Diameters Greater than Six (6) Inches. Borings over
six (6) inches (0.15m) in diameter shall be accomplished with an auger and
following pipe, and the diameter of the auger shall not exceed the outside
diameter of the following pipe by more than one (1) inch (25mm).
         (d)   Borings with Diameters Six (6) Inches or Less.
   Borings of six (6) inches or less in diameter may be accomplished by either
jacking, guided with auger, or auger and following pipe method.
         (e)   Tree Preservation. Any facility located within the drip line of
any tree designed by the City to be preserved or protected shall be bored under
or around the root system.
      (2)   Trenching. Trenching for facility installation, repair, or
maintenance on rights-of-way shall be done in accord with the applicable
portions of Section 603 IDOT’s “Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction”.
         (a)   Length. The length of open trench shall be kept to the
practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipe-line testing. Only
one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless special
permission is obtained from the Public Works Director.
         (b)   Open Trench and Excavated Material. Open trench and wind rowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by Chapter 6 of the Illinois
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devises. Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow for wind rowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         (c)   Drip Line of Trees. The utility shall not trench within the drip
line of any tree designated by the City to be preserved.
      (3)   Backfilling.
         (a)   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation
of facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT’s “Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction”. When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
         (b)   For a period of three (3) years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore
any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If so
ordered by the Public Works Director, the utility, at its expense, shall remove
any pavement and backfill material to the top of the installed facility, place
and properly compact new backfill material, and restore new pavement, sidewalk,
curbs, and driveways to the proper grades, as determined by the Public Works
Director.
      (4)   Pavement Cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair
shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed
to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this paragraph (4) is
permitted under Section
33-9-21, the following requirements shall apply:
         (a)   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and compacted
as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10 gradation, as
designated by the Public Works Director.
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the City.
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         (d)   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven (7) years, or resurfaced in the last
three (3) years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to
be an emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before
the time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
City.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
(1) foot (0.3m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or City approved jointed
pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is installed
prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or mechanical
joints are of a type approved by the City. Bell and spigot type pipe shall be
encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:

there is no feasible alternative and if guy wires are equipped with guy guards
for maximum visibility.
         (c)   Underground Facilities.
            (i)   Cable may be installed by trenching or plowing, provided that
special consideration is given to boring in order to minimize damage when
crossing improved entrances and side roads.
            (ii)   If a crossing is installed by boring or jacking, encasement
shall be provided between jacking or bore pits. Encasement may be eliminated
only if:
               a.   the crossing is installed by the use of “moles”, “whip
augers”, or other approved method which compress the earth to make the opening
for cable installation or
               b.   the installation is by the open trench method which is only
permitted prior to roadway construction.
            (iii)   Cable shall be grounded in accordance with the National
Electrical Safety Code.
            (iv)   Burial of Drops. All temporary service drops placed between
November 1 of the prior year and March 15 of the current year, also known as

overhead or underground facilities, when permitted within a right-of-way, shall
be provided with a vegetation-free area extending one (1) foot (305mm) in width
beyond the appurtenance in all directions. The vegetation-free area may be
provided by an extension of the mounting pad, or by heavy duty plastic or
similar material approved by the Public Works Director, shrubbery surrounding
the appurtenance may be used in place of vegetation-free area. The housing for
ground-mounted appurtenances shall be painted a neutral color to blend with the
surroundings.
   (C)   Materials.
      (1)   General Standards. The materials used in constructing facilities
within rights-of-way shall be those meeting the accepted standards of the
appropriate industry, the applicable portions of IDOT’s “Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction”, the requirements of the
Illinois Commerce Commission, or the standards established by other official
regulatory agencies for the appropriate industry.
      (2)   Material Storage on Right-of-Way. No material shall be stored on
the right-of-way without the prior written approval of the Public Works
Director. When such storage is permitted, all pipe, conduit, wire, poles, cross
arms, or other materials shall be distributed along the right-of-way prior to
and during installation in a manner to minimize hazards to the public or an
obstacle to right-of-way maintenance or damage to the right-of-way and other
property. If material is to be stored on right-of-way, prior approval must be
obtained from the City.
      (3)   Hazardous Materials. The plans submitted by the utility to the City
shall identify any hazardous materials that may be involved in the construction
of the new facilities or removal of any existing facilities.
   (D)   Operational Restrictions.
      (1)   Construction operations on rights-of-way may, at the discretion of
the City, be required to be discontinued when such operations would create
hazards to traffic or the public health, safety, and welfare. Such operations
may also be required to be discontinued or restricted when conditions are such
that construction would result in extensive damage to the right-of-way or other
property.
      (2)   These restrictions may be waived by the Public Works Director when
emergency work is required to restore vital utility services.
      (3)   Unless otherwise permitted by the City, the hours of construction
shall be those determined by the City and either set forth separately in this
Code, or as determined by Resolution of the City Council.
   (E)   Location of Existing Facilities. Any utility proposing to construct
facilities in the City shall contact J.U.L.I.E. and ascertain the presence and
location of existing above-ground and underground facilities within the rights-
of-way to be occupied by its proposed facilities. The City will make its permit
records available to a utility for the purpose of identifying possible
facilities. When notified of an excavation or when requested by the City or by
J.U.L.I.E., a utility shall locate and physically mark its underground
facilities within forty-eight (48) hours, excluding weekends and holidays, in
accordance with the Illinois Underground Facilities Damage Prevention Act (220
ILCS 50/1 et seq.)
33-9-17 VEGETATION CONTROL.
   (A)   Electric Utilities - Compliance with State Laws and Regulations. An
electric utility shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation control
activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable Illinois laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the City as permitted by law.
   (B)   Other Utilities - Tree Trimming Permit Required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing the same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this Article.
      (1)   Application for Tree Trimming Permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to Trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The City will require
compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without
authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The City may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (B)   Specimen Trees or Trees of Special Significance. The City may require
that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special
significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm
extensions, covered wire or other means.
   (C)   Chemical Use.
      (1)   Except as provided in the following paragraph, no utility shall
spray, inject or pour any chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation
in the City for any purpose, including the control of growth, insects or
disease.
      (2)   Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals will not be
permitted on rights-of-way unless the utility demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the Public Works Director that such spraying is the only practicable method
of vegetation control.
33-9-18 REMOVAL, RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATION OF UTILITY FACILITIES.
   (A)   Notice. Within ninety (90) days following written notice from the
City, a utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or
permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any
utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities
have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is
reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation
of any City improvement in or upon, or the operations of the City in or upon,
the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the City, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall,
at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of- way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this Article; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The City retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the City, as the City may determine to be necessary, appropriate or
useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances
permit, the Municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior
to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after
cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of Facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights-of-way of the City, the utility shall notify the City within ninety (90)
days. Following receipt of such notice the City may direct the utility to
remove all or any portion of the facility if the Public Works Director
determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health,
safety and welfare. In the event that the City does not direct the utility that
abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the
City, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or
removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person.
33-9-19 CLEANUP AND RESTORATION.
The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain
and other property within ten (10) days after any portion of the rights-of-way
are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or maintenance by the
utility, all to the satisfaction of the City. This includes restoration of
entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using
materials and methods approved by the Public Works Director. Such cleanup and
repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding,
resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a condition
substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the
project. The time period provided in this Section may be extended by the Public
Works Director for good cause shown.
33-9-20 MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the City and at the utility’s expense.
   (B)   Emergency Maintenance Procedures. Emergencies may justify
noncompliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flags. If a hazard does not
exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Public Works Director or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the
traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If
the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of
traffic, the City police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency Repairs. The utility must file in writing with the City a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within forty-eight
(48) hours after an emergency repair.
33-9-21 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for Variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this Article must do so in writing to the Public Works
Director as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each
provision of this Article from which a variance is requested and the reasons
why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to Grant Variances. The Public Works Director shall decide
whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this Article identified
in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for Granting of Variance. The Public Works Director may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Public Works Director may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this Article but which carry out the
purposes of this Article.
   (E)   Right to Appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Public
Works Director under the provisions of this Article shall have the right to
appeal to the City Council, or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the City
Clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order, requirement,
decision or determination. The City Council shall commence its consideration of
the appeal at the Council’s next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least
seven (7) days after the filing of the appeal. The City Council shall timely
decide the appeal.
33-9-22 PENALTIES.
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this Article shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when the City will
incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this Article. Unless
the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the City’s costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the City. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it.
33-9-23 ENFORCEMENT.
Nothing in this Article shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the City may have for enforcement of this Article.
33-9-24 SEVERABILITY.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Article
is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and
independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions hereof.

34-1-4 INTERPRETATION.
This Code is intended as Minimum Requirements to provide for coordinated,
efficient, and economic development of the City, to ensure the adequacy of
street and utility facilities, and to promote the public health, safety and
welfare.
Thus, in accordance with State law, whenever this Chapter imposes higher
standards than the County Subdivision Code and the Plat Act, Chapter 765, the
higher standards shall supersede the County regulations in the unincorporated
territory located within the subdivision jurisdiction of the City.
34-1-5 APPLICATION OF CODE.

conveyed unless a Final Plat of the property has been approved according to the
requirements and provisions of this Code and recorded in the office of the
County Recorder of Deeds, except in those instances listed in Section
34-1-9 when subdivision plats will not be required.
34-1-6 SUITABILITY OF LAND FOR SUBDIVISION DEVELOPMENT.
Land unsuitable for subdivision development due to drainage, flood hazard area,
hillside area, rock formation or any other condition(s) constituting a danger
to health, life or property shall not be approved for subdivision development
unless the subdivider presents evidence or data satisfactory to the Plan
Commission, establishing that the methods proposed to meet any such condition
(s) are adequate to avoid any danger to health, life or property.

DIVISION III - MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN
34-2-9 GENERAL STATEMENT.
The subdivider shall conform to the following principles and standards of land
subdivision in the design of each subdivision or portion thereof. No
Preliminary Plat shall be approved unless it conforms to the following minimum
standards of design.
34-2-10 STREETS AND ALLEYS.
   (A)   The street and alley arrangement shall be such as to not impose undue
hardship upon the owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land
and seek to provide for convenient access thereto. Reserve strips controlling
access to streets are prohibited, except where their control is placed with the
City Council.
   (B)   The arrangement of rights-of-way in a subdivision shall provide for
the continuation of the existing streets or rights-of-way in adjoining areas,
unless the Plan Commission deems such continuation undesirable for reasons of
topography or design. Where subdivision streets or rights-of-way are
continuations or extensions of existing streets or rights-of- way, the width
thereof shall be of the same or greater width as the existing street or right-
of-way, except that in no case shall the street or right-of-way in the
subdivision be of less width than hereinafter provided.
   (C)   Where, in the opinion of the Plan Commission, it is desirable to
provide future street access to adjoining areas, the streets and rights-of-way
in the subdivision shall be extended to the property line. If deemed necessary
by the Plan Commission, any temporary dead-end street shall be provided with a
temporary turnaround. In no case shall access be denied to any parcel or part
of a parcel of ground by the subdividing of land.
   (D)   Streets shall intersect, as nearly as possible, at right angles.
   (E)   Local street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least
fifteen (15) feet; intersections involving collector or arterial streets shall
have radii of not less than twenty-five (25) feet.
   (F)   Street jogs with center line offsets of less than one hundred twenty-
five (25) feet are prohibited.
   (G)   Unless topography indicates a need for a greater length, dead-end
streets designed to be so permanently shall be no longer than five hundred
(500) feet and shall terminate in a circular open space having a radius at the
outside of the pavement of at least forty (40) feet and a diameter at the
outside of the right-of-way of at least one hundred (100) feet.
   (H)   Local streets shall be designed so as to discourage through traffic.
   (I)   No local street grade shall be in excess of ten percent (10%) and no
collector street or arterial street grade shall be in excess of seven percent
(7%), except as otherwise approved by the Plan Commission due to adverse
topographic conditions. For adequate drainage, the minimum grade of any new
street shall not be less than one-half of one percent (1/2%).
   (J)   The Plan Commission shall not approve streets which will be subject to
frequent inundation or flooding.
   (K)   Alleys shall be avoided in a single-family and two-family district,
except as required by this Section, however, may be required in multiple-family
districts and commercial or industrial districts, unless other definite and
assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading,
unloading and parking consistent and adequate for the use proposed.
   (L)   Dead-end alleys shall not be permitted, except where provided with
adequate turnaround facilities at the dead-end, or where such dead-end alleys
provide the only access to off-street parking.
   (M)   Alleys, where provided, shall have a right-of-way of not less than
twenty (20) feet.
   (N)   The minimum right-of-way of local streets, minimum including marginal
access streets and cul-de-sacs, shall be fifty (50) feet.
   (O)   The minimum right-of-way of secondary or collector streets shall be
sixty (60) feet.
   (P)   The minimum right-of-way of arterial or primary streets shall be
eighty (80) feet.
   (Q)   Intersections of more than two (2) streets at one (1) point shall be
avoided.
   (R)   Where the subdivision abuts in or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the Plan Commission may require that marginal access streets
be provided in order that no lots front on such existing or proposed arterial
street.
   (S)   Dedication of half-streets shall be discouraged, but may be permitted
whenever there is no other logical method of platting. However, wherever there
exists a dedicated or platted half-street or alley adjacent to the tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street or alley shall be platted, unless
otherwise permitted by the Plan Commission.
34-2-11 DRAINAGE.
No plat shall be approved for any subdivision which is subject to flooding
unless the plat conforms to the applicable requirements of this Code. (See
Chapter 6, Article VI, “Flood Plain Code”)
   (A)   No plat shall be approved for any subdivision or part thereof which is
subject to periodic flooding or which contains inadequate drainage facilities
or which makes adequate drainage of streets impossible. However, if the
subdivider agrees in writing to make improvements at his expense which will, in
the opinion of the Plan Commission, make the area safe for human occupancy and
use further provide adequate drainage for streets, then the preliminary and
final plat may be approved.
   (B)   The rate of storm water runoff leaving the subdivision shall not
exceed what would have occurred under natural, undeveloped conditions. Storm
water drainage shall be discharged to retention basins or detention basins
designed to control the peak rate of discharge from the property at or below
those which existed prior to development. (See Section
34-3-7(D). (Ord. No. 1319; 12-12-05)
   (C)   No existing ditch, stream, drain or drainage canal shall be deepened,
widened, filled, rerouted or filled without written permission from the City.
   (D)   Where artificial channels must be constructed to augment the natural
drainage system, such channels as well as the natural drainage ways may be
planned as part of a recreational trail system. Channels shall be designed to
be aesthetically compatible for recreational trail use.
   (E)   The drainage system shall be constructed and operational during
construction or as approved by the City.
   (F)   The natural drainage system shall be used as far as is feasible for
the storage and flow of runoff.
   (G)   No plat shall be recorded for any subdivision situated within five
hundred (500) feet of any surface drain or watercourse serving a tributary area
of six hundred forty (640) acres or more, until such plan or map has been
reviewed by the Department of Transportation, either independently or in
cooperation with Federal, State or local agencies, for the purpose of
determining, for the protection of persons and property, the flood hazards
involved and a report thereon filed by the Department with the County Recorder.
34-2-12 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.
The following standards shall be applied in the subdivision and construction of
land areas:
   (A)   The development shall conform to the natural limitations presented by
topography and soil so as to create the least potential for soil erosion.
   (B)   Natural plant covering shall be retained and protected so far as is
consistent with development of the site.

complete required improvements;
   (E)   To evaluate and make decisions concerning proposed minor changes in
approved final plats;
   (F)   To review and forward applications for subdivision variances to the
Plan Commission;
   (G)   To periodically review the provisions of this Code to determine
whether revisions are needed, and to make recommendations on such matters to
the Plan Commission as necessary;
   (H)   To maintain up-to-date records of matters pertaining to this Code,
including, but not limited to, preliminary plats, as-built records of completed
improvements, final plats, variances, and amendments; and
   (I)   To provide information to subdividers/developers and to the general
public on matters related to this Code.
34-5-2 SUBDIVISION VARIANCES.
Any subdivider/developer desiring a variance from the requirements of this Code
shall file a written application therefor with the Administrator at the same
time that he files his Preliminary Plat. The application shall fully explain
the grounds for the variance request, and specify the section(s) of this Code
which, if strictly applied, would cause great practical difficulties or
hardship. The Administrator shall prepare an advisory report on variance
application and submit it, together with the completed application to the Plan
Commission.
   (A)   Review By Plan Commission. The Plan Commission shall review the
variance application and the Administrator's comments, and submit their
advisory report to the City Council, together with their recommendation on
preliminary plat approval. The Plan Commission's advisory report shall be
responsive to all the variances standards set forth in paragraph (B) below.

which they take action on the application for preliminary plat approval, the
City Council shall decide by resolution whether to grant or deny the requested
subdivision variance. A copy of their decision, clearly stating their reasons
therefor and the exact terms of any variance granted shall be attached to both
the preliminary and final plats. The City Council shall not grant any
subdivision variance unless, based upon the information presented to them, they
determine that:
      (1)   the proposed variance is consistent with the general purposes of
this Code; and
      (2)   strict application of the subdivision design and improvement
requirements would result in great practical difficulties or hardship to the
applicant, not a mere inconvenience; and
      (3)   the proposed variance is the minimum deviation from the subdivision
requirements that will alleviate the difficulties/hardship; and
      (4)   the plight of the applicant is due to peculiar circumstances not of
his own making; and
      (5)   the peculiar circumstances engendering the variance request are not
applicable to other tracts and, therefore, that a variance would be a more
appropriate remedy than an amendment; and
      (6)   the variance, if granted, will not substantially impair
implementation of the City Community Plan, including the Official Map.

Within a reasonable time the Plan Commission shall submit an advisory report to
the City Council. The City Council shall act on the proposed amendment at their
next regularly scheduled meeting following submission of this report. The City
Council may either pass or reject the proposed amendment or may refer it back
to the Plan Commission for further consideration.

required improvements, and such resolution indicates that the owner and/or
developer has been notified that the municipality finds that a breach of the
owner's and/or developer's obligations has occurred and have not been cured
within a period of thirty (30) days, that in such case, we shall make payments
for materials and labor to such contractor(s) or subcontractor(s) retained by
the municipality who have completed the

according to the owner and/or developer the permission to proceed with the
development project expressly upon the guarantee of the irrevocable nature of
this commitment. It is further acknowledged that the consideration for this
irrevocable commitment is provided by agreements between this financial
institution and the developer. The sum of this credit shall, however, be
reduced in the amount of disbursements made from time to time in accordance
with the terms under which this credit is extended as set out above.

36-3-2 EXCEPTIONS.
None of the taxes authorized by this Article may be imposed with respect to any
transaction in interstate commerce or otherwise to the extent to which the
business or privilege may not, under the Constitution and statutes of the
United States, be made the subject of taxation by this State or any political
subdivision thereof; nor shall any persons engaged in the business of
distributing, supplying, furnishing, or selling or transmitting gas, water, or
electricity, or engaged in the business of transmitting messages, or using or
consuming electricity acquired in a purchase at retail, be subject to taxation
under the provisions of this Article for those transactions that are or may
become subject to taxation under the provisions of the "Municipal Retailers'
Occupation Tax Act" authorized by Section
8-11-1; nor shall any tax authorized by this Article be imposed upon any person

exercising the same privilege within the City.
36-3-3 ADDITIONAL TAXES.
Such tax shall be in addition to other taxes levied upon the taxpayer or its
business.
36-3-4 COLLECTION.
The tax authorized by this Article shall be collected from the purchaser by the
person maintaining a place of business in this State who delivers the
electricity to the purchaser. This tax shall constitute a debt of the purchaser
to the person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser and if unpaid, is
recoverable in the same manner as the original charge for delivering the
electricity. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to this Article and any
such tax collected by a person delivering electricity shall constitute a debt
owed to the City by such person delivering the electricity. Persons delivering
electricity shall collect the tax from the purchaser by adding such tax to the
gross charge for delivering the electricity. Persons delivering electricity
shall also be authorized to add to such gross charge an amount equal to three
percent (3%) of the tax to reimburse the person delivering electricity for the
expense incurred in keeping records, billing customers, preparing and filing
returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the City upon request. If the
person delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from the purchaser, then
the purchaser shall be required to pay the tax directly to the City in the
manner prescribed by the City. Persons delivering electricity who file returns
pursuant to this Section shall, at the time of filing such return, pay the City
the amount of the tax collected pursuant to this Article.
36-3-5 REPORTS TO CITY.
On or before the last day of each month, each taxpayer shall make a return to
the City for the preceding month stating:
   (A)   His name.
   (B)   His principal place of business.
   (C)   His gross receipts and/or kilowatt-hour usage during the month upon
the basis of which the tax is imposed.
   (D)   Amount of tax.
   (E)   Such other reasonable and related information as the corporate
authorities may require.
The taxpayer making the return herein provided for shall, at the time of making
such return, pay to the City, the amount of tax herein imposed; provided that
in connection with any return, the taxpayer may, if he so elects, report and
pay an amount based upon his total billings of business subject to the tax
during the period for which the return is made (exclusive of any amounts
previously billed) with prompt adjustments of later payments based upon any
differences between such billings, and the taxable gross receipts.
36-3-6 CREDIT FOR OVER-PAYMENT.
If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been paid which was not due under
the provisions of this Article, whether as the result of a mistake of fact or
an error of law, then such amount shall be credited against any tax due, or to
become due, under this Article from the taxpayer who made the erroneous
payment; provided that no amounts erroneously paid more than three (3) years
prior to the filing of a claim therefor shall be so credited.
No action to recover any amount of tax due under the provisions of this Article
shall be commenced more than three (3) years after the due date of such amount.
36-3-7 PENALTY.

addition, shall be liable in a civil action for the amount of tax due. (See 65

One hundred percent (100%) of all revenues received hereunder shall be
deposited into the Infrastructure Fund. (Ord. No. 1889; 04-10-17)
36-3-9 REVERSION.
Should the use tax or electric deregulation law be successfully challenged in a
court of law and invalidated in whole or in part effectively making the rate
structure of Section
36-3-1(B) invalid, the City wishes to provide the necessary language to revert
to a gross receipts tax on electricity upon such happening, without further
action of the City. Therefore, should such circumstance arise, the following
paragraph shall replace Section
36-3-1(B), (C) and (D):
   “(B) Persons engaged in the business of distributing, supplying, furnishing
or selling electricity for use or consumption within the City and not for
resale, at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross receipts therefrom.”
36-3-10 EXEMPTION.

“Gross charges” for private line service shall include charges imposed at each
channel termination point within a municipality that has imposed a tax under
this Article, and charges for the portion of the inter-office channels provided
within that municipality. Charges for that portion of the inter-office channel
connecting two (2) or more channel termination points, one or more of which is
located within the jurisdictional boundary of such municipality, shall be
determined by the retailer by multiplying an amount equal to the total charge
for the inter-office channel by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of channel termination points that are located within the jurisdictional
boundary of the municipality and the denominator of which is the total number
of channel termination points connected by the inter-office channel. However,
“gross charge” shall not include any of the following:
      (1)   any amounts added to a purchaser’s bill because of a charge made

any of the tax liabilities or other amounts specified in those provisions of
the Public Utilities Act;
      (2)   charges for a sent collect telecommunication received outside of
such municipality;

provided in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly
owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed
under this Act has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that
the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or
between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the
corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering
such service;
      (7)   bad debts (“bad debt” means any portion of a debt that is related
to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or
excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under
applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to
be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that
portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made);
      (8)   charges paid by inserting coins in coin-operated telecommunication
devices; or
      (9)   amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the
Telecommunications Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act.
      (10)   Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if:
         (a)   those charges are aggregated with other charges for
telecommunications that are taxable,
         (b)   those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or
invoice, and
         (c)   the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on
the retailer books and records kept in the regular course of business.
If the nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge
from the sale of both taxable and nontaxable services or telecommunications
billed on a combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or
telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the
retailer of the telecommunications.
   (D)   “Interstate Telecommunications” means all telecommunications that
either originate or terminate outside this State.
   (E)   “Intrastate Telecommunications” means all telecommunications that

imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this State,
who, to the satisfaction of the Department, furnishes adequate security to
insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this State in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this State.
The permit may be revoked by the Department at its discretion.
   (I)   “Retailer maintaining a place of business in this State”, or any like
term, means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this State,
directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission

as defined in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-
to-ground systems and the like, “service address” shall mean the location of a
taxpayer’s primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by
telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are
sent.

other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any
other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means,
between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio,
satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this Article, “private line” means
a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of “telecommunications” shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. “Telecommunications” shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunication service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-
company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end
telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered “telecommunications”
subject to the tax imposed under this Act. For purposes of this Section,
“prepaid telephone calling arrangements” means that term as defined in Section
2-27 of the Retailer’s Occupations Tax Act.

Section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the
municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
municipal tax.
   (B)   The act or privilege of originating in the City or receiving in the
City interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent (6%) of

this State on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted
pursuant to or authorized by this Section to the extent of the amount of such
tax properly due and paid in such other state which was not previously due and
paid in a municipality in this State which was not previously allowed as a
credit against any other state or local tax in this State.

privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the Constitution
and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the City.

taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this State and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this Article and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the Department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the State. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this Article
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
Department in the manner provided by the Department.
   (B)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this Article shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.

a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
Department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this Article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the Department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunications tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person’s having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided hereinabove in this Section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this State shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.
36-4-6 FUND CREATED.
   (A)   There is hereby created a separate fund, located in the General Fund
for the City of Staunton, Illinois, which shall hereafter be known as the

every person, company or corporation who is supplied with water and sewer
services from the waterworks and sewerage system and every person, company or
corporation, hereinafter called a “customer” who accepts and uses City water
and sewer services shall be held to have consented to be bound thereby.
   (B)   Not Liable for Interrupted Service. The Department shall endeavor at
all times to provide a regular and uninterrupted supply of service, however, in
case the supply of service shall be interrupted or irregular or defective or
fail from causes beyond its control or through ordinary negligence of
employees, servants or agents, the Departments shall not be liable therefor.
   (C)   Using Services Without Paying. Any person using utility services from
the City without paying therefor, or who shall be found tampering or breaking
the seal of any meter or appurtenances, or bypassing any meter, shall be
assessed a fee of Fifty Dollars ($50.00).
   (D)   Destroying Property. Any person found guilty of defacing, tampering,
injuring or destroying, or in any manner, limiting the use or availability of
any meter or any property of the waterworks system and sewerage system, or
erecting signs on the property of the Department without permission shall, upon
conviction of such act, be fined as provided in Chapter 1, Article I of this
Code.
   (E)   Service Obtained By Fraud. All contracts for water and sewer services
must be made in the name of the head of the household, firm or corporation
using the established spelling of that person's or firm's name. Attempts to
obtain service by the use of other names, different spellings or by
substituting other persons or firms shall be considered a subterfuge and
service shall be denied. If service has been discontinued because of nonpayment
of bills, or any unpaid obligation and service has again been obtained through
subterfuge, misrepresentation or fraud, that service shall be promptly
disconnected and the whole or such part of the advanced payment as may be
necessary to satisfy the unpaid obligation shall be retained by the City and
credited to the appropriate account.
   (F)   Failure to Receive Bill. Failure to receive a bill shall not excuse a
customer from his obligation to pay within the time specified. Should the
Department be unable to bill a customer for services used during any month, the
following billing shall include the charges for services used during the
unbilled month.
   (G)   Request to Discontinue Service. Services shall have been deemed to
have been supplied to any property connected to the Water and Sewer Systems
during a month unless the customer notifies the City Hall, in writing, ten (10)
days prior to the time such termination of such service is desired. In the
event that the customer requests that service be disconnected, the service
shall not be thereafter reconnected until such time as the customer has paid to
the City a turn-on fee in the amount of Thirty-Five Dollars ($35.00) per
service to the property. During such time as service to the property has been
voluntarily terminated by the customer, the facility charge fees set forth in
Section
38-4-14 shall also cease to accrue for those whole months where service has
been voluntarily disconnected. Full facility charge fees shall be due for
properties receiving service for any partial portion of a month. In the event
that a customer requests that service be voluntarily turned off due to a leak
which is being repaired by the customer, and provided that the leak is repaired
within two (2) weeks of notification to the City, no turn-on fee shall be due
and owing from the customer upon request to resume service. (Ord. No. 1485; 04-
27-09)
   (H)   Water and/or sewer bills issued on a monthly basis from the City, and
are due to be paid on receipt. Water and/or sewer bills not being paid in full
by the fifteenth (15th) of the month following the month in which the bills are
issued shall be deemed delinquent, and shall result in a penalty to be imposed
on the delinquent balance in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the outstanding
balance. (Ord. No. 1844; 04-25-16)
   (I)   The water supply of the premises against which the water service
charges remain unpaid may be shut off by the City and such service discontinued
conditioned on the following terms and conditions:
      (1)   Hearing Afforded User.  Any user who has failed to pay in full the
bill for water and/or sewer service by or before the fifteenth (15th) of the
month following the date the bill issued is declared to be delinquent. Ten (10)
days after the date of delinquency of the water and/or sewer bill, if the
delinquent user fails to pay all amounts owed the City for water service, the
City Clerk, or his/her designee, shall cause a water shut off notice to be
served upon the address of the delinquent user, which shall notify the
delinquent user that water service shall be terminated three (3) days after the
delivery of the water shut off notice, unless full payment for all amounts owed
for water service is paid to the City, or unless the delinquent user exercises
his right to a hearing by demanding a hearing as provided herein within three
(3) days of the date of service as noted on the water shut off notice. An
additional Thirty-Five Dollar ($35.00) administrative fee shall be added to the
delinquent amount due to cover the cost to the City of drafting, recording in
City records, and serving the water shut off notice upon the delinquent user,
and the water shut off notice shall notify the delinquent user of the Thirty-
Five Dollar ($35.00) administrative fee. If the delinquent user fails to demand
a hearing in the manner provided herein within three (3) days of the date of
service as noted on the water shut off notice, then the delinquent user shall
be deemed to have waived his right to the hearing provided in this Section. If
the delinquent user waives his right to the hearing provided in this Section,
then water service shall be shut off and terminated.
      (2)   Request for Hearing; Hearing.
         (a)   If a user chooses to dispute amount stated on the water bill,
the user must make a written request for a hearing thereon within three (3)
days of the date of service of the water shut off notice. This request for a
hearing must be received by the City at the address stated on the water bill
for the mailing of payment, either hand delivered or by U.S. mail. The user may
make a partial payment on the bill and request a hearing on the disputed
portion of the bill. Acceptance of partial payment by the City does not waive
any authority of the City to pursue disconnection pending the results of a
properly requested hearing.
         (b)   Upon receipt of the written request for a hearing, the City
Clerk shall immediately forward said request to the Utility Chairman, or his/
her designee, who shall establish a date and time for the hearing. The user
shall be notified in writing of the date, time and place of the hearing.
         (c)   At the time and place of said hearing, the hearing officers
shall give the delinquent user an opportunity to be heard and to present any
and all relevant evidence including testimony on said user’s behalf. Evidence
shall be limited to that relevant to the giving of proper notice and the
correctness or incorrectness of the bill being challenged. As an administrative
proceeding, the hearing shall not be subject to the strict rules of evidence
followed in the circuit courts. The records of payment for said water service
by the user, as provided and given to the hearing officers by the offices of
the City Treasurer, City Clerk and City Collector shall be prima facie evidence
that said bill is due and delinquent. A record of the hearing shall be kept.
      (3)   Notice of Findings of Hearing Officers. If the hearing officers,
within five (5) business days after such hearing, determine that the user is,
in fact, delinquent in payment of said bill for water services and that the
water service of said user should be discontinued, shut off and terminated,
then the officers shall state the basis or reasons for such termination in a
written order of termination, and shall serve a copy of such order upon the
user within five (5) days after said hearing. The order shall also state the
date when the water service shall be shut off and terminated, said date to be
no later than ten (10) days after the hearing date.
      (4)   Payment of Bill for Water Service; Reinstatement of Service. At any
time before or after the hearing is held; at any time before or after notice of
termination is served on the user; and at any time after termination, the
delinquent user shall have the right to have said water service reinstated upon
payment in full of the delinquent bill, including the water shut off notice
administrative fee, plus the Thirty-Five Dollar ($35.00) water connection fee,
plus penalties, interest, and any necessary costs assessed for the conduct of
the hearing and for labor and materials necessarily required to terminate and
reinstate the water service of the user.
      (5)   Hearing Officers. The hearing officers shall be the Utility
Chairman and the members of the Utility Committee. Provided, however, that the
Utility Chairman may conduct the hearing and issue a finding and order without
the presence of all members of the Utility Committee.
      (6)   Proper Notice.   Any notices required to be given under this
Section shall be proper if addressed to the user at the address stated on the
application for service or water billing account, postage prepaid and deposited
in the U.S. Mail or hand delivered to the address stated on said application or
water billing account, or if hand delivered and fastened to a door of the
residence. The City Clerk shall certify to the Hearing Officers the proper
mailing or delivery of the required notice and such certification shall be
prima facie evidence of the serving of such notice as of the date of deposit in
the U.S. Mail.
(Ord. No. 1586A; 06-27-11; Ord. No. 2187; 11-14-22)
   (J)   Lien/Foreclosure. In the event the charges for water or sewer service
are not paid within thirty (30) days after rendition of the bill for service,
such charges including all penalties, shall be deemed and are hereby declared
to be delinquent, and thereafter such delinquencies may constitute liens upon
the real estate for which service is supplied, provided that the City Clerk
first notifies the property owner or owners of record, as appears on the
records of the County Recorder of Deeds or as appears on the records of the
County Collector as those who paid property taxes for the most recent year, in
writing, of the delinquency and grants the property owner an additional ten
(10) days from the date of written notification to pay the bill in full
including the appropriate penalty as provided for herein. If the delinquent
bill is not paid within the time provided in the written notice of the City
Clerk, then the City Clerk is authorized and directed to file a notice of such
lien in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of Macoupin or Madison County,
Illinois, which said notice of such lien shall consist of a sworn statement
setting out the name(s) of the owner(s) of the real estate, a description of
the real estate upon or for which service was supplied, the amounts of moneys
due, and the date or dates when such amount or amounts became delinquent, and
the filing of such statement in the aforesaid office shall be deemed notice for
the payment of such charges for such service. In all cases where a lien has
been recorded, a recording and legal fee of One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00)
shall be charged in addition to the delinquent water supply and/or sewer system
service charge. The failure of the City Billing Clerk to record such notice of
any such lien shall not affect the right of the City to foreclose the lien for
unpaid water supply and/or sewer service charges or the right to pursue any
other legal remedy. If the charges for service are not paid within one hundred
eighty (180) days after rendition of the bill, the lien hereinabove provided
for may be foreclosed by appropriate legal action in the Circuit Court of
Macoupin or Madison County, as determined by the location of the subject
property. Notwithstanding anything provided in this Section, the remedy of
enforcement of the lien for the unpaid portion of water bills and delinquency
charges shall not be exclusive of any other legal remedy to collect the amount
due and unpaid for water consumed or furnished to the person liable therefor.
(Ord. No. 1586A; 06-27-11)
   (K)   Penalty. Any person, firm, or entity violating the terms and
conditions of this Section shall be subject to a fine not to exceed Seven
Hundred Fifty Dollars ($750.00) with each and every day that the violation is
allowed to exist. Each day that a violation exists constitutes a distinct and
separate offense under the terms of this Section. In addition the corporate
authority may take whatever action it deems appropriate to enforce the terms of
this Section, including an action for injunction. All attorney’s fees and costs
incurred by the City in enforcing the terms of this Section shall be paid by
the violator. (Ord. No. 1586A; 06-27-11)
   (L)   Insufficient Funds. A Twenty-Five Dollar ($25.00) fee shall be charged
for any check returned to the City due to insufficient funds. Offender will be
notified by first class mail and given twenty-four (24) hours to reimburse the
City in the amount of the insufficient check and fee. If the Offender does not
reimburse the City within the given time, water service shall be terminated at
the residence of the offender until City is reimbursed for full amount of
insufficient check and fees. All such payments shall be accepted only if made
by cash, money order or cashier’s check. (Ord. No. 1586A; 06-27-11)
38-2-2 CONSUMER LISTS.
It is hereby made the duty of the Collector to prepare or cause to be prepared
a complete and accurate list of all premises and properties receiving utility

same. The list shall be kept up-to-date, and shall be corrected from time to
time to allow changes in the occupancy or ownership of any such property or
premises. It shall be presented at the regular monthly meeting if requested.
38-2-3 LIABILITY FOR CHARGES.

weather.
38-2-5 NO FREE UTILITY SERVICE.
No free utility service shall be furnished to any person, public or private,
and all rates and charges shall be non-discriminatory, provided that the Mayor
and City Council reserve the right to impose special rates and charges in cases
where particular circumstances render the regular rates inadequate or unjust.
38-2-6 UTILITY DEPOSITS.
Whenever in the judgment of the Utility Chairman and members of the City
Council of the Combined Waterworks and Sewage System the interest of the City
requires, a deposit shall accompany each application for service to be retained
by the City to ensure the payment of bills. When service to the applicant is
discontinued, this deposit, less any amounts due and owing to the City for
water and sewer service and associated fees and expenses, shall be refunded to
the customer without interest. Such deposit shall be in the amount of Two
Hundred Dollars ($200.00) paid to the City regardless of meter size. For those
applications where the Utility Chairman and City Council have determined that a
deposit is required, the service turn-on fee of Thirty-Five Dollars ($35.00)
set forth in Section
38-2-1(G) or 38-2-1(H)(4) shall not be required to be paid by the applicant at

contained in paragraph (B) herein.

private property owner, or the private property owner’s agent or contractor,
must contact the City and allow the City to inspect the mains, laterals, and
associated equipment and structures, to determine the source of the problem.
The homeowner shall contact City Hall to report the problem and request an
inspection. An after hours or weekend phone number will be available from City
Hall for problems arising when the City Hall is closed. The private property
owner shall bear sole responsibility to any contractor or individual hired,
retained, or engaged by the private property owner for payment of any and all
repairs made by said contractor for repairs made to correct any plumbing
problems. However, in accordance with the provisions of this Section, a private
property owner may submit bills incurred to the City for review and potential
reimbursement. The City will, in its sole discretion, based upon its
inspection, determine the City’s percentage of responsibility, if any, for the
plumbing problem and reimburse the property owner accordingly the reasonable
value of the services rendered and equipment utilized to perform said repairs
to City owned equipment. Under no circumstance shall any request for
reimbursement be considered by City for any property if the City was not
contacted prior to the repairs being made, and allowed the opportunity to be
present and document the nature and extent of the repairs. Failure to follow
these procedures will result in a denial of any claim for reimbursement. (Ord.

240 mg/l respectively. The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded
by water meters and/or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the 204 mg/
l and 240 mg/l concentration for BOD and SS respectively. (Section
38-4-22 specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.)

Three Dollars Forty Cents ($3.40) per one thousand (1,000) gallons shall be
applied to all users outside the City Corporate limits. This charge will be
divided such that One Dollar Thirty Cents ($1.30) is applied for operation,
maintenance and replacement; the remainder collected shall be applied towards
debt reduction.
38-4-21 SURCHARGE RATE.
The rates of surcharges for BOD5 and SS shall be as follows:
SC BODi =   $0.16 (BOD i – 204) x Q i x 8.34
SC SSi   =   $0.13 (SS i – 240) x Q i x 8.34
S ci   =   SC BODi + SC SSi
Where Q i   =   total bimonthly flow volume expressed in million gallons.
 
BOD i  = Biochemical Oxygen Demand Concentration (5 day, 20 degrees Centigrade)
         of waste expressed in milligrams per liter.
SS i   = Suspended Solids Concentration of waste expressed in milligrams per
         liter.
SCBODi = Bi-monthly surcharge in dollars for Biochemical Oxygen Demand for
         waste concentrations greater than 204 mg/l.
SCSSi  = Bi-monthly surcharge in dollars for Suspended Solids for waste
         concentrations greater than 240 mg/l.
SCi    = Total bi-monthly surcharge in dollars.
 
38-4-22 COMPUTATION OF SURCHARGE.
The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges shall be established
by flow measurement and waste sampling. Waste sampling and flow measurement
shall be performed as often as may be deemed necessary by the City and shall be
binding as a basis for surcharges.
38-4-23 COMPUTATION OF WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE.
The wastewater service charge for users within the City Corporate limits shall
be computed by the following formula:
CW = CF + Vu(CU + CUD) + SC i
 
Where   =WAmount of wastewater service charge per billing period.
CF         = Facilities Charge ($12.00)
Vu         = Wastewater Volume per billing period.
CU         = Basic User Rate for Operation, Maintenance and Replacement.
             ($1.30 per 1,000 gallons)
CUD        = Basic User Rate for Debt Reduction. ($0.40 per 1,000 gallons)
SC i       = Amount of Surcharge. (Section

(DSFR) means developed land containing one dwelling structure which is not
attached to another dwelling and which contains one or more bedrooms, with a
bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. DSFR
units may include houses, manufactured homes, and mobile homes located on one
or more individual lots or parcels of land. Billing for storm water user fees
is based on land usage, not zoning. Some residentially zoned properties house
small businesses, resulting in a classification of non-residential property.
   (D)   Developed Land. Developed land means property that has been altered
from its natural state by the addition of impervious area(s) equal to at least
one percent (1%) of the gross area.
   (E)   Impervious Area or Impervious Surface. Impervious area or impervious
surface means those areas that prevent or impede the infiltration of storm
water into the soil. Common impervious areas include, but are not limited to
rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage
areas, compacted aggregate, and awnings.
   (F)   Impervious Area Units. An impervious area unit (IAU) shall be used as
the basis for determining the storm water service charge to a parcel. One
thousand (1,000) square feet of impervious area shall be one (1) IAU. The
number of IAU’s attributed to a parcel will be determined by dividing the total
impervious area (square feet) of the parcel by one thousand (1,000) and
rounding the result to the nearest integer (.5 rounds up).
   (G)   Storm Water System. Storm water system shall mean a conveyance or
system of conveyances and shall include sewers, storm drains, curbs, gutters,
ditches, retention ponds or basins, dams, stream impoundments, man-made
channels or storm drains, and flood control facilities and appurtenances
thereof which are designed or used for the collection, control, transportation,
treatment, or discharge of storm water.
38-5-76 SCOPE OF RESPONSIBIILITY FOR THE STORM WATER UTILITY.
The Storm Water Utility shall be responsible for the operation, maintenance,
management, and improvement of the storm water system owned by the City,
including all activities required by the NPDES Storm Water Permit.
38-5-77 DETERMINATION OF STORM WATER SERVICE CHARGES.
Storm water service charges shall be determined by the City Council. The
revenue generated by storm water service charges, together with any other
sources of revenue that may be made available to the Storm Water Utility, will
be sufficient to meet the obligations of the Storm Water Utility.
38-5-78 STORM WATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   Calculation of Charges.
      (1)    Developed properties will be charged based on the number of IAU’s
on the property. The charge per month will be as set forth on Addendum I
attached hereto. The first month for which the charge will be imposed shall be
January, 2017.
      (2)    The minimum storm water utility bill for a developed property will
be 2.7 IAUs.
      (3)    Bills will be issued to the owner(s) of each property to which the
charge applies.
      (4)    Bills will be payable no later than thirty (30) days after
issuance.
      (5)    If a multiple-unit property is invoiced in one (1) bill, the IAU
charge will be exactly as calculated. If the invoice is divided among the
units, and each is billed, the bill to each will be calculated by dividing the
total bill by the number of units.
   (B)   Additions to Property. Whenever impervious surfaces are added to
property in the City, it shall be the responsibility of the owner and adult
occupants of the property to advise the City of the addition, so that
adjustments may be made in the charges to such property. Such report may be
made, through the building permit application, if applicable. If no building
permit is obtained for such addition, the report shall be made directly to the
Director of Public Works, in writing. If such report is not made, the property
owner and occupant(s) shall be responsible to immediately pay the fee from the
time of the addition until the time payment commences; and shall, additionally,
be required to pay the fine then in effect for a violation of the City’s
ordinances.
38-5-79 EXEMPTIONS AND CREDITS.
   (A)   Exemptions Applicable to Storm Water Service Charges. All property in

owned by the City, a township, Macoupin County, the State of Illinois, the
Federal Government, or a railroad.
   (B)   Credits Applicable to Storm Water Service Charges. Parcels shall be
eligible to receive a storm water service charge credit based upon the
requirements of the City of Staunton Storm Water Credit Manual, which is
attached hereto as Addendum 1, as such manual may be modified from time to time
by the City Council. An applicant for a credit shall be required to pay the fee
charged by the engineer engaged to review the application on behalf of the
City.
   (C)   Maintaining Credits. Any credit allowed against the storm water
service charge is conditioned upon continuing compliance with the City of
Staunton Storm Water Credit Manual.
38-5-80 APPEALS.
Any customer who believes the provisions of this Article have been applied in
error may appeal in the following manner:
   (A)   Appeal to the Public Works Director. An appeal must be filed in
writing with the Director. In the case of service charge appeals, the appeal
shall include a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional
engineer containing information on the total property area, the impervious
surface area, and any storm water management features, such as detention ponds,
or conditions which influence the hydrologic response of the property to
rainfall events.
   (B)   Responsibilities of the Public Works Director. Using the information
provided by the appellant, the Director shall have a qualified engineer engaged
by the City conduct a technical review of the conditions on the property and
provide a written report of his/her findings. The Director shall respond to the
appeal, based on such report, in writing, within sixty (60) days of the receipt
of the appeal. If the review reveals the customer has been overcharged for the
storm water utility fee, the Public Works Department will notify the City
billing department of the amount of the refund due to the customer paying the
storm water utility fee. Any refund due as a result of overcharging of the
storm water utility fee will be credited to the customer’s future utility
bills. The maximum time frame for credit reimbursement shall be no more than
six (6) months. If the review indicates the customer has been receiving a storm
water utility bill that is less than the amount he should have been charged,
the Public Works Department shall notify the City billing department of the
increase necessary to bring the storm water utility fee to the proper amount.
The City will not make any attempt to recoup the storm water utility fees
previously uncollected; provided, however, that the appellant shall be
responsible to reimburse the City for the cost of the engineer review
undertaken pursuant to this Section.
   (C)   Appeal of the Public Works Director Decision. A decision of the
Director that is adverse to an appellant may be appealed to the City Council
within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the adverse decision. The
appeal must be filed in writing with the City Council by the appellant and
include a detailed explanation of the grounds for the appeal. The City Council
shall issue a written decision on the appeal within sixty (60) days.

lien on the property with respect to which such charge is incurred, until such
charge has been paid in full. Such lien shall be automatic and without further
action of the City than this Division; provided that the City may, but shall
not be required to, record a notice of such lien with the Recorder of Deeds for
Macoupin County.
   (F)   Prosecution. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, City may
elect to enforce the requirements of this Division and any violations thereof
through issuance of Ordinance Violations, the penalties for which shall be
subject to the City’s general penalty provision as set forth in Staunton
Revised Code Section

application, the review will resume and be completed within sixty (60) days of
receipt of additional information. Billing adjustments required to implement
credits shall be applied retroactively to the date of the customer’s completed
credit application. If an application is denied, a letter explaining reasons
for the denial will be provided to the applicant.
First Year of Implementation:
To give customers the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the storm
water utility billing and to investigate the process by which a credit may be
obtained, any applications received during the first year (Feb, 2018 – Jan,
2019) that qualify for credit will receive the credit retroactively to the
inception of the program (Feb, 2018).
Chapter 1: General Information
The City Council of the City of Staunton, Illinois adopted Ord. No. 1913 on
October 9, 2017, creating a City-wide Storm Water Utility to provide storm
water management activities such as public education and participation; the
elimination of illicit discharges; control of construction site runoff; the
operation, maintenance, and repair of the storm water system; and pollution
prevention. These practices are necessary for the City to be in compliance:
with EPA Storm Water Regulations.
The primary source of revenue for the Storm Water Utility is the Storm Water
Utility Charge applied to all developed property in the City. Storm Water
Utility Charges to a property are related to the amount of storm water runoff
from the property. Since it is not feasible to directly measure this runoff,
the charge is based upon the amount of impervious area on each property. In
general terms, the impervious areas are the portions or the property that shed
water during a storm. Typical impervious areas include sidewalks, driveways,
roofs, awnings, patios, parking lots, and compacted aggregate.
Except as noted below, each parcel in the City shall be billed and shall pay a
Storm Water Utility Charge based on the number of impervious area units (IAUs)
on such parcel. One thousand (1,000) square feet of impervious area is one (1)
IAU.
The number of IAU’s attributed to a parcel will be determined by dividing the
total impervious area (square feet) of the parcel by one thousand (1,000) and
rounding the result to the nearest integer (.5 rounds up). Railroads and public
streets and highways are not included and are not billed. Each included parcel
located in the City has been studied, by a professional engineer, to determine
the number of IAUs on such parcel, as of August 22, 2017. That number, applied
to the rate, schedule attached to Sec. 38-5-78(A) of the City Code, shall be
the storm water service charge for that particular property for each month.
If a multiple-unit property can be invoiced on one (1) bill, the service charge
will be exactly as calculated. If the invoice is divided among the units, and
each is billed, the minimum billing will be 2.35 IAUs per parcel.
The number of IAUs assigned to a parcel will remain constant, unless physical
changes are made that alter the amount of its impervious area. In these cases,
billing changes will be made automatically at the issuance of a building
permit. In those circumstances where improvements have been made without a
building permit, the owner of the parcel shall notify the Director of Public
Works and, in any case, such changes will be billed retroactively to the date
the improvement was constructed, once the Director becomes aware of such
changes.
The City of Staunton has developed a system of credits for storm water service
customers who construct and operate facilities or controls on their parcel to
store or treat storm water runoff significantly above and beyond the level
required by the City’s subdivision ordinance, thereby reducing the impact on
the drainage system. This manual details the policies and procedures applicable
to the storm water service charge credit program.
Chapter 2: Credit Policies
It is the City’s intent to allow credit for practices that significantly reduce
or eliminate the negative impact of development on the drainage system through
a simple but effective credit system. A parcel whose impact on the storm water
drainage system is significantly reduced beyond City requirements or eliminated
through specific controls shall be entitled to a credit adjustment that will be
applied to such parcel’s storm water service charge. This manual details credit
available to parcels that have and maintain a storm water detention facility
that significantly exceeds the requirements of the City of Staunton Subdivision
Code. No credit is available for exceeding minimum water quality of discharged
storm water, at this time.
A.   Application Fee.
A credit application will not be considered complete and will not be processed
unless the application fee and all appropriate forms and information required
in this manual are submitted with it. The credit application fee shall be Two
Hundred Dollars ($200.00). Application fees are one-time and non-refundable.
It is the intent of the Public Works Department to process applications within
sixty (60) days of submittal of the complete and correct application package.
Billing adjustments required to implement credits shall be applied
retroactively to the date of the customer’s completed credit application. A
pending application for credit shall not constitute a valid reason for
nonpayment of the current Storm Water Service Charges.
The application fee is intended to cover one detention basin/storm water
mitigation facility, or a related group of detention basins within one
development. Therefore, an application fee may cover more than one multi-
family, commercial, or industrial lot within one development.
B.   Rate Reduction Credit
The Rate Reduction Credit is available for storm water facilities that control
the peak rate of storm runoff according to the following criteria:
   50% Rate Reduction Credit, if no storm water runs off the parcel, up to and
including the one hundred (100) year design storm.
   40% Rate Reduction Credit, for those parcels that control the post-
development peak rate of storm water runoff for the one hundred (100) year
design storm with a release rate less than or equal to a two (2) year pre-
developed runoff in accordance with the City of Staunton’s subdivision code.
   20% Rate Reduction Credit, for those parcels that control the post-
development peak rate of storm water runoff for the fifty (50) year design
storm with a release rate less than or equal to a two (2) year pre-developed
runoff in accordance with the City of Staunton’s subdivision code.
C.   Application Requirements
   1.   The application fee must be submitted with the application.
   2.   The owner shall supply maintenance information, along with their
application. Any association agreements or contracts for inspection and/or
maintenance are required to be disclosed as part of the application. The
information submitted must warrant the schedule for major maintenance that will
be performed and how many times per year basic maintenance (such as erosion
control and/or mowing) activities will be performed.
   3.   The owner shall supply the following technical information along with
the application:
      a.   Conceptual site plan and structural control location diagram.
      b.   Locations, dimensions, and characteristics of all proposed and
existing patterns and drainage facilities.
      c.   Existing and proposed grading and location of all structures,
parking, driveways, and other impervious areas.
      d.   Detailed engineering calculations providing the results of routing
the storm runoff for the one hundred (100) year storm event through the basin
or control, along with comparison to pre-development runoff rates. Total
storage volume calculations and emergency spillway configuration are also
required. Calculations shall be in a form acceptable to the Director of Public
Works and certified by a Professional Engineer licensed in Illinois.
      e. Upon completion of construction, as-built data and calculations shall
be in a form and from a source as noted in “d” above, and shall be submitted in
order to complete the application. The as-built data must verify the capacity
of the detention or other control facility.
   4.   While the engineer who performed the impermeable acreage study for the
City did not find there to be any existing facilities that would qualify for a
credit hereunder, if an existing facility does currently exist, it will be
eligible for credit, as long as it meets the requirements of this manual. In
this case, the preceding information required and any other supporting material
shall be submitted for review. Retrofitting of existing structures is also
allowed to provide credit for a parcel. The process of retrofitting existing
structures is similar to that for new developments. As-built data shall be
submitted for the existing or retrofitted structure before the credit will be
applied.
   5.   The owner shall be required to sign a statement certifying that the
information contained in the application is correct and an acknowledgement that
the credit determination will be based on the information submitted in the
application. A later inspection determining that the information was inaccurate
will result in the loss of the credit back to its inception. If the
certification is blatantly false, there will be a loss of credit back to its
inception and the owner shall be required to pay the fine then is effect for a
violation of the City’s ordinances.
D.   Maximum Credit
The maximum aggregate credit for any individual parcel is fifty percent (50%)
of its gross billing amount for the Storm Water Service Charge. Developments
must still conform to all applicable ordinances and standards of the City of
Staunton.
E.   Maintenance Requirements
Inspection reports shall be signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer
licensed in Illinois, and shall be in a form and from a source acceptable to
the City’s Director of Public Works. Furthermore, these inspection reports
shall be filed with the Director each year, as calculated from the original
application date (or other date which may be established by the City), in order
to maintain any level of Rate Reduction Credit. After two (2) consecutive years
of compliance, inspection reports shall be filed every two (2) years. If a
parcel owner fails to file required inspection reports or if a random City
inspection finds deficiencies, the City will send a letter informing the owner
of the required action to avoid revocation of the credit. If the parcel owner
fails to take the required action within sixty (60) days, the credit will be
revoked until the situation is corrected. No retroactive credits will be given
during said lapse period. If the City discovers that deficiencies have existed
for more than two (2) months and that the property owner has been receiving
credit for which s/he was not entitled, there will be a retroactive adjustment
reflecting the revoked credit back to the date of the last inspection. Credits
will be restored on the effective date of the submittal of the property owner’s
acceptable response. At a minimum, inspection reports shall include:
   1.   The condition of the retention or other structure.
   2.   Documentation that the quantity (volume) of detention has not been
reduced.
   3.   The condition of the emergency overflow and verification that it has
sufficient capacity.
   4.   Documentation of any signs or erosion or instability in any part of the
structure and corrective action required (if necessary).
F.   Indemnification
In consideration for permission to construct or install a storm water
improvement/best management practice (BMP), and by nature of applying for a
storm water fee credit, the applicant is hereby legally acknowledging and
agreeing to the following:
   1.   After completion of the construction or installation by the Owner and
approval by the City, the storm water improvement/BMP shall remain a privately
owned and maintained storm water improvement/BMP.
   It shall not be accepted by the City, and shall not become a part of the
maintenance program of the City of Staunton Storm Water Utility or the Public
Works Department. All maintenance responsibility and liability shall be and
remain with the owner of the parcel, their personal representatives, heirs,
grantees, successors, and assigns.
   2.   Owners, their personal representatives, heirs, grantees, successors,
and assigns shall indemnify and hold harmless the City of Staunton, its
officers, agents, and employees from and against any and all claims, actions,
causes of action, judgments, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including
attorney’s fees) arising out of or resulting from the construction,
installation, maintenance, or operation of the storm water improvement/BMP.
G.   Continuity
Storm water service charges and associated credits (if applicable) run with the
real estate upon which the storm water improvement/BMP has been constructed and
shall be binding upon the owner of the parcel on which they are located, their
personal representatives, heirs, grantees, successors, and assigns, so long as
the drainage facility and/or improvement or any part of it shall be used by
them. At such time as the storm water improvement/BMP that earned the credit
shall cease to be operated and maintained so as to be effective, the credit
shall immediately terminate. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the
parcel at the time such improvement/BMP ceases to be operated and/or maintained
to so advise the City’s Director of Public Works. If such owner fails to
provide such notice, such owner shall be liable and responsible for the storm
water service fee that would have applied from the date of such cessation, plus
the fine then is effect for a violation of the City’s ordinances.

The boundaries of the listed zoning districts are hereby established as shown
on the zoning map of this municipality. The zoning map, including all notations
and other information thereon, is hereby made a part of this Code by reference.
Official copies of the zoning map shall be kept on file in the office of the
Zoning Administrator or other appropriate official.
   (A)   Annual Publication. In accordance with State Law (Ill. Comp. Stats.,
Chap. 65, Section 5/11-13-19), the Administrator shall publish the City's
zoning map not later than March 31st of each year. However, no map shall be
published for any calendar year during which there have been no changes in
zoning districts or regulations.
   (B)   Determining Territory of Districts With Precision. In determining with
precision what territory is actually included within any zoning district, the
Zoning Administrator shall apply the following rules:
      (1)    Where a district boundary as indicated on the Zoning Map
approximately follows the features listed below on the left, the corresponding
feature on the right shall be deemed the district boundary:
 
(a) Center line of any street, alley or highway Such centerline.
(b) Lot line                                    Such lot line.
(c) Railroad tracks                             Right-of-way line of such track
      (2)   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is legally vacated,
the zoning districts adjoining each side of such vacated public way shall
automatically extend to the center of such way, and all territory included in
the vacated way shall thereafter be subject to all regulations of the extended
districts.
      (3)   All territory (including bodies of water) that lies within the
zoning jurisdiction of this municipality, but which is not shown on the zoning
map as being located within any district, shall comply with the zoning
regulations of the most restrictive adjoining district.
40-3-3 GENERAL PROHIBITION.
No structure or part thereof shall be erected, used, occupied, enlarged,
altered, relocated or reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of
this Code. Similarly, no lot or part thereof shall be used, occupied, or
developed except in conformity with the provisions of this Code.
   (A)   AGRICULTURAL EXEMPTION. The provisions of this Code shall not be
interpreted or administered so as to restrict the erection, maintenance,
alteration, or extension of buildings (including farmhouses) or structures used
or intended to be used for agricultural purposes on agricultural land except
that such buildings or structures shall be required to conform to applicable
setback regulations. Whenever a portion of a tract of land ceases to be used
primarily for agricultural purposes, all pertinent provisions of this Code
shall apply to that portion.
40-3-4 UNLISTED USES PROHIBITED.
Whenever any use is not specifically listed as permitted or special within a
particular zoning district, such use shall be deemed prohibited in that
district. However, if the City Council, following consultation with the Zoning
Administrator finds that the unlisted use is similar to and compatible with the
listed uses, they may amend this Code in accordance with Section
40-8-3 to allow such use. The Council's decision shall become a permanent
public record, and any unlisted use that they approve shall thereafter have the
same status as listed uses.
40-3-5 TEMPORARY USES.
Except as specifically provided otherwise in this Code, no temporary structure
shall be used or occupied for any purpose, and no land shall be used for any
temporary enterprise, whether for profit or not-for-profit, unless a temporary

to one thousand (1,000) square feet or the first floor square footage of the
house, whichever is smaller, as well as a shed which is two hundred (200)
square feet or less. As both of these structures are classified as "accessory",

accessory buildings may not be constructed on a vacant parcel; or one (1)
principal building with attached garage or one (1) principal building with a
customary detached garage and one (1) detached accessory building shall be
permitted on any residential lot with adherence to all defined setbacks, space

the front setback requirements of the district in which it is located on every
side having frontage.

bounded by the street lines that are thirty (30) feet from the point of
intersection, no obstruction, whether natural or man-made, shall intrude into

ARTICLE VI - NONCONFORMITIES
40-6-1 PURPOSE OF ARTICLE.
The requirements imposed by this Code are designed to guide the use of land by
encouraging the development of structures and uses that are compatible with the
predominant character of each of the various residential, business, and
industrial districts. Lots, structures, and uses of land or structures that do
not conform to the requirements of the district in which they are located
impede appropriate development. For example, nonconformities are frequently
responsible for heavy traffic on residential streets, the over-taxing of
parking facilities, the emission of noxious fumes or excessive noise, and/or
the lowering of property values. The regulations in this Article are intended
to alleviate such existing/potential problems by encouraging the gradual
elimination of nonconformities.
40-6-2 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
Any vacant lot that does not conform to one or more of the lot size
requirements of the district in which it is located may be used in the manner
indicated at Sections
40-6-3 and
40-6-4 if it:
   (A)   Is of record on the date of the adoption or amendment of this Code;
and
   (B)   Has continuously remained in separate ownership from abutting tracts
of land throughout the entire period during which the creation of such lot was
prohibited by the applicable zoning code or other ordinances; and
   (C)   Is at least thirty (30) feet wide.
40-6-3 SAME: RESIDENTIAL.
On any such lot located in any district, any permitted structures may be
erected, provided all the bulk (see definitions) and setback regulations of the
particular district are observed.
40-6-4 SAME: OTHER DISTRICTS.
On any such lot located in the business or industrial districts, any structure
permitted in the particular district may be erected if the bulk and setback
requirements of that district are met.
40-6-5 TWO OR MORE LOTS IN COMMON OWNERSHIP.
If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage were of record and in common ownership on the date of the
enactment or amendment of this Code, and if one or more of those lots do not
meet the minimum lot width, depth, and area requirements of the district in
which they are located, the land involved shall be considered an undivided
parcel for purposes of this Code. No portion of any such parcel shall be
developed except in compliance with this Code, nor shall any such parcel be
divided so as to create a lot that does not meet the requirements of this Code.
40-6-6 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
Any lawful structure which exists on the date of the enactment or amendment of
this Code, but which could not be erected under the terms of this Code because
of restrictions on lot size, height, setbacks, lot coverage, or other
characteristics of the structure, or its location on the lot, may lawfully
remain, subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   Enlargement, Alterations. No such structure shall be enlarged or
altered in any way which increases its nonconformity.
   (B)   Relocation. No such structure shall be relocated unless, after
relocation, it will conform to all the regulations of the district in which it
is located.
   (C)   Reconstruction. No such structure which is destroyed or damaged by any
means shall be reconstructed if the Zoning Administrator determines that the
cost of such reconstruction exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the structure's
market value at the time of loss, unless after reconstruction the structure
will conform to all applicable regulations of the district in which it is
located. In the event the Zoning Administrator deter-mines the estimated cost
of reconstruction is less than fifty percent (50%) of the structure's market
value at the time of loss, repairs or reconstruction shall be permitted,
provided such work starts within six (6) months from the date the damage
occurred and is diligently prosecuted to completion.
A bona fide construction contractor shall make the reconstruction cost
estimate, and a licensed real estate appraiser shall determine the structure's
market value at the time of loss. The owner of the damaged structure shall be
responsible for transmitting these estimates to the Zoning Administrator.
(Effective June 1, 1993)
40-6-7 NONCONFORMING USES: OCCUPYING A STRUCTURE.
If any lawful use occupying a structure exists on the date of the enactment or
amendment of this Code, but would not be allowed under the terms of this Code,
such a use may lawfully continue, subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   Maintenance. Any structure housing a nonconforming use may be
maintained through ordinary repairs.

housing a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, structurally altered,
reconstructed or relocated unless the use of the structure is changed to a
permitted use.

of the structure not intended or designed to be devoted to such use, nor shall
the nonconforming use be extended to occupy any land outside such structure.

a structure and premises in combination, is discontinued for twelve (12)
consecutive months, it shall not thereafter be resumed, and any subsequent use

discontinuance caused by government action and without any contributing fault
by the nonconforming user shall not be counted in calculating the length of
discontinuance.

For information specific to mobile homes refer to Section
40-4-12(A).
Any lawful use of land existing on the date of the adoption or amendment (June
1, 1993) of this Code that would not be permitted under the terms of this Code
may lawfully continue, subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   Intensification or Extension of Use. A nonconforming use of land shall
not be intensified, or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was
occupied by such use on the date of the adoption or amendment of this Code.
   (B)   Relocation. No nonconforming use of land shall be moved, in whole or
in part, unless, upon relocation, such use will conform to all pertinent
regulations of the district in which it will be located.
   (C)   Change of Use. A nonconforming use of land shall not be changed except
to a use that is permitted under the applicable district regulations.

contributing fault by the owner or operator shall not be counted in calculating
the length of discontinuance.
40-6-9 NONCONFORMITIES UNDER PERMIT AUTHORITY.
The regulations of this Article shall not apply to any change in an existing
structure or to any change in the use of structure or of land for which a
permit was issued prior to the enactment of this Code or any pertinent

   (A)   CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER. To secure compliance with this Code, the
Administrator may issue a corrective action order. Such order shall be deemed
properly served upon the owner, occupant, or operator of the offending lot,
structure, or use if it is served upon such party personally, sent by
registered mail to his last known address, or posted in a conspicuous place on
or about the affected premises. Corrective action orders shall include:

temporary certificate of zoning compliance was issued, the Administrator may
order that such work be stopped immediately. The Administrator's stop-work
order may be served on any person engaged in or responsible for such work, or
may be posted in a conspicuous place on or about the affected premises. Failure
to abide by a stop-work order shall be deemed a separate violation of this
Code.
40-7-6 EMERGENCY MEASURES.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, whenever the Administrator
determines that any violation of this Code poses an imminent peril to life or
property, he may institute, without notice or hearing, any necessary

Administrator shall record such complaints, immediately investigate, and, if
necessary, institute appropriate corrective measures.

   (A)   Failure to comply with any provision of this Code shall constitute a
misdemeanor, and each day that such violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense.
   (B)   Any person who is convicted of a violation of this Code shall be fined
not more than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) each day the violation exists, and/
or six (6) months confinement. Daily fine assessment shall begin on the first
day the violator is notified of the violation and may be waived if compliance
is met within thirty (30) days of notification.
   (C)   Nothing contained in this Section shall prevent this Municipality from
taking any other lawful action that may be necessary to secure compliance with
this Code. All legal fees incurred by the City in the legal enforcement of the
Code shall be reimbursed to the City by the violator. (Ord. No. 1120; 04-13-98)

plan shall be maintained on file with the City clearly noting all conditions of
approval and the date approved for issuance of a permit. If the application is
denied by the City Council, the applicant shall not again apply for a permit
for substantially the same proposal unless there has occurred a substantial
change in circumstances the basis of which shall be specifically noted on the
supplemental application, and in such case, only with the Hearing Officer’s
consent first obtained, otherwise not earlier than one (1) year after the date
of the denial by the City Council. If the application is referred back for

directions of the Hearing Officer, if any, otherwise in time for the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the Hearing Officer.

complied with. The Hearing Officer may, however, allow modifications of the
final plan, before completion, in conformity with the applicable provisions for
review as provided for in this Article.

   (B)   By publication in a newspaper of general circulation within this
municipality. This notice shall indicate the time, date, and place of the
hearing, the particular location for which the special use permit is requested,
and the nature of the proposed special use.
40-8-5 FACTORS CONSIDERED.
In making his/her advisory recommendation to the City Council, the Hearing
Officer shall consider and make findings of fact, where appropriate, on the
following factors:
   (A)   Whether the proposed design, location and manner of operation of the

purposes of this Code; and
   (G)   Whether the proposed application is consistent with the
characteristics of the general nature of the area in which the special use is
to be located.
(Ord. No. 1483; 04-27-09)

plan and shall not be modified, nor shall any additions be made thereto, except

Notice of the public hearing shall be given not more than thirty (30) nor less

hearing, may by simple majority vote, approve or reject any proposed variance,
or may refer it back to the Hearing Officer for further consideration. A
certified copy of the City Council’s decision shall be transmitted to the
