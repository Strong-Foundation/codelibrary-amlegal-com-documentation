penalty being enforced.

penalty specifically declared for such breach, the provisions of this chapter
shall apply. (1997 Code)

   (a) Any fine, other sanction, or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other
sanction, or costs imposed, remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of, or the
failure to exhaust, judicial review procedures under the Administrative Review
Law shall be a debt due and owing the municipality and, as such, may be
collected in accordance with applicable law.
   (b) After expiration of the period within which judicial review under the
Administrative Review Law may be sought for a final determination of the code
violation, the municipality may commence a proceeding in the circuit court of
the county in which the municipality is located for purpose of obtaining a
judgment on the findings, decision, and order. Nothing in this Section shall

orders against a person in such a proceeding. Upon commencement of the action,
the municipality shall file a certified copy of the findings, decision, and
order, which shall be accompanied by a certification that recites facts
sufficient to show that the findings, decision, and order was issued in
accordance with this Division and the applicable municipal ordinance. Service

receipt requested, provided that the total amount of fines, other sanctions,
and costs imposed by the findings, decision, and order does not exceed $2,500.
If the court is satisfied that the findings, decision, and order was entered in
accordance with the requirements of this Division and the applicable municipal
ordinance and that the defendant had an opportunity for a hearing under this
Division and for judicial review as provided in this Division:
    (1) The court shall render judgment in favor of the municipality and
against the defendant for the amount indicated in the findings, decision and
order, plus costs. The judgment shall have the same effect and may be enforced
in the same manner as other judgments for the recovery of money.
    (2) The court may also issue any other orders and injunctions that are
requested by the municipality to enforce the order of the hearing officer to
correct a code violation.
   (c) In place of a proceeding under subsection (b) of this Section, after
expiration of the period in which judicial review under the Illinois
Administrative Review Law may be sought for a final determination of a code
violation, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the findings,
decision, and order of the hearing officer may be enforced in the same manner
as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   In any case in which a defendant has failed to comply with a judgment
ordering a defendant to correct a code violation or imposing any fine or other
sanction as a result of a code violation, any expenses incurred by a
municipality to enforce the judgment, including, but not limited to, attorney's
fees, court costs, and costs related to property demolition or foreclosure,
after they are fixed by a court of competent jurisdiction or a hearing officer,
shall be a debt due and owing the municipality and may be collected in
accordance with applicable law. Prior to any expenses being fixed by a hearing
officer pursuant to this subsection (c), the municipality shall provide notice
to the defendant that states that the defendant shall appear at a hearing
before the administrative hearing officer to determine whether the defendant
has failed to comply with the judgment. The notice shall set the date for such
a hearing, which shall not be less than 7 days from the date that notice is
served. If notice is served by mail, the 7-day period shall begin to run on the
date that the notice was deposited in the mail.
   Upon being recorded in the manner required by Article XII of the Code of
Civil Procedure or by the Uniform Commercial Code, a lien shall be imposed on
the real estate or personal estate, or both, of the defendant in the amount of
any debt due and owing the municipality under this Section. The lien may be
enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction.
   A hearing officer may set aside any judgment entered by default and set a
new hearing date, upon a petition filed within 21 days after the issuance of
the order of default, if the hearing officer determines that the petitioner's
failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause or at any time if the
petitioner establishes that the municipality did not provide proper service of
process. If any judgment is set aside pursuant to this subsection (c), the
hearing officer shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien
which has been recorded for any debt due and owing the municipality as a result
of the vacated default judgment.

6-7-13: DERELICT AND ABANDONED VEHICLES:
   A.   City Policy:
      1.   Findings: The city council finds that derelict and abandoned
vehicles constitute a safety hazard and a public nuisance; are detrimental to
the health, safety and welfare of the general public by harboring disease,
providing breeding places for vermin, inviting plundering, creating fire
hazards, and presenting physical dangers to children and others; produce scenic
blights which degrade the environment and adversely affect land values and the
proper maintenance and continuing development of the city; represent a resource
out of place and an energy loss to the city economy, and require municipal
government attention, in order to assure the expeditious removal and recycling
of the derelict and abandoned vehicles.
      2.   Declaration: The city council declares, therefore, that it is the
policy of the city to:
         a.   Prohibit the abandonment of vehicles and the retention of
derelicts, and to enforce such prohibition by law while reminding vehicle
owners of their own individual responsibility to dispose of such vehicles.
         b.   Encourage the development of procedures and techniques to
facilitate the expeditious removal of derelict and abandoned vehicles from
public or private premises.

person reasonably believes to be personalty.

been remedied within the seven (7) day period of compliance, or in the event

premises. It shall be unlawful for any person to interfere with, hinder or
refuse to allow such person to enter upon private property for the purpose of
removing a vehicle under the provisions of this section.

   B.   Additional City Review Of Applications Of Telecommunications Retailers:
      1.   Pursuant to section 4 of the telephone company act, 220 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 65/4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the city
that it intends to commence work governed by this article for facilities for
the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of
plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the
purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the
telecommunications retailer to the city not less than ten (10) days prior to
the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30)
days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The city director
of public works shall specify the portion of the right of way upon which the

such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within
either: a) ten (10) days after service of notice to the city by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for
new construction, or b) twenty five (25) days after service of notice by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new
construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without
obtaining a permit under this article.
      3.   Upon the provision of such specification by the city, where a permit
is required for work pursuant to section
7-1A-4 of this article the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the city
an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of subsection B1 of this
section. (Ord. 14-01, 8-27-2001)
7-1A-6: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
   A.   Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this article on city rights of way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights of way.
   B.   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the city
does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the
city and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. 14-01, 8-27-2001)
7-1A-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:

material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within ninety (90) days
after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this article, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with section
7-1A-21 of this article. If the city denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right of way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor. (Ord. 14-01, 8-27-2001)
7-1A-8: INSURANCE:

be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or
umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   C.   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the city within ten (10) days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the city.
   D.   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies

later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   E.   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The
legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies required by this section
shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the
recovery of any amounts thereunder. (Ord. 14-01, 8-27-2001)
7-1A-9: INDEMNIFICATION:
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right of way, a utility shall be
deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the city and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this article or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
article by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. (Ord. 14-01, 8-27-2001)
7-1A-10: SECURITY FUND:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this article;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this article; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this article including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this article to perform that the city must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this article or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the state
of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the city director of public works, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are likely
to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the city director of
public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The city, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the
fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund,
the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the city with respect to the
security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved
by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or
exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other
right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city shall not be
entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which
may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 14-01, 8-27-2001)

article.
      1.   Application For Tree Trimming Permit: Applications for tree trimming
permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent
workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      2.   Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The city will require
compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without
authorization. The formula developed by the international society of
arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The city may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   B.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The city may require
that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special
significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, sidearm
extensions, covered wire or other means.

decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this article
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The city director of public works
may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the city director of public works may require the
utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this article but which carry
out the purposes of this article. (Ord. 14-01, 8-27-2001)

7-1A-23: PENALTIES:
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this article shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the city will
incur delay or other costs, including third-party claims, because the utility
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this article. Unless
the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the city's costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility who
does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. 14-01, 8-27-2001)

show proof of grease containers being serviced (dumped) on a regular basis. In
no event should such services be less than once every two (2) weeks.
         c.   Grease Interceptors: Where it has been determined that a grease
interceptor is not being maintained and serviced as intended by this code and
the manufacturer's instructions, an approved interceptor monitoring system
shall be provided or a maintenance program shall be established with
documentation submitted to the code official. The city inspector, public works
director or his designee shall be allowed to inspect at any time premises
covered by this subsection. (Ord. 0-10-14, 7-28-2014)
   G.   Owner Expense: Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing
facilities are provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at owner's expense.
   H.   Control Manhole Required: When required by the city, the owner of any
property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall be
required to install a control manhole and, when required by the city, the owner
of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall
install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and
other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling
and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly
and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved
by the city. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at owner's expense,
and shall be maintained by owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
When agreed upon by the city and the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes, a water meter approved by the city
shall be installed, at the expense of the owner if none exists for the purpose
of measuring the volume of water consumed by said user and subsequently
discharged to the sewer system. The volume of water consumed as measured by the
water meter shall be used to compute the volume portion of the surcharge to be
charged said owner in lieu of the requirement of the necessary meter for
measurement of actual wastes discharged. However, the requirement for a control
manhole, and the necessary appurtenances required to facilitate observation and
sampling of wastes, shall not be construed as to be waived by the installation
of said water meter unless so stipulated by the city.
   I.   Requirements For Oil Separators:

intervals as required to prevent the material from entering the sewer system.
      3.   A list of all separators required by subsection I1 of this section
shall be furnished to the fire chief who shall cause regular periodic
inspections to be made of the units to determine and assure their proper
cleaning and maintenance.
   J.   Waste Sampling: At the request of the city, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall provide
laboratory measurement tests and analyses of waters and wastes to illustrate
compliance with this chapter and any special conditions for discharge
established by the city or regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the
discharge.
The number, type and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed by the
owner shall be as stipulated by the city but no less than once per year, the
industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater
discharge to assure that compliance with the Federal, State and local standards
are being met. The owner shall report the results of measurements and
laboratory analyses to the City at such times and in such manner as prescribed
by the City. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses and
reporting required by the City. At such times as deemed necessary, the City
reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside
laboratory service.
   K.   Measurement Of Water Characteristics: All measurements, tests and
analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made
in this Chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of
"Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater", published by
the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control
manhole provided or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the
event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the
point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and
property. (The particular analysis involved will determine whether a 24-hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples.)
   L.   Special Agreement And/Or Arrangements Authorized: No statement
contained in this Section shall be construed as preventing any special
agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial concern whereby an
industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the City
for treatment, subject to payment therefor in accordance with Section
8-2-4-1 of this Chapter, by the industrial concern, provided such payments are
in accordance with Federal and State guidelines for user charge system and
industrial cost recovery system. (1997 Code)
8-2-3-6: PROTECTION OF SEWAGE WORKS FROM DAMAGE:

or within ten feet (10') of a water or storm sewer line.
      4.   If a sewer service line is constructed with changes in direction of
the line approximately ninety degrees (90°), any such change shall be
constructed using "loop sweep bends" of not greater than forty five degrees
(45°) change in direction. If an abrupt ninety degree (90°) bend cannot be
avoided, a manhole or cleanout shall be constructed at that point to make
possible rodding the sewer in case of blockage.
   G.   Inspection, Approval Of Service Lines: No part of a sewer service line
shall be covered until inspected and approved by an authorized inspector of the
City.
   H.   Service Lines Property Of Owner: Sewer service lines shall be and shall
remain the property of the owner of the lot or parcel or real estate being
served, and any required repairs, maintenance or cleaning shall be the
responsibility of said property owner. Should, at some future time, the sewer
service line be found to be defective, permitting the introduction of storm or
ground water into the system, the line shall be repaired at the property
owner's expense so that such entry is stopped.
   I.   Method Of Connecting Sewer Lines: Connection of sewer service lines to
the City sewers shall be at the tee or wye connection in the line.
Indiscriminate breaking into the sewer main will not be allowed. If there is no
tee or wye set in the main line, one of the following methods shall be used:

8-2-4: WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES; INDUSTRIAL WASTE COST RECOVERY:
8-2-4-1: WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES:
   A.   Basis For Wastewater Service Charges:
      1.   Wastewater Service Charge: The wastewater service charge for the use
of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city shall
consist of a basic user charge for operation and maintenance plus replacement,
a debt service charge, and a surcharge if applicable.
      2.   Debt Service Charge: The debt service charge shall be the amount to
be paid each billing period for payment of interest, principal and coverage of
bond which includes payments to be made in the various reserve accounts as
required by the bond ordinance and shall be computed by dividing the annual
debt service by the number of users connected to the wastewater facilities.
      3.   Basic User Charge: The basic user charge shall be a monthly rate for
each sanitary sewer connection having the following normal concentrations:
- A five (5) day, twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD) of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l).
- A suspended solids (SS) content of two hundred fifty milligrams per liter
(250 mg/l).
It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and
depreciation and shall be computed as follows:
- Estimate the projected annual revenues required to operate and maintain the
wastewater facilities, including a replacement and depreciation fund for the
year, for all works categories.
- Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories by volume,
suspended solids and BOD, if possible.
- Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to be treated.
- Proportion the estimated costs to nonindustrial and industrial users by
volume, suspended solids and BOD.
- Compute costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons for normal sewage strength.
- Compute surcharge costs per pound of BOD and SS in excess of normal sewage
strength.
      4.   Surcharge: A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters
exceed the normal concentrations for BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (250 mg/l). The
surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or
concentration for BOD and SS respectively. Subsection 8-2-4-2G of this chapter
specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.
      5.   Annual Review: The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall
be reviewed annually by certified public accountants for the city in their
annual audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be revised
periodically to reflect a change in debt service or a change in operation and
maintenance costs, including replacement and depreciation costs.
   B.   Measurement Of Flow (When Applicable): The volume of flow used for
computing surcharges shall be metered water consumption read to the lowest even
increments of one hundred (100) gallons.
      1.   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his/her water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall install and maintain, at his/her expense, water meters of a type approved
by the city for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from
these other sources.
      2.   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the city if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered
water consumption records.
      3.   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the city.
   C.   Debt Service Charge: A debt service charge of five dollars ($5.00) per
month to each user of the wastewater facility of the city is hereby
established.

(1997 Code)
8-2-4-2: INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY:
   A.   Industrial Cost Recovery Required: Each industrial user shall pay that
portion of any state grant which has been obtained for the financing of the
construction of wastewater treatment works allocable to the treatment of the
wastewater from such user. Such user's share shall not include an interest
component.
   B.   Basis For Industrial Cost Recovery Charges: The ICR charge for the use
of and for the service supplied by the wastewater facilities shall consist of a
unit charge for actual process flow (Vu); and unit charges for actual BOD (Bi)
and SS (Si) contained in the process flow.
The actual process flow shall be the volume of flow as determined in subsection
8-2-4-1B of this Chapter less an allowance for employee flow and water consumed
in production.
The actual concentration of BOD and SS used for computing the ICR charge shall
be established by waste sampling in accordance with subsections 8-2-3-5J and K
of this Chapter.
   C.   Determination Of Unit Charges: The ICR unit charges, for all industrial
users serviced by the wastewater facilities of the City shall be determined as
follows:
      1.   Allocate the EPA grant amount to the three (3) treatment parameters,
flow, BOD and SS.
      2.   Divide the total for each parameter by the recovery period.
      3.   Divide the totals obtained in subsection C2 above by their
respective annual element of plant design.
The ICR unit charges shall be as follows:
a. Unit Flow (Vu) ICR Charge:
   $13,470.00/year
   365,000,000 gal/yr = $0.037/1,000 gallons
b. Unit BOD (Bi) ICR Charge:
   $11,482.00/year
   608,820 lbs/yr     = $0.0190/lb.
c. Unit SS (Si) ICR Charge:
   $12,570.00/year
   761,000            = $0.0166/lb.
 
In addition to the above, the ICR unit charges, for all industrial users within
the corporate limits of the City serviced by the City's wastewater facilities
shall be determined as follows:
a. Federal Grant Annual Cost =
   $1,455,500.00 ÷ 30 years = $48,516.67
b. Federal Grant Daily Cost =
   $48,516.67 ÷ 365 days = $132.92
c. Design Load =
   Capacity of the 2 interceptor sewers are:
   .70 MGD + 1.00 MGD = 1.7 MGD
d. Design Capacity Unit Cost =
   $132.92 ÷ 1,700,000 = $0.078/1,000 gal
 
Summary: The overall industrial cost recovery charge for industry served within
the corporate limits of the City will, therefore, be:
Volume = $0.37/1,000 gal + $0.078/1,000 gal = $0.115/1,000 gal
BOD    = $0.0190/lb.
SS     = $0.0166/lb.
 
D.   Cost For Industrial User: The cost to be recovered from an industrial user
(ICR) shall be determined by the following formula:
       ICR   = Vu ($Qi) + Bi ($BODi) + Si ($SSi)
where: ICR   = Industrial cost recovery charge to each industrial user
       Vu    = Wastewater volume, in 1,000 gallons, from industrial user for
               monthly billing period
       Bi    = BOD in pounds from industrial user process wastewater
       Si    = SS in pounds from industrial user process wastewater
       $Q    = Industrial cost recovery rate per 1,000 gallons of process
               wastewater volume = $0.037/1,000 gallons
       $BODI = Industrial cost recovery rate per pound for BOD = $0.0190/lb.
       $SSi  = Industrial cost recovery rate per pound for SS = $0.0166/lb.
 
The BOD in pounds from process wastewater or "Bi" shall be computed as follows:
       Bi   = Vu x BODu x 0.00834
where: BODu = Total BOD in mg/l, from process wastewater as determined by waste
              sampling
 
The SS in pounds from process wastewater or "Si" shall be computed as follows:
       Si  = Vu x SSu x 0.00834
where: SSu = Total SS in mg/l, from process wastewater as determined by waste
             sampling
 
E. Charge For Industrial Cost Recovery: Each year during the industrial cost
recovery period, each industrial user of the treatment works shall pay the cost
recovery amount determined by subsection D above for such industry. Where an
industry is connected to a public sewer after the start up of the facilities
constructed under a State grant, such industry shall only pay its portion of
the State grant for each month remaining in the recovery period. Such industry
will not be required to pay for those months of the recovery period prior to
connection to a public sewer.
F. Length Of Industrial Cost Recovery Period: The industrial cost recovery
period shall be equal to the useful life of the treatment works which shall be
thirty (30) years after the start up of the wastewater treatment facilities.
G. Payments And Billing Periods For Industrial Cost Recovery: For the purpose
of industrial cost recovery, the year shall be divided into monthly periods,
such periods to correspond to the water billing periods and all industrial
users of the City shall pay the cost as determined by this Chapter for
industrial cost recovery and such payments shall be made monthly on the ninth
day of the month immediately following the expiration of the monthly period for
which service has been supplied, and such charge shall be payable within
fifteen (15) days after rendition thereof, and in the event such bills are not
paid within said fifteen (15) days, a service charge of ten percent (10%) shall
be added thereto.
H. Delinquency And Termination Of Service: In the event the charges for
industrial cost recovery are not paid within sixty (60) days after the
rendition of that bill, then such service charges shall be deemed and are
hereby declared to be delinquent, and thereafter such delinquent charge shall
constitute a lien upon the real estate for which such sewer services were
supplied. The City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed each month to file
sworn statements showing such delinquencies in the office of the Recorder of
Deeds of Henry County, Illinois, and the filing of such statements shall be
deemed notice of a lien for the payment of such charges for sewer service. If
the delinquency in the payment of the recovery cost continues for a period of
more than sixty (60) days, the sewer service shall be discontinued.
I. Time Of First Payment: The initial payment made by an industrial user which
is connected to a public sewer after the start up of the treatment works
constructed with a State grant shall be made by the next scheduled due date as
defined in subsection G of this Section.
J. Adjustment Of Charge Due To Strength Of Volume Changes: If there is a change
in the strength and/or volume introduced into the treatment works by an
industrial user as determined by waste sampling and/or the previous years'
records, the City shall adjust the user's waste characteristic used in
calculating the ICR charge accordingly.
K. Adjustment Of Charge Due To Plant Improvement Utilizing State Grant Funds:
If there is an expansion or upgrading of the treatment works utilizing a State
grant, each existing industrial user's share shall be adjusted accordingly.
L. No Charge For Unused Or Unreserved Capacity: An industrial user's portion of
any State grant shall not include any portion of the grant amount allocable to
unused or reserved capacity.
M. Commitment For Increased Use: An industrial user's portion of any State
grant shall include allowance for the cost of any firm commitment to the City
for any increased use by such user.
N. Payment To State Required: The City shall retain fifty percent (50%) of the
amounts recovered from industrial users. The remainder, together with any
interest earned thereon, shall be returned to the State Anti-Pollution Fund on
an annual basis.
O. Disposition Of Retained Amounts: Eighty percent (80%) of the retained
amounts, together with interest earned thereon, shall be used solely for
eligible costs of the expansion or reconstruction of treatment works associated
with the project and necessary to meet the requirements of the Federal Act and
the State. The City, prior to commitment of the retained amounts, shall obtain
written approval of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency for any
expansion or reconstruction. The remainder of the retained amounts may be used
for such expenditures as the City deems appropriate.
P. Investment Of Retained Amounts Required: Pending use, the City shall invest
the retained amounts for reconstruction and expansion in:
1. Obligations of the U.S. Government; or
2. Obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government

Official Map. Thus this Title assists in achieving the following specific
objectives:
   A.   To preserve, protect, and promote the public health, safety, and
welfare;
   B.   To provide a pleasant living environment by furthering the orderly
layout and use of land; and to create an environment conducive to the
productive development of the City;
   C.   To avoid legal and other problems by requiring that subdivided land be
properly monumented and recorded;
   D.   To conserve and increase the value of land, improvements, and
buildings;

extent;
   F.   To provide adequate light, air, and privacy for all residents of new
developments by preventing undue concentration of population;
   G.   To protect against injury or damage caused by fire, pollution,
flooding, storm water runoff, or erosion and sedimentation;
   H.   To provide safe and convenient access to new developments and to avoid
traffic congestion by requiring the proper location, design, and construction
of streets and sidewalks;
   I.   To reduce the cost of installing and maintaining adequate water mains,
sanitary sewers, storm water sewers, and other utilities and services; and
   J.   To ensure that adequate parks, schools, and similar facilities can be

11-1-2: JURISDICTION:
This Title shall be applicable within the corporate limits of the City and
within all unincorporated territory located within one and one-half (1.5) miles
of said limits, provided such territory is not located within the subdivision
jurisdiction for another municipality 1 . (Ord. 99-01, 1-25-1999)
 
Notes
1 1. See 65 ILCS 5/11-12-9 for State requirements concerning jurisdictional
  boundary lines.
11-1-3: INTERPRETATION:
Every provision of this Title shall be construed liberally to achieve the
purposes outlined in Section
11-1-1 of this Chapter.
   A.   More Restrictive Requirements Apply: Whenever the requirements of this
Title differ from those of any statute, lawfully adopted ordinance or
regulation, easement, covenant, or deed restriction, the more stringent
requirement shall prevail. Thus, in accordance with State law 1 , whenever this
Title imposes higher standards than the County subdivision ordinance, said
higher standards shall supersede the County regulations in the unincorporated
territory located within the City's subdivision jurisdiction.
This Title is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, deed
restriction, or any other private agreement or restriction; provided, that,
where the provisions of this Title are more restrictive or impose higher
standards or regulations than such easement, covenant, deed restriction, or
other private agreement or restriction, the provisions of this Title shall
govern. Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, deed restriction, or
private agreement or restriction impose duties and obligations more
restrictive, or higher standards than the requirements of this Title or the
determinations of the City in approving a subdivision or in enforcing this
Title, and such private provisions are not inconsistent with this Title or
determinations thereunder, then such private provisions shall be operative and
supplemental to this Title and determinations made thereunder. The City does
not purport to enforce any such private provisions not reflected on the plat
and its supporting documents and unless there is expressed in the nature of the
document and the approval process an intent to give the City enforcement rights
over same. (Ord. 99-01, 1-25-1999)

officer, board member, agent, or employee of the City shall render himself
personally liable for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a
result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his duties under
this Title 1 .
   B.   Any suit brought against any officer, board member, agent, or employee
of the City, as a result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of
his duties under this Title, shall be defended by the City Attorney until the
final determination of the legal proceedings. (Ord. 99-01, 1-25-1999)

11-1-5: VARIANCES:
When the subdivider can show that a provision of this Title, if strictly
adhered to, would cause the unnecessary hardship and when, in the opinion of
the City Plan Commission, because of topographical or other conditions peculiar
to the site, a departure may be made without destroying the intent of such
provision, the City Plan Commission may recommend a variance or modification to
the Council. The subdivider shall apply in writing for such variance or
modification of the action. Any variance or modification thus authorized, shall
be attached to and made a part of the final plat. (Ord. 99-01, 1-25-1999)

   A.   Horizontal Curvatures: All changes in horizontal alignment shall be
conducted with a horizontal curve with the following minimum center line
radius, designated "R":
      1.   For principal, minor and collector streets (design speed = 35 mph),
R shall equal five hundred feet (500');
      2.   For local streets (design speed = 30 mph), R shall equal one hundred
twenty five feet (125'); and
      3.   For alleys, R shall equal one hundred feet (100').
   B.   Through Traffic Discouraged: Marginal access and local streets shall be
laid out so as to discourage use by through traffic. The rigid rectangular
gridiron street pattern should be avoided, and the use of curvilinear streets,
cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped streets shall be encouraged to effect a more desirable
street layout.
   C.   Limited Access To Arterials: Where a subdivision abuts or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, the Planning Commission may recommend to
the City Council that access to said arterial may be limited by one of the
following means:
      1.   The subdivision of lots so that they back onto the arterial street
and front onto a parallel local street (double frontage lots), coupled with the
installation of screening in a reserve (access-restricting) strip along the
rear lot lines of such lots;
      2.   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered
from and generally at right angles to the arterial street; or
      3.   A frontage road separated from the arterial street by a planting
strip, but having access thereto at suitable points.
   D.   Dead-End Streets:
      1.   Temporary Stub Streets: Streets shall be so arranged to provide for
the continuation of streets between adjacent properties when such continuation
is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire and police
protection, and efficient provision of utilities, and where such continuation
comports with the Municipal Comprehensive Plan. If the adjacent property is
owned by the developer (under the same ownership) and undeveloped and the
street must dead-end temporarily, the right of way shall be extended to the
property line, and no strip that would prevent connections with future streets
shall be reserved. A temporary turnaround shall be provided at the terminus of
any temporary dead-end street. If the adjacent property is under another
ownership there should be a permanent dead-end.
      2.   Permanent Dead-End Streets: Cul-de-sacs shall have a maximum length
of seven hundred fifty feet (750'). A cul-de-sac turnaround, having a minimum
right of way diameter of ninety eight feet (98'), a minimum pavement return
radius of twenty five feet (25'), and a pavement diameter of seventy five feet
(75'), shall be provided at the end of every permanent dead-end street.
   E.   Alleys: Alleys shall be prohibited in single-family residence
districts. Alleys may be required in multiple-family districts and in
commercial/industrial districts unless other adequate provisions for service
access are made. Adequate vehicular turnaround space shall be provided at the
terminus of any dead-end alley.
   F.   Intersections:
      1.   Only Two Streets: Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at
any one point.
      2.   Right Angles: Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly
as possible at right angles; in no case shall two (2) streets intersect at an
angle of less that eighty degrees (80o) or more than one hundred degrees
(100o). An oblique street shall be curved approaching an intersection and shall
be approximately at right angles with said intersection for at least one
hundred feet (100') therefrom.
      3.   Alignment: Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing
street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on
the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with center line offsets of less
than one hundred twenty five feet (125') shall not be permitted, except where
the intersected street has divided lanes without median breaks at either
intersection. Intersections involving collector or arterial streets shall be at
least eight hundred feet (800') apart.
      4.   Curb Radii: To permit safe vehicular movement at corners, the
minimum curb radius at the intersection of two (2) streets shall be fifteen
feet (15') where both streets are marginal access or local and at other
intersections, not less than twenty five feet (25').
      5.   Grade: Intersections shall be designed with a minimum grade of 0.5%.
In hilly terrain, an area having not greater than a two percent (2%) slope for
a distance of sixty feet (60') from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street shall be provided at the approach to an intersection.
      6.   Cross-Slope: The cross-slopes of all streets, including
intersections, shall not exceed three percent (3%).
      7.   Adequate Sight Lines: Where any street intersection will involve
earth banks or existing vegetation, the developer shall cut such ground and/or
vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right
of way to the extent necessary to provide adequate sight distance in accordance
with the following chart:
      30 mph   130 feet each way from intersection
      35 mph   155 feet each way from intersection
For design speeds exceeding thirty five miles per hour (35 mph), sight distance
will be determined based upon AASHTO criteria.
   G.   Reverse Curves: A tangent at least fifty feet (50') long shall be
introduced between reverse curves on local streets and one hundred feet (100')
long on collector streets.
   H.   Road Dedications And Reservations And Improvements To Existing Streets:
      1.   New Perimeter Streets: Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an
existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The Planning
Commission may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves
and dedicates the entire required street right-of-way width within his own
subdivision boundaries.
      2.   Existing Roads: Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road
or when the Comprehensive Plan, Official Map, or zoning setback regulations
indicate plans for realignment or widening a road that would require use of
some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall be required to improve
and dedicate at his expense such areas for widening or realignment of such
roads as are specifically and uniquely attributable to his subdivision and to
reserve for public use any portion of the right of way determined not to be
specifically and uniquely attributable to his subdivision.
      3.   Excess Right Of Way: Right of way in excess of the standards set

(Ord. 99-01, 1-25-1999)
11-3-13: DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS:
   A.   Design Criteria: The Planning Commission shall not recommend the
approval of plat unless, the appropriate City official (ACO)
                                determines that the proposed provisions for
storm water drainage are adequate within boundaries of the subdivision.
Drainage improvements in the subdivision shall be coordinated with existing and
planned drainage improvements elsewhere so as to form an integrated City
system. The storm water drainage system shall be separate and independent of
the sanitary sewer system and shall meet the following design criteria:

constructed so that the majority of surface water shall be intercepted before
reaching the intersection, and not carried for a distance of more than four
hundred feet (400') of the pavement.
   C.   Accommodation Of Upstream Drainage Areas: A culvert or other drainage
facility large enough to accommodate potential runoff from the entire drainage
area upstream from the proposed subdivision shall be provided in accordance
with the City's standard specifications. Potential runoff shall be determined
on the basis of the maximum development of the upstream area that is permitted
or to be permitted under the Comprehensive Plan.
   D.   Areas Subject To Flooding: Whenever a plat is submitted for an area
that is subject to flooding, the City Council may require appropriate
protective measures, including the filling of the flood-prone area to a level
equal to the regulatory flood elevation, if any. (Ord. 99-01, 1-25-1999)
11-3-14: SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL:
In the development of any subdivision, the following erosion and sedimentation
control regulation shall be observed:
   A.   The developer shall protect the development site from soil erosion and
shall protect downstream property from sedimentation deposits during the
construction of the subdivision. Practices contained in "Procedures and
Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" shall
be employed in the preparation of an erosion and sedimentation control plan
which shall be approved by the City Engineer prior to any earth disturbing
activity taking place. (Ord. 99-01, 1-25-1999)
11-3-15: DEDICATIONS FOR PUBLIC USE:
The City Council may require the developer to dedicate (i.e., to transfer
without compensation) to the City or other appropriate governmental entity
suitable parcel(s) of land within the subdivision for public purposes provided
such facilities are otherwise required by this Title. Any such dedicated area
shall be shown on the final plat.
   A.   Reservations For Public Use: Besides requiring the developer to
dedicate parcels for public purposes, the City Council may require that he
reserve land for parks, playgrounds, schools, or other public purposes in
locations designated in the City's Comprehensive Plan. Since public acquisition
of reserved land requires compensation, it is not essential that the need for
such land be uniquely and specifically attributable to the subdivision 1 .
      1.   Adopted: There is hereby adopted an Official Map dated
                          , which shall be applicable to all land situated
within the City, and shall also be applicable to contiguous territory within
one and one-half (11/2) miles from the corporate limits of the City and not
included within the corporate limits of any other municipality. The Official
Map shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk and is made part of this
Title by reference.
      2.   Planned Public Improvements To Be Shown On Map: The Official Map may
show indication of sites for planned public facilities. Public facility sites
which may be indicated on the Official Map may include, but are not limited to:
sites for new trafficways or widening of existing trafficways; school sites;
recreational sites; public building sites; and sites for future storm drainage,
electrical or other public service or utility easements.
      3.   Availability Of Sites For Planned Public Improvements:
         a.   Whenever the Official Map indicates the necessity for providing a
site for a planned public facility, the Council may require that the site for
the public use be designated on the subdivision plat before granting approval
to such plat; and, furthermore, that the site be held for that specific public
use for a period of one year from the date of approval of the final plat. When
such designation has been required, the Council shall notify the responsible
public agency in writing of the designation within ten (10) days.
         b.   Whenever a site for public use, shown on the Official Map, has
been required to be indicated on a subdivision plat, the responsible agency
having jurisdiction of such use shall acquire the land so designated by
purchase or commence proceedings to acquire the land by condemnation within one
year from date of final approval of the plat; and, if it does not do so within
such period of one year, the land so designated may then be used by the owners
in any other manner consistent with this Chapter, the Zoning Ordinance, or any
other provision of this Code or other ordinance of the City.
      4.   Amendments Or Additions To The Official Map: Amendments to the
Official Map, including the indication of additional public sites to be shown
on the map, shall be considered amendments to this Title and therefore shall be
as specified in this Title for amendments to this Title. Any public agency
requesting the establishment of the Official Map of a future public site or
easement which is not included in the Comprehensive Plan, shall indicate to the
Plan Commission the need for the site in the particular location specified. The
Plan Commission, before making a favorable recommendation for the inclusion on
the Official Map of such site by the Council, shall find that this public site
location is determined to be necessary to provide public service consistent
with the Comprehensive Plan of the community and shall so indicate in its
minutes. (Ord. 99-01, 1-25-1999)

   C.   Ensure that the building protection requirements for all buildings
subject to section
13-1-7 of this chapter are met and maintain a record of the "as built"
elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) or floodproof certificate;
   D.   Assure that all subdivisions and annexations meet the requirements of
section
13-1-8 of this chapter;
   E.   Ensure that water supply and waste disposal systems meet the public

   M.   Perform site inspections to ensure compliance with this chapter and
make substantial damage determinations for structures within the floodplain;
and
   N.   Maintain the accuracy of floodplain maps including notifying IDNR/OWR
and/or submitting information to FEMA within six (6) months whenever a
modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in
a change to the floodplain map. (Ord. 0-25-10, 5-9-2011)
13-1-5: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the building inspector and zoning officer. The building
inspector and zoning officer shall not issue a development permit if the
proposed development does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
   A.   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
      1.   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      2.   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      3.   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to

   B.   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the building
inspector and zoning officer shall compare the elevation of the site to the
base flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown by
survey data to be higher than the current base flood elevation and which has
not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map is
not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to the requirements of this
chapter. Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base
flood elevation and hydraulically connected, but not shown on the current flood
insurance rate map, is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
The building inspector and zoning officer shall maintain documentation of the
existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this
ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance
rate map identification.
The building inspector and zoning officer shall be responsible for obtaining
from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits,
approvals or permit not required letters that may be required for this type of
activity. The building inspector and zoning officer shall not issue a permit
unless all other federal, state, and local permits have been obtained. (Ord. 0-

For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance
(including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be
maintained.
In addition, the city of Colona shall notify adjacent communities in writing
thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or
relocation of the watercourse. (Ord. 0-25-10, 5-9-2011)
13-1-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the planning commission or
zoning board of appeals for a variance. The planning commission or zoning board
of appeals shall review the applicant's request for a variance and shall submit
its recommendation to the city council. The city council may attach such
conditions to granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the
intent of this chapter.
   A.   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that all
of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities.
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP, and
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   B.   The planning commission or zoning board of appeals shall notify an
applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of the building
protection standards of section
13-1-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   C.   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
13-1-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
13-1-6 and
13-1-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure. (Ord. 0-25-10, 5-9-2011)
13-1-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the city of Colona or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 0-25-10, 5-9-2011)
13-1-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the zoning officer or
building inspector may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of
this chapter exists. The zoning officer or building inspector shall notify the
owner in writing of such violation.
   A.   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The city of Colona shall make application to the circuit court for
an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order
as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues, and
      4.   The city of Colona shall record a notice of violation on the title
of the property.
   B.   The zoning officer or building inspector shall inform the owner that
any such violation is considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and
therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be
suspended.
The zoning officer or building inspector is authorized to issue an order
requiring the suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall
be in writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the
action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work
order. The stop work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the zoning board of appeals. Written notice of such hearing
shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the zoning board of appeals
shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   C.   Nothing herein shall prevent the city of Colona from taking such other
lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 0-25-10, 5-
9-2011)
13-1-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city of
Colona to fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance program.
However, this chapter does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance
adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.
Where this chapter and other ordinances, easements, covenants or deed
restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 0-25-10, 5-9-2011)
