the Board of Trustees may attend any open or closed meeting of the Village
Board via electronic means (such as by video or audio conference) provided that
such attendance is in compliance with these rules and any applicable laws.
   (B)   Prerequisites. A member of the Board of Trustees may attend a meeting
electronically if the member meets the following conditions:
      (1)   The member shall notify the Village Clerk before the meeting,
unless advance notice is impractical, so that necessary communications
equipment can be arranged. Inability to make the necessary technical
arrangements will result in denial of a request for remote attendance.
      (2)   The member must assert one of the following three reasons why he or
she is unable to physically attend the meeting:
         (a)   The member cannot attend because of personal illness or
disability;
         (b)   The member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the
business of the village; or
         (c)   The member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency.
   (C)   Authorization to participate.
      (1)   The Village Clerk, after receiving the electronic attendance
request, shall inform the Board of Trustees of the request for electronic
attendance.
      (2)   After establishing that a quorum is physically present at a meeting
where a member of the Board desires to attend electronically, the presiding
officer shall state that (a) notice was received by the member of the Village
Board in accordance with these rules, and (b) the member will be deemed
authorized to attend the meeting electronically unless a motion objecting to
the member’s electronic attendance is made, seconded, and approved by a
majority of the members of the Village Board physically present at the meeting.
If no such motion is made and seconded, or if any such motion fails to achieve
the required vote by the members of the Village Board physically present at the
meeting, then the request by the member to attend the meeting electronically
shall be deemed approved by the Village Board and the presiding officer shall
declare the requesting member present. After such declaration by the presiding
officer, the question of a member’s electronic attendance may not be
reconsidered.
   (D)   Adequate equipment required. The member participating electronically
and other members of the Village Board must be able to communicate effectively,
and members of the audience must be able to hear all communications at the
meeting site. Before allowing electronic attendance at any meeting, the Village
Board shall provide equipment adequate to accomplish this objective at the
meeting site.
   (E)   Minutes. Any member attending electronically shall be considered an
off-site attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting if the
member is allowed to attend. The meeting minutes shall also reflect and state
specifically whenever a member is present by electronic means.
   (F)   Rights of remote member. A member permitted to attend electronically
will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting and participate
in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject to all
general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and adhered to.
The member attending electronically shall be heard, considered, and counted as
to any vote taken. Accordingly, the name of any member attending electronically
shall be called during any vote taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded
by the Village Clerk and placed in the minutes for the corresponding meeting. A
member attending electronically may leave a meeting and return as in the case
of any member, provided the member attending electronically shall announce his
or her leaving and returning.
   (G)   Committees, boards and commissions. These rules shall apply to all
committees, boards and commissions established by the village.

§ 32.111 COMMENCEMENT OF HEARINGS.
   (A)   (1)   A proceeding before a Hearing Officer shall be instituted upon
the filing with the Code Administrator of a written sworn pleading, complaint
or citation by any authorized official of the village, including police
officers, code enforcement officers and such other employees as authorized.
      (2)   In the event a complaint causing the initiation of a hearing is
filed by a tenant or occupant of a dwelling who is not also the owner thereof,
no action for eviction, abatement of a nuisance, forcible entry and detainer or
other similar proceeding, whether it be civil or criminal, shall be threatened
or instituted against such tenant or occupant solely because such tenant or
occupant files such complaint or agrees to testify or present tangible evidence
at an administrative adjudication hearing. The foregoing sentence shall not
apply if the owner proves by a preponderance of the evidence that such tenant
or occupant is the proximate cause of the violation for which the hearing is
commenced.
   (B)   Defendants shall be served with a copy of the written sworn pleading,
complaint or citation along with a notice of hearing in a manner reasonably
calculated to give them actual notice of the proceeding instituted against them
by one of the following means:
      (1)   Personal service upon a party or its authorized agent;
      (2)   Service by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the party’s
last known address;
      (3)   Service by first class mail, postage prepaid, at the party’s last
known address;
      (4)   If the party’s last known address cannot be ascertained after a
diligent search, by posting a copy of the sworn pleading, complaint or citation
in a conspicuous place upon the property or motor vehicle where the violation
is found when the party is the owner of the property or motor vehicle;
      (5)   Any notice presented by first class or certified mail or by posting
shall be deemed served three days after the deposit of such notice in the U.S.
Mail or the posting of such notice.
   (C)   Notices of hearing shall include:
      (1)   The type and nature of the ordinance violation to be adjudicated,
including a citation to the appropriate section of the code;
      (2)   The date and time of the administrative adjudication hearing;
      (3)   The legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to
be held;
      (4)   The penalties for failure to appear at the hearing; and
      (5)   Any witnesses or complainants who may be called to testify for the
village who are not employees or officers thereof.

by the Code Administrator no less than 30 and no more than 40 days after the

(Ord. 01-26, passed 8-22-01)
§ 32.112 HEARING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Rights of parties. Parties shall be provided with an opportunity for a
hearing before or during which they may exercise any or all of the following
rights:
      (1)   Be represented by counsel, although defendants shall not be
entitled to have an attorney appointed to represent them;
      (2)   Present and cross-examine witnesses;
      (3)   Request the Hearing Officer to issue subpoenas to direct the
attendance and testimony of relevant witnesses or the production of relevant
tangible evidence.
   (B)   Rules of evidence shall not govern. The formal and technical rules of
evidence shall not apply in administrative adjudication hearing authorized
under this chapter. Evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted only if it is
the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of
their affairs.
   (C)   Standard of proof. Administrative adjudication hearings are civil in
nature. The village shall bear the standard of proof to prove by a
preponderance of the evidence the occurrence or existence of a violation of the
code. A sworn, written pleading, complaint or citation shall constitute prima
facie evidence of the violation.
   (D)   Defenses. It shall be a defense to a code violation charged under this
chapter if the owner, his or her attorney or any other agent or representative
proves to the Hearing Officer’s satisfaction that:
      (1)   The code violation alleged in the notice did not in fact exist at
the time of the citation, pleading or complaint;
      (2)   The code violation has been caused by the current property
occupants and that in spite of reasonable attempts by the owner to maintain the
dwelling free of such violations, the current occupants continue to cause the
violations; or
      (3)   An occupant or resident of the dwelling has refused entry to the
owner or his or her agent to all or part of the dwelling for the purpose of
correcting the code violation;
      (4)   The code violation alleged in the notice occurred before the owner
became owner of the real or personal property. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, any existing order to correct a code violation and/or sanctions
imposed by the village as a result of a finding of a code violation under this
subchapter shall be attached to the property as well as to the owner of the
property, so that a finding of a code violation against one owner cannot be
avoided by conveying or transferring the property to another owner. Any
subsequent transferee owner of the property takes the same subject to the
findings, decision and order of a Hearing Officer under this subchapter.
   (E)   Continuances. No continuances shall be authorized by a Hearing Officer
for any administrative adjudication hearing commenced under this subchapter
except in cases where a continuance is absolutely necessary to protect the
rights of the defendant or owner. Lack of preparation shall not be grounds for
a continuance. Any continuance authorized by a Hearing Officer shall not exceed
28 days.
   (F)   Judicial review. Any final decisions by a Hearing Officer that a code
violation does or does not exist shall constitute a final determination for
purposes of judicial review and shall be subject to review under the Illinois
Administrative Review Law, ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 3-101 et seq., or as
hereinafter amended. Any person filing for judicial review under the
Administrative Review Law shall be subject to the assessment of costs for the
preparation and certification of the record of proceedings before the Hearing
Officer. The cost shall be assessed as $100 for the first page of the
transcript and $25 for each page thereafter. Any failure to pay such fee shall
subject the party seeking review to the provisions of ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, § 3-
109, including dismissal of the complaint on motion of the village.
(Ord. 01-26, passed 8-22-01)
§ 32.113 ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENT.
   (A)   Any fine, other sanction or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other
sanction or cost imposed remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of or the
failure to exhaust judicial review procedures under the Illinois Administrative
Review Law are a debt due and owing the Village of Bellwood and may be
collected in accordance with applicable law.
   (B)   Failure of the defendant to pay such fine or penalty after the
exhaustion of or the failure to exhaust judicial review procedures under the
Illinois Administrative Review Law may result in, if applicable:
      (1)   The immobilization of the person’s vehicle for failure to pay fines
or penalties for five or more parking violations; and
      (2)   The suspension of the person’s driver’s license for failure to pay
fines or penalties for ten or more parking violations.
   (C)   After expiration of the period in which judicial review under the
Illinois Administrative Review Law may be sought for a final determination of
an ordinance violation, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
findings, decision and order of the Hearing Officer may be enforced in the same
manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (D)   (1)   In any case in which a defendant has failed to comply with a
judgment ordering that defendant to correct an ordinance violation or imposing
any fine or other sanction as a result of an ordinance violation, any expenses
incurred by the village to enforce the judgment entered against that defendant,
including, but not limited to, attorney’s fees, court costs and costs related
to property demolition or foreclosure, after they are fixed by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a Hearing Officer, shall be a debt due and owing the
Village of Bellwood and may be collected in accordance with applicable law.
      (2)   Prior to any expenses being fixed by the Hearing Officer pursuant
to this division (D), the Code Administrator shall serve a notice to the
defendant that states that defendant shall appear at a hearing before the
Hearing Officer to determine whether the defendant has failed to comply with
the judgment. The notice shall set forth the date for such hearing, which shall
not be less than seven days from the date service is effective, as provided in
this subchapter.
   (E)   Upon being recorded in the manner required by Illinois Code of Civil
Procedure, Article XII (ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 1-101 et seq.) or by the
Uniform Commercial Code (ILCS Ch. 810, Act 5, §§ 1-101 et seq.), a lien shall
be imposed on the real estate or personal property, or both, of the defendant
in the amount of any debt due and owing the village under this subchapter. The
lien may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (F)   (1)   The Hearing Officer may set aside any judgment entered by
default and set a new hearing date, upon a petition filed by the defendant
within 21 days after the issuance of the order of default, if the Hearing
Officer determines that the defendant’s failure to appear at the hearing was
for good cause, or at any time if the defendant establishes, by a preponderance
of the evidence, that the village did not provide proper service of process. In
addition, for the purpose of motor vehicle violations, the grounds for the
petition may include:
         (a)   The person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited
vehicle on the date the parking violation notice was first issued; or
         (b)   The person having already paid the fine or penalty for the
parking violation in question.
      (2)   If any judgment is set aside pursuant to this subsection, the
Hearing Officer shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien
which has been recorded for any debt due and owing the village as a result of
the vacated default judgment. The petitioner shall appear with appropriate
evidence, so that if the petition is granted, he or she is prepared to proceed
immediately with a hearing on the merits.

§ 32.114 ENFORCEMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLE VIOLATIONS; CITATIONS.

Administrator observing such violation may issue a parking violation notice and
serve the notice on the owner of the vehicle by handling it to the operator of
the vehicle, if he or she is present, or by affixing it to the vehicle in a
conspicuous place. The issuer of the notice shall specify on the notice his or
her identification number, the particular parking regulation allegedly

in Illinois Vehicle Code § 11-208.3, ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-208.3, as
amended.
   (C)   The parking violation notice shall contain the information required
under the previous division. In addition, the notices shall state the
applicable fines as provided herein, the monetary penalty which shall be
automatically assessed for late payment, the vehicle immobilization and
driver’s license suspension that may be imposed if fines and penalties are not
paid in full, that payment of the indicated fine and of any applicable penalty
for late payment shall operate as a final disposition of the violation, and
information as to the availability of an administrative adjudication hearing in
which the violation may be contested on its merits and the manner in which such
hearing may be had.
   (D)   It shall be unlawful for any person, other than the owner of the
vehicle or his or her designee, to remove from a vehicle a parking violation
notice affixed pursuant to this subchapter.
   (E)   The Code Administrator shall distribute parking violation notices to
parking enforcement aides, other persons authorized to issue parking violating
notices and the Department of Police for issuance pursuant to these provisions.
The Chief of Police shall be responsible for the distribution of the notice
forms within the Department of Police, shall maintain a record of each set of
notices issued to individual members of the Department and shall retain a

   (F)    The Traffic Compliance Administrator shall compile and maintain
complete and accurate records relating to all parking violation notices issued
and the dispositions thereof, whether by payment of the fine or by final
determination of the Hearing Officer. In addition, the traffic compliance
administrator shall make certified reports to the Secretary of State pursuant
to the Illinois Vehicle Code.

§ 32.115 DETERMINATION OF LIABILITY; MOTOR VEHICLE CITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   Any person on whom a parking violation notice has been served
pursuant to this subchapter shall within seven days from the date of the
notice:
         (a)   Pay the indicated fine; or
         (b)   Request an administrative adjudication hearing as provided by
this subchapter to contest the charged violation.
      (2)   A response by mail shall be deemed timely if postmarked within
seven days of the issuance of the notice of violation.
   (B)   If the respondent requests an administrative hearing to contest the
cited violation, the Code Administrator shall notify the owner in writing of
the location and time available for a hearing in accordance with provisions of
this subchapter.
   (C)   Where a respondent who has requested an administrative hearing either
fails to pay the indicated fine prior to the hearing or fails to appear at a
hearing, a final determination of parking violation liability shall be entered
in the amount of the fine indicated on the notice of violation, plus costs.
Such costs shall include payment of a $40 administrative adjudication fee,
which shall be assessed against any violator found to be in default or
otherwise found to be liable.
   (D)   (1)   If no response is made in accordance with division (A) of this
section, the Code Administrator shall cause a second notice of violation to be
sent to the respondent. The notice shall specify the date and location of the
violation, the make and state registration number of the vehicle, the code
provision violated, the applicable fine and the time and manner in which the
respondent requests an administrative adjudication hearing to contest the cited
violation, the Code Administrator will cause a notice of hearing to be sent to
the respondent as provided herein.
      (2)   If the respondent fails to pay the indicated fine or request a
hearing to contest the charged violation within 14 days from the date of such
second notice of violation a determination of parking violation liability shall
be entered in the amount of the fine indicated on the notice of violation.
Failure to pay the fine within 21 days of issuance of the determination of
liability will result in the imposition of a late payment penalty pursuant to
division (E) herein. Upon the occurrence of a final determination of parking
violation liability and after expiration of the period in which judicial review
under the Illinois Administrative Review Law may be sought any unpaid fine or
penalty will constitute a debt due and owing the village. The second notice of
violation shall provide the above information.
   (E)   Failure by any respondent to pay or mail payment of the fine for a
parking violation within 21 days of the issuance of the final determination of
liability will automatically subject the respondent to a penalty for late
payment. The penalty for late payment shall be $50. Failure to pay or mail
payment of a fine within each subsequent 21-day period after the issuance of
the determination of liability will automatically subject the respondent to
additional penalty of $30.
   (F)   A person charged with a parking violation may contest the charge
through an administrative adjudication hearing limited to one or more of the
following grounds with appropriate evident to support:
      (1)   That the respondent was not the owner or lessee of the cited
vehicle at the time of the violation;
      (2)   That the cited vehicle or its state registration plates were stolen
at the time the violation occurred;
      (3)   That the relevant signs prohibiting or restricting parking were
missing or obscured;
      (4)   That the relevant parking meter was inoperable or malfunctioned
through no fault of the respondent;
      (5)   That the facts alleged in the parking violation notice are
inconsistent or do not support a finding that the specified regulation was
violated.

§ 32.116 LESSOR OF VEHICLE; LIABILITY.
   In accordance with Illinois Vehicle Code § 11-1306, ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §
11-1306, no person who is the lessor of a vehicle pursuant to a written lease
agreement shall be liable for a violation of any standing or parking regulation
of this chapter involving such vehicle during the period of the lease if upon
receipt of a notice of violation he or she shall, within 60 days thereafter,
provide to the Code Administrator the name and address of the lessee. Upon
receipt of a lessor’s notification of the name and address of his or her
lessee, pursuant to Illinois Vehicle Code §§ 11-1305 or 11-1306, ILCS Ch. 625,
Act 5, §§ 11-1305 or 11-1306, the Code Administrator shall cause a notice of
violation to be sent to the lessee as provided herein. If the lessor fails to
provide the Code Administrator with the name and address of the lessee within
60 days of receiving notice, the lessor shall be liable for the full amount of
the violation and late penalties, and a final determination will be issued.
(Ord. 01-26, passed 8-22-01)
§ 32.117 IMMOBILIZATION PROGRAM.
   (A)   (1)   The Code Administrator is authorized to direct and supervise a
program of vehicle immobilization for the purpose of enforcing the parking
regulations of the code. The program of vehicle immobilization shall provide
for immobilizing any eligible vehicle, as defined in division (B) below, by
placement of a restraint in such a manner as to prevent its operation.
      (2)   If the eligible vehicle is parked or left in violation of any
provision of the traffic code for which such vehicle is subject to an immediate
tow, in any place where it constitutes an obstruction or hazard or where it
impedes village workers during such operations as snow removal, the Code
Administrator may cause the eligible vehicle to be towed to a vehicle pound or
relocated to a legal parking place and there restrained.
   (B)   (1)   When the registered owner of a vehicle has accumulated five or
more final determinations of parking violation liability for which the fines
and penalties, if applicable, have not been paid in full, the Code
Administrator shall cause a notice of impending vehicle immobilization to be
sent as prescribed in this subchapter.
      (2)   The notice of impending vehicle immobilization shall state the name
and address of the registered owner, the state registration number of the
vehicle or vehicles registered to such owner and the serial numbers of parking
violation notices which have resulted in final determination of liability for
which the fines or penalties remain unpaid. Failure to pay the fines and
penalties owed within 21 days from the date of the notice will result in the
inclusion of the state registration number of the vehicle or vehicles of such
owner on an immobilization list. A person may challenge the validity of the
notice of impending vehicle immobilization by requesting a hearing and
appearing in person to submit evidence which would conclusively disprove
liability. Upon a request for a hearing, the Code Administrator shall schedule
the hearing for the next regular hearing date. Documentary evidence which would
conclusively disprove liability shall be based on the following grounds:
         (a)   That all fines and penalties for the parking violations cited in
the notice have been paid in full; or
         (b)   That the registered owner has not accumulated five or more final
determinations of parking violation liability which were unpaid at the time the
notice of impending vehicle immobilization was issued.
   (C)   Upon immobilization of an eligible vehicle, a notice shall be affixed
to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. The notice shall warn that the vehicle
is immobilized and that any attempt to move the vehicle may result in its
damage. The notice shall also state that the unauthorized removal of or damage
to the immobilizing restraint is a violation of Illinois Criminal Code §§ 16-
1 and 21-1. The notice shall also provide information specifying how release of
the immobilizing restraint may be had and how the registered owner may obtain
an immobilization hearing. If the restraint has not been released within 24
hours of its placement, the restraint shall be released and the vehicle towed
and impounded.
   (D)   The owner of an immobilized vehicle or other authorized person may
secure the release of the vehicle by paying the immobilization, towing and
storage fees provided in division (G) of this section and all fines and
penalties remaining due on each final determination of parking violation
liability issued to such person.
   (E)   The owner of an immobilized vehicle shall have the right to a hearing
to determine whether the immobilization or any subsequent towing and
impoundment was erroneous, if the owner files a written request for a hearing
with the Code Administrator within 14 days after immobilization or 14 days of
the date of the notice sent pursuant to division (F) herein, whichever is
later. The determination of the Hearing Officer regarding the validity of the
immobilization shall become final for the purpose of judicial review under the
Administrative Review Law of Illinois upon issuance.
   (F)   Within 10 days after a vehicle has been impounded, a notice of
impoundment shall be sent by first class mail to the address of the registered
owner as listed with the Secretary of State. The notice shall state that the
owner has the right to request a post- immobilization and post-towing hearing
as provided in division (E) herein and that, if the vehicle is not claimed
within 30 days from the date of the notice, the vehicle may be sold or
otherwise disposed of in accordance with Illinois Vehicle Code § 4-208, ILCS
Ch. 625, Act 5, § 4-208.
   (G)   The fee for immobilization shall be $30. In addition, a fee for towing
subsequent to the immobilization and a storage fee for every 24-hour period the
vehicle is retained shall be assessed. No fees shall be assessed for any
immobilization or tow which has been determined to be erroneous.
   (H)   It shall be unlawful to relocate or tow any vehicle restrained by an
immobilization device without the approval of the Code Administrator or his or
her designee. The registered owner of the immobilized vehicle and any person
who relocates an immobilized vehicle in violation of this division shall each
be subject to a penalty of $1,000 for such violation.
(Ord. 01-26, passed 8-22-01)
§ 32.118 DRIVER’S LICENSE SUSPENSION.
   (A)    When a person has failed to pay any fine or penalty due and owing
pursuant to this subchapter on ten or more parking violations, the Code
Administrator shall cause a notice of impending driver’s license suspension to
be sent in the form as required by the Secretary of State. The notice shall
state that failure to pay the amount owing within 45 days of the date of the
notice will result in the village’s notifying the Secretary of State that the
person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings pursuant to the
Illinois Vehicle Code.
   (B)   If a person sent a notice pursuant to division (A) of this section
fails to pay the amount owing within the time stated on the notice, the Code
Administrator may file with the Secretary of State a certified report, in
accordance with the Illinois Vehicle Code, that the person is eligible for
initiation of suspension proceedings. The Code Administrator shall assess a $20
filing fee against the person named in the certified report to reimburse the
village for the expense of preparing and filing the certified report with the
Secretary of State.
   (C)   (1)   A person named in a certified report filed pursuant to division
(B) of this section may, within 21 days of the date of the notice sent by the
Secretary of State pursuant to the Illinois Vehicle Code, file with the Code
Administrator a written statement and supporting documentation to challenge the
report; provided, however, the grounds for such challenge shall be limited to:
         (a)   The person not having been the owner or lessee of the vehicle or
vehicles receiving ten or more parking violations notices on the date or dates
such notices were issued; or
         (b)   The person having already paid the fine and penalty for the ten
or more violations indicated on the report.
      (2)   The Code Administrator shall send notice of the decision on the
challenge of the report after receipt thereof.
   (D)   If a person named in a certified report has paid the previously
reported fine or penalty or if the report is determined by the Code
Administrator to be in error, the Code Administrator shall notify the Secretary
of State in accordance with the Illinois Vehicle Code. A certified copy of such
notification shall be given, upon request and at no charge, to the person named
therein.
   (E)   An administrative hearing to contest an impending suspension or
suspension may be had upon filing a written request with the Secretary of
State. The filing fee for this hearing shall be $20 to be paid at the time the
request is made. The village shall reimburse the Secretary of State for all

ACCIDENT REVIEW BOARD
§ 32.180 CREATION.
   There shall be and is hereby created the Accident Review Board ("Board") of
the Village of Bellwood.
(Ord. 03-55, passed 10-8-03)
§ 32.181 COMPOSITION.
   The Board shall be comprised of the Comptroller, Director of Public Safety,
and two department heads. The Village President shall appoint the department
heads for a two-year term.
(Ord. 03-55, passed 10-8-03)
§ 32.182 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   The purpose of the Accident Review Board is to determine if a Bellwood
employee and/or a motor vehicle, truck, mobile or portable equipment was
involved in a preventable or non-preventable accident not at fault, partially
at fault, or at fault. The Board shall review every accident as mentioned and
shall submit a finding of preventability/nonpreventability and not at fault,
partially at fault, or at fault on the appropriate form to the department head.
The Board shall submit to the department head an annual report summarizing the
year's accidents/incidents.
(Ord. 03-55, passed 10-8-03)
§ 32.183 POLICY OF THE ACCIDENT REVIEW BOARD.
   (A)   The Accident Review Board. The Accident Review Board shall consist of
supervisory level employees.
   (B)   Preventable/at fault accident defined. A preventable/at fault accident
is any accident involving an employee while performing his or her daily work
assignments, which results in property damage and/or personal injury,
regardless of who was injured, what property was damaged, to what extent, or
where it occurred, in which the employee in question failed to exercise every
reasonable precaution to prevent the accident.
   (C)   Procedure.
      (1)   The following procedures will be adhered to by the Board members:
         (a)   Each member shall review a copy of the accident report form(s).
         (b)   Testimony from the employee will be considered.
         (c)   The facts as presented in the accident report shall be
considered on their merits.
         (d)   The Board shall reach its decision by a majority verbal vote.
      (2)   The facts of each accident as presented to members of the Board
will come from the following sources:
         (a)   The accident report form(s).
         (b)   Statements by the employee and witness(es).
         (c)   Supervisor's report.
         (d)   Photographs or additional diagrams, if required.
         (e)   Inspection of accident locations.
         (f)   Testimony of necessary individuals, if required.
      (3)   All accident reports submitted to the Chairman of the Accident
Review Board shall be processed within ten working days (or as soon as is
reasonably possible) after the date of occurrence. If the report is not
evaluated within ten working days (or as soon as is reasonably possible), the
department head shall be notified of the reason for the delay.
      (4)   Each member of the Board will receive copies of all applicable
accident report forms from the Board Chairman.
      (5)   Each member of the Board will make an independent judgment of the
accident. A verbal vote will be taken to determine if the accident was
preventable or nonpreventable, and whether the employee was not at fault,
partially at fault, or at fault.
      (6)   The Chairman of the Accident Review Board shall then submit the
Board's findings and final vote to the department head. The department head
will notify the employee of any possible disciplinary actions within five
working days.
   (D)   Guidelines to determine accident preventability/at fault. It is
impossible to describe in detail the many ways employees might prevent an
accident without being primarily responsible. Extenuating circumstances with
factors relating to the duties of the employee should be considered with
discretion. The following comments are therefore intended as a guide in
evaluating accidents and are not presented as all-inclusive.
   (E)   Accidents involving more than one city vehicle or employee. When two
or more employees are involved in the same accident, each employee may be
charged with a preventable, at fault accident, regardless of which one was
responsible for the occurrence.
   (F)   Witness statements and traffic citations. Admissions of being at fault
by the other driver or the fact that the other driver involved was issued a
traffic citation or statements or exoneration by the police officer are not, in
themselves, conclusive evidence to judge an accident nonpreventable. A careful
study must be made of all conditions to determine how the employee in question
contributed to the situation by acts of omission or commission. Unless a
thorough investigation indicated that the employee in question could not have
avoided involvement by reasonable defensive driving and safety practices, the
accident will be regarded as preventable/at fault. An accident review will be
held separate from any other legal proceedings.
   (G)   Intersections. It is the responsibility of the employee to approach,
enter and cross intersections prepared to avoid accidents that might occur
through the action of other drivers. Failure of other drivers to conform to law
or traffic control devices will not automatically discharge an accident as non-
preventable.
   (H)   Department vehicles and equipment on emergency operations. Employees
on emergency operations, who cross an intersection against a red light, go
through a stoplight or make any other driving maneuver during emergency
operations, are not relieved of the responsibility of causing an accident. In
the absence of convincing circumstances, when driving a village vehicle under
emergency conditions, the accident in most cases should be ruled preventable/at
fault.
   (I)   Backing. All backing accidents are preventable. An employee driver and
his or her co-workers are not relieved of his or her responsibility to back
safely under practically any circumstances.
   (J)   Front-end collisions. Regardless of the abrupt or unexpected stop of
the vehicle ahead, the employee driver can prevent front-end collisions by
maintaining a safe following distance at all times. He or she is expected to be
prepared for possible obstructions on the roadway. Overdriving headlights at
night is a common cause of front-end collisions. Night speed should not be
greater than that which will permit the vehicle to come to a stop within the
forward distance illuminated by the vehicle headlights.
   (K)   Rear-end collisions. Investigation often disclose that drivers being
struck from behind by failing to maintain a margin of safety in their own
following distance. Rear-end collisions proceeded by a rollback, an abrupt stop
at a grade crossing, when a traffic signal changes, or when the driver fails to
signal a turn at an intersection, should be ruled preventable/at fault.
   (L)   Passing. Failure to pass safely indicates faulty judgment and the
possible failure to consider one or more of the important factors a driver must
observe before attempting the maneuver. The entire passing maneuver is
voluntary; it is the driver's responsibility to pass with safety.
   (M)   Being passed. Sideswipes and cut-offs involving employee drivers are
preventable when the employee fails to yield to the passing vehicle by slowing
down or moving to the right where possible.
   (N)   Lane encroachment. A safe driver is rarely a victim of entrapment by
another driver when changing lanes. Also, entrapment in merging traffic is an
indication of unwillingness to yield to other vehicles or to wait for a break
in traffic. Drivers must make extra allowances to protect themselves in areas
of limited sight distances.
   (O)   Grade crossing. Collisions with fixed rail vehicles occurring at grade
crossings, in a rail yard, switch area or on private property are the
responsibility of the driver to prevent.
   (P)   Opposing vehicles. It is important to check the action of the employee
driver when involved in a head-on or sideswipe accident with a vehicle
approaching from the opposite direction. Even though an opposing vehicle enters
the driver's traffic lane, it may be possible for the employee driver to avoid
the collision.
   (Q)   Turning. Turning movements require special care. Left or right turns
involving other vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles or pedestrians are the
responsibility of the driver making the turn. Failure to signal, improper lane
usage, check mirrors or take any other defensive action should be considered.
Sudden turns should be carefully examined. U-turns by the employee driver in a
collision are preventable/at fault.
   (R)   Pedestrians. Traffic regulations and court decisions generally favor
the pedestrian hit by a moving vehicle. A pedestrian struck while crossing at
midblock or from between parked cars does not relieve a driver from taking
precautions to prevent such accidents.
   (S)   Weather. Adverse weather conditions are not a valid excuse for being
involved in an accident in most cases. The driver is expected to adjust his or
her driving to prevailing weather conditions.
   (T)   Fixed objects. Collisions with fixed objects are preventable.
   (U)   While parked. Unconventional parking locations, including double
parking, failure to put out warning devices, and the like, generally constitute
evidence for judging an accident preventable/at fault.
   (V)   Defensive driving defined. The following definition of DEFENSIVE
DRIVING should be applied to all accidents under consideration by the Board: “A
DEFENSIVE DRIVER is one who commits no driving errors himself or herself and
makes allowances for the lack of skill or improper driving practices of the
other drivers. A DEFENSIVE DRIVER adjusts his or her own driving to compensate
for unusual weather, road, and traffic conditions, and is not tricked into an
accident by the unsafe actions of pedestrians and other drivers. By being alert
to accident inducing situations, he or she recognizes the need for preventative
action in advance and takes the necessary precautions to prevent the accident.
As a DEFENSIVE DRIVER, he or she knows when it is necessary to slow down, stop
or yield his or her right-of-way to avoid an accident.”

tax not actually collected from a retail purchaser; and

without the revenue stamps provided by this section, a lien is declared against
said real estate conveyed in the amount of the tax. The fact that the deed or
assignment does not contain a Bellwood revenue stamp in an amount equal to

constructive notice of lien. The lien may be enforced by proceedings to
foreclose, as in cases of mortgages or mechanics liens. Suit to foreclose this
lien must be commenced within three years after the date of recording the deed.
Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing the village from bringing a

penalties as herein provided.

and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid
tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the

§ 36.15 FUNDING OF ILLINOIS MUNICIPAL RETIREMENT FUND PENSION.
   (A)   Introduction.
      (1)   The purpose of this policy statement is to define the manner in
which the village funds long-term costs of pension benefits to Illinois
Municipal Retirement Fund (IMRF) plan participants. The ultimate goal of this
policy is to ensure that pension benefits can be paid, employer costs can be
managed, and the plan to fund pensions is clear.
      (2)   Funding a defined benefit pension plan requires a long-term
horizon. Assumptions and inputs into the policy should focus on long-term
trends, not year-to-year shifts in the economic or noneconomic environments.
Generally, assumptions or inputs should be evaluated and changed if long-term
economic or non-economic inputs have fundamentally changed or are no longer
reasonable. As such, the village will review this policy as part of the annual
budget process to determine if changes are needed to ensure adequate resources
are being accumulated in Bellwood’s IMRF account. The village reserves the
right to make changes to this policy and change funding practices, at any time,
if the financial condition of the village warrants, and it is deemed
appropriate by the Village Board of Trustees.
   (B)   General funding policy objectives. The fundamental financial objective
of a public employee defined benefit pension plan is to fund the long-term cost
of benefits provided to the plan participants. To assure the plan remains
sustainable, the plan should accumulate adequate resources for future benefit
payments in a systematic and disciplined manner during the active service life
of the benefitting employees.
      (1)   Actuarially determined contributions. A pension funding plan should
be based upon an actuarially determined contribution (ADC) incorporating both
the cost of benefits in the current year and the amortization of the plan’s
unfunded actuarial accrued liability.
      (2)   Specific cost assumptions. The village does not obtain a separate
actuarial report for IMRF and instead relies on the information provided by
IMRF. IMRF costs are allocated to the budget activities in which the related
salary expenditures are recorded. Most IMRF costs are funded by the village’s
IMRF property tax levy. The Water and Sewer Fund pays the village’s IMRF costs
from revenues dedicated to that purpose.
      (3)   Funding discipline.
         (a)   A commitment to make timely, actuarially determined
contributions to the retirement system is needed to ensure sufficient assets
are available for all current and future retirees.
         (b)   Specific policy objectives and considerations.
            1.   As required by state statute, the village will, at a minimum,
fund the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund (IMRF) in the amounts determined by
IMRF. The village will consider funding IMRF at higher levels when anticipated
property tax revenue exceeds actual contributions to the fund.
            2.   Employer contributions - Property tax receipts will be
electronically deposited to IMRF on a monthly basis.
            3.   Employee contributions - Employee contributions obtained
through payroll deductions will be electronically deposited to IMRF on a
monthly basis.
      (4)   Intergenerational equity.
         (a)   Annual contributions should be reasonably related to the
expected and actual cost of each year of service so the cost of employee
benefits is paid by the generation of taxpayers who receives services from
those employees.
         (b)   Specific policy objectives and considerations. Fully funding
pension benefits over the average future service period of employees reasonably
aligns the cost of the benefits of the public services with the taxpayers who
benefit from those services.
      (5)   Accountability and transparency.
         (a)   Clear reporting of pension funding should include an assessment
of how and when the plan sponsor will ensure sufficient assets are available
for all current and future retirees.
         (b)   Specific policy objectives and considerations.
            1.   The village’s Annual Financial Report (AFR) shall be published
on its website, uploaded to the State Comptroller’s Office; and hard copies
made available at the Village Hall. The AFR includes various financial reports
related to the village’s Retirement Fund and the village’s annual contribution
to the Pension Plan.
            2.   The village’s annual budget shall be published on its website
and hard copies made available at the Village Hall. The budget shall include
the village’s contribution to the village’s IMRF account as well as this
funding policy.

code violation, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
findings, decision, and order of the hearing officer may be enforced in the
same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (C)   In any case in which a defendant has failed to comply with a judgment
ordering a defendant to correct a code violation or imposing any fine or other
sanction as a result of a code violation, any expenses incurred by a
municipality to enforce the judgment, including, but not limited to, attorney's
fees, court costs, and costs related to property demolition or foreclosure,
after they are fixed by a court of competent jurisdiction or a hearing officer,
shall be a debt due and owing the municipality and may be collected in
accordance with applicable law. Prior to any expenses being fixed by a hearing
officer pursuant to this division (C), the municipality shall provide notice to
the defendant that states that the defendant shall appear at a hearing before
the administrative hearing officer to determine whether the defendant has
failed to comply with the judgment. The notice shall set the date for such a
hearing, which shall not be less than seven days from the date that notice is
served. If notice is served by mail, the seven-day period shall begin to run on
the date that the notice was deposited in the mail.

of Civil Procedure or by the Uniform Commercial Code, a lien shall be imposed
on the real estate or personal estate, or both, of the defendant in the amount
of any debt due and owing the municipality under this section. The lien may be
enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction.
   (E)   A hearing officer may set aside any judgment entered by default and
set a new hearing date, upon a petition filed within 21 days after the issuance
of the order of default, if the hearing officer determines that the
petitioner's failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause or at any time
if the petitioner establishes that the municipality did not provide proper
service of process. If any judgment is set aside pursuant to this division (E),
the hearing officer shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any
lien which has been recorded for any debt due and owing the municipality as a
result of the vacated default judgment.

manhole, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes. The manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safety located and
shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Building
Commissioner. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her expense
and shall be maintained by him or her so as to be safe and accessible at all
times.
   (I)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this subchapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the village or regulatory agencies
having jurisdiction over the discharge. The number, type and frequency of
laboratory analyses to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the
village, but no less than once per year the industry must supply a complete
analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure that
compliance with the federal, state and local standards are being met. The owner
shall report the results of measurements and laboratory analyses to the village
at such times and in such a manner as prescribed by the village. The owner
shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses and reporting required by
the village. At such times as deemed necessary, the village reserves the right

and wastes to which reference is made in this subchapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of IEPA Division of Laboratories Manual of
Laboratory Methods and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or
upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24 hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from 24 hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples.
   (K)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the village and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the village for treatment, subject to payment therefore, in
accordance with this subchapter by the industrial concern, provided such
payments are in accordance with federal and state guidelines for the user
charge system.

§ 51.56 VILLAGE PROGRAM FOR ELIMINATION OF EXTRANEOUS FLOWS.
   (A)   Establishment of program. Because of their almost instantaneous
impact, their injurious results, substantial contributions and relative ease of
correction, the village will institute a priority program for the elimination
of extraneous flows entering into the sanitary sewer system through downspouts,
roof drains and other visible or outside connections which are connected
directly or indirectly to the sanitary sewer system.
   (B)   Inspection of outside or inside connections. Within a period of six
months starting March 1, 1974, and at no expense to the property owner, the
village will make visual outside inspections of all properties within the
village, with specific attention to downspouts, roof drains and other visible
or outside connections, and, if requested by the property owner, the village
will enter into the premises and make or assist in the making of additional
inspection of the premises to ascertain if illegal connections are present.
Upon completion of the visual outside or inside inspection, the village will
advise the property owner in writing if any illegal connections are observed,
and will advise on the manner of corrections for compliance with the provisions
of this chapter. After the corrections are made, the village will, at no
expense to the owner, make further inspections of the corrections to insure
compliance with this division.
   (C)   Responsibility of owner to make connections after notice of findings.
Within 90 days after notice to the property owner by the village of the
presence of illegal connections, the property owner shall, at his or her
expense, disconnect all illegal connections observed. All discharges of
extraneous flows into the sanitary sewer system, directly or indirectly, shall
be discontinued.
   (D)   Additional powers of village. In addition to visual inspections on the
outside or the inside of the premises as indicated in division (A) of this
section, the village may make other tests and inspections of the municipal
sewer systems as it deems necessary in order to locate such illegal connections
and sources of extraneous flows as may exist. The village, at its option, may
also invoke other legal powers vested in it or implied by the state statutes
for the protection of the health and welfare of the public, or institute such
legal action as it deems necessary to discover and order the disconnection of
any illegal connections that may exist.
(`95 Code, § 51.41) Penalty, see §
51.99

§ 52.02 APPLICATION FOR WATER SERVICE; TURN-ON FEE; DEPOSIT.
   (A)   Consumer defined, liability for charges. The word CONSUMER shall mean
the owner, official custodian, occupant or person in control of any premises to
which water and/or sewer service is provided, or, in the case of non-owner
occupied premises, the owner and occupant of such premises, jointly and
severally. All new accounts shall be contracted for by such consumer and all
deposits shall be in the name of such consumer. All charges for service and any
deposits shall be presumed to be made by the owner and occupant jointly and
severally.
   (B)   Application. No water from the waterworks system shall be turned on

writing to the Water Supervisor and shall contain an agreement by the applicant
to abide by and accept all of the provisions of this chapter as conditions
governing the use and service of the waterworks system by the applicant. In the
case of non-owner occupied premises, the applicant must provide name, address
and telephone information of both the owner and occupant(s) of such premises.
The turn-on fee and deposit required by divisions (C) and (D) of this section
shall be payable in advance to be made at the time of application as a
condition precedent for the turn-on of the waterworks system at a particular
premises or residential unit. When the ownership of property is transferred to
a new owner, it shall be the responsibility of the new owner to pay all fees,
deposits, and delinquent charges prior to water and sewer service being turned
on or otherwise restored to property receiving water services or subject to the
application for service from the waterworks system. Water and sewer service
shall not be turned on or otherwise restored to a property until all fees,
deposits, and delinquent charges have been paid in full.
   (C)   Turn-on fee. A fee shall be paid for turning on the water. The only
exception to this will be when the consumer temporarily relocates to another
home out of state, in which case a fee shall be added to the bill at the time
of turn-on.
   (D)   Deposit required.
      (1)   In addition to payment of any other fees or amounts due and owing
the village, a deposit, in the amount shown in the table set forth in this
division (D)(1), which may be amended from time to time by the Board of
Trustees, shall be made with each application for water service, whether the
applicant is applying for water service for the first time or whether through a
change of address or otherwise is applying for water service at a new, other or
additional premises, which deposit shall be a condition precedent to the
supplying of such water, shall be paid to the Finance Director and shall be
retained by the village to ensure the timely payment of bills for water
services rendered. The amount of the deposit required to initiate water service
to a residential unit or premises shall be as shown in the table set forth in
this division (D)(1), which may be amended from time to time by the Board of
Trustees:
TYPE OF STRUCTURE SERVED DEPOSIT
TYPE OF STRUCTURE SERVED                  DEPOSIT

Industrial                                $750
 
      (2)   Unless and until the deposit must be drawn down to satisfy
delinquent water bills, the water deposit shall be retained to the credit of
the consumer in an account separate from the village's general water/sewer
system account. The funds in the village's water deposit account shall not be
considered "revenue" within the meaning of ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-19-9 or §
52.57(C) unless and until such funds are drawn upon and transferred into the
general water/sewer system account in accordance with the provisions of
division (D)(6) of this section. When service to the consumer is discontinued
permanently via a request for and payment of a final bill or otherwise, the
deposit, less any amount still due the village for provision of water services,
penalties, fees and payment of any attorneys' fees or costs associated with the
liening of the subject property for delinquent water service payments or costs
associated with other collection efforts, shall be refunded to the consumer
without interest upon the consumer's request for a refund or transfer of the
deposit to a different premises or residential unit in the village.
      (3)   Should a consumer of water services vacate a premises or
residential unit served thereby without requesting or paying a final bill,
without notifying the village of his or her departure, or failing to claim a
refund or transfer of the deposit within 60 days of vacancy, the village shall
notify the recipient at the last known address through the U.S. Mail Service of
any portion of the deposit available for refund.
      (4)   Should the recipient of water services fail to notify the village
of a claim for refund within 30 days after the village sends notice through the
U.S. Mail Service as provided in division (D)(3) of this section, the balance
of the deposit shall be transferred to the operations and maintenance account
of the water and sewer fund. The village shall maintain a record of this
transfer for a period of one year from the date that the village becomes aware
of the water recipient vacating the premises.
      (5)   If the consumer files a claim for refund of the deposit within a
period of one year from vacating the premises and the consumer is entitled to
such a refund, the village will make such refund from the operations and
maintenance account of the water and sewer fund. If no claim is filed, the
deposit will become non-refundable, with any remaining portion of the deposit
reimbursing the village for its cost of handling and maintaining the records.
      (6)   If any consumer fails to pay a bill for water services in full
within 30 days of the bill being rendered and mailed, then the deposit or that
portion of the deposit as is necessary, shall be applied to pay such
delinquency, including any late fees that may have accrued.
      (7)   Every instance in which the village has to draw down the deposit to
satisfy delinquent water bills and generate notice to the consumer, as provided
for in divisions (D)(6) and (8) of this section, respectively, a $20 service
charge shall be levied and added to the water service balance due to cover
administrative costs and processing fees, which service charge shall become
part of the amount due and owing on the account in question.
      (8)   When the consumer's deposit has been drawn down to satisfy a water
arrearage as provided in division (D)(6) of this section, the consumer shall be
notified promptly, via first class mail sent to the premises served by such
water service and at the address at which the consumer has registered with the
village, if different. This dated notice shall specify the amount of the
deposit having been applied to satisfy water arrearages, the remaining amount
of the deposit or any remaining amounts due for water services for which the
deposit was insufficient to satisfy in full, and the duty of the consumer to
replenish the deposit to the original amount deposited within 30 days, as set
forth in division (D)(9) of this section.
      (9)   Whenever the deposit shall be drawn down by the village to satisfy
a late bill payment as provided in division (D)(6) of this section, the
consumer must deposit an additional sum of money that, in addition to the
remaining balance of the deposit, shall equal the deposit amount originally
demanded and required by the village. Such replenishing of the original deposit
shall be made within 30 days of the dated notice provided by the village
pursuant to division (D)(8) of this section. Failure to timely replenish the
deposit in full shall constitute a violation of this chapter and subject the
violator to a fine in accordance with the penalty provision of §
52.99(A). No permits for any purposes whatsoever shall be issued by the village
to the consumer unless the deposit is fully funded as required herein.
   (E)   Deposit, turn-on fee, satisfaction of delinquent charges a requirement
prior to restoration of water service. When water service to a premises or
residential unit has been turned off for nonpayment pursuant to §
52.39, such water service shall not be restored at the formerly-served premises
or residential unit, whether or not the application for service restoration is
tendered by the same consumer who was responsible for the prior delinquency,
until all fees, deposits, and delinquent charges, including the turn-on fee and
deposit required by divisions (C) and (D) of this section, have been paid in
full.

hearing shall be scheduled on or before the disconnection date specified in the
notice of the village's intent to terminate the water supply to the premises.
If the written request for a pre-termination hearing is timely received by the
village prior to the disconnection date, but no administrative adjudication
session will take place prior to the specified termination date, the
termination shall be delayed until after the hearing takes place. The hearing
shall provide the consumer an opportunity to be heard regarding any disputed
portion of the bill. The hearing shall be open to the public, informal, and the
hearing officer shall accept evidence only pertaining to the accuracy of the

village in its initial notice of water service termination, an amended notice
of water service termination shall be served upon the owner and tenants of the
property in the same manner as the initial notice, except that no further
opportunity to request a hearing shall be provided. In such cases, the date for
water service termination shall be not less than ten days from the date of
service of the amended notice.
         (b)   The village shall not disconnect the water service to any
property for nonpayment during the pendency of the dispute if:
            1.   A written request for hearing has been remitted by the
consumer, which request shall be made in writing and contain the name, address
and telephone number of the person disputing a charge, identify with
particularity the amount or portion of the bill(s)/charge(s) in dispute, and
state the specific grounds or reasons for which the charges billed are being
disputed (the consumer's ability to pay shall not be a relevant consideration
or basis for dispute); and payment of all undisputed portions of the bill(s) is
made in full; OR
            2.   The hearing officer finds that there is no outstanding balance
due and owing the village.
         (c)   The village may disconnect the water service to any property for
nonpayment if:
            1.   No written request for hearing has been remitted by the
consumer prior to the termination date specified in the village's notice of
impending water service termination;
            2.   The dispute is resolved by the hearing officer ordering an
amount due that is not paid in full prior to the termination date specified in
the village's notice of impending water service termination;
            3.   The consumer fails to pay any undisputed portions of the bill
(s);
            4.   The consumer fails to appear for the scheduled adjudicatory
hearing; or
            5.   After tendering a written request for hearing as provided
herein, the consumer is unresponsive to the village's attempts to schedule a
hearing date and time.
      (5)   In the event the water supply is terminated, a $100 fee shall be
charged to have the water supply turned back on.
      (6)   When the water supply to a property is turned off, it shall be
unlawful for any person other than a village employee or village designee to
attempt to turn said water supply back on, or to tamper with the water meter,
service connection, service pipes, valves, shut-off boxes or any other element
or appurtenance of the village waterworks system. Any such act shall be
considered a violation of §
52.54, attributable to the owner and/or occupant of the subject property, and a
penalty shall be imposed in accordance with §
52.99(G).
      (7)   When water service is terminated for a property based upon a
failure to make full payment of amounts due for water service within the time
specified under the Village Code, prior to the reinstatement of services to
said property, the village may demand full satisfaction of the outstanding
charges for water and/or sewer services, late fees and penalties, the turn-on
fee set forth in division (A)(3) of this section, garbage pickup fees, all
expenditures related to preparing and providing notice(s) of delinquency, and
any outstanding code violations pertaining to the property.
      (8)   The charges hereinbefore provided shall be paid by the person
owning or occupying, or in possession, charge or control of such building,
structure or premises at the time it is desired to have water service restored
thereto, irrespective of whether such person shall have been the one
responsible for the accumulated charges or fees or fines stemming from a
violation of any provision of this division (A) or Chapter 52 generally.
      (9)   Restoration of service. Following termination of water service,
such service shall be restored immediately to the premises following payment in
full of all outstanding charges for water and/or sewer services, late fees and
penalties, the turn-on fee set forth in division (A)(3) of this section,
garbage pick-up fees, all expenditures related to preparing and providing
notice(s) of delinquency, any outstanding code violations pertaining to the
property, and payment of a deposit as specified in §
52.02, if applicable.
      (10)   Terminating water service for nonpayment shall not be the
exclusive remedy for nonpayment. The village may also record a lien for
delinquent payments and foreclose on such liens in accordance with §
52.40 and pursue any other collection methods available to the village by law.
Any and all such courses of action may be pursued simultaneously and shall not
be mutually exclusive to one another.
   (B)   Multi-family apartment buildings served by a single service pipe, a
common metering device and a single shut-off valve.
      (1)   This division (B) shall apply to any multi-family residential
apartment buildings containing three or more dwelling units, for which the
entire building or structure and all units therein supplied water by the
village share a single, common metering device, one service pipe, and a single
shut-off valve controlling the flow of water into the entire building and all
of the apartments therein.
      (2)   In all apartment buildings with three or more residential units
wherein a single shut-off valve is the only means of disconnecting the water
service to the apartment building such that either all or none of the
apartments therein receive water service, the owner or owners and tenants are
declared to be jointly and severally liable for the water charges incurred by
the occupants, and the failure or nonpayment of water charges by either the
owners or the tenants shall entitle the village to shut off the water supply to
any such apartment building in its entirety whenever the water bill remains
unpaid for a period of 30 days after the bill is rendered and mailed, insofar
as the deposit funds specified in §
52.02, if applicable, are insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance in
full plus any applicable penalties or late fees that may have accrued, in
accordance with the following procedures:
         (a)   Once a water bill has remained unpaid for 30 days or more after
it has been mailed by the village, the village must notify the owner of the
apartment building or his or her designee by first-class mail sent to the
address(es) at which the owner(s) registered with the village in the
application for water service, notify each tenant by first-class mail addressed
to each tenant's dwelling unit, and provide further notice by posting the
notice of water service termination on the front door of the apartment
building, which apprises the recipients of the proposed termination of water
service. This notice shall comply with the requirements of ILCS Ch. 765, Act
735, § 3 and shall be in substantially the same form as the notice of water
service termination attached to Ordinance No. 11-20 as Exhibit B and
incorporated by reference herein.
         (b)   It is unlawful for the landlord or his or her agent to alter,
deface, tamper with or remove the notice of water service termination. A
landlord or his or her agent who violates this provision is guilty of a Class C
misdemeanor.
         (c)   In addition to all other information provided, the notice of
water service termination shall indicate that the water service will be
terminated on a date certain no less than ten days after the notice is mailed
and posted at the premises, whichever is later.
         (d)   1.   In addition to all other information provided, the notice
of water service termination shall inform the owner and tenants of their right
to have a pre-termination hearing conducted at the first available
administrative adjudication hearing date after a written request for hearing is
remitted by the owner or tenant to the Finance Department, either by mail or
in-person delivery. Upon receiving a written request for hearing, a designee of
the village shall schedule a pre-termination hearing with the requestor, which
hearing shall be scheduled on or before the disconnection date specified in the
notice of the village's intent to terminate the water supply to the premises.
If the written request for a pre-termination hearing is timely received by the
village prior to the disconnection date, but no administrative adjudication
session will take place prior to the specified termination date, the
termination shall be delayed until after the hearing takes place. The hearing
shall provide the owner or tenants (or both; if multiple requests for hearing
are tendered to the village, the dispute shall be resolved in a single hearing)
an opportunity to be heard regarding any disputed portion of the bill. The
hearing shall be open to the public, informal, and the hearing officer shall
accept evidence only pertaining to the accuracy of the charges. At the close of
the hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a findings, decision and order
declaring the amount due and owing, if any, and a copy of the findings,
decision and order shall be provided to the Finance and Water Departments, as
well as the party(ies) requesting the hearing. If the amount due is found to be
different than the amount originally claimed by the village in its initial
notice of water service termination, an amended notice of water service
termination shall be served upon the owner and tenants of the property in the
same manner as the initial notice of water service termination, except that no
further opportunity to request a hearing shall be provided. In such cases, the
date for water service termination shall be not less than ten days from the
date of service by mail and posting of the amended notice of water service
termination.
            2.   The village shall not disconnect the water service to any
property for nonpayment pursuant to this division (B) during the pendency of
the dispute if:
               a.   A written request for hearing has been remitted by an owner
or tenant, which request shall be made in writing and contain the name, address
and telephone number of the person disputing a charge, identify with
particularity the amount or portion of the bill(s)/charge(s) in dispute, and
state the specific grounds or reasons for which the charges billed are being
disputed (the owner's or tenant's ability to pay shall not be a relevant
consideration or basis for dispute); and payment of all undisputed portions of
the bill(s) is made in full;
               b.   The hearing officer finds that there is no outstanding
balance due and owing the village;
               c.   The village receives notice of a court order issued by the
Circuit Court of Cook County appointing a receiver for the apartment building
prior to termination, in which case water service shall continue unless and
until the court issues a later order terminating the receivership with a
delinquent balance remaining for water services.
            3.   The village may disconnect the water service to any property
for nonpayment if:
               a.   No written request for hearing has been remitted by the
owner or tenant prior to the termination date specified in the village's notice
of impending water service termination;
               b.   The dispute is resolved by the hearing officer ordering an
amount due that is not paid in full prior to the termination date specified in
the village's notice of impending water service termination;
               c.   The consumer fails to pay any undisputed portions of the
bill(s);
               d.   The owner or tenant fails to appear for the scheduled
adjudicatory hearing; or
               e.   After tendering a written request for hearing as provided
herein, the owner or tenant is unresponsive to the village's attempts to
schedule a hearing date and time.
      (3)   In the event the water supply is terminated, a $100 fee shall be
charged to have the water supply turned back on.
      (4)   When the water supply to a property is turned off, it shall be
unlawful for any person other than a village employee or village designee to
attempt to turn said water supply back on, or to tamper with the water meter,
service connection, service pipes, valves, shut-off boxes or any other element
or appurtenance of the village waterworks system. Any such act shall be
considered a violation of §
52.54, attributable to the owner and/or occupant of the subject property, and a
penalty shall be imposed in accordance with §
52.99(G).
      (5)   When water service is terminated for a property based upon a
failure to make full payment of amounts due for water service within the time
specified under the Village Code, prior to the reinstatement of services to
said property, the village may demand full satisfaction of the outstanding
charges for water service, plus late fees, penalties, and the turn-on fee set
forth in division (A)(3) of this section.
      (6)   Restoration of service. Following termination of water service,
such service shall be restored immediately to the apartment building upon the
occurrence of any of the following:
         (a)   Payment is tendered in full to the village for the delinquent
amount, plus late fees, penalties and the turn-on fee as specified in division
(B)(4) of this section, regardless of the identity of the payer;
         (b)   A tenant in the apartment building requests that the water bill
be put in his or her name, agrees to pay future water bills, and either i)
provides credit references deemed satisfactory to the village in its sole
discretion or ii) pays the deposit required by §
52.02; or
         (c)   The village receives a copy of an order issued by the Circuit
Court of Cook County appointing a receiver for the apartment building, in which
case the water shall be restored and remain on until such time as the
receivership is terminated by court order with a delinquent balance remaining
for water services.
      (7)   In its sole discretion, the village may, but need not, petition the
Circuit Court of Cook County for the appointment of a receiver for the
apartment building to collect rent from the tenants of the apartment building
instead of the landlord and remit a portion of those funds to the village in
payment for water services as the court may direct in accordance with the
Rental Property Utility Service Act, ILCS Ch. 765, Act 735, §§ 0.01, et seq.
      (8)   Shutting off water service for nonpayment shall not be the
exclusive remedy for nonpayment. The village may also record a lien for
delinquent payments and foreclose on such liens in accordance with § 52.40 and
pursue any other collection methods available to the village by law. Any and
all such courses of action may be pursued simultaneously and shall not be
mutually exclusive to one another.
   (C)   Duplexes, townhouses, rowhouses and other attached premises with each
attached unit therein served by an individual metering device but all attached
units sharing a common service pipe.
      (1)   This division (C) shall apply to any residential, commercial or
industrial property containing a building(s) or structure(s) subdivided into
two or more attached units sharing a common roof and joined at one or two sides
by a party wall or walls, which units extend from foundation to roof with open
space on at least two sides. Such attached premises are supplied with water by
the village and each unit therein has an individuated, dedicated metering
device, but all attached units share a single service pipe and shut-off valve
controlling the flow of water into the entire building(s) or structure(s) and
all of the attached units therein.
      (2)   When the village identifies a particular unit in an attached
structure that has accrued unpaid charges for water and sewer services, late
fees and penalties for which the deposit funds specified in §
52.02, if applicable, are insufficient to pay down the outstanding balance the
village shall have the right to install a shut-off box on that unit's water
service pipe after providing the consumer (defined as the occupant and, where
different, the owner of the unit) with ten days advance notice in substantially
the same form as the attached property shut-off box installation and water
termination notice, attached to Ordinance No. 11-20 as Exhibit C and
incorporated by reference herein, as follows:
         (a)   The village shall send written notice a minimum of ten days
prior to taking any action contemplated by the notice;
         (b)   Such notice shall be sent via first class mail sent to the
delinquent unit itself and any address(es) at which the owner registered with
the village in the application for water service as provided in §
52.02(A);
         (c)   The notice shall inform the owner and/or occupant of the
village's intent to install a "shut-off box," as defined in §
52.36, on the water service pipe servicing the unit to enable a targeted
termination of the water supply to said unit without affecting the owners or
occupants of attached units;
         (d)   The notice shall inform the owner and/or occupant that the water
service to the unit will terminate immediately following the installation of
the shut-off box on the water service pipe;
         (e)   The notice shall inform the owner and/or occupant that the cost
of installing such a shut-off box shall be combined with all delinquent water
and sewer charges, late penalties and fees, and that the owner and occupant,
where different, are jointly and severally liable for all such charges, and
that the aggregate balance must be satisfied in full before water service will
be restored to the premises; and
         (f)   The notice described in this division (C)(2) shall inform the
owner and occupant of their right to have a hearing conducted at the first
available administrative adjudication hearing date after a written request for
hearing is remitted to the Finance Department, either by mail or in-person
delivery. Upon receiving a written request for hearing, a designee of the
village shall schedule a hearing with the requestor, which hearing shall be
scheduled on or before the date specified in the notice of the village's intent
to install a shut-off box on the water service pipe and subsequently terminate
the water supply to the unit. If the written request for a pre-shut-off box
installation/water service termination hearing is timely received by the
village prior to the shut-off box installation/water service disconnection
date, but no administrative adjudication session will take place prior to that
installation/disconnection date, the shut-off box installation and water
service termination shall be delayed until after the hearing takes place. The
hearing shall provide the owner or occupant (or both; if multiple requests for
hearing are tendered to the village, the dispute shall be resolved in a single
hearing) an opportunity to be heard regarding any disputed portion of the
delinquent bill. The hearing shall be open to the public, informal, and the
hearing officer shall accept evidence only pertaining to the accuracy of the
charges. At the close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a
findings, decision and order declaring the amount due and owing, if any, and a
copy of the findings, decision and order shall be provided to the Finance and
Water Departments, as well as the party(ies) requesting the hearing. If the
amount due is found to be different than the amount originally claimed by the
village in its initial notice of shut-off box installation and water service
termination, an amended notice of shut-off box installation and water service
termination shall be served upon the owner and occupant of the property in the
same manner as the initial notice, except that no further opportunity to
request a hearing shall be provided. In such cases, the date for shut-off box
installation and water service termination shall be not less than ten days from
the date of service of the amended notice.
      (3)   The village shall not install a shut-off box on the service pipe
carrying water into the unit subject to the arrears and subsequently disconnect
the water service to any unit for nonpayment during the pendency of a dispute
regarding the amount owed if:
         (a)   A written request for hearing has been remitted by the owner or
occupant, which request shall be made in writing and contain the name, address
and telephone number of the person disputing a charge, identify with
particularity the amount or portion of the bill(s)/charge(s) in dispute, and
state the specific grounds or reasons for which the charges billed are being
disputed (the consumer's ability to pay shall not be a relevant consideration
or basis for dispute); and payment of all undisputed portions of the bill(s) is
made in full; or
         (b)   The hearing officer finds that there is a balance of less than
$500 due and owing the village.
      (4)   The village may install a shut-off box on the service pipe carrying
water into the unit subject to the arrears and subsequently disconnect water
service to that unit for nonpayment if:
         (a)   No written request for hearing has been remitted by the consumer
prior to the shut-off box installation date specified in the village's notice
of impending shut-off box installation and subsequent water service
termination;
         (b)   The dispute is resolved by the hearing officer ordering an
amount due in excess of $1,500 that is not paid in full prior to the shut-off
box installation date specified in the village's notice of impending shut-off
box installation and subsequent water service termination;
         (c)   The consumer fails to pay any undisputed portions of the bill
(s);
         (d)   The consumer fails to appear for the scheduled adjudicatory
hearing;
         (e)   After tendering a written request for hearing as provided
herein, the consumer is unresponsive to the village's attempts to schedule a
hearing date and time; or
         (f)   Following installation of a shut-off box, the consumer pays the
village only the water and sewer charges due but does not reimburse the village
for its expenditures related to the installation of the shut-off box on the
consumer's service pipe.
      (5)   In the event that a shut-off box is installed on the delinquent
unit's water service pipe for nonpayment of water and sewer arrears in excess
of $1,500, the owner and occupant of the unit, if different, shall be jointly
and severally liable to the village for reimbursing it for the costs of such
installation.
      (6)   In the event the water supply is terminated, a $100 fee shall be
charged to have the water supply turned back on, in addition to all other fees
and charges that may have been incurred.
      (7)   When the water supply to a property is turned off, it shall be
unlawful for any person other than a village employee or village designee to
attempt to turn said water supply back on, or to tamper with the water meter,
service connection, service pipes, valves, shut-off boxes or any other element
or appurtenance of the village waterworks system. Any such act shall be
considered a violation of §
52.54, attributable to the owner and/or occupant of the subject property, and a
penalty shall be imposed in accordance with §
52.99(G).
      (8)   When water service is terminated to an attached unit based upon a
failure of the owner or occupant to make full payment of amounts due for water
service within the time specified under the Village Code, prior to the
reinstatement of services to said property, the village may demand full
satisfaction of the outstanding charges for the cost of installing a shut-off
box on the service pipe to the unit, water and/or sewer arrears, late fees and
penalties, the turn-on fee set forth in division (C)(6) of this section,
garbage pickup fees, all expenditures related to preparing and providing notice
(s) of delinquency, and any outstanding code violations pertaining to the
affected unit.
      (9)   The charges and fees described in division (C)(8) of this section
shall be paid by the person owning or occupying, or in possession, charge or
control of such attached unit at the time it is desired to have water service
restored thereto, irrespective of whether such person shall have been the one
responsible for the accumulated charges or fees or fines stemming from
violations of any provision of this division (C) or
Chapter 52 generally.
      (10)   Restoration of service. Following termination of water service,
such service shall be restored immediately to the unit following payment in
full of all outstanding charges for water and/or sewer services, late fees and
penalties, the turn-on fee set forth in division (A)(3) of this section,
garbage pick-up fees, reimbursement to the village for its costs incurred
installing a shut-off box on the service pipe to the unit, all expenditures
related to preparing and providing notice(s) of delinquency, any outstanding
code violations pertaining to the property, and payment of a deposit as
specified in §
52.02, if applicable. Although there is herein established a $1,500 delinquency
threshold triggering the applicability of this division (C), once the village
has installed a shut-off box on the unit's water service pipe and shut off the
water, the entire aggregate balance, as described in division (C)(8) of this
section, must be satisfied in its entirety in order to restore water service to
the unit.
      (11)   Installing a shut-off box at the owner's/occupant's expense and
subsequently shutting off water service for nonpayment shall not be the
exclusive remedy for water service bill delinquencies. The village may also
record a lien for the aggregate delinquent payments and the cost of installing
the shut-off box and foreclose on such liens in accordance with §
52.40 and pursue any other collection methods available to the village by law.
Any and all such courses of action may be pursued simultaneously and shall not
be mutually exclusive to one another.
      (12)   Once a shut-off box has been installed on a water service pipe
servicing an attached unit as described in this division (C) and the water
service has been terminated and subsequently restored following payment in
full, such an attached unit with a water service pipe and dedicated shut-off
box shall henceforth be treated as a detached premises in the same manner and
to the same extent as the properties identified and described in division (A)
of this section, including the 30-day delinquency trigger for water service
termination.
   (D)   Disabled residents.
      (1)   This division (D) shall apply to any disabled individual living in
any dwelling unit described in division (A), (B), or (C) that are supplied
water by the village. A disabled resident is defined as a lawful resident of
the Village of Bellwood who has a physical or mental impairment that
substantially limits one or more major life activities; has a record of such
impairment; or is regarded as having such an impairment. To be considered
disabled under this section, a resident must provide certification of their
status as disabled from a physician licensed in Illinois.
      (2)   The water supply may be shut off to any premises or unit as
described in division (A)(1), (B)(1), or (C)(1) of this section for which the
water bill remains unpaid for a period of 30 days after the bill is rendered
and mailed, insofar as the deposit funds specified in §
52.02, if applicable, are insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance in
full plus any applicable penalties or late fees that may have accrued.
      (3)   No water supply may be shut off until the consumer is given ten
days advance written notice of the village's intent to terminate the water
supply, which notice shall be sent via first class mail sent to the address(es)
at which the consumer registered with the village in the application for water
service as provided in §
52.02(A). The notice required under this division (A)(3), (B)(3), or (C)(3)
shall be in substantially the same form as the detached property water
termination notice attached to Ordinance No. 11-20 and incorporated by
reference herein.
      (4)   (a)   The notice described in division (A)(3) of this section shall
inform the consumer of his or her right to a pre-termination hearing conducted
at the first available administrative adjudication hearing date after a written
request for hearing is remitted by the consumer to the Finance Department,
either by mail or in-person delivery in accordance with division (A)(4)(a)1. of
this section. Upon receiving a written request for a pre-termination hearing, a
designee of the village shall schedule a hearing with the requestor, which
hearing shall be scheduled on or before the disconnection date specified in the
notice of the village's intent to terminate the water supply to the premises.
If the written request for a pre-termination hearing is timely received by the
village prior to the disconnection date, but no administrative adjudication
session will take place prior to the specified termination date, the
termination shall be delayed until after the hearing takes place. The hearing
shall provide the consumer an opportunity to be heard regarding any disputed
portion of the bill. The hearing shall be open to the public, informal, and the
hearing officer shall accept evidence only pertaining to the accuracy of the
charges. At the close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a
findings, decision and order declaring the amount due and owing, if any, and a
copy of the findings, decision and order shall be provided to the Finance and
Water Departments, as well as the party/parties requesting the hearing. If the
amount due is found to be different than the amount originally claimed by the
village in its initial notice of water service termination, an amended notice
of water service termination shall be served upon the owner and tenants of the
property in the same manner as the initial notice, except that no further
opportunity to reguest a hearing shall be provided. In such cases, the date for
water service termination shall be not less than ten days from the date of
service of the amended notice.
         (b)   The village shall not disconnect the water service to any
property for nonpayment during the pendency of the dispute if:
            1.   A written reguest for hearing has been remitted bv the
consumer, which reguest shall be made in writing and contain the name, address
and telephone number of the person disputing a charge, identify with
particularity the amount or portion of the bill(s)/charge(s) in dispute, and
state the specific grounds or reasons for which the charges billed are being
disputed (the consumer's ability to pay shall not be a relevant consideration
or basis for dispute): and payment of all undisputed portions of the bill(s) is
made in full; or
            2.   The hearing officer finds that there is no outstanding balance
due and owing the village.
         (c)   The village may disconnect the water service to any property for
nonpayment if:
            1.   No written request for hearing has been remitted bv the
consumer prior to the termination date specified in the village's notice of
impending water service termination;
            2.   The dispute is resolved bv the hearing officer ordering an
amount due that is not paid in full prior to the termination date specified in
the village's notice of impending water service termination;
            3.   The consumer fails to pay any undisputed portions of the bill
(s);
            4.   The consumer fails to appear for the scheduled adjudicatory
hearing; or
            5.   After tendering a written reguest for hearing as provided
herein, the consumer is unresponsive to the village's attempts to schedule a
hearing date and time.
      (5)   The termination of service will be delayed by 30 days if a
physician licensed in the state of Illinois certifies that disconnection would
adversely affect the health of a disabled household member and the customer
enters into a payment plan with the village prior to the disconnection date
provided in the termination notice. Failure of the customer to comply with the
terms of the payment plan will result in termination of service pursuant to the
procedures described above.
      (6)   Disabled residents may enter into a payment plan with the village
prior to the village issuing a termination notice from the village. If a
payment plan is entered into prior to the village issuing a termination notice,

Department of Motor Vehicles, the Illinois Secretary of State or any other
state agency or bureau, shall be subject to the provisions of this section and
the owner thereof shall be required to acquire the appropriate license as
prescribed by this section. It shall be unlawful for any person to operate any
vehicle specified in §
70.03 or trailer without first obtaining a license for such and paying the fee
prescribed by this section. The requirements of this section shall also apply
to those vehicles which are garaged or housed within the village even though
the title or registration on file with the Illinois Department of Motor
Vehicles or the Illinois Secretary of State may designate an address for the
owner outside of the village unless such vehicles have previously been licensed
for the current year by another municipality in which they are also housed or
garaged, in which they are used for at least 20% of their use, and in which the
owner resides or has a principal place of business.
   (G)   Certain state licenses prerequisite to issuance. No license shall be
issued to the owner or lessee of any truck, tractor, trailer or bus unless a
license has already been issued therefor by the state.
   (H)   License tag.

fixed referred to in this section shall be furnished with an appropriate
license tag which the owner shall affix to such vehicle by attaching the same
in the lower right-hand corner of the windshield of such vehicle and in a
conspicuous place upon such motorbike, motorcycle, motor scooter or trailer.
      (2)   The license tag required in this section shall be attached in the
appropriate location no later than midnight of the thirtieth day of April of
each year. Any license year that is greater than 12 months shall result in the
proportionate adjustment to the license fee such that the annual license fee
shall equal the annual license fee divided by 12 and then multiplied by the
number of months included in the actual license year. In the event that a
license tag is issued for a vehicle or trailer for a given license year after
the thirtieth day of April of the license year, it shall be attached by the
owner immediately upon its issuance.
   (I)   Duplicate tag. A duplicate license tag may be issued when the original
license tag has become mutilated beyond service ability, lost, stolen, or for
other proper cause. Whenever possible the original license shall be surrendered
before a duplicate is issued. Application for a duplicate license tag shall be
made on a form provided and shall contain a brief statement by the applicant
giving the circumstances requiring the need for a duplicate. A fee of $1 shall
be charged for the duplicate license tag.

vehicles held for demonstration; fee; application to service vehicles. Dealers
in motor vehicles licensed by the State of Illinois and the village shall be
required to purchase a license for each pair of special plates or single
special plate such dealer receives from the Secretary of State. The license
shall be affixed to the state plate when displayed on the vehicle and may be
used on any vehicle held for sale or demonstration in the dealer's ownership.
The first vehicle license dealer's plate shall be issued at a fee of $70 and
each additional plate thereafter at a fee of $20. Service vehicles owned and
used incident to the business of dealers in motor vehicles shall require a
license as provided herein.
   (L)   Fleet licenses; fee; certificate and tag; issuance and administration.
      (1)   Each owner of 20 or more motor vehicles, as provided on the annual
listing from the Illinois Department of Motor Vehicles or from the Illinois
Secretary of State's office procured by the village during the six-month period
immediately preceding the commencement of the license year, may apply for a
fleet license covering each owned vehicle collectively on application forms as
provided by the Village Comptroller. The fee for the issuance of a fleet
license, including a fleet license certificate, and fleet license tags equal in
number to the number of motor vehicles within the fleet, shall equal the sum of
the license fees for each of the vehicles within the fleet in accord with the
fees as established from time to time by the Village Board. A certificate of a
fleet license shall issue listing the vehicle identification number of the
vehicles included within the fleet as of the commencement of the license year.
A duplicate certificate of the fleet license shall be retained on the files of
the Village Comptroller. During the license year, the fleet owner shall notify
by written correspondence the Village Comptroller when any motor vehicle
included within the fleet is removed from ownership or otherwise from inclusion
within the licensing authority under this chapter and, in the event that a new
motor vehicle replaces the withdrawn motor vehicle, advising the Village
Comptroller of the vehicle identification number of any such new motor vehicle.
No fee shall be charged for the transfer or periodic addition of motor vehicles
to be included within the fleet license so long as the number of vehicles is
not in excess of the number of vehicles at the commencement of the license
year. The number of motor vehicles included within the fleet license may be
expanded during the license year by the payment of additional license fees for
each additional vehicle. The fleet licensee shall notify the village of each
motor vehicle exchange, transfer, withdrawal, or addition within ten days of
each such occurrence. In the event that the owner fails to notify the village
as required herein with respect to any additional motor vehicle other than as
listed within the original fleet license, such vehicle shall be deemed to have
been acquired outside of the fleet license provision; and the owner shall be
liable for any payment of the license fee and any late payment fees as provided
within this chapter. The Village Comptroller's office shall compare the listed
vehicles from the Department of Motor Vehicles or from the Secretary of State
for the next following license year with that of the preceding year to
determine any failures on the part of a fleet license holder to notify the
village as required herein and shall invoice the fleet licensee for all motor
vehicles for which proper and timely notification did not issue to the village.
Such charges shall be in addition to the license fee for the following license
year.
      (2)   The fleet licensee shall not be required to display an individual
vehicle license tag on each vehicle within the fleet. Notwithstanding, fleet
license tags in equal number to the number of vehicles included within the
fleet license at the commencement of the license year will be made available
upon the request of the fleet licensee and may be displayed at the fleet
licensee's election. It shall be unlawful for any person to display, or cause
to be displayed, a fleet license tag upon a motor vehicle not included within
the fleet license as on file with the Village Comptroller. Any person affixing
the fleet license tag to any vehicle not properly included within the license
shall be fined not less than $750 upon conviction for each vehicle fleet
license tag improperly and unlawfully displayed.
   (M)   Police Department determination of vehicle addresses. The members of
the Police Department are hereby authorized to procure a current annual listing
from the Illinois Department of Motor Vehicles or from the Illinois Secretary
of State’s office listing the declared addresses of the operators, lessees or
titleholders of motor vehicles as of the first day of May that are within the
village limits. If any vehicles are licensed and listed to addresses within the
village but have not applied for or received a license from the village, then
the members of the Police Department shall initiate proper proceedings to
determine whether a violation has occurred. It shall be presumed that where any
vehicle is listed with the Illinois Department of Motor Vehicles, the Illinois
Secretary of State’s records or any other state agency’s or bureau’s records as
being within the village and where the vehicle has not received a license under
the terms of this section, then the vehicle and any operator of it shall be in
violation hereof and subject to prosecution.

§ 70.42 AUTOMATED TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM.
   (A)   Detection. As used in this section, AUTOMATED TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT
SYSTEM means a device within the village with one or more motor vehicle sensors
working in conjunction with a red light signal to produce recorded images of
motor vehicles entering an intersection against a steady or flashing red signal
indication in violation of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-306, and §§
70.30 and
70.31. The automated traffic law enforcement system shall not be used to
enforce speed limit regulations. The recorded images produced by the automated
traffic law enforcement system, which consist of either two or more
photographs, two or more micrographs, two or more electronic images or a video
recording showing the motor vehicle, shall capture and display images of the
vehicle allegedly violating traffic-control signals, together with the
registration plate on such vehicle, and shall also show the time, date and
location of the violation.
   (B)   Signage. Any intersection equipped with an automated traffic law
enforcement system must have a sign posted which is visible to approaching
traffic indicating that the intersection is being monitored by an automated
traffic law enforcement system.
   (C)   Procurement. When purchasing the equipment and services required
implementing the automated traffic law enforcement system, the contract price
must reflect the value of the equipment and services provided and may not be
based on the number of citations issued or a percentage of the revenue
generated by the system.
   (D)   Notice of violation. When the automated traffic law enforcement system
records a motor vehicle entering an intersection in spite of a steady or
flashing red signal indication in violation of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-306,
and §§
70.30 and
70.31, the village shall issue a written notice of the violation to the
registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, which shall be delivered by first
class mail within 30 days after the Illinois Secretary of State notifies the
village of the identity of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, and
in no event later than 90 days following the violation. Each notice of
violation associated with an automated traffic law violation shall require a
review of the associated recorded image by a technician employed or contracted
by the village, who shall inspect the image and determine whether the motor
vehicle violated ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-306, and/or §§
70.30 and
70.31, or whether one of the defenses enumerated below in division (F) is
visibly applicable upon inspection. Upon determination that the recorded image
captures a violation of one of the foregoing provisions and that no defense
applies, the notice of violation shall be served upon the registered vehicle
owner in the manner provided for below. The Traffic Compliance Administrator
shall retain a copy of all violation notices, recorded images and other
correspondence mailed to the alleged violator. Each notice of violation, which
shall constitute evidence of the facts contained in the notice and is
admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation of the above-noted statutory
and local provisions and shall establish prima facie evidence of a violation,
subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in division (F) of
this section, shall include the following:
      (1)   The name and address of the registered owner or lessee of the
vehicle, as indicated by the records of the Secretary of State, or, if such
information is outdated or unattainable, then the last known address recorded
in a United States Post Office approved database;
      (2)   The registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the
violation;
      (3)   The violation charged, with specific reference to that section of
the village code allegedly violated;
      (4)   The location where the violation occurred;
      (5)   The date and time of the violation;
      (6)   A copy of the recorded images;
      (7)   The amount of the civil penalty imposed under divisions (G)(2), (H)
(1) or (M) of this section and the date by which the civil penalty should be
paid if liability for the violation is not going to be contested;
      (8)   A statement that the recorded images are evidence of a violation of
a red light signal;
      (9)   A warning that failure to either pay the civil penalty or to
contest liability within 21 days of the mailing of the notice of violation is
an admission of liability and may result in a suspension of the driving
privileges of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle in addition to the
specified penalties for failing to appear at the hearing or pay the fine in
advance of the hearing; and
      (10)   A statement that the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle may
elect to proceed either by paying the fine stated in the notice of violation or
by challenging the charge in an administrative hearing or, for non-residents of
the village, by mail in accordance with division (L) of this section, and that
failure to pay the stated fine within the allotted time will operate to process
the violation notice within the administrative adjudication system and give
rise to a mandatory appearance at the administrative hearing.
   (E)   Notice of determination of liability. If the registered owner fails to
pay or contest the notice of red light violation within 21 days a notice of
determination of liability will be sent to the owner indicating that a fine in
the amount of $100 is due. The notice will also state that the registered owner
can petition the village to set aside the determination of liability before it
becomes final. If the owner does not pay the $100 as specified in the notice or
petition the municipality to set aside the determination within 14 days, a
notice of final determination will be sent to the owner indicating that the
owner has exhausted all challenge options and the $100 fine is a debt due and
owing to the village and must be paid within 14 days. The owner will also be
notified that the failure to pay the $100 fine within 14 days will result in a
late fee of $100 added to the original fine.
   (F)   Defenses. The following are the only defenses available for an alleged
violator contesting his or her liability for a violation, which shall be
weighed by the Hearing Officer and shall only rebut the prima facie case
established by the notice of liability insofar as one or more of the following
defenses are established by a preponderance of the evidence:
      (1)   The motor vehicle or registration plates were stolen before the
violation occurred and were not under the control of or in the possession of
the owner at the time of the violation, which may be demonstrated through the
submission of a certified copy of a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle
or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely
matter;
      (2)   The driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection in spite
of a red light either to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle or as
part of a funeral procession.
   (G)   Expired registration plates.
      (1)   No person shall operate a vehicle, nor shall any person permit the
operation of a vehicle, which is required to have motor vehicle registration
plates under Section 3-413 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or the laws of another
state in order to be operated upon the public highways, upon which is displayed
an invalid or expired registration plate, plates or registration sticker issued
by the State of Illinois or another state when such vehicle is on a public
street in the village, or in a parking lot owned by the village.
      (2)   A vehicle found upon a public street in the village, or in a
parking lot owned by the village, in violation of this division shall subject
the owner thereof to a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $100 for each
day that such vehicle remains in violation of this division.
      (3)   Any images recorded by the automated traffic law enforcement system
showing a vehicle with expired or otherwise invalid vehicle registration
plates, issued by the State of Illinois or any other state, may be used to
enforce this division (G). All such recorded imagery must comply in all
respects with the mandates of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-208.6, including, but
not limited to, the requirements that the recorded image provide a clear image
of the vehicle and the vehicle's license plate and display the time, date and
location of the violation.
      (4)   Violations of this division shall be deemed vehicle compliance
violations related to the condition and use of vehicle equipment and be subject
to the village's system of administrative adjudication.
   (H)   Administrative adjudication.
      (1)   All vehicular standing and parking violations, violations
concerning the condition and use of vehicle equipment, violations regarding the
display of municipal wheel tax licenses, the display of expired Illinois
registration plates and stickers and automated traffic law violations shall be
resolved through the village's system of administrative adjudication, codified
in
Chapter 32 of this Code of Ordinances. All such offenses are civil in nature
and are to be adjudicated through the administrative system with fines levied
up to $250 upon a finding of liability, except for those violations detected by
the automated traffic law enforcement system, for which no uniform traffic
citation is issued at the time of the offense, in which case the maximum fine
shall be $100, with additional penalties of up to $100 for delinquent payment.
      (2)    The Village President, with the advice and consent of the Board of
Trustees, shall appoint a Traffic Compliance Administrator for a term not to
exceed that of the Village President's current term of office, who shall
oversee the administration of all sections of the village code pertaining to
parking, standing, condition and use of vehicle equipment, display of municipal
wheel tax licenses, display of Illinois registration plates and stickers and
automated traffic law regulations. The Traffic Compliance Administrator is
authorized to adopt, distribute and process parking, compliance and automated
traffic law violation notices, collect money paid as fines and penalties for
the above-noted violations, operate the traffic compliance division of the
administrative adjudication system and make certified reports to the Secretary
of State regarding a registered vehicle owner’s failure to pay fines and
penalties in accordance with Illinois state law. The Traffic Compliance
Administrator is hereby vested with all of the powers and duties granted to the
Code Administrator in §§
32.109(B) and
32.114(E) with respect to violations to be adjudicated under this section of
the village code, and shall have all of the powers granted by ILCS Ch. 625, Act
5, § 11-208.3(b)(1), the provisions of which are incorporated herein by
reference.
      (3)   Officers, independent contractors and employees involved with the
portion of the administrative adjudication system that adjudicates alleged
violations occurring under this section shall be vested with the power,
authority and limitations as set forth in
Chapter 32 of this Code of Ordinances.
      (4)   Violation notices concerning parking, standing, condition and use
of vehicle equipment, display of municipal wheel tax licenses, the display of
expired Illinois registration plates and stickers and automated traffic law
regulations shall contain the information specified in §
32.114(B) and (C) of this Code of Ordinances and provide a hearing date on
which the violation may be contested on its merits and notify the alleged
violator of his or her right to be represented by legal counsel at the
administrative hearing.
      (5)   Violation notices shall be served in the following manner:
         (a)   Violations concerning parking, standing, condition and use of
vehicle equipment, or display of municipal wheel tax licenses, and the display
of expired Illinois registration plates and stickers shall be served in
accordance with §
32.114(B) of this Code of Ordinances.
         (b)   Violation notices for automated traffic law regulations must be
mailed to the address of the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle as
recorded with the Secretary of State within 30 days after the Secretary of
State notifies the village of the identity of the registered vehicle owner, but
no later than 90 days after the date of the violation. If the notice of
violation is returned as undeliverable, then the notice of violation must be
sent to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved
database, which notice shall still be sent within 90 days of the violation.
      (6)   Any person on whom a violation notice has been served pursuant to
this section shall within 21 days from the date of the notice either pay the
indicated fine or request an administrative adjudication hearing. In the event
that the registered vehicle owner elects to contest the merits of the alleged
violation in lieu of paying the civil penalty, an administrative hearing shall
be held not less than 30 days and no more than 40 days after the mailing of the
notice of violation, which date shall be provided on the notice of in-person
hearing, together with the pre-hearing date on which the penalty shall be due
in order to generate a final disposition and obviate the administrative
adjudication process.
      (7)   Except as specifically noted herein, hearings shall be conducted in
accordance with the procedures established in §
32.112 of this Code of Ordinances. Hearings shall be tape recorded.
      (8)   Alleged violators who have requested an administrative hearing but
fail to pay the indicated fine prior to the hearing and do not appear on their
scheduled hearing date shall have a default judgment entered against them,
which shall constitute a final determination of liability.
      (9)   The Hearing Officer must enter either a default judgment or a
determination of liability or non-liability, in accordance with consideration
of the facts and testimony. The Hearing Officer shall issue a written
determination, based on the evidence presented at the hearing, of whether a
violation of the village code exists. The determination shall include findings
of fact, a decision and order setting forth the fine, penalty or action with
which the person found liable must comply, impose penalties consistent with
applicable village code provisions and assess costs upon finding a party liable
for the charged violation, which costs shall include payment of a $40
administrative adjudication fee. The administrative adjudication fee and any
other costs shall be assessed against any violator found to be in default,
found to be liable, or where the alleged violator has corrected a violation
prior to the hearing but where the hearing officer finds that a violation
existed at the time of issuance of the citation.
      (10)   The determination of liability issued by the Hearing Officer shall
constitute a final determination for purposes of judicial review and shall be
subject to review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law, ILCS Ch. 735,
Act 5, §§ 3-101, et seq.
      (11)   Upon expiration of the period in which judicial review under the
Illinois Administrative Review Law may be sought for a final determination of a
village code violation, the findings, decision and order of the Hearing Officer
may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction.
      (12)   Upon expiration of the period in which judicial review under the
Administrative Review Law may be sought for a final determination of a village
code violation, a notice of final determination of liability shall be sent to
the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle, stating that the unpaid
fine or penalty is a debt due and owing the village. The notice of final
determination shall also warn the liable party that a failure to pay any fine
or penalty due and owing the village within 14 days of the issuance of the
notice of final determination may result in the village's filing of a petition
in the Circuit Court to have the unpaid fine or penalty rendered a judgment, or
may result in suspension of the liable party's driver's license and/or
immobilization of the violator's registered vehicle where such party has failed
to pay fines or penalties for ten or more standing, parking or compliance
violations or five or more automated traffic law violations.
      (13)   Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the village from
pursuing all available remedies, allowed by law, to collect money judgments.
   (I)   Petition to set aside determination of liability. 
      (1)   Any person owing an unpaid fine or penalty to the village in light
of a determination of liability by a Hearing Officer and the expiration of the
period for judicial review may file a petition with the Traffic Compliance
Administrator in-person within 14 days of the village's issuance of a notice of
determination of liability, as provided above in division (H)(9). The petition
to set aside the determination of liability must be premised on one of the
following grounds:
         (a)   The petitioner was not the registered owner or lessee of the
cited vehicle on the date that the violation notice was issued;
         (b)   The petitioner already paid the fine or penalty for the

of this traffic code prohibiting parking a vehicle in a designated area, or
restricting the length of time a vehicle may be there parked, or parking in a

SPEED RESTRICTIONS
§ 71.001 SPEED LIMITS.
   (A)   (1)   No vehicle may be driven upon any highway of this village at a
speed which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic
conditions and the use of the highway, or which endangers the safety of any
person or property. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the
applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to
decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching
and going around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when traveling upon any
narrow or winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists with respect to
pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions.
Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person
or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and
the duty of all persons to use due care.
      (2)   For purposes of this section, “urban district” does not include any
interstate highway as defined in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 1-133.1 which includes
all highways under the jurisdiction of the Illinois State Toll Highway

71.002, or by a regulation or ordinance made under this chapter.
   (C)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit in an urban district (as defined in §
70.01) for all vehicles is:
      (1)   Thirty miles per hour; and
      (2)   Ten miles per hour in an alley.
   (D)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit in a non-urban district shall be as determined under
ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-601.
   (E)   A first violation of this section is a petty offense with a minimum
fine of $150. A second or subsequent violation of this section is a petty

per hour while passing a school zone, or while traveling on a local, county, or
state roadway on public school property or upon any public thoroughfare where
children pass going to and from school.
   (D)   This section shall not be applicable unless appropriate signs are
posted upon streets wherein the school zone is located. The signs shall give
proper due warning that a school zone is being approached, and shall indicate
the school zone and the maximum speed limit in effect during school days when
school children are present.
   (E)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the use of electronic speed-
detecting devices within 500 feet of signs within a special school speed zone
indicating the zone, as defined in this section, nor shall evidence obtained
thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for speed, provided the use of the
device shall apply only to the enforcement of the speed limit in the special
school speed zone.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2), a person who violates
this section is guilty of is a petty offense. Violations of this section are
punishable with a minimum fine of $150 for the first violation, a minimum fine
of $300 for the second or subsequent violation, and community service in an

purposes. If the violation occurred in a dual school district, $25 of the
surcharge shall be paid to the elementary school district for school safety
purposes and $25 of the surcharge shall be paid to the high school district for
school safety purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the entire
$50 surcharge shall be paid to the appropriate school district or districts.
      (2)   For purposes of this section, SCHOOL SAFETY PURPOSES include the
costs associated with school zone safety education, the Safe Routes to School
Program under Section 2705-317 of the Department of Transportation Law of the
Civil Administrative Code of Illinois, safety programs within the School Safety

SPECIAL STOPS REQUIRED
§ 71.080 OBEDIENCE TO SIGNAL INDICATING APPROACH OF TRAIN OR RAILROAD TRACK
EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   Whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade
crossing where the driver is not always required to stop, the person must
exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a
highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in
this section, the driver shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet
from the nearest rail of the railroad, and shall not proceed until the tracks
are clear and he or she can do so safely. The foregoing requirements shall
apply when:
      (1)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives
warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (2)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagger gives or continues to
give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (3)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment approaching a highway
crossing emits a warning signal and the train or railroad track equipment, by
reason of its speed or nearness to the crossing, is an immediate hazard;
      (4)   An approaching railroad train or railroad track equipment is
plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to the crossing;
      (5)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment is approaching so
closely that an immediate hazard is created. Whenever a person driving a
vehicle approaches a railroad grade crossing where the driver is not always
required to stop but must slow down, the person must exercise due care and
caution as the existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning of
danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in this section, the driver
shall slow down within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail
of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or she checks that the tracks
are clear of an approaching train or railroad track equipment.
   (B)   No person shall drive any vehicle through, around, or under any
crossing gate or barrier at a railroad crossing while the gate or barrier is
closed or is being opened or closed.
   (C)   When stop signs are erected at railroad grade crossings, the driver of
any vehicle shall stop within 0 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest
rail of the railroad, and shall proceed only upon exercising due care.
   (D)   At any railroad grade crossing provided with railroad crossbuck signs,
without automatic, electric, or mechanical signal devices, crossing gates, or a
human flagger giving a signal of the approach or passage of a train or railroad
track equipment, the driver of a vehicle shall in obedience to the railroad
crossbuck sign, yield the right-of-way and slow down to a speed reasonable for
the existing conditions and shall stop, if required for safety, at a clearly
marked stopped line, or if no stop line, within 50 feet but not less than 15
feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or
she can do so safely. If a driver is involved in a collision at a railroad
crossing or interferes with the movement of a train or railroad track equipment
after driving past the railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or interference
is prima facie evidence of the driver's failure to yield right-of-way.
   (E)   No person shall, while driving a commercial motor vehicle, fail to
negotiate a railroad-highway grade railroad crossing because of insufficient
undercarriage clearance.
   (F)   It is unlawful to violate any part of this section.
      (1)   A violation of this section is a petty offense for which a fine of
$250 shall be imposed for a first violation, and a fine of $500 shall be
imposed for a second or subsequent violation. The court may impose 25 hours of
community service in place of the $250 fine for the first violation.
      (2)   For a second or subsequent violation, the Secretary of State may
suspend the driving privileges of the offender for a minimum of six months.

      (1)   At any railroad grade crossing where traffic is controlled by a
police officer or flagger;
      (2)   At any railroad grade crossing controlled by a functioning traffic-
control signal transmitting a green indication which, under law, permits the
vehicle to proceed across the railroad tracks without slowing or stopping,
except that division (A) of this section shall apply to any school bus;
      (3)   At any streetcar grade crossing within a business or residence
district; or
      (4)   At any abandoned industrial or spur track railroad grade crossing
designated as exempt by the Illinois Commerce Commission and marked with an

ticket imposing a fine by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the

   (B)   The notice of impending driver's license suspension shall be sent by
first class mail, postage prepaid, to the address recorded with the Secretary
of State or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the

§ 71.162 DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSION.
   (A)   The Traffic Compliance Administrator, by certified report, shall
request that the Secretary of State suspend the driving privileges of an owner
of a registered vehicle who has failed to pay any fine or penalty due and owing
as a result of five automated traffic violations. The report shall be certified
and contain the following:
      (1)   The name, last known address as recorded with the Secretary of
State, as provided by the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease, or
as recorded in a United States post office approved database if any notice sent
under this subchapter is returned as undeliverable, and driver's license number
of the person who failed to pay the fine or penalty and the registration number
of any vehicle known to be registered to such person in a state;
      (2)   The name of the municipality making the report pursuant to this
section; and
      (3)   A statement that a notice of impending driver's license suspension
has been sent to the person named in the report at the address recorded with

vehicle at the time of the lease or, if any notice sent under this subchapter
is returned as undeliverable at the last known address recorded at a United
States Post Office approved database; the date on which such notice was sent;
and address to which such notice was sent.
   (B)   The Traffic Compliance Administrator shall notify the Secretary of
State whenever a person named in the certified report has paid the previously
recorded fine or penalty or whenever the municipality determines that the
original report was in error. A certified copy of such notification shall also
be given upon request and at no additional charge to the person named therein.
   (C)   Any person receiving notice from the Secretary of State that their
driving privileges may be suspended at the end of a specified period may
challenge the accuracy of the certified report prepared by the Traffic
Compliance Administrator. The person shall, within seven days after having
received notice from the Secretary of State, request an opportunity to speak
with the Traffic Compliance Administrator to challenge the accuracy of the
certified report. If the Traffic Compliance Administrator determines that the
original report was in error due to the fact that the person challenging the
report was not the owner or lessee of the vehicle or that the person has
already paid their fine for the five or more automated traffic violations, the
Traffic Compliance Administrator shall immediately notify the Secretary of
State of such error in a subsequent certified report.
(Ord. 11-1, passed 1-12-11)

automated traffic law violation. In the event that such penalty is not paid
within 14 days after service of a final determination of liability, an
additional $100 late payment penalty shall be imposed. A penalty shall not
apply if the driver of the motor vehicle received a uniform traffic citation
from a police officer at the time of the violation. The village may not charge
court costs or hearing fees to persons found liable after exercising their
right to appear and contest the violation at an administrative hearing.

11-301, designating such parking space as a handicapped parking space. The
Village President or his or her designee shall maintain a list of all
handicapped parking spaces in the village which list shall be made available to
the public. It shall be no defense to any person cited for parking in a
handicapped parking space in violation of this subchapter that the list of
parking spaces maintained by the Village President does not reflect the
reservation of a parking space for handicapped persons, as long as a reasonable
person would be made aware by the handicapped parking sign or notice on or near
the parking place that the place is reserved for a person with disabilities.
(Am. Ord. 01-35, passed 10-10-01)
   (B)   Unauthorized use of parking spaces.
      (1)   (a)   It shall be prohibited to park any motor vehicle which is not

to a disabled veteran pursuant to ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 3-609, as evidence
that the vehicle is operated by or for a person with disabilities or disabled
veteran, in any parking place, including any private or public off-street
parking facility, specifically reserved, by the posting of an official sign as
designated under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-301, for motor vehicles displaying
such registration plates. It shall be prohibited to park any motor vehicle in a
designated access aisle adjacent to any parking place specifically reserved for
persons with disabilities, by the posting of an official sign as designated
under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-301, for motor vehicles displaying such
registration plates. When using the parking privileges for persons with
disabilities, the parking decal or device must be displayed properly in the
vehicle where it is clearly visible to law enforcement personnel, either
hanging from the rearview mirror or placed on the dashboard of the vehicle in
clear view. Any motor vehicle properly displaying a disability license plate or
a parking decal or device containing the international symbol of access issued
to persons with disabilities by any local authority, state, district,
territory, or foreign country shall be recognized as a valid license plate or
device and receive the same parking privileges as residents of the village. In
no event shall any person be permitted to park in a designated handicapped
parking space for a period of greater than 60 minutes in any two-hour period
unless otherwise permitted by village-installed signage.
         (b)   An individual with a vehicle displaying disability license
plates or a parking decal or device issued to a qualified person with a
disability under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §§ 3-616, 11-1301.1, or 11-1301.2 or to a
disabled veteran under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 3-609 is in violation of this

or device is not the authorized holder of the disability license plate or
parking decal or device or is not transporting the authorized holder of the
disability license plate or parking decal or device to or from the parking
location; and

or device to exercise any privileges granted through the disability license
plate or parking decals or devices under state law.
      (2)   Any person or local authority owning or operating any public or
private off-street parking facility may, after notifying the Police Department,
remove or cause to be removed to the nearest garage or other place of safety
any vehicle parked within a stall or space reserved for use by a person with
disabilities which does not display person with disabilities registration
plates or a special decal or device as required under this section.
      (3)   Any person found guilty of violating the provisions of division (B)
(1)(a) of this section shall be fined as set forth in §
72.99 in addition to any costs or charges connected with the removal or storage
of any motor vehicle authorized under this section. The village shall display
signs indicating the fine imposed, and if the amount of the fine is
subsequently changed, the village shall change the sign to indicate the current
amount of the fine. It shall not be a defense to a charge under this section
that either the sign posted pursuant to this section or the intended accessible
parking place does not comply with the technical requirements of ILCS Ch. 625,
Act 5, § 11-1301, Department regulations, or local ordinance if a reasonable
person would be made aware by the sign or notice on or near the parking space
that the place is reserved for a person with disabilities.

for the use of nonresidents who are temporary visitors of the resident permit
district. These permits shall be good for one day only and must be attached to

the date of the termination notice to object to the action taken and submit to
the Director of Public Safety proof of the continuing need for the reserved
parking privilege. All objections to the termination notice must be made in

disabled resident or Bellwood institution desires a drop-off zone for disabled
persons, the application for such a zone shall follow the procedures of this
section and criteria listed.
   (I)   Drop-off zones for persons with disabilities shall meet the following
criteria:
      (1)   The person or entity seeking the drop-off zone for persons with
disabilities must demonstrate the need for such a zone. Factors to be
considered in determining the need for such a drop-off zone shall include the
following: the number of persons with disabilities traveling to and from the
proposed drop-off zone location, the frequency of this activity, the
difficulties encountered without the proposed drop-off zone and the alternate
solutions available.
      (2)   The proposed drop-off zone for persons with disabilities shall not
have a substantial negative impact on existing parking and traffic conditions
in the area.
      (3)   The need which must be demonstrated under this division must not be
the need for parking for persons with disabilities, but rather the need for a
location to stop a vehicle which carries a person or persons with disabilities
only long enough to drop off or pick up such person or persons from a
designated place. The regular use of special motor vehicles or buses for the
transport of persons with disabilities to and from a designated place shall be
considered as evidence indicating the need for a drop-off zone for persons with
disabilities, rather than the need for parking for persons with disabilities.
      (4)   Drop-off zones can be up to eight feet in length, based on the
review procedures described herein.

officer has probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle is subject to
seizure and impoundment pursuant to this chapter, such police officer shall
cause the motor vehicle to be seized and impounded in accordance with the
procedures set forth herein, unless the police officer, acting in his or her
sole discretion and considering the totality of the circumstances, determines
that seizure and impoundment is not reasonably necessary to protect public
safety because the motor vehicle is capable of being operated in a safe manner
by the properly-licensed owner of the motor vehicle. If the police officer so
concludes, then a motor vehicle shall not be impounded, but rather be released
into the custody of the owner. Such determination may only be made where the
police officer finds all of the following:
         (a)   The owner of the motor vehicle was not operating the motor
vehicle at the time of the traffic stop; and
         (b)   The owner of the motor vehicle was not involved in any manner
with the commission of any of the activities set forth in division (B)(1)
above; and
         (c)   The owner of the motor vehicle is available and capable of
safely and lawfully removing the motor vehicle from the scene without delay;
and
         (d)   The owner of the motor vehicle furnishes:
            1.   Proof of valid, current motor vehicle insurance as required by
the Illinois Vehicle Code;

      (1)   The provisions of this section shall be in addition to and shall
not replace or otherwise abrogate any existing state or federal law or village
ordinance that relates to the seizure and/or impoundment of motor vehicles, and
the administrative fee provided herein shall be in addition to any and all
penalties that may be assessed or imposed by a court or administrative Hearing
Officer for the violation of any underlying criminal or quasi-criminal offense
or local ordinance violation.
   (D)   Exceptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply if at the
time of the offense the vehicle was stolen and the theft was reported to the
appropriate police authority within 24 hours after the theft was discovered, or
the vehicle was otherwise operated without the knowledge and express or implied
consent of the registered owner.
   (E)   Notice; towing; release.
      (1)   Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a
vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section and the
police officer has arrested the operator or person in physical control of the
vehicle for any of the offenses set forth in division (B)(1) above, the police
officer shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility authorized by
the village. Prior to or at the time the vehicle is towed, the police officer
shall notify or make a reasonable attempt to notify the owner or any person
identifying himself or herself as the owner of the vehicle, or any person who
is found to be in physical control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged
offense, of the fact of the seizure and of the vehicle owners right to request
a preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing to be conducted in accordance with
division (F)(1) and hearing pursuant to division (F)(2) herein. The vehicle
shall be impounded pending the completion of the hearing(s) provided for in
division (F)(1) and (2) herein, unless the owner of the vehicle or someone on
his or her behalf posts with the village a cash bond in the amount of $500 and
pays the towing and storage charges.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (E)(1) above, the
arresting police officer may release the vehicle prior to towing if the vehicle
subject to seizure and impoundment was not owned by the person placed under
arrest and the registered owner or some other person legally authorized to
possess the vehicle shall arrive at the scene of the arrest prior to the actual
removal or towing of the vehicle and the lawful owner or person lawfully
entitled to possession of the vehicle possesses a valid operators license,
proof of ownership or registration, proof of liability insurance and would not,
as determined by the arresting police officer, indicate a lack of ability to
operate the motor vehicle in a safe manner, or who would otherwise, by
operating the motor vehicle, not be in violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code.
If the vehicle subject to seizure and impoundment is owned by the person under
arrest, the arresting officer may, prior to the actual removal or towing of the
vehicle, release the vehicle to another person with the written consent of the
owner, provided that such other person possesses a valid operators license,
proof of liability insurance and would not, as determined by the arresting
police officer, indicate a lack of ability to operate the motor vehicle in a
safe manner or who would otherwise, by operating the motor vehicle, not be in
violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code.
   (F)   Hearings.
      (1)   Preliminary hearing. The owner of record of a vehicle seized and
impounded may contest the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle by requesting
a preliminary hearing. To be effective, the owner must make a written request
for a preliminary hearing within 24 hours of the seizure. The request shall be
deemed filed upon delivery to the Bellwood Police Department, directed to the
attention of the Chief of Police. The Chief of Police or his or her designee
shall conduct the preliminary hearing within 24 hours after receipt of the
request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or village holidays, in which case the
preliminary hearing shall be heard on the next business day after the request.
All interested parties shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at
the preliminary hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the
hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is of the type
commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their
affairs. The village shall not be required to produce any police officer or
other witness at the preliminary hearing. Any and all reports, records,
tickets, citations or other documents prepared or maintained in the normal
course of village business may be admitted into evidence at the preliminary
hearing and such documents shall be considered to be prima facie proof of the
truth and correctness of the facts, statements and contents contained therein
without the need for any additional foundation or testimony. If, at the
conclusion of the hearing, the Chief of Police or his or her designee
determines that (i) there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle was
operated, used, or in the physical control of any person with the consent of
the owner of record of such vehicle, during the commission of any offense
enumerated in division (B)(1) above and was therefore properly subject to
seizure and impoundment, and (ii) that the impoundment was reasonably necessary
as a community caretaking function at the time of impoundment in order to not
jeopardize the public safety, then he or she shall order the continued
impoundment of the vehicle as herein provided, unless the owner of the vehicle
posts with the village a cash bond in the amount of $500 and pays any
applicable towing and storage fees. If the Chief of Police or his or her
designee determines that there is no such probable cause to believe the vehicle
was used or operated during the commission or attempted commission of the
offenses set forth in division (B)(1) above, or the Chief of Police or his or
her designee determines that the impoundment was not reasonably necessary as a
community caretaking function at the time of impoundment, then the vehicle
shall be returned to the registered owner without payment of the administrative
fee or the posting of any bond.
      (2)   Notice; procedures; final hearing. Within ten days after a vehicle
is seized and impounded, the Chief of Police or his or her designee shall
notify the registered owner of record of the seized and impounded vehicle by
certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail, postage
prepaid, of the date, time, and location of a final hearing to be conducted.
Notice by certified mail need not be given when the owner of the vehicle has
been personally served with notice, in written form, of the time, date and
location of the final hearing. Such final hearing shall take place within 45
days of the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle. The owner shall appear at
the hearing and enter a determination to contest or not contest the basis of
the seizure and impoundment.
         (a)   If the owner elects not to contest the basis for the seizure,
the Hearing Officer shall review the evidence and, if he or she determines by a
preponderance of the evidence that the seizure and impoundment was proper, the
Hearing Officer shall issue a written order finding the owner of the vehicle
liable to the village for an administrative fee in the amount of $500. The
village shall not be required to produce any police officer or other witness at
the hearing. Any and all reports, records, tickets, citations or other
documents prepared or maintained in the normal course of village business may
be admitted into evidence at the preliminary hearing and such documents shall
be considered to be prima facie proof of the truth and correctness of the
facts, statements and contents contained therein without the need for any
additional foundation or testimony.
         (b)   1.   If the owner elects to contest the basis for the
impoundment and seizure, a hearing shall be held immediately, unless continued
by order of the Hearing Officer. Continuances shall only be granted for good
cause shown. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
be heard at the hearing. At any time prior to the hearing date, the Hearing
Officer may, at the request of the registered owner of the vehicle or the
village, direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing.
Subpoenas for the production of witnesses and records may be issued upon
request of either party. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the
hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is of the type
commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their
affairs. The village shall not be required to produce any police officer or
other witness at the hearing. Any and all reports, records, tickets, citations
or other documents prepared or maintained in the normal course of village
business may be admitted into evidence at the preliminary hearing and such
documents shall be considered to be prima facie proof of the truth and
correctness of the facts, statements and contents contained therein without the
need for any additional foundation or testimony. If, after the hearing, the
Hearing Officer determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle
was used or operated in connection with or during the commission or attempted
commission of any offense set forth in division (B)(1) above and that the
impoundment was reasonably necessary as a community caretaking function to
prevent jeopardizing the public safety, the Hearing Officer shall issue a
final, written Findings, Decision and Order finding the owner of record of the
vehicle liable to the village for an administrative fee in the amount of $500.
The Hearing Officer shall order the vehicle to remain impounded until the owner
or someone on the owner’s behalf pays the administrative fee to the village
plus any and all fees to the towing entity or village for the towing and
storage of the vehicle as the case may be. In the event a $500 bond was posted
prior to the hearing, it will be retained by the village as final payment of
the administrative fee assessed by the Hearing Officer.
            2.   If the Hearing Officer determines by a preponderance of the
evidence that the vehicle was not used or operated in connection with or during
the commission or attempted commission of any offense set forth in division (B)
(1) above, or that the operator or person in physical control of the vehicle
was not arrested for that offense, or that the vehicle should have been
released to the owner pursuant to the written consent and directive of the
vehicle owner pursuant to division (B)(2) above, or that the towing and
impoundment was otherwise improper, the Hearing Officer shall issue a final,
written Findings, Decision and Order finding the owner of record of the vehicle
not liable to the village, decline to assess an administrative fee, order the
immediate release of the vehicle, if still impounded, and a return of the $500
bond, if such bond was posted by the owner prior to the hearing.
         (c)   If, after proper service of notice, the owner of record fails to
appear at the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall conduct the hearing in
absentia. The village shall not be required to produce any police officer or
other witness at the hearing. Any and all reports, records, tickets, citations
or other documents prepared or maintained in the normal course of village
business may be admitted into evidence at the preliminary hearing and such
documents shall be considered to be prima facie proof of the truth and
correctness of the facts, statements and contents contained therein without the
need for any additional foundation or testimony. After reviewing the evidence
and confirming the propriety of the towing and impoundment by a preponderance
of the evidence, the Hearing Officer shall issue a written order of default
finding the owner of the vehicle liable to the village for an administrative
fee in the amount of $500, a copy of which default order shall be sent to the
registered owner via certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class
mail, postage prepaid.
   (G)   Administrative fee. If the vehicle owner is found liable for the
administrative fee by the Hearing Officer, such administrative fee shall
constitute a debt due and owing to the village. The administrative fee shall be
paid into the General Corporate Fund of the village. If a cash bond has been
posted, the bond shall be applied to the administrative fee. If a vehicle is
still impounded at the time that the administrative fee is imposed, the village
may seek to enforce such judgment against the vehicle or its owner as provided
by law. Except as may otherwise be provided in this section, all vehicles shall
continue to be impounded until (i) cash bond is posted and any applicable
towing and storage fees are paid to the towing entity or the village, as the
case may be, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the
person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle, or (ii) the
administrative fee is paid to the village and any applicable towing and storage
fees are paid to the towing entity or village, as the case may be, in which
case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally
entitled to possess the vehicle, or (iii) the vehicle is sold or otherwise
disposed of to satisfy a judgment and lien as provided by law. If bond is not
posted or the administrative fee and applicable towing and storage fees are not
paid within 30 days after the expiration of time in which review of the Hearing
Officer’s determination may be sought, or within 30 days after an action
seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the village,
whichever is applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be
disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed
vehicles under the Illinois Vehicle Code.
   (H)   Vehicle possession. Except as may otherwise be provided by law or by
order of the Hearing Officer, no owner, lien holder of record, or other person
shall be legally entitled to take possession of a seized and impounded vehicle
until the bond, administrative fee and towing and storage fees have been paid.
The foregoing notwithstanding, whenever a person or entity with a lien of
record against an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure or repossession
proceedings, possession of the vehicle will be given to that person or entity
if such person or entity agrees in writing to refund to the village the amount
of the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale or other sale of the repossessed
vehicle, less any amounts required to pay all lien holders of record, not to
exceed the sum of the administrative fee.

      (2)   The village at its discretion may enforce this section by:

penalty adjudicated under the village’s administrative adjudication system; or
         (b)   An action seeking monetary and injunctive relief filed in the
Circuit Court of Cook County or any other court having jurisdiction over the
violator.
   (G)   Seizure and impoundment of bus.
      (1)   Whenever a police officer has reason to believe that a violation of
this section has occurred, the bus is subject to seizure and impoundment in
addition to any other monetary penalty or other remedy that may be pursued. The
police officer shall, in the exercise of discretion, provide for the towing of
the bus to a facility approved by the Police Department.
      (2)   Upon the towing of a bus, the police officer shall notify or make a
reasonable attempt to notify the owner of record, lessee, person claiming to be
the owner or lessee, or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle
at the time of the alleged violation of the fact of the seizure and of the
vehicle owner’s right to request an administrative hearing.
   (H)   Administrative tow hearing.
      (1)   Within five business days after a bus is seized and impounded, the
village shall notify, by personal service, first class mail, or certified mail,
the owner of record, lessee, and any lien holder of record of the owner’s right
to request a hearing to determine whether a violation of this section actually
occurred. The name and address of the person to whom a vehicle is registered as
shown on the records of the state in which the vehicle is registered shall be
conclusive evidence of the name and address of the owner of record of the
vehicle unless the owner of record gave the village actual written notice of a
different name or address.
      (2)   In order to obtain a hearing, the owner of record must file a
written request for a hearing with the Chief of Police no later than ten
business days after the date the notice was mailed. The hearing date must be
scheduled for a date that is no more than 15 business days after a request for
a hearing has been filed. The person requesting the hearing shall be given at
least five business days’ notice of the date of the hearing.
      (3)   The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer appointed in
accordance with this code’s administrative hearing procedures. The owner of the

of the charges causing the seizure and impoundment of the bus; the right to
present witness and documentary evidence; and the right to cross-examine all
witnesses.
      (4)   If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines, by a
preponderance of evidence, that a violation of this section has occurred
involving the seized and impounded bus, then the hearing officer shall enter an
order finding the owner of record of the vehicle liable to the village for the
administrative fees of $750, which shall be in addition to any other penalties,
fines and remedy sought. If, after a hearing, the hearing officer does not
determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the vehicle was used in
violation of section of this code, the hearing officer shall enter an order
finding for the owner and ordering the return of the vehicle.
      (5)   If the owner of record fails to request a hearing on the seizure
and impoundment of the bus in a timely manner or fails to appear at the
hearing, the owner of record shall be deemed to have waived the owner’s right
to a hearing, and the hearing officer may enter a default order in favor of the
village in the amount of the administrative fees. However, if the owner of
record pays such penalty and the vehicle is returned to the owner, no default
order need be entered if the owner is informed of his or her right to a hearing
and signs a written waiver, in which case, an order of liability shall be
deemed to have been made when the village receives the written waiver.
   (I)   Requirements for recovery of a seized and impounded bus. A vehicle
impounded pursuant to this chapter shall remain impounded until:
      (1)   The administrative fee of $750 is paid to the village and all
applicable towing fees are paid to the towing agent, in which case, the owner
of record shall be given possession of the bus;
 
      (2)   A bond in the amount of $750 is posted with the village, and all
applicable towing fees are paid to the towing agent, at which time, the bus
will be released to the owner of record; or
      (3)   The bus is deemed abandoned, in which case, it shall be disposed of
in the manner provided by law for the disposition of abandoned vehicles.
   (J)   Posting bond.
      (1)   If a bond in the amount of $750 is posted with the Police
Department, the impounded bus shall be released to the owner of record, and the
owner of the bus shall still be liable to the towing agent for any applicable
towing fees.
      (2)   If a after an administrative hearing on the seizure and impoundment
of the bus, it is determined that the bus was used in violation of this section
the posted bond shall be forfeited to the village; however, if a violation of
this section is not proven by a preponderance of the evidence, the bond will be
returned to the person posting the bond, and all towing fees shall be waived.
      (3)   All bond money posted pursuant to this chapter shall be held by the
village until the hearing officer issues a decision or, if there is a judicial
review, until a final order is entered in the judicial proceeding in which
review is sought.
   (K)   Disposition of an unclaimed bus. Any bus that is not reclaimed or
subject to judicial review within 35 days after the administrative hearing
officer issues a final written decision shall be deemed abandoned and disposed
of as an unclaimed vehicle as provided by law.

cashier's check, unless the Village Administrator determines, in his or her
sole discretion, that additional funds in excess of $50,000 are necessary based
upon the status of the siting process, in which case the applicant shall
deposit that amount. In no event shall any demand for additional fees exceed
$100,000 per each additional funding request. Any portion of the fees,
including any additional fees, that remain unexpended at the conclusion of the
siting approval decision shall be returned to the applicant.

revisions upon payment of additional fees in the sum of $25,000 - unless the
Village Administrator determines, in his or her sole discretion, that funds in
excess of the $25,000 are required due to the nature of the changes of the

Upon the filing of an amended application, the time limitations for final
action by the Village Board shall be extended for an additional period of 90
days.
   (H)   Other amendments may be made if, in the opinion of the Hearing
Officer, any such proposed amendment is nonsubstantive and the Hearing Officer
otherwise allows such amendments.

§ 98.04 REVIEW OF APPLICATION.
   (A)   The Village Administrator ("Administrator"), together with the

coordinating the review of the application by the village staff and its
consultants and to render such reports, advice or recommendations to the Mayor
and Village Board as the Administrator shall deem prudent to assisting the
Mayor and Village Board in making their decision. The Administrator is
authorized to call meetings and set deadlines for the submittal of reports and
recommendations in preparation for submission through the public hearing
process. The Administrator, special counsel, the village staff and the
village's consultants shall not discuss the application or the review thereof
with, nor submit reports or recommendations to the Mayor, Village Board or the
Village Attorney except in accordance with the public hearing process set forth
below.
   (B)   Should the Administrator desire to enter any reports, testimony or

(Ord. 10-47, passed 4-28-10)
§ 98.05 PARTICIPATION AND INFORMATION FROM OTHER PARTIES.
   (A)   The applicant is a participant.
   (B)   The village is a participant. For purposes of the Act, the village and
its employees and staff, and any experts, consultants, investigators or
attorneys hired by the village to review, investigate, present at hearing, or
otherwise work for the village concerning the petition, all constitute one
participant. To the extent the village employees and staff wish to participate
in the public hearings outside their roles or employment with the village, they
must submit a notice of participation, as do other members of the public.
   (C)   Any person other than described in divisions (A) and (B), above, must
file a written notice of participation on a form supplied by the Village Clerk
notifying the Village Clerk and counsel for the applicant of that person's or
entity's intent to participate.
      (1)   Every notice of participation must be filed with the Village Clerk
before the adjournment of the first day of public hearing. In the case of
counsel of record for any participant, said counsel shall, on or before the
80th day from the date of filing, serve a letter upon the Village Clerk and
upon counsel for the applicant entering his or her appearance for the
participant.
      (2)   Every notice of participation shall provide the following
information: the name, address, daytime phone number and, if available,
facsimile number of the participant or counsel; whether the participant will be
participating on his or her own behalf or as a representative/spokesperson of
another person or entity (and if on behalf of another person or entity,
identify the name of that person or entity); whether the person (or the entity
or association he or she represents) will be represented by an attorney during
the public hearings; and whether the person intends on providing oral testimony
or comment during the public hearing. All members of the public who desire to
present sworn testimony, unsworn comment, or submit written questions to the
Hearing Officer must file a notice of participation.
      (3)   No person may become a participant after the first day of the
hearing except for good cause shown. The Hearing Officer shall liberally
interpret this limitation if the additional participation shall not delay the
process or unfairly prejudice a prior participant. No late participant shall be
entitled to re-call a witness who has previously testified.
   (D)   Participant rights. Participants have the right to present sworn
testimony and witnesses. Participants represented by counsel have the right to
cross-examine or question witnesses who provide sworn testimony. Participants
who are not represented by counsel may provide witnesses, evidence and sworn
testimony subject to cross-examination by others; provide unsworn testimony or
comment during the public hearing (subject to the Hearing Officer's judgment
and consistent with fundamental fairness); or, as is the case for members of
the public generally, submit written questions to the Hearing Officer who, in
his or her sole discretion, shall decide whether such questions shall be posed
and the manner of posing such questions. Participants who are not represented
by counsel shall not cross-examine witnesses directly.
   (E)   Any attorneys acting as counsel and representing a participant must be
licensed and in good standing to practice law in the State of Illinois, or if
licensed and in good standing to practice law in another state which is part of
the United States, shall be allowed to serve as a counsel for a participant
upon motion made to and granted by the Hearing Officer.
   (F)   All witnesses (other than those called purely for purposes of
rebuttal) and the subject matter on which they will testify shall be disclosed,
and all reports, studies, exhibits or other evidence, or copies thereof, that
any person, other than the applicant, desires to submit as evidence for the
record at the public hearing must be filed with the Village Clerk and with
counsel for the applicant no later than 80 days after the date of filing of the
application. In the event that the 80th day after the date of filing falls on a
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the next business day shall be considered
the date by which all such information must be filed. Copies of all such
information shall also be available for copying by the public upon the payment
of the actual costs of reproduction. Evidence or witnesses not so disclosed by
the required date shall be admissible at the hearing only where the Hearing
Officer shall find that the admission of such evidence is necessary to provide
fundamental fairness to the parties.

the applicant of the date, time and location of the public hearing and shall
request that the applicant cause notice of the public hearing to be made as
follows:
      (1)   Publish two legal notices in a newspaper of general circulation
published in the village or Cook County. The first such notice shall be
published no sooner than 50 days from the date of filing and no later than 60
days from the date of filing; the second such notice shall be published no
sooner than 65 days from the date of filing nor later than 75 days from the
date of filing. Said notices, which may be in lower case, shall consist of the
following:
         (a)   The name and address of the applicant;
         (b)   The owners of the site and, if ownership is in a land trust, the

(B)(1) above except for item (B)(1)(c) of this section.
   (D)   Hearing procedures.
      (1)   The Mayor shall appoint a Hearing Officer to preside over the
public hearing and the Hearing Officer shall make any decisions concerning the
admission of evidence and the manner in which the hearing is conducted, subject
to this chapter. The Hearing Officer shall make all decisions and rulings in
accordance with fundamental fairness. The Hearing Officer may exclude
irrelevant, immaterial, incompetent or unduly repetitious testimony or other
evidence. All testimony and all public meetings concerning the petition shall
be in the presence of a certified court reporter who shall report all
proceedings regarding consideration of the petition. The Hearing Officer shall
have the following powers or duties:
         (a)   Administer oaths and affirmations;
         (b)   Conduct a public meeting, prior to the start of the public
hearings, to explain the public hearing procedure and site location review

and transcribe the conduct of all public hearings for the public record.
         (d)   Regulate the course of the hearing, including, but not limited

grant recesses for good cause shown. For example, good cause may be found when
issues, facts, data or other pieces of evidence arise in the course of the
hearing that were not reasonably foreseeable to the party requesting the
recess. No recess may extend past five days except due to the availability of a
suitable forum for the hearing.
         (e)   Require a witness or person presenting unsworn public comment to

proposed facility.
         (f)   Examine a witness and direct a witness to testify.

consistent with the Act and this chapter, including but not limited to the
reasonable limitation of sworn testimony, unsworn oral comment, direct and
cross-examination of any witnesses, and the limitation of repetitive or
cumulative testimony and questioning.
         (h)   Rule upon objections and evidentiary questions, with the
understanding that such rulings must be consistent with fundamental fairness,
but need not be in strict compliance with the Illinois Supreme Court, Illinois
Code of Civil Procedure, or any local rules of evidence governing a civil
judicial trial in the State of Illinois.
         (i)   Allow the introduction of late-filed evidence, be it written or
testimonial, on behalf of any participant, provided good cause is shown for the
late-filing, the evidence is offered in and is relevant to the rebuttal portion
of the applicant's or participant's case, and evidence was filed with the
Village Clerk at least one day before the public hearing at which it is
offered, and fundamental fairness to all parties will be preserved.
         (j)   The Hearing Officer shall be an attorney, licensed to practice
in Illinois. The Hearing Officer shall confer with the Village Board concerning
the petition, between the date of filing of the petition and the Board's
decision on the petition. Given the Hearing Officer's role of communicating
with the Village Board, the Hearing Officer may not confer with the
participants (members of the public, applicant and village included) concerning
the petition, unless such conference takes place during the public hearing, is
through correspondence which is filed with the Village Clerk (and, thus,
available for everyone to view), or concerns location, time or other similar
scheduling aspects of the public meeting or public hearing, or the notices for
same. The only additional exception from this restriction is that the Hearing
Officer may confer with the Village Clerk about the upkeep or status of the
public record, make a request to review or copy the public record, or confer
with the Village Clerk regarding the scheduling or location of the public
meeting or hearing, or arrangements for the notices of the public meeting and
hearing.

of all timely-filed written comments, the Hearing Officer shall submit draft
written findings (of law or fact) to the Village Board and file a copy of such
findings with the Village Clerk.
         (l)   The Hearing Officer does not have the right or the power to

record;
         (i)   Applicant, participants represented by counsel, and special
counsel for the village staff may then make an opening statement;

and/or any witnesses the applicant may wish to call. Upon the close of the
applicant's testimony, participants represented by counsel may present sworn
testimony, including any witnesses and evidence they wish to present. Upon the
close of all such testimony, the village may present sworn testimony, including
witnesses and evidence it may wish to present. The Hearing Officer, in the
exercise of his or her discretion, may then permit rebuttal testimony and sur-
rebuttal testimony;
         (k)   All witnesses shall testify under oath and be subject to
reasonable questioning as follows: direct examination by counsel; cross-
examination by counsel for other participants or the village staff, the Village
Board and/or the Hearing Officer (including the use of written questions

participant not represented by counsel that wishes to provide sworn testimony
subject to cross-examination by others may proceed;
         (m)   Following the testimony, if any, outlined in division (l) above,

participants represented by counsel, and counsel for the village staff;
         (o)   Rebuttal statement, if any, by the applicant, subject to

appropriateness of the proposed facility, or its compliance with the
requirements of ILCS Ch. 415, Act 5, § 39.2, with the Village Clerk, at any
time after the filing of a petition and within the time limitation provided in
division (3)(d), below. Likewise, the applicant, village staff, the Village

      (3)   Deny the petition.
   (B)   In making its recommendation on the request for siting approval, the
Village Board shall base its decision on the following criteria:
      (1)   The facility is necessary to accommodate the waste needs of the

      (5)   The plan of operations for the facility is designed to minimize the
danger to the surrounding area from fire, spills or other operational

Board for such area have been met.
   (C)   In its evaluation of statutory criteria (ii) and (v) as set forth in
ILCS Ch. 415, Act 5, § 39.2, the Village Board may also consider as evidence
the previous operating experience and past record of violations and penalties

the applicant has made application to the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency for a permit to develop the site. In the event that the local siting
decision has been appealed, such expiration period shall be deemed to begin on
the date upon which the appeal process is concluded.

days prior to a regularly scheduled Board meeting. The moving party must submit
a certified copy of the notice of intent, and demonstrate that: compliance with

request. The Board shall act upon the motion expeditiously and may act upon the
request for copies reduction at its first regular meeting after filing of the
motion.

amendment, the Board may establish such conditions as are reasonable and
necessary to accomplish the purposes of ILCS Ch. 415, Act 5, § 39.2, and are

amendment of conditions established in the Board's decision.
   (H)   No amendment may be approved which would enable the conduct of

impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public
rights-of-way.
   (B)   The issuance of a permit by the village does not excuse the permittee
from complying with other requirements of the village and all applicable
statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. 7-50, passed 7-18-07)
§ 99.066 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.

material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this subchapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
99.080. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee
shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility
so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.

coverage and limit requirements required under this section, such as evidence
that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the Workers' Compensation
Act.
      (5)   The legal liability of the utility to the village and any person
for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self
insurance required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance

      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this subchapter, including, without limitation, all professional service
fees incurred by the village;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
subchapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this subchapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this subchapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this subchapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to
the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this
section shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
state at which it can be drawn.

to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction
under the permit, as determined by the Comptroller, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Comptroller may,
in his sole and absolute discretion, allow the permittee to post a single
amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction
under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall
be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the
provisions of this division for any single phase.
   (D)   The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the
reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this section,
may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has
not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14 day notice period.
Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
under this subchapter, including, without limitation, all professional service
fees incurred by the village;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this subchapter that the
village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the
security fund.
   (E)   Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the village that
any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall

practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the permittee has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A permittee shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;

practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipe line testing. Only
one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless special
permission is obtained from the Comptroller.
         (b)   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by section 6 of the Illinois
Supplement to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Where practicable,
the excavated material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as
added protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the
paved portion of the roadway. Material excavated from paved areas shall be
immediately loaded into trucks and hauled offsite. Where right-of-way width
does not allow for windrowing excavated material off the paved portion of the
roadway, excavated material shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         (c)   The permittee shall not trench within the drip line of any tree
designated by the village to be preserved.
      (3)   Backfilling.
         (a)   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation

to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this division (4) is
permitted under §
99.080, the following requirements shall apply:
         (a)   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and compacted
as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 gradation. No crushed
recycled concrete shall be used.
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the village.
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         (d)   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
         (e)   All concrete pavements and concrete base courses shall be
restored with concrete to the same thickness as the existing pavement or base
course being abutted, but not less than eight inches for roadways, seven inches
for driveways, and five inches for sidewalks. All removed concrete roadway
pavements and base courses shall be replaced using three-fourths inch diameter
by 18 inch long deformed tie bars, drilled nine inches and epoxy grouted into
the adjacent existing concrete at mid-depth, at a spacing of two feet on
centers along the full length of the abutment to the existing pavement.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
village.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approvcd by the village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the ease of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair and
cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.

of a required permit in violation of this section; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if
known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if
known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
public rights-of-way of the village, the utility shall notify the village
within 90 days. Following receipt of such notice the village may direct the

determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health,
safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not direct the utility
that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to
the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the
alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility
or person.
(Ord. 7-50, passed 7-18-07)
§ 99.078 CLEANUP AND RESTORATION.
   The permittee shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and

§ 99.079 MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the village and at the permittee's expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify
noncompliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the permittee shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Comptroller of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been
taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make
the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere
with the free movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified
immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the permittee shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The permittee must file in writing with the village
of a description of the repairs undertaken on the right-of-way within 48 hours
after an emergency repair.

§ 99.080 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for variance. An applicant requesting a variance from one or
more of the provisions of this section must do so in writing to the Comptroller
as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision
of this section from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a
variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Comptroller shall decide whether a
variance is authorized for each provision of this section identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Comptroller may authorize a
variance only if the applicant requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Comptroller may require the utility requesting the
variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this section but which carry out the purposes of
this section.
(Ord. 7-50, passed 7-18-07)
§ 99.081 RIGHT TO APPEAL.

any of the provisions of this section shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when the village
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
permittee will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
section. Unless the permittee shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the permittee shall bear the
village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility who does not pay the costs apportioned to it.
(Ord. 7-50, passed 7-18-07)
§ 99.083 ENFORCEMENT.
   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of this section.

the removal and ensuring the replacement of trees removed from private property
within the village and safeguard the ecological and aesthetic environment of
the village by:
      (1)   Preserving trees as an important public resource that promote the
general welfare and enhance the quality of life, unique character and physical,
historical and aesthetic environment of the village;
      (2)   Promoting the essential character and aesthetic environment of
those neighborhoods of the village that are heavily forested;
      (3)   Requiring use of indigenous tree species for all landscaping and
streetscaping activities;
      (4)   Enhancing the air quality of the village through the filtering
effect of trees on air pollutants and facilitate the goal of making the village
as a net reducer of atmospheric carbon;
      (5)   Reducing noise within the village through the baffle and barrier
effect of trees on the spread of noise;
      (6)   Stabilizing soil through the prevention of erosion and
sedimentation;
      (7)   Reducing energy consumption through the windbreak and shade effects
of trees, reducing home heating and cooling costs and reducing the "heat
island" effect in the village;
      (8)   Preserving and enhancing nesting areas for birds and other wildlife
which in turn assists in the control of insects;
      (9)   Reducing storm water runoff and associated costs, including
property damage;
      (10)   Preventing the existence of trees which are invasive species, pose
a threat or danger to the public or to the property in the village, and
providing for the removal of such trees;
      (11)   Ensuring for the removal of diseased and infested trees and other
plant species that pose a danger to other trees and plant species; and
      (12)   Protect and increase property value.
   (B)   Tree protection required. All regulated tree activities, as set forth
in §
100.002, shall be performed in such a manner, to such a degree, and with such
equipment and personnel, so as to reasonably involve the least amount of damage
or removal of trees and not defeat, or be inconsistent with, the purposes and
intent of this subchapter.
(Ord. 7-5, passed 1-24-07)
§ 100.002 REGULATED ACTIVITY.
   The following activities are regulated activities under this subchapter:

lines when such augering is determined by the Comptroller to be necessary to
improve chances of tree survival. Such specifications shall also include the
identification and clear delineation of the construction activity area and tree
protection area and their respective perimeters.
   (C)   Integration of existing trees into site and landscape plans. Every
reasonable effort shall be made to retain existing trees in all construction
and development through the integration of those trees surveyed into the site
and landscape plan for the proposed development. Removal of trees designated
for preservation in an approved construction activity plan shall only be
allowed by amendment to the such plan approved by the Board of Trustees by
resolution duly adopted.
   (D)   Construction activity area. The construction activity area shall be
the area of the property that is the smallest area reasonably needed to
undertake the proposed construction activity as determined by the Comptroller.
The construction activity area shall include the entire area affected by the
proposed construction activity, and shall also include any access route across
the public right-of-way and the private tree presentation area. Construction
activity shall not be conducted or staged in any area of the property located
outside the construction activity area. No excess soil, additional fill,
liquids, or any construction debris may be placed or located outside the
construction activity area. All buildings, structures, and driveways shall be
located so as to reasonably involve the least amount of damage or removal of
trees, shall nevertheless be consistent with minimum building setback
requirements of the zoning code.
   (E)   Tree protection area. The tree protection area shall be the area of
the property included in the construction activity area. No construction
activity shall be conducted in the tree protection area. All reasonable
measures and protective materials shall be employed to presence and safeguard
trees located within the tree protection area. Protective materials shall
include, without limitation, the temporary installation of high visibility
plastic mesh fencing or other similar materials specifically approved by the
Comptroller. All such fencing shall be at least four feet in height and shall
be secured to metal posts driven into the ground and spaced six feet apart. All
protective measures and materials shall be in place and approved by the
Comptroller prior to the commencement of any construction activity. Protective
materials shall not be removed until the Comptroller approves such removal
after the completion of all construction activity. No attachments, fences, or
wires, other than those approved for bracing, guying, or wrapping shall be
attached to any protected tree during the construction activity.
   (F)   Root zones. The root zone of trees on lots adjacent to the lot in
question on which construction activity will take place shall be carefully
reviewed and considered during construction activity plan review. Every effort
shall be made during the architectural layout and design of the proposed
development to preserve trees located within 15 feet of the lot line on
adjacent lots through sensitivity to the root zone of said trees.
   (G)   Tree survey. A tree survey, conducted by a degreed forester or
arborist certified by the International Society of Arborculture, shall be

of all deciduous trees located on the parcel with a trunk size of four inches
or greater or a multibranch tree with an aggregate diameter of eight inches or
greater, as measured at diameter breast height (54 inches) above the
established ground level, all evergreen trees measuring five vertical feet or
more in height, and all trees that are located within 15 feet of the lot line
on adjacent parcels that fall within the size classifications as listed above.
All trees illustrated on the tree survey shall be numbered on the plan and
tagged with the corresponding number on the site.
      (2)   Location of site, scale, north arrow, location of buildings
(existing and proposed) and the excavation limits required to construct
proposed improvements, location of parking areas, all natural features, and any
other relevant existing or proposed information.

relates to preservation. The condition of the trees shall be based on a 5-point
scale with 1 being the best and 5 the worst.
 
Rating Description General Criteria
                   The tree is typical of the species, has less than 10%
1      Excellent   deadwood in the crown that is attributable to normal causes,
                   has no other observed problems, and requires no remedial
                   action.
                   The tree is typical of the species and/or has 10% - 20%
2      Good        deadwood in the crown, only 1 or 2 minor problems that are
                   easily corrected with normal care.
                   The tree is typical of the species and has 20% - 30%
                   deadwood in the crown, 1 or 2 minor problems that are not
3      Fair        eminently lethal to the tree, and no significant decay or
                   structural problems, but the tree must have remedial care
                   above normal care in order to minimize the impact of future
                   stress and to ensure continued good health.
                   The tree is not typical of the species and/or has
                   significant problems such as 30% - 50% deadwood in the
                   crown, serious decay or structural defect, insects, disease
4      Poor        or other problems that can be eminently lethal to the tree
                   or create a hazardous tree if not corrected in a short
                   period of time or if the tree is subjected to additional
                   stress.
                   The tree is not typical of the species and/or has over 50%
                   deadwood in the crown, major decay or structural problems,
5      Dead        is hazardous or is severely involved with insects, disease
                   or other problems that even if aggressively corrected would
                   not result in the long term survival of the tree.
 
The assignment of the category ratings to specific trees is subject to the
approval of the Comptroller, or his or her designee. The Comptroller may, at
its discretion, retain an urban forestry consultant to assist the village to be
paid by the applicant.
      (4)   The scale of the tree survey shall be consistent with the
construction activity plan.
(Ord. 7-5, passed 1-24-07)
§ 100.007 TREE PRESERVATION PLAN.
   (A)   Tree preservation plan required. Unless otherwise waived by the
Comptroller, or his or her designee, a tree preservation plan with a scale no
less than one inch equals ten feet, on a topographic map if deemed necessary by
the Comptroller, shall be submitted to and approved by the Comptroller, or his
or her designee and upon which shall be geographically and accurately marked
all of the following information:
      (1)   The location, size and species (both scientific and common names)
of all deciduous trees located on the parcel with a trunk size of four inches
or greater or a multi-branch tree with an aggregate diameter of eight inches or
greater, as measured at diameter breast height (52 inches) above the
established ground level, all evergreen trees measuring five vertical feet or
more in height, and all trees that are located within 15 feet of the lot line
on adjacent parcels that fall within the size classifications as listed above.
All trees illustrated on the tree preservation plan shall be numbered on the
plan and tagged with the corresponding number on the site.
      (2)   As applicable, the construction activity area as depicted on the
construction activity plan.
      (3)   The crown spread of the trees to be preserved and the location of
the preservation fencing as required at the drip line of the tree(s) to be
preserved with details of the tree protection fencing to be used.
      (4)   A tree survey prepared in accordance with §
100.006(G).
      (5)   For those trees being transplanted, outline the method of
transplanting to be used, provide a detail of such, and indicate the permanent
proposed location on the tree preservation plan.
      (6)   Proposed grading plan, if the grading will affect the preservation
of existing trees. No soil is to be removed or added within the root zone of
any tree that is to remain.
      (7)   As applicable, canopy and root pruning of trees directly impacted
by construction.
      (8)   Any other relevant information as required by the Comptroller, or
his or her designee.
   (B)   Preservation techniques. The following is a list of the minimum
preservation techniques required with any regulated activity under this
subchapter:
      (1)   Installation of temporary barriers. Prior to the issuance of a
building permit, the applicant shall install all temporary barriers necessary
for the preservation of existing plant materials on the parcel to be developed
and adjacent parcels as approved by the Village Board. All fencing shall be of
a rigid material such as wooden snow fencing, brightly colored plastic
construction fencing, chainlink fencing, or an alternative barrier, with the
written approval of the Comptroller, or his or her designee, and shall be
installed at the periphery of the drip line of the tree or at a distance of one
foot for every caliper inch as measured at 12 inches above the established
ground level, whichever is greater, to prevent the storage of vehicles or
materials and the encroachment of grading and construction equipment. Such
fencing shall be securely fastened to metal fence posts spaced a maximum of
eight feet apart.
      (2)   Additional root zone protection. Additional root zone protection
may be used in areas where proposed improvements will encroach upon the root
zone of existing trees. Root zone protection shall consist of one-half inch
plywood panels placed on top of the undisturbed root zone of trees designated
to remain. Panels shall be covered with enough soil to prevent movement during
high winds and by construction equipment. Barriers and root zone protection
shall be installed and approved prior to any earthwork or construction activity
and shall be maintained throughout construction to the satisfaction of the
Comptroller, or his or her designee.
      (3)   Construction within drip line. All trees to be preserved which are
subjected to construction activity within the drip line shall be selectively
pruned or thinned by a degreed forester or arborist certified by the
International Society of Arborculture. Such procedure shall be approved by the
Comptroller, or his or her designee, prior to commencing the work. None of the
trees shall be topped, headed back, or skinned. The trees shall not be climbed
using spikes. All deadwood in all preserved trees shall be removed to reduce
hazard.
   (C)   Inspection of tree preservation fencing. Regulated activities shall
not begin on property unless and until the property has been inspected by the
village for compliance with the tree preservation plan and, as applicable, the
construction activity plan. In no case shall tree preservation fencing be
removed, breached, temporarily removed, altered, or relocated without written
authorization from the Comptroller, or his or her designee.
   (D)   Material storage. No construction activity, movement, or placement of
equipment, materials, or spoils storage shall be permitted within the root zone
of any protected tree illustrated on the tree preservation plan. No excess
soil, additional fill, crushed limestone, liquids, or construction debris shall
be placed within the root zone or located at a higher location where drainage
toward the tree(s) could conceivably affect the health of said tree(s).
   (E)   Underground utility conflicts. In the event an underground utility
line is to be located within five feet of the trunk of a tree designated for
preservation, the utility line shall be augered to prevent damage to the root
system of the tree. A property owner or contractor shall not be responsible for
damages caused by the action of a public utility unless that person directed
the location and manner of work of the utility.
   (F)   Attachments to trees. No attachments, signs, fences, or wires, other
than approved for bracing, guying or wrapping, shall be attached to trees
during the construction period.
(Ord. 7-5, passed 1-24-07)
§ 100.008 REPLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR UNAUTHORIZED REMOVAL OF TREES.
   (A)   Deciduous trees.
      (1)   Number. In the event an existing deciduous tree is removed,
damaged, destroyed or injured, such trees shall be replaced with new trees at a
rate of three inches in caliper of replacement trees to each one inch in
caliper of removed tree. In the event of a fraction of an inch, if the fraction
is less than one-half inch, it may be disregarded. If the fraction is one-half
inch or greater, it shall be counted as one inch.
      (2)   Shrubbery in lieu of trees. If in keeping with good forestry
practices, the parcel cannot accommodate all of the replacement trees, but it
can accommodate additional shrubs, such replacement trees may be replaced with
new shrubs at a rate of five shrubs being equivalent to one tree measuring
three inches in caliper. For example, for one 12-inch removed tree, 36 caliper
inches of replacement trees are required. Thirty-six inches multiplied by five
shrubs per three inches of trees equals 60 shrubs [36 trees x 5 shrubs/3 inch
tree].
      (3)   Size. All replacement trees for deciduous trees shall be a minimum
trunk size of three inches in diameter, as measured six inches above the
established ground, or a multibranch tree measuring eight feet in height. At
the time of installation, all replacement shrubs shall be a minimum of four
feet in height if mature size is greater than three feet in height, or two feet
in height if mature size is three feet or smaller in height. Any combination of
tree sizes three inches in diameter or larger, or multibranch trees measuring
eight feet in height or larger may be used for tree replacements; i.e., one 12-
inch removed tree equals 36" of replacements which may be installed as follows:
four 6-inch trees and four 8-foot multibranched tree replacements; 12 3-inch
diameter replacements; or a combination of trees and shrubs (if all of the
replacement trees cannot fit on the lot): four 6-inch diameter trees and 20
shrubs.
   (B)   Evergreen trees.
      (1)   Number. In the event an evergreen tree is removed, damaged,
destroyed or injured, such trees shall be replaced at a rate of three vertical
feet for each one vertical foot of removed tree.
      (2)   Shrubbery in lieu of trees. If in keeping with good forestry
practices, the parcel cannot accommodate all of the replacement trees, but it
can accommodate additional shrubs, such replacement trees can be replaced with
new shrubs at a rate of five shrubs being equivalent to one tree measuring six
feet in height. For example, for one 20-foot removed tree, 60 vertical feet of
replacement trees are required. Sixty vertical feet multiplied by five shrubs
per six feet of trees equals 50 shrubs [60 vertical feet x 5 shrubs/6 foot
tree].
      (3)   Size. All replacement trees for evergreen trees shall be a minimum
height of six vertical feet. All replacement evergreen shrubs shall be a
minimum spread of three feet at the time of installation. Any combination of
tree sizes six feet in height or greater may be used for tree replacements. For
example, for one 20-foot removed tree, 60 vertical feet of replacement trees
may be installed as follows: ten 6-foot trees; two 10-foot trees and five 8-
foot trees; or a combination of trees and shrubs (if all of the replacement
trees cannot fit on the lot): four 6-foot trees and 30 shrubs [36 vertical feet
x 5 shrubs/6 foot trees].
   (C)   Species of replacement trees. For a list of species that can be used,
refer to Appendix A, Table 1.
   (D)   Time period for replacements. Replacements under this section shall be
made within 12 months of the date of the removal of any tree(s) for which such
replacement is required, and such replacements shall be installed at a time of
year most beneficial for transplanting the particular species.
   (E)   Alternate means of measurement.
      (1)   Stump measurement. In the event that trees are destroyed or
removed, leaving no physical evidence for measurement at diameter breast
height, tree size in caliper inches shall be measured at the stump diameter.
      (2)   Reasonable means for determining size in absence of stump. In the
event that no physical evidence for measurement remains, the comptroller, or
his or her designee, shall determine the size of the removed tree(s) by
employing reasonable methods, such as measuring the caliper inches of nearby
trees of similar species and age, or other methods as deemed appropriate.
   (F)   Alternate tree replacement location. If in keeping with good forestry
practices, sufficient space is not available to plant replacement trees, the
applicant shall be required to pay to the village a cost in lieu of making such
replacement in kind. This cost shall equal $150 per one inch caliper required
for each caliper inch of replacement trees that will not be planted in
compliance with this chapter. Any such collected fee shall be used for tree
planting or tree preservation programs operated by the village. The fee in lieu
of tree replacement must be received by the village within 30 days after the
date of the damage, removal or injury for which replacement is required.
(Ord. 7-5, passed 1-24-07)
§ 100.009 PENALTY FEE FOR UNAUTHORIZED TREE REMOVAL.
   In the event that a tree is removed, damaged, destroyed or injured during
any regulated activity, or has been removed without the prior approval of the
Comptroller, or his or her authorized designee, or the Board of Trustees, such
trees shall be replaced in accordance with the applicable replacement rates. A
$500 per tree penalty shall be assessed upon the owner of the property on which

      (2)   The location, quantity, size, root ball condition (e.g., balled and
burlapped or potted), and name, both scientific (Latin) and common, of all
proposed plant materials, and existing plant materials to be preserved as well
as boundaries of all planting beds.
      (3)   The location of all proposed berming and drainage swales,
indicating contours at one foot intervals, percent of slope, and the location
of all proposed drainage features with natural vegetation including, but not
limited to, rain gardens, and other storm water detention and infiltration
areas.
      (4)   Specification and boundaries of all natural landscaping areas,
including prairie, woodland, and wetland plant communities, identified by
specific community type and by scientific and common names of all species. (If
natural landscaping areas will contain grasses or sedges that exceed 18 inch
mature height, a natural landscaping permit is required.)
      (5)   Elevations and details of all fences, bridges, retaining walls, or
other decorative features proposed for location on site. The details shall
include, but are not limited to, materials, colors, styles and sizes.
      (6)   Elevations, cross sections, all necessary planting details and
notes, and other information as determined necessary by the Director of
Planning or his or her designee.
      (7)   Landscape data box which shall include the required and proposed
calculations for the following: total area in square feet of the lot or tract
to be developed, the total square feet and percentage of landscape area between
the building(s) and any public or private street, and the total square feet and
percentage of the area being landscaped. The data box in chart form shall also
include the total number of trees required and proposed, their common and
botanical names, and their type (shade, evergreen, or ornamental), and the
total number of shrubs required and proposed, their common and botanical name
and their type (evergreen or deciduous).
      (8)   Delineate the width and length of the buffer yard, the quantity of
trees by name (common and scientific) and by type (evergreen, shade or
ornamental), and the quantity of shrubs by name (common and scientific) and
type (evergreen or deciduous).
      (9)   Details of erosion control for natural landscaping areas.
   (C)   Design guidelines. In preparing a landscape plan, the design
guidelines shall be as follows:
      (1)   General landscape design principles.
         (a)   Landscape improvements should serve to integrate the project to
the site, with particular sensitivity to the natural topography, watercourses,
and existing vegetation. Preservation of the existing landscape material and
land forms should be taken into account, particularly where mature trees are a
part of the site. This is of particular importance in cases where specimen
trees, groves, or tree lines, or tree lined watercourses are present.
         (b)   Landscape improvements should serve to enhance the appearance of
the site, especially as viewed from an adjacent public right-of-way. Effective
year round screening shall be provided to lessen the visual prominence of:
parking lots, service yards, loading docks, public utility structures, and
unsightly appurtenances.
         (c)   Innovative landscape design proposals that promote
sustainability, reduce irrigation requirements, and that utilize effective on-
site storm water management techniques are encouraged. Thoughtful selection and
placement of plant material and ground covers based on ecological principles
are also encouraged.
         (d)   The aesthetic aspect of landscape improvements should be
considered both at installation and maturity. Groupings of trees or other
plantings are recommended for optimal visual effect and ease of maintenance.
      (2)   Scale. Scale and nature of landscape materials and planting bed
size should be appropriate to the site and structures. Larger buildings and
sites may accommodate and be enhanced by larger plant material, plant
groupings, and planting beds.
      (3)   Selection and layout. Plant material should be selected for its
form, texture, color and concern for its size at maturity. Wherever possible,
large planting areas should be provided in groupings and masses to provide a
more naturalistic appearance. Wherever appropriate, use of native woody and
herbaceous plant materials is encouraged. In small planting areas within
parking lots, trees and shrubs should be planted in groups with massing
appropriate to and in harmony with buildings, circulation, storm water
management, and neighboring landscapes. Energy conservation should also be
considered when determining layout of selection and layout of plant material.
For instance, sun tolerant plant materials should be placed on the south and
west sides of buildings to provide shade from summer sun, and shade tolerant
plant materials should be concentrated on the north side of buildings to
dissipate the effects of winter winds.
      (4)   Storm water and water quality. Wherever possible, preserve,
restore, and integrate natural drainage patterns and features including swales,
filter strips, and wetlands or rain gardens vegetated with native plant
systems. The intention should be to slow storm water runoff, increase on site
infiltration, and filter suspended solids and contaminants in support of on-
site storm water management and treatment strategies that reduce or control
costs to the village.
      (5)   Berming. Earthen berms and existing topography should, whenever
practical, be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site. Bermed areas
should be designed to resemble natural land forms, whenever possible. The
maximum permissible slope is three to one (3:1).
      (6)   Facade treatments. Landscape improvements should be provided to
enhance architectural features and to add visual interest adjacent to large
expanses of building walls. Landscape improvements should also be provided as a
buffer between pedestrian and vehicular activity at primary building entrances
and along building facades.
      (7)   Fence treatments. When fencing is used, provide landscaping which
includes a variety of plant material, height, color and texture. This
landscaping should buffer, soften or minimize the visual monotony of long
expanses of fencing.
      (8)   Miscellaneous screening standards. Functional activities within and
adjoining the development site must be considered in the design of the
landscape improvements, including consideration of the following: trash
dumpsters or other waste receptacles, all utility equipment, dish antennas,
loading docks or other outdoor service areas and ground signs. Particular
attention should be paid towards screening mechanical equipment, air
conditioning units, or any other visible outside equipment, service areas,
including dumpster enclosures, loading docks, and bicycle parking areas.
Enhance walkways, entrances, seating areas, bus stops or any other pedestrian
areas; separate and buffer pedestrian and public areas from circulation drives
and parking areas; and direct attention to focal areas and main entrances.
      (9)   Miscellaneous placement standards. There should be a three foot
radius free of trees or shrubs around fire hydrants, valve vaults, hose bibs,
manholes, hydrants, fire department siamese connections, and other site
features as deemed necessary by the village. Additionally, plant material
branching higher than two feet and lower than six feet above top of curb shall
not be planted or maintained in a sight visibility triangle as defined by the
Village Engineer.
      (10)   Multi-family interior landscaping. On multi-family parcels with
more than one structure, the open space between buildings should be
appropriately landscaped to provide: screening of adjacent dwelling units,
screening and shading to improve energy efficiency, and a visually appealing
living environment. Landscape features such as trees and shrubs (a combination
of evergreen and deciduous), ground cover, flowering annuals and perennials,
permitted natural landscaping areas, rain gardens, vegetated swales, filter
strips and berming should be used as appropriate to enhance the overall
appearance and function of the open space area.
      (11)   Texture. Plants differ in texture according to foliage, color,
size and density. A variety of texture will add interest and depth to the
landscape design. For example, coarser plants (larger leaves, dense foliage)
may work to "anchor corners", medium textured materials can gradually
transition to fine textured plants. In massing, coarser textured plants are
usually more effective when placed at greater distances from common viewing
locations. Groups of finer textured plants are typically more effective near
walkways and entrances and in courtyards of buildings or plazas.
      (12)   Form. Among the most important design qualities of a plant is
form, which includes columnar, round, vase, weeping, pyramidal and oval forms.
Plants of contrasting shapes may provide variety and interest by accenting a
group of plants of another form. Evergreen trees exhibit pyramidal forms, while
many crabapples are round to oval. Plantings that combine two or more forms may
effectively buffer or "soften" building facades, fences, and other structures.
The dominant use of native trees and shrubs that display strongly horizontal
branch patterns and "layered" flowering forms is basic to effective use of the
unified "prairie style", associated historically and ecologically with this
region, and is encouraged.
      (13)   Color. Color can be used to unify or contrast plantings on a site.
It is essential to consider the varying colors exhibited by a plant in all
seasons. Most importantly, through the use of perennials and/or annuals, color
can be used to call attention to entryways and other focal points.
      (14)   Repetition. A design is tied together through the repeated use of
a small number of plant species, sizes, colors, forms, or textures throughout
the site. Too much repetition can result in monotony, so it is important to
find a balance. Natural landscaping techniques using a diverse palette of
randomly mixed prairie forbs and grasses will provide repetition and unity
throughout the planting area and across the seasons. On smaller sites it is
recommended to keep the plant palette short and simple.
      (15)   Massing. Massing ties in with scale and repetition. In general,
shrubs, perennials and annuals are massed or grouped together to achieve a more
dramatic effect. For example, large sites may have shrubs in groupings of 100
or more. Large buildings and sites are complemented with larger material and
greater massing of shrubs and/or color.
      (16)   Variety. Variety adds interest and liveliness to the design. It
provides a few unlike qualities to contrast with those qualities that are alike
and duplicated as part of repetition. Variety is achieved through the use of
different forms, textures, colors and plants.
   (D)   Approval.
      (1)   All landscaping plans shall be submitted to the Comptroller, or his
or her designee, for review. The Comptroller shall have 14 business days to
review the landscape plan for conformance with this chapter.
      (2)   In the event that the Comptroller finds a landscape plan to be in
conformance with the requirements of this chapter, the Comptroller shall
forward a copy of it to the Board of Trustees with his or her finding that the
landscape plan is in conformance with this chapter.
      (3)   Within 30 days after receipt of a landscape plan the Board of
Trustees shall review and approve the plan by resolution duly adopted. The
Comptroller shall report the decision of the Board of Trustees to the developer
in writing with a copy of the resolution.
      (4)   In the event that the Comptroller finds that a landscape plan is
not in conformance with this chapter, he or she shall notify the developer in
writing specifying the reasons why the landscape plan is not in conformance
with this chapter and what must be done to bring it into conformity.
      (5)   Approval of a landscape plan does not give a developer a right to a
building permit and shall only be a condition precedent to issuance of a
building permit.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 122.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide specific regulations for the
placement, construction and modification of personal wireless telecom-
munications facilities, towers and antenna support structures.
   (B)   In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and
businesses while protecting the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community, the Village Board finds that these regulations are necessary in
order to:
      (1)   Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunications services to
the residents and businesses of the village;
      (2)   Minimize adverse visual effects of towers, antenna support
structures and personal wireless telecommunications facilities through careful
design and siting standards;
      (3)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through structural standards and setback requirements;
      (4)   Maximize the use of existing and approved towers and antenna
support structures to accommodate new personal wireless telecommunications
facilities in order to reduce the number of towers needed to serve the
community; and
      (5)   To ensure that towers, antenna support structures and personal
wireless telecommunications facilities are compatible with surrounding land
uses.
(Ord. 01-29, passed 9-12-01)
§ 122.02 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   The provisions of this chapter are not intended and shall not be
interpreted to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of
personal wireless services, nor shall the provisions of this chapter be applied
in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between providers of
functionally equivalent personal wireless services. To the extent that any
provision or provisions of this chapter are inconsistent or in conflict with
any provision of this code, the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to
control.
   (B)   In the course of reviewing any request for any approval required under
this chapter made by an applicant to provide personal wireless service or to
install personal wireless service facilities, any reviewing authority,
including the Plan Commission, Zoning Board of Appeals or the Board of
Trustees, as the case may be, shall act within a reasonable period of time
after the request is duly filed with the village, taking into account the
nature and scope of the request and, any decision to deny such a request shall
be in writing and supported by substantial evidence.
(Ord. 01-29, passed 9-12-01)

§ 123.04 COLLECTION, ENFORCEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF FEES.
   (A)   A telecommunications retailer shall charge to and collect from each
customer an additional charge in an amount equal to the village infrastructure
maintenance fee attributable to that customer’s service address.
   (B)   Unless otherwise approved by the Village Comptroller, the
infrastructure maintenance fee shall be remitted by the telecommunications
retailer to the village not later than the last day of the month subsequent to
the month in which a bill is issued to the customer; provided, however, that
the telecommunications retailer may retain an amount not to exceed 2% of the
village infrastructure maintenance fee collected by it to reimburse itself for
expenses incurred in accounting for and remitting the fee.
   (C)    Remittance of the municipal infrastructure fee to the village shall
be accompanied by a return, in a form to be prescribed by the Village
Comptroller, which shall contain such information as the Village Comptroller
may reasonably require.
   (D)   Any infrastructure maintenance fee required to be collected pursuant
to this chapter and any such infrastructure maintenance fee collected by such
telecommunications retailer shall constitute a debt owed by the
telecommunications retailer to the village. The charge imposed under division

shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the telecommunications retailer who

same manner as the original charge for such services.
   (E)   If it shall appear that an amount of infrastructure maintenance fee
has been paid that was not due under the provisions of this chapter, whether as

credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due or to become due under
this chapter from the telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous
payment; provided, however, the Village Comptroller may request and the
telecommunications retailer shall provide written substantiation for such
credit. However, no claim for such credit may be made more than three years
after the date of the erroneous payment unless:
      (1)   The credit is used only to offset a claim of underpayment made by
the village within the applicable statutory period of limitations; and
      (2)   The credit derives from an overpayment made by the same
telecommunications retailer during the applicable statutory period of
limitations.
   (F)   Amounts paid under this chapter by telecommunications retailers shall
not be included in the tax base under any of the following acts as described
immediately below:
      (1)   Gross charges for purposes of the Telecommunications Excise Tax
Act, ILCS Ch. 35, Act 630, §§ 1 et seq.;
      (2)   Gross receipts for purposes of the municipal utility tax as
prescribed in Illinois Municipal Code, ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 8-11-2;
      (3)   Gross charges for purposes of the municipal telecommunications tax
as prescribed in Illinois Municipal Code, ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 8-11-17;
      (4)   Gross revenue for the purposes of the tax on annual gross revenue
of public utilities as prescribed in Public Utilities Act, ILCS Ch. 220, Act 5,
§ 2-202.
   (G)   The village shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit books
and records of all telecommunications retailers subject to this chapter to
determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly accounted to the
village for the village infrastructure maintenance fee. Any underpayment of the
amount of the village infrastructure maintenance fee due to the village by the
telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the village plus 5% of the total
amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs incurred by
the village in conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed 5% of the total
amount of the underpayment determined in an audit. The sum shall be paid to the
village within 21 days after the issuance of an invoice for same.
   (H)   The Village Comptroller, or his or her designee, may promulgate such
further or additional regulations concerning the administration and enforcement
of this chapter consistent with its provisions as may be required from time to
time and shall notify all telecommunications retailers that are registered
pursuant to §
123.02 of such regulations.
(Ord. 97-12, passed 10-8-97; Am. Ord. 02-36, passed 9-25-02)
§ 123.05 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS.
   Nothing in this chapter shall excuse any person or entity from obligations
imposed under any law, including but not limited to:
   (A)   Generally applicable taxes;

concerning uses or structures not located on, over or within the right-of-way.

§ 123.06 EXISTING FRANCHISE AND LICENSES.

retailers and the village entered into before the effective date of this
chapter regarding the use of public rights-of-way shall remain valid according
to and for their stated terms except for any fees, charges or other
compensation to the extent waived.

building or single-family dwelling unit for rent has been suspended shall be
given the opportunity to be heard by the Village President in connection with
the violations. Said person must submit his or her request to be heard in
writing and the written request must explain in detail, the violations cited,
why they have not been corrected, and a compliance time frame for completion.

license shall be revoked. The village, as a result of such hearing, may grant
additional time or may revoke the operating license. Prior to revocation any
person whose operating license has been suspended may request a re-inspection

been or is in the process of being evicted, the operating license shall be
reinstated by the Comptroller. A request for re-inspection must be filed within
the 21 day time period for requesting a hearing, unless the official
responsible for sending the violation notice so requests.
   (E)   If the licensee is convicted by a court of a violation of any

family dwelling unit for rent, dwelling unit, or rooming unit who has received

for each failure to comply with this section.
   (C)   When repairs are made or other corrective action taken at the
direction of the Comptroller, cost of such repairs and corrective action shall
constitute a debt in favor of the village against the owner of the repaired
structure. In the event such owner fails, neglects, or refuses to pay the
village the amount of this debt, it shall be recoverable in a civil action
against the owner or his or her successor, brought in a court of competent

unsafe, or unsanitary dwelling, dwelling unit, or rooming unit within the
requisite time, the Comptroller may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction
for a demolition order to undertake the demolition. The court may grant such

such demolition shall create a debt in favor of the village against such owner,
and shall be recoverable in a civil action brought by the village which shall
possess all the rights of a private creditor.
   (D)   Whenever a multiple-family building or single-family dwelling unit for
rent is demolished, whether carried out by the owner or by the Comptroller such
demolition shall include the removal of concrete slabs, the filling in of
excavation remaining on the property on which the demolished dwelling was
located, and grading and grass seeding, in such manner as to eliminate all
potential danger to the public health, safety, or welfare arising from such

equipment required by federal, state or village laws.
   (H)   Licensees must immediately, and in writing, inform the Police
Department regarding any changes of the information on their original
application for license. Failure to comply with this requirement may constitute
grounds for removal from the police towing licensee list.
   (I)   Every licensee or tow driver shall remove or cause to be removed all
glass and debris deposited on any street or highway by the vehicle being
serviced. The licensee or tow driver shall also spread oil-dry upon that
portion of any street or highway where any fluids have been deposited by the
vehicle being serviced, unless the Fire Department has taken charge of the
cleanup, at which point the licensee will follow the instructions of Fire
Department personnel regarding cleanup.
   (J)   While at the scene of any call for a license tow, every license tow
driver will wear safety apparel compliant with the class 2 or 3 standard of the
International Safety Equipment Association standard: ANSI/ISEA 107-2004 (as
amended) standard for high visibility safety apparel, as appropriate to the
task being performed and the conditions present.

lists, as follows:

      (2)   Medium duty.
      (3)   Heavy duty.
   (B)   The Police Department will ensure that licensees are called in
rotation as far as is reasonable and practicable. Except upon request of the
owner, operator or person legitimately in possession of the vehicle to be
serviced, the Police Department will not call any tow truck not on the police
towing licensee list unless all such licensees are unavailable.
   (C)   The Police Department may deviate from the order of normal rotation
if, in the Police Department's judgment, deviation is necessary to protect the
public health, safety, and/or welfare or to ensure proper traffic, incident, or
accident management. The Police Department may also deviate from the order of
normal rotation if the licensee next on rotation is, in the Police Department's
sole discretion and judgment, incapable or improperly equipped for handling a
specific task.
   (D)   If a licensee is unable to respond to a request for service within the
time frames required in the towing license agreement, the licensee or their
employee shall advise the Police Department that they are not available due to
an extended response time. The licensee will then be placed at the bottom of
the list. No substitute tow company or licensee will be allowed. The police
telecommunicator will then call the next licensee on the list.
   (E)   When a request for service is canceled after being dispatched off the
police towing licensee list, the licensee will be put back at the top of the
list.
   (F)   The village reserves the right to terminate or modify its license
procedure unilaterally at any time without any notice and without recourse.
(Ord. 06-37, passed 3-22-06)
§ 125.08 LICENSE NON-TRANSFERABLE.
   Any license granted pursuant to this chapter shall be personal to the
individual or entity to whom issued and may not be transferred to any other
person or entity. Such license shall not be sold, leased, transferred,
assigned, or otherwise disposed of, either in whole or in part, whether by
forced sale, merger, consolidation, bankruptcy, reorganization under bankruptcy
laws, or otherwise, without reapplication pursuant to §
125.02.
(Ord. 06-37, passed 3-22-06)
§ 125.09 REMOVAL FROM POLICE TOWING LICENSEE LIST.
   (A)   Removal of licensee. The Chief of Police, or designee, may remove any
licensee temporarily or permanently when it is determined that:
      (1)   The license was secured by fraud or concealment of a material fact,
which if known would have caused disapproval of the application.
      (2)   The licensee has violated any of the provisions of this chapter, or
the Police Department towing license agreement.
      (3)   The service provided by the licensee has been substantially
inadequate, which shall include, but not be limited to, failing to be available
for or not accepting calls, slow response time, excessive damage claims, theft,
repeated complaints from citizens, inadequate services or towing equipment.
      (4)   During the term of the license, any licensee or a tow driver:
         (a)   Is convicted of any felony in any state;
         (b)   Is determined to be a sex offender, as defined in ILCS Ch. 730,
Act 150, § 2, as amended; or
         (c)   Is convicted under the laws of Illinois or any other state of an
offense that under the laws of the State of Illinois would be a felony theft of
a vehicle or vehicle parts.
   (B)   Temporary Removal. If the removal of the licensee from the police
towing licensee list is temporary, such temporary removal shall not be for more
than 30 days at any one time.
   (C)   Pending suspension/removal. If the Chief of Police, or designee,
determines the alleged offense does not constitute an immediate threat to the
health, safety or welfare of the public, the Chief of Police shall provide the
licensee with written notice at least 15 days prior to the effective date of
the temporary or permanent removal by delivering said notice to the licensee's
place of business. Said written notice shall include:
      (1)   The effective date of the removal.
      (2)   Whether the removal is temporary or permanent.
      (3)   The allegations which form the basis of the removal.
      (4)   The actions, if any, the licensee may take to prevent the removal
from occurring.
      (5)   The procedure that the licensee must follow to request a hearing to
appeal the removal.
   (D)   Immediate suspension/removal.
      (1)   If the Chief of Police, or designee, determines that a licensee
presents an immediate threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public, or
if the licensee has not provided proof of valid insurance in the amounts
required by ordinance, the Chief of Police shall provide the licensee with
written notice that the licensee is being removed from the police towing
licensee list immediately. Said written notice shall be delivered to the
licensee's place of business on the first day the removal is effective, and
shall state:
         (a)   That the removal is effective immediately.
         (b)   Whether the removal is temporary or permanent.
         (c)   The allegations which form the basis of the removal.
         (d)   The actions, if any, the licensee may take to be reinstated.
         (e)   The procedure that the licensee must follow to request a hearing
to appeal the removal.
      (2)   If a hearing is requested, the Village Comptroller, or the Village
Comptroller's designee shall act as the hearing officer. The hearing shall be
informal and provide both sides with the opportunity to present all evidence
relevant to the removal. The hearing officer shall issue a written decision
based upon a preponderance of the presented evidence within seven days of the
hearing. The opinion shall be sent to the licensee's business address, with a
copy retained in the licensee's application file at the Police Department. If
the decision favors the licensee, the hearing officer shall notify the Police
Department so that license towing privileges may be reinstated as soon as
possible. The village or the licensee may contest the decision of the hearing
officer in any manner provided by law.
   (E)   Method of requesting hearing. A licensee must request a hearing by
calling the Village Comptroller's office within ten days of receiving a notice
of suspension or removal and scheduling a hearing. Leaving a message with the
Village Comptroller's office will not satisfy this requirement. The Village
Comptroller's office must provide a time for the hearing that is within 72
hours of the request, provided there is one complete business day within the
72-hour time period. If there is no complete village business day in the 72-
hour period, the hearing shall be held on the first village business day after
the 72-hour time period. If the licensee is unavailable at the time provided by
the village, the village shall not be bound by the 72-hour time period and the
removal will not be stayed. If the village is unable to provide a hearing time
within the applicable time period, all action on the removal shall be stayed
until the hearing.
(Ord. 06-37, passed 3-22-06)
§ 125.10 ALLOWABLE FEES.
   The fee structure shall be adjusted annually based on the U.S. Department of
Labor, Consumer Price Index (CPI). This calculation will be done yearly at the
time the application period starts. Each fee shall be calculated and adjusted
separately. The calculation will be cumulative each year but adjustments to the
fees contained herein will only be made in increments of $5 and rounded down to
the nearest $5, except for mileage and accident cleanup fees which will be
rounded down to the nearest $1. Yearly adjusted rates will be contained within
the Police Department towing license agreement. No licensee shall impose any
fee not specifically provided for below for any tow performed pursuant to a
police towing license.

broadcast sound or reproducing recorded sound if the device is located on the
public way or in any vehicle on the public way, and if the sound generated by
the device is clearly audible to a person with normal hearing at a distance of
75 feet. This section shall not apply to a person participating in a parade or
public assembly for which a permit has been issued, nor to any authorized
emergency vehicle nor to any utility vehicle while being used for work in the
public way.
   (B)   Any person, including the operator of any vehicle, who violates this
section shall be subject to an administrative penalty of up to $1,000.
   (C)   A vehicle used in violation of this section shall be subject to
seizure and impoundment. The owner of any vehicle used in violation of this
section may be assessed an administrative penalty of $1,000 in addition to fees
for towing and storage. It shall be a defense to such penalty that the vehicle
was stolen at the time of the violation and the theft was reported to police
authorities within 24 hours after the theft was discovered or reasonably should
have been discovered.
   (D)   Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle
is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, the officer
shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility controlled by the
village or its agents. When a vehicle is towed, the police officer shall give
written notice to a person who appears to be in control of the vehicle at the
time of the alleged violation, if such a person is present, of the seizure and
of the vehicle owner's right to request a preliminary hearing pursuant to this
section.
   (E)   The owner of a vehicle which is seized and impounded pursuant to this
section may, within 30 days after seizure, submit a written request to the
Police Department for a preliminary hearing before an administrative hearing
officer. The request for hearing shall be immediately forwarded to the
administrative hearing officer. The hearing shall be conducted within 48 hours
after receipt of the written request at the Police Department, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. At the preliminary hearing, the hearing
officer shall determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the
vehicle was used in a violation of this section. If the hearing officer
determines that there is such probable cause, he or she shall order the
continued impoundment of the vehicle, unless the owner of the vehicle posts
with the village a cash bond of $1,000 plus the amount of towing and storage
fees. If the hearing officer determines that there is no such probable cause,
he or she shall order the vehicle returned to the owner without penalty or
fees.
   (F)   Within ten days after a vehicle has been impounded pursuant to this
section, the Police Department shall send notice by certified mail to the
registered owner of the vehicle, advising of the penalty which may be imposed
upon the owner, of the owner's right to request a preliminary hearing pursuant
to division (E), and also advising of the owner's right to a full hearing
before an administrative hearing officer, to contest the charge of a violation
of this section. The notice shall explain the procedure and time for requesting
a hearing and shall state also that if no hearing is requested and no bond
posted, the vehicle may be sold or disposed of by the village in accordance
with applicable law. A copy of the notice shall be forwarded to the hearing
officer.
   (G)   The owner who has received notice pursuant to division (F) may, within
30 days of the date of the seizure, submit a written request to the Police
Department for either a preliminary hearing as described in division (E), or a
full hearing. The request shall be immediately forwarded to the hearing
officer. A full hearing shall be held within 30 days after receipt by the
Police Department of the owner's request. After a full hearing, the hearing
officer shall determine whether, by the preponderance of the evidence, the
vehicle was used in violation of this section. If the hearing officer
determines that the vehicle was so used, he or she shall enter an order holding
the owner liable to the village for the amount of the administrative penalty,
plus towing and storage fees. If the hearing officer determines that the
preponderance of the evidence does not support a finding that the vehicle was
so used, he or she shall enter an order holding the owner not liable to the
village and directing the return of the vehicle without penalty or fees, or the
return of the cash bond. If, however, the vehicle is subject to seizure and
impoundment for any reason other than violation of this section, the hearing
officer shall not direct release of the vehicle until receipt of authorization
from the appropriate agency.
   (H)   If the owner of an impounded vehicle fails to request a full hearing
or, having made such a request, fails to appear, the owner shall be deemed to
have waived his or her right to a hearing. The administrative hearing officer
shall enter a default order in favor of the village in the amount of $1,000
plus towing and storage fees. Any cash bond posted pursuant to division (E)
shall be applied to the amount owed.
   (I)   An administrative penalty imposed pursuant to this section, together
with towing and storage fees, shall constitute a debt owed to the village which
may be enforced in any manner provided by law. The vehicle shall continue to be
impounded until the debt is paid, when it shall be given to the person legally
entitled to possession; or until it is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy
a judgment or enforce a lien as provided by law. Whenever a person with a lien
of record against a vehicle impounded pursuant to this section has commenced
foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle may be given to such person
if such person agrees in writing to refund to the village the net proceeds of
any foreclosure sale, less any amounts necessary to pay all lienholders of
record, up to the total amount of penalties and fees imposed pursuant to this
section. If, however, the vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment for any
reason other than violation of this section, the vehicle shall not be released
until receipt of authorization from the appropriate agency.
   (J)   Any motor vehicle which is not reclaimed within 30 days after
expiration of the time during which the owner may seek judicial review of the
village's action under this section or, if judicial review is sought, the time
at which a final judgment is rendered in favor of the village, may be disposed
of as an unclaimed vehicle as provided by law.

graffiti and/or restoration of the structure or wall to its previous condition.
      (2)   In addition, the Court may order as further penalty community
service in the form of time to be spent in cleaning the property that has been
defaced by graffiti in other locations within the village.

liable to the person so detained.

to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight by the actor or
other circumstances make it impracticable, a peace officer shall, prior to any
arrest for an offense under this section, afford the actor an opportunity to
dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted by requesting him or her to
identify himself or herself and explain his or her presence and conduct. No
person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the peace officer
did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if it appears at trial that the
explanation given by the actor was true and, if believed by the peace officer
at the time, would have dispelled the alarm.

§ 134.02 OBSCENITY.

laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction; or
      (6)   Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented
or held out by him or her to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
   (B)   Obscene defined. Any material or performance is OBSCENE if:
      (1)   The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;
      (2)   The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or
perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions, or lewd
exhibition of the genitals; and
      (3)   Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults except
that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
         (a)   The character of the audience for which the material was
designed or to which it was directed;
         (b)   What the predominant appeal of the material would be for
ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would
probably have on the behavior of such people;

of the material, or absence thereof;
         (d)   The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this
state;
         (e)   Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising
or other promotion of the material;
         (f)   Purpose of the author, creator, publisher, or disseminator.
   (D)   Permissive inference. The trier of fact may infer an intent to
disseminate from the creation, purchase, procurement, or possession of a mold,
engraved plate, or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for
reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three copies of
obscene material.
   (E)   Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age;
      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.

impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this section unless the owner of the
vehicle posts with the village a cash bond in the amount of $500 plus the
accumulated costs of towing and storing. If the hearing officer determines that
there is no such probable cause, the vehicle will be returned without penalty
or other fees.
      (4)   If after the hearing, the administrative hearing officer determines
by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used in the commission of
any of the violations described in subsection (1), the administrative hearing
officer shall enter an order requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded
until the owner pays a penalty of $500 plus fees for the towing and storage of
the vehicle. The penalty and fees shall be a debt due and owing the village.
However if a cash bond has been posted the bond shall be applied to the
penalty. If the hearing officer determines that the vehicle was not used in
such violation, he or she shall order the return of the vehicle or cash bond.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, whenever a person with a
lien of record against a vehicle impounded under this section has commenced
foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given to that
person if he or she agrees in writing to refund to the village the net proceeds
of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts necessary to pay lienholders of
record, up to the total amount to penalties and fees imposed under this
subsection. No vehicle shall be returned to the owner of record unless and
until the village receives notice from the appropriate state or, where
applicable federal officials that (i) forfeiture proceedings will not be
instituted or (ii) forfeiture proceedings have concluded and there is a
settlement or a court order providing that the vehicle shall be returned to the
owner of record.
      (5)   If an administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to this section,
such penalty shall constitute a debt due and owing to the village. The record
owner's obligation to pay such debt to the village shall be independent of the
village's return of any impounded vehicle. If a cash bond has been posted
pursuant to this section, the bond shall be applied to the penalty. Except as
provided otherwise in this section, an impounded vehicle shall be returned to
the record owner, or other person who is legally entitled to possess the
vehicle, upon his or her payment to the village of the penalty, plus any
applicable towing and storage fees, unless the vehicle has been sold or
otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment or enforce a lien as provided by
law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no vehicle shall be
returned to the record owner unless and until the village has received notice
from the appropriate state or, where applicable, federal officials that (i)
forfeiture proceedings will not be instituted or (ii) forfeiture proceedings
have concluded and there is a settlement or court order providing that the
vehicle shall be returned to the owner of record.
      (6)   Any motor vehicle that is not reclaimed within 30 days after
expiration of the time during which the owner of record may seek judicial
review of the village's action under this section, or the time at which a final
judgment is rendered in favor of the village, or the time of a final
administrative decision is rendered against an owner of record who is in
default may be disposed of as an unclaimed vehicle as provided by law;
provided, however that where proceedings have been instituted under state or
federal drug asset forfeiture laws, the subject vehicle may be disposed of by
the village except as consistent with those proceedings. Where the vehicle is
sold by the village and proceeds from the sale are greater than the amount due
the village in penalty and towing and storage costs, then the owner of record
may obtain those net proceeds by filing a claim with the village.

§ 152.03 BASE FLOOD ELEVATION.
   (A)   The protection standards of this chapter are based on the Flood
Insurance Study for the village. If a base flood elevation or 100-year
frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the
protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available in
the Illinois State Water Survey’s Floodplain Information Repository. When a
party disagrees with the best available data, he or she may finance the
detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and
submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA.
   (B)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
Addison Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the
countywide Flood Insurance Study for Cook County prepared by FEMA effective
August 19, 2008, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared
from time to time.
   (C)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA
delineated as an “AH Zone” or “AE Zone” shall be that elevation (or depth)
delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the countywide Flood Insurance
Study for Cook County prepared by FEMA effective August 19, 2008, and such
amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
   (D)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the
remaining SFHAs delineated as an “A Zone” on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of
the village shall be according to the best existing data available in the
Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository. When no base
flood or 100- year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a
backwater model, such as HEC-2, HEC-RAS, WSP-2, or a dynamic model such as FEQ.
   (E)   The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from
hydrologic models, such as HEC-1, TR-20, HEC-HMS, or FEQ, or by techniques
presented in various publications prepared by the United States Geological
Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. Flood flows should be based on
anticipated future land use conditions in the watershed as determined from
adopted local and regional land use plans. Along any watercourses draining more
than one square mile, the above analyses shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for
approval. Once approved it must be submitted to the Illinois State Water Survey
Floodplain Information Repository for filing. For a nonriverine SFHA, the base
flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three feet, unless
calculated by a detailed engineering study and approved by the Illinois State
Water Survey.

shall require compensatory storage for one times the volume below the base
flood elevation occupied by the detention basin including any berms. The
release from the detention storage provided shall still be controlled
consistent with the requirements of §
152.19. The applicant shall certify its operations for all streamflow and
floodplain backwater conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along
streams and watercourses shall be opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by
detention. All floodplain storage lost below the 10-year flood elevation shall
be replaced below the 10-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost
above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed
10-year flood elevation. All compensatory storage excavations shall be
constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
         (b)   No compensatory storage requirement shall be established for new
or existing residential buildings to be located in a residential district
already in existence as of the date of adoption.
      (3)   On-stream detention basins are allowable if they provide regional
public benefits and if they meet the other provisions of this code with respect
to water quality and control of the 2-year and 100-year, 24-hour events from
the property. If on-stream detention is used for watersheds larger than one
square mile, it is recommended that the applicant use dynamic modeling to
demonstrate that the design will not increase stage for any properties upstream
or downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part of on-
stream detention:
         (a)   Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species,
which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for
spawning;
         (b)   Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water
quality or stream aquatic habitat;
         (c)   Shall include a design calling for gradual bank slopes,
appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation basin; and
         (d)    Shall comply with 17 Illinois Administrative Code Part 3708 and
this code.
   (B)   Detention in wetlands. Existing wetlands shall not be modified for the
purposes of stormwater detention unless it is demonstrated that the proposed
modification, including such activities as filling, draining, excavating and
vegetation removal, will maintain or improve habitat, and water quality. In
addition, fill shall not be placed in the wetland and a long-term monitoring
and maintenance agreement shall be established to ensure that the modified
wetland/detention facility continues to provide wetland functions.
   (C)   General detention considerations for water quality enhancement.
      (1)   Inlet and outlet orientation. As much as feasible, the distance
between detention inlets and outlets should be maximized. If possible, they
should be at opposite ends of the basin.
      (2)   Velocity dissipation. Baffles or berms should be placed
perpendicular to the direction of flow through a detention basin to reduce
velocity and prevent scour.
      (3)   Maintenance. The stormwater drainage system shall be designed to
minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed sideslopes should be designed to
allow lawn moving equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins should be
provided with alternate outflows which can be used to completely drain the pool
for sediment removal. Pre-sedimentation basins should be considered for
localizing sediment deposition and removal. Access for heavy equipment should
be provided.
   (D)   Flows from tributary areas. Stormwater runoff from areas tributary to
the property shall be considered in the design of the property's drainage
system.
      (1)   Upstream areas not meeting code requirements. When there are areas
not meeting the storage and release rates of this code, tributary to the
applicant's property, regionalized detention on the applicant's property shall
be explored by the applicant. The following steps shall be followed:
         (a)   The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his or
her property using the release rates prescribed herein, the applicant's
property area, and the procedures described herein.
         (b)   Areas tributary to the applicant's property, not meeting the
storage and release rate requirements of this code, shall be identified.
         (c)   Using the areas determined above plus the applicant's property
area, total storage needed for the combined properties shall be computed.
         (d)   Allowable release rates shall be computed using the combined
property areas. Storage shall be computed as described herein. If tributary
areas are not developed, a reasonable fully developed land cover shall be
assumed for the purposes of computing storage.
         (e)   Once the necessary combined storage is computed, the village may
choose to have the applicant construct regional storage and the village shall
pay for oversizing the applicant's detention basin to accommodate the regional
flows. The applicant's responsibility will be limited to the storage for his or
her property as computed in this chapter. If regional storage is selected by
the village, the design accommodating the volume determined pursuant to
division (C) of this section shall be implemented. If regional storage is
rejected by the village, the applicant has the option of bypassing all
tributary area flows around the applicant's basin. In the event the applicant
chooses to route them through his or her basin and the upstream areas exceed
one square mile in size, the applicant must construct the basin to comply with
the provisions of on-stream basins.
      (2)   Upstream areas meeting code requirements. When there are areas
which meet the storage and release rate requirements of this code tributary to
the applicant's property, the upstream flows shall either be bypassed around
the applicant's detention basin or be routed through the applicant's detention
basin at the discretion of the village. Storage needed for the applicant's
property shall still be computed as described above. However, if the village
decides to route tributary area flows through an applicant's basin, the final
design stormwater releases shall be based on the combined total of the
applicant's property plus tributary areas.
   (E)   Early completion of detention facilities. Where detention, retention
or depressional storage areas are to be used as part of the drainage system for
a property, they shall be completed before general property grading begins.
This is to ensure that if soil erosion and sediment control practices are not
adequately implemented, any eroded sediment will be captured in these areas and
will have to be removed by the applicant before project completion.
   (F)   Fee in lieu of detention.
      (1)   All developments which are approximately three acres and under in
size may be required to pay a fee based on the acre feet which would be
required under this code as a percentage of the total capacity of an existing
or proposed detention facility multiplied by the cost of engineering, land
construction, landscaping and maintenance of the detention facility rather than
installing detention facilities on the property, when specifically directed by
the Comptroller. The village also shall have the option for larger properties
of requiring a fee for each acre-foot of detention needed in lieu of the
applicant building a basin on-site provided the property will discharge
stormwater to the village's storm sewer system.
      (2)   In instances where regional benefits and economies of scale can be
achieved, it may be permissible, and may be required, for adjacent properties
to utilize a common regional detention basin. The applicant may have the option
of paying a fee based on the ratio of acre feet required to the total capacity
of the detention facility and reflecting the cost of engineering, land,
construction, landscaping and maintenance of the detention facility so that the
village can build regional facilities or applicants can jointly build the
necessary facilities themselves.

§ 152.16 EXCEPTIONS.
   The Comptroller may waive the requirement of this chapter for detention
facilities when one or more of the following conditions exist:
   (A)   The proposed development consists of home improvements or additions to
an existing residence and it can be satisfactorily verified that the
improvements will not increase the value of the premises by more than 50% of
its then current value.
   (B)   The proposed development consists of restoring existing improvements
which have been damaged by fire, storm, or flood.
   (C)   The property to be developed is all or a wholly contained part of an
approved development for which stormwater detention was previously provided or
planned to the satisfaction of village authorities in the form of on-site
detention, off-site detention, cash in lieu thereof, or some combination of the
above. Development of property shall be allowed to take place according to the
conditions of previously approved detention standards and stipulations,
provided, however, that previously approved concept plans and/or preliminary
plats shall not retain their approved status for stormwater detention proposals
for longer than one year if no construction or development takes place within
that time.

§ 152.18 RUNOFF VOLUMES AND RATES.
   (A)    In the selection of a drainage plan for a development, the applicant
shall choose a strategy which strives to minimize the increase in runoff
volumes and rates from the site.
   (B)   The applicant shall observe the following hierarchy in developing a
drainage plan:
      (1)   Minimization of impervious surfaces on the property;
      (2)   Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and retention of
natural depressions or construction of new ones in conjunction with retention
of existing natural stream channels;
      (3)   Infiltration of runoff on-site;
      (4)   Stormwater retention structures;
      (5)   Stormwater detention structures;

152.99
§ 152.19 RELEASE RATES.
   (A)   Generally. The drainage system for a property shall be designed to
control the peak rate of discharge from the property for the 2-year, 24-hour
and 100-year, 24-hour events to levels which will not cause an increase in
flooding or channel instability downstream when considered in the aggregate
with other development properties and downstream drainage capacities. The peak
discharge from events less than or equal to the 2-year event shall not be
greater than 0.04 cfs per acre of property. The 100-year discharge shall not be
greater than 0.15 cfs per acre of property.
   (B)   Small development sites. When the calculated allowable discharge for a
development site is exceptionally small due to the small size of the site (that
is, three acres or less), the Comptroller may allow a greater rate of discharge
provided that the developer's engineer demonstrates that appropriate attempts
had been made to develop a design for a discharge device which could be
reasonably expected to function effectively without undue personal attention or
maintenance efforts. In no case will discharge orifices less than two inches in
inside diameter be required. Project engineers shall be expected to utilize, to
the extent practicable, innovative and high-tech solutions for discharge
facilities intended to minimize discharges for small site detention basins.

§ 152.20 WATER QUALITY AND MULTIPLE USES.
   (A)   The drainage system should be designed to minimize adverse water
quality impacts downstream and on the property itself. Detention basins shall
incorporate design features to capture stormwater runoff pollutants. Detention
and infiltration of stormwater shall be promoted throughout the property's
drainage system to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and to reduce the
quantity of runoff pollutants.
   (B)   The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses to the maximum
extent feasible. Uses considered compatible with stormwater management include
open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (boating, trails, playing
fields), wetlands and water quality mitigation. The applicant should avoid
using portions of the property exclusively for stormwater management.

152.99
§ 152.21 HYDROLOGIC DESIGN PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Design. The design of the drainage system shall be developed and
evaluated by the applicant based on routing runoff hydrographs for the 2-year,
10-year, and 100-year, 24-hour events through its minor and major components.
In addition, a general assessment of the impacts of flows exceeding the 100-
year event shall be presented.
   (B)   Rainfall. Unless a continuous simulation approach to drainage system
hydrology is used, all design rainfall events shall be based on Bulletin 70.
First quartile median point rainfall distribution as described by Huff of the
ISWS shall be assumed for discharge estimations. SCS Type II distributions
shall also be acceptable for detention basin design.
   (C)   Hydrograph required. Runoff must be developed as part of the design of
the drainage system's minor and major components. The TR-SS design procedure,
or other method approved by the Comptroller, shall be utilized for generation
of hydrographs, subject to rainfall distribution modifications, for all
properties larger than five acres. The rational formula shall not be used to
estimate peak discharges for properties larger than five acres.
   (D)   Antecedent moisture. All computations of runoff hydrographs which do
not rely on a contiguous accounting of antecedent moisture conditions shall
assume the following antecedent moisture conditions:
      (1)   SCS TR-55–antecedent moisture condition two; and
      (2)   ILLUDAS–number 3, rather wet.

   (A)   Profile.  A profile and mapping of flood- water depths and coverage
shall be prepared for the property for the 2-year, 10-year, and 100-year
events. Direction of flow and velocities shall also be reported for critical
points in the drainage system.
   (B)   Detention. The minimum available storage to be provided in a detention
basin shall be based on the runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour event and
reservoir routing (also called level pool), or equivalent.
   (C)   Streets. If streets are to be used for storage of excess stormwater
ponding depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one inch and shall
not remain flooded for more than eight hours for any event less than or equal
to the 100-year event.

§ 152.23 WET BASINS.
   (A)   Design. Wet detention basins shall be designed to remove stormwater
pollutants, to be safe, and as much as feasible, to be available for
recreational use.
   (B)   Depths. Wet basins shall be at least eight feet deep (three feet if
aerated), excluding near shore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to
be provided, they shall be at least ten feet deep over 25% of the bottom area
to prevent winter freeze-out.
   (C)   Permanent pool volume. The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at
normal depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the 2-
year event.
   (D)   Nuisance control. Wet basins shall be designed in a manner which will
reduce as much as practicable nuisance problems such as algae.

   (A)   Design. Dry basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants,
to be safe, and, as much as feasible, to be available for multiple uses.
   (B)   Drainage. Dry basins shall be designed so that 80% of their bottom
area shall have standing water no longer than 72 hours for any runoff event
less than the 100-year event. Underdrains directed to the outlet control shall
be used if necessary to accomplish this requirement.
   (C)   Water quality. All dry detention basins shall be designed to remove
stormwater pollutants.

   (A)   Design. The drainage system components, especially all detention
basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of any children or adults
coming in contact with the system during runoff events.
   (B)   Shorelines. The shorelines of all detention basins at 100-year
capacity shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the
basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Shorelines shall not have
greater than three to one (horizontal to vertical) slope.
   (C)   Banks. The sideslopes of the banks of both wet and dry detention
basins shall not be steeper than three to one.
   (D)   Safety ledge. All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge
extending three feet into the basin from the shoreline and two feet below the
normal water depth.
   (E)   Velocity. Velocities throughout the drainage system shall be
controlled to safe levels taking into consideration rates and depth of flow.
   (F)   Overflow structures. All stormwater detention basins shall be provided
with clearly defined overflow facilities capable of safely passing overflows so
that downstream damage to properties is prevented.

   Infiltration practices including basins, trenches, and porous pavement shall
only be allowed in soils considered A or B by the U.S. Soil Conservation
Service. Infiltration practices shall not be located within 75 feet of a water
supply well or a building foundation. A sediment settling basin shall be
provided to remove coarse sediment from stormwater flows before they reach
infiltration basins or trenches. Stormwater shall not be allowed to stand more
than 72 hours over 80% of a dry basin's bottom area for the maximum design
event to be exfiltrated. The bottom of infiltration facilities shall be a
minimum of four feet above seasonally high ground water and bedrock.

SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS
§ 152.30 PURPOSE.
   This subchapter is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to the
village by ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, §§ 1-2-1, 11-12-12, 11-30-8, and 11-31-2. The
purpose of this subchapter is to maintain the village's eligibility in the
National Flood Insurance Program; to minimize potential losses due to periodic
flooding including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare;
and to preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve economic
and natural values, and provide for the wise utilization of water and related
land resources. This subchapter is adopted in order to accomplish the following
specific purposes:
   (A)   To meet the requirements of ILCS Ch. 615, Act 5, § 18(g), being an act
in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams of the state,
approved June 10, 1911, as amended.
   (B)   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage
hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion.
   (C)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage.
   (D)   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding.
   (E)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and
relief operations.
   (F)   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in
the village by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program.
   (G)   To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program, codified as 44 CFR 59 through 79, as amended.
   (H)   To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources.
   (I)   To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats.
   (J)   To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order
to moderate flood and storm water impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil
erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational
opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development.

§ 152.31 RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   The Comptroller shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the duties
listed in this section.
   (B)   To fulfill those duties, the Comptroller first should use the criteria
listed in §
152.32 to determine whether the development site is located within a
floodplain. Once it has been determined that a site is located within a
floodplain, the Comptroller must determine whether the development site is
within a flood fringe, a regulatory floodway, or within a SFHA or floodplain on
which no floodway has been identified. If the site is within a flood fringe,
the Comptroller shall require that the minimum requirements of §
152.03 be met. If the site is within a floodway, the Comptroller shall require
that the minimum requirements of §
152.40 be met. If the site is located within a SFHA or floodplain for which no
detailed study has been completed and approved, the Comptroller shall require
that the minimum requirements of §
152.50 be met.
   (C)   In addition, the general requirements of §
152.32 shall be met for all developments meeting the requirements of §§
152.03,
152.40, and
152.50. The Comptroller shall assure that all subdivision proposals shall meet
the requirements of §
152.05.
   (D)   If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the Comptroller shall
review the requirements of §
152.06 to make sure that they are met. In addition, the Comptroller shall
complete all notification requirements.
   (E)   In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in
this chapter, the Comptroller may take any and all actions as outlined in §
152.99.
(Ord. 7-28, passed 5-9-07 ; Am. Ord. 8-70, passed 7-16-08)
§ 152.32 OCCUPATION AND USE.
   In SFHA or floodplains, where no floodways have been identified and no base
flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations have been established by FEMA, and
draining more than a square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the
cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all other anticipated
uses and structures shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and
passage of the floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-
year frequency flood elevation.
   (A)   Development permit.   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm,
corporation, or governmental body, not exempted by state law, to commence any
development in a SFHA or floodplain without first obtaining a development
permit from the Comptroller. Application for a development permit shall be made
on a form provided by the Comptroller. The application shall be accompanied by
drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions; existing
grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or
drilling, sealed by a licensed engineer architect or surveyor; the location and
dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the elevation of
the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed buildings subject to the
requirements of this section. The application for a development permit shall
also include the following information:
      (1)   A detailed description of the proposed activity, its purpose, and
intended use;
      (2)   Site location (including legal description) of the property, drawn
to scale, on the regulatory floodway maps, indicating whether it is proposed to
be in an incorporated or unincorporated area;
      (3)   Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of activity;
      (4)   Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include at a
minimum:
         (a)   A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, name of the
waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site, graphic
or numerical scale, and north arrow;
         (b)   A plan view of the project and engineering study reach showing
existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the
structure or work, elevations in mean sea level (1929 adjustment) datum or
N.G.V.D., adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and flood control
easements, distance between proposed activity and navigation channel (when the
proposed constriction is near a commercially navigable body of water),
floodplain limit, location and orientation of cross-sections, north arrow, and
a graphical or numerical scale;
         (c)    Cross-section views of the project and engineering study reach
showing existing and proposed conditions including principal view, existing and
proposed elevations, normal water elevation, 10-year frequency flood elevation,
100-year frequency flood elevation, and graphical or numerical scales
(horizontal and vertical); and
         (d)   A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed
areas. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be
implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance;
      (5)   Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted
showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of §
152.05(D); and
      (6)   Any and all other local, state, and federal permits of approvals
that may be required for this type of development.
   (B)   Comparison of elevation.  Based on the best available existing data
according to the Illinois State Water Survey’s Floodplain Information
Repository, the Comptroller shall compare the elevation of the site to the base
flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Should no elevation information
exist for the site, the developer’s engineer shall calculate the elevation
according to §
152.03(D). Any development located on land that can be shown to have been
higher than the base flood elevation as of the site’s first Flood Insurance
Rate Map identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the
requirements of this chapter. The Comptroller shall maintain documentation of
the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that
this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site’s first Flood
Insurance Rate Map identification.
   (C)   Copies of permits. The Comptroller shall be responsible for obtaining
from the applicant copies of all other local, state, and federal permits,
approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of
activity. The Comptroller shall not issue the development permit unless all
required local, state, and federal permits have been obtained.
   (D)   Preventing increased damages. No development in the SFHA, where a
floodway has not been determined, shall create a damaging or potentially
damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health,
safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
the floodway or channel, or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as
called for in this chapter.
   (E)   Required standards.  Within all riverine SFHAs where the floodway has
not been determined, the following standards shall apply:
      (1)   Engineering requirements.  The developer shall have a registered
professional engineer state in writing and show through supporting plans,
calculations, and data that the project meets the engineering requirements of §
152.50(E)(1) through (11) for the entire floodplain as calculated under the
provisions of §
152.03(D). As an alternative, should the developer have an engineering study
performed to determine a floodway and submit an engineering study to IDNR/OWR
for acceptance of their floodway, the developer shall then demonstrate that the
project meets the requirements of §
152.40 for the regulatory floodway. The floodway shall be defined according to
the definition in §
152.01.
      (2)   IDNR/OWR permits. A development permit shall not be issued unless
the applicant first obtains a permit from IDNR/OWR or written documentation
that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR.
      (3)   Village responsibility. No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required
if IDNR/OWR has delegated permit responsibility to the village per 17 Ill. Adm.
Code Part 3708 for regulatory floodways, per IDNR/OWR’s state-wide permit
entitled Construction in Floodplains with No Designated Floodways in
Northeastern Illinois.
      (4)   Dam safety permits. Any work involving the construction,
modification, or removal of a dam or an on-stream structure to impound water as
defined in § 152.01 shall obtain a state IDNR/OWR Dam Safety permit or a letter
indicating a permit is not required prior to the start of construction of a
dam. If the Comptroller finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR permit, the
Comptroller shall immediately notify the IDNR/OWR. If the Comptroller finds a
dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the Comptroller shall
immediately notify the owner of the dam and the Illinois Emergency Management
Agency (IEMA) and IDNR/OWR.
      (5)   Exempted activities. The following activities may be permitted
without a registered professional engineer's review or calculation of a base
flood elevation and regulatory floodway. Such activities shall still meet the
other requirements of this chapter:
         (a)   Underground and overhead utilities that:
            1.   Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations;
or
            2.   Require the placement of aboveground structures in the
floodway; or
            3.   In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the
pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the existing
streambed; and
            4.   In the case of overhead utilities, no support towers are
placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to catch
debris.
         (b)   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:
            1.   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent
natural bank slope; and
            2.   Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and
            3.   Are designed so as not to cause stream bank erosion at the
outfall location.
         (c)   Construction of shoreline and streambed protection that:
            1.   Does not exceed 1,000 feet in length or two cubic yards per
lineal foot of streambed;
            2.   Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank;
            3.   Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-sectional
area of the stream channel by more than 10%; or
            4.   Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the
preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where high channel
velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative
stabilization measures, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred materials.
Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rabble, and gabions should
be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
         (d)   Temporary stream crossings in which:
            1.   The approach roads will be one-half foot or less above natural
grade;
            2.   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up
the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or
outfall invert;
            3.   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least
two feet below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be
non-erosive material, such as rip-rap or gravel;
            4.   All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise
stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of
construction; or
            5.   The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within
one year after authorization.
         (e)   The construction of light poles, sign posts, and similar
structures.
         (f)   The construction of sidewalks, driveways, athletic fields
(excluding fences), patios and similar surfaces which are built at grade.
         (g)   The construction of properly anchored, unwalled, open structures
such as playground equipment pavilions, and carports built at or below existing
grade that would not obstruct the flow of flood waters.
         (h)   The placement of properly anchored buildings not exceeding 70
square feet in size, nor ten feet in any one dimension (for example, animal
shelters and tool sheds).
         (i)   The construction of additions to existing buildings which do not
increase the first floor area by more than 20%, which are located on the
upstream or downstream side of the existing building, and which do not extend
beyond the sides of the existing building that are parallel to the floor of
flood waters.
         (j)   Minor maintenance dredging of a stream channel where:
            1.   The affected length of stream is less than 1,000 feet;
            2.   The work is confined to reestablishing flows in natural stream
channels; or
            3.   The cross-sectional area of the dredged channel conforms to
that of the natural channel upstream and downstream of the site.
      (6)   The flood carrying capacity within any altered or relocated
watercourse shall be maintained.
   (F)   Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is
authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the
authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of stream and
watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the area so
filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall
be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. Subject to the
review and approval of village staff which includes the Building Department,
Public Works and the Village Engineer, compensation of lost storage will not be
required for a Public Flood Control Project meeting the definition set forth in
§
152.01. Public Flood Control Projects not demonstrating an absence of adverse
impact to adjacent property owners shall comply with the compensatory storage
requirements of the code.

152.99
FLOOD FRINGE AREAS
§ 152.40 OCCUPATION AND USE.
   Development and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if
protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by
proper elevation, and compensatory storage and other provisions of this chapter
are met. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of
drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe
shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of §
152.32.
   (A)   Development permit. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm,
corporation, or governmental body not exempted by state law to commence any
development in the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the
Comptroller.
   (B)   Application. Application for a development permit shall be made on a
form provided by the Comptroller. The application shall be accompanied by
drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and
legal descriptions of the property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect
or land surveyor; existing grade elevations in mean sea level (1929 adjustment)

the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings. For
all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement)
and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the
development will be subject to the requirements of §
152.32.
   (C)   Comparison of elevations. Upon receipt of a development permit
application, the Comptroller shall compare the elevation of the site to the
base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Any development located on
land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of
the sites first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification is not in the SFHA and,
therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter. The Comptroller
shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the
development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to
the date of the sites first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.
   (D)   Erosion and sedimentation plan. A soil erosion and sedimentation
control plan for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan shall include
description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment
and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This
plan shall also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation
measures and the identification of a responsible party to ensure post-
construction maintenance.
   (E)   Copies of permits. The Comptroller shall be responsible for obtaining
from the applicant, copies of all other local, state and federal permits,
approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of
activity. The Comptroller shall not issue a permit unless all other local,
state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (F)   Preventing increased damages. No development in the flood fringe shall
create a threat to public health and safety.
   (G)   When fill used. If fill is being used to elevate the site above the
base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit
sufficient data and obtain a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the
purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
   (H)   Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is
authorized for use, the volume of space which is occupied by the authorized
fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation
shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of
excavation taken from below the base flood or 100- year frequency flood
elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and
watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas
so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall
be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. Subject to the
review and approval of village staff which includes the Building Department,
Public Works and the Village Engineer, compensation of lost storage will not be
required for a Public Flood Control Project meeting the definition set forth in
§
152.01. Public Flood Control Projects not demonstrating an absence of adverse
impact to adjacent property owners shall comply with the compensatory storage
requirements of the code.

   (C)   Copies of permits. The Comptroller shall be responsible for obtaining
from the applicant copies of all other local, state, and federal permits and
approvals that may be required for this type of activity. The Comptroller shall
not issue the development permit unless all required federal and state permits
have been obtained. A registered professional engineer, under the employ or
contract of the village shall review and approve applications reviewed under
this section.
   (D)   Preventing increased damages and a list of appropriate uses. The only
development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which
will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a
damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a
threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic
and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair
existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be
minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only
those appropriate uses listed in 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3708 will be allowed.
Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new
structures, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel
modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the
floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a
fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an
appropriate use. The approved appropriate uses are as follows:
      (1)   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife.
      (2)   Structures or facilities relating to the use of or requiring access
to the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and
facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent use.
      (3)   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls.
      (4)   Underground and overhead utilities.
      (5)   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems,
including any related fencing (at least 50% open when viewed from any one
direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open
air pavilions.
      (6)   Detached garages, storage sheds, or other non-habitable accessory
structures without toilet facilities to existing buildings that will not block
flood flows, nor reduce floodway storage.
      (7)   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways, and
taxiways and any modification thereto.
      (8)   Parking lots and any modification thereto (where depth of flooding
at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed one foot) and aircraft
parking aprons built at or below ground elevation.
      (9)   Regulatory floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive
non-erosive slope toward a watercourse.
      (10)   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
not more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure
and which are considered substantial improvements to the structure.
      (11)   In the case of damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or
repairs made to a building that are valued at less than 50% of the market value
of the building before it was damaged or replaced and which do not increase the
outside dimensions of the building.
      (12)   Additions to existing buildings above the BFE that do not increase
the building's foot print and are valued at less than 50% of the market value
of the building.
   (E)   Engineering and mitigation activities. Within the regulatory floodway
as identified on the regulatory floodway maps, the construction of an
appropriate use will be considered permissible, provided that the proposed
project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so
stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered
professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection
requirements of §
152.32.
      (1)   Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood
stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on-stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
         (a)   Regulatory floodway conveyance:
            "K" = (1.486/n) x A x R2/3
Where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the
cross-section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See
Open Channel Hydraulics, Yen Te Chow, 1959, McGraw Hill Book Company, New
York).
         (b)   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and
proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state, or local unit of government can assure that the proposed conditions will
be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-
vegetative land cover.
         (c)    Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations
of effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant’s engineer can prove to
IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency.
            1.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length.
            2.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length.
            3.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length
shall be used.
            4.   Transition sections shall be provided between cross-sections
with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the regulatory floodway
delineation on adjacent properties.
            5.   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
      (2)   Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream
flooding.  Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory floodway
storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures
placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory
storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5 times the volume
of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage lost due to a
reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
The compensatory regulatory floodway storage shall be placed between the
proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All
regulatory floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation
shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All regulatory
floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall
be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the
compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed
construction, the applicant’s engineer shall demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through a
determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the
compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no
reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification,
unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure.
      (3)   Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream
erosion or flood heights. For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts
or on stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in
the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage for all flood
events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. However, in the case
of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing
up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be
increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be
avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
      (4)   Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway
approaches. The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for
all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event; or the
upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the
design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded
flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood
stages greater than 0.1 feet, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR for a dam
safety permit or waiver.
         (a)   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in §
152.60. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA Hydraulic Chart for
the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/
Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways calculation
procedures.
         (b)   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per division (E)
(2) of this section.
         (c)   Velocity increases must be mitigated per division (E)(3) of this
section.
         (d)   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for
recreational or commercial navigation, a Department of Transportation permit
must be received.
         (e)    The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge
showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by divisions
(E)(6) and (E)(7) of this section.
         (f)   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be
designed per division (E)(8) of this section.
      (5)   Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts, and
approach roads.
         (a)   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
         (b)   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
         (c)    The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is
a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with the Department of Transportation Rules, 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part
3708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR
for review and concurrence before a permit is issued.
      (6)   On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up
water.  Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when
compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the
design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded
flood easements. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be
obtained from IDNR/OWR for a dam safety permit or waiver for any structure
built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood
flow. All dams and impoundment structures as defined in §
152.01 shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702
(Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a
modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall
be demonstrated that:
         (a)   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by
providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention.
         (b)   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous
fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life
cycle, such as for spawning.
         (c)   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water
quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank
slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin.
         (d)   A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control.
         (e)   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of §
152.40.
      (7)   Floodproofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial
structures. If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building.
Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for
floodproofing activities.
      (8)   Excavation in the floodway. When excavation is proposed in the
design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and
replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures or to compensate for lost
conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided
for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be
used unless an applicant’s engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the
same efficiency:
         (a)   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section,
the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length.
         (b)   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length.
         (c)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length
shall be used.
         (d)   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and
downstream of the transition sections.
      (9)   Channel modifications. If the proposed activity involves a channel
modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
         (a)   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which
would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the
body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank
stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from
the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment
of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable
if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and
fish and wildlife habitat.
         (b)   Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification, and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values.
         (c)   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria:
            1.   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall
match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-
section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.
            2.   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both
the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will
prevent erosion.
            3.   One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization
effects of the vegetation.
            4.   Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is
essential for construction of the channel.
            5.   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Natural
vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred
materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction
rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
            6.   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be
seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
            7.   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity
such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be
provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow
characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall be established where
appropriate.
            8.   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of
the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
            9.   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all
items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.
            10.   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
            11.   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification.
            12.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of §
152.40.
      (10)   Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
      (11)   Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in the
floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
         (a)   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum
vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil
is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be
destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of
improvements.
         (b)   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied
to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the
site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but
will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days.
         (c)   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion
ditches, and sediment basins.
         (d)   A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be
preserved and/or re- established where possible along existing channels.
Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream
crossings shall be constructed, where necessary to minimize erosion. Necessary
construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately.
         (e)   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
designed and implemented consistent with The Illinois Urban Manual and
"Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control" (IEPA,
1987).
      (12)   Public flood control projects.   For public flood control
projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if
the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
      (13)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations.
         (a)    The flood profiles, flows, and floodway data in the regulatory
floodway study referenced in §
152.60 must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data
appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted
for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
         (b)   If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation at the site of the
proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet the requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood
elevations for the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the
receiving stream at normal water elevations.
         (c)    If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a
private owner that a down-stream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing condition and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
      (14)   Conditional letter of map revision.  If the appropriate use would
result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or the 100-year
frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWA and FEMA all
the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a
conditional regulatory floodway map revision and receive the IDNR/OWR
conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change before a permit is
issued. However, the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by FEMA
until as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by FEMA and
IDNR/OWR. In the case of non-governmental projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the
proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval
can be given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued. No further development activities shall
take place until a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA with
concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
      (15)   Professional engineer's supervision. All engineering analyses
shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional
engineer.
      (16)   Construction near channel. For all activities in the floodway
involving construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria
shall be met:
         (a)   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at
least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
         (b)   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the
construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
         (c)   The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer
strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided, when necessary, for
stream maintenance purposes.
         (d)    After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory
floodway change and issuance of a permit and a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision, construction as necessary to change the regulatory floodway
designation may proceed, but no buildings or structures of other construction
that are not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the regulatory
floodway map is changed and a final Letter of Map Revision is received. The
regulatory floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by
IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the “as-built” plans.
   (F)   State review. For those projects listed below located in a regulatory
floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their
review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit:
      (1)   IDNR/OWR will review an engineer’s analysis of the flood profile
due to a proposed bridge pursuant to division (E)(4) of this section.
      (2)   IDNR/OWR will review an engineer’s determination that an existing
bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis
indicating the proposed flood profile, pursuant to division (E)(5) of this
section.
      (3)   IDNR/OWR will review alternative transition sections and
hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to divisions (E)(1), (E)(2), and (E)
(8) of this section.
      (4)   IDNR/OWR will review and approve prior to the start of construction
any department projects, dams (as defined in §
152.01) and all other state, federal or units of local government projects,
including projects of the municipality or county.
   (G)   Other permits. In addition to the other requirements of this chapter,
a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued
unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a
permit is not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to ILCS Ch. 615, Act 5, §
5. No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/OWR has delegated this
responsibility to the village.
   (H)   Dam safety permits. Any work involving the construction, modification
or removal of a dam as defined in §
152.01 per 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall
obtain a IDNR/OWR dam safety permit prior to the start of construction of a
dam. If the Comptroller finds a dam that does not have a IDNR/OWR. permit, they
shall immediately notify the IDNR/OWR. If the Comptroller finds a dam which is
believed to be in unsafe condition, the Comptroller shall immediately notify
the owner of the dam, IDNR/OWR, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency
(IEMA).
   (I)   Activities that do not require a registered professional engineer's
review. The following activities may be permitted without a registered
professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other
requirements of this chapter, including the mitigation requirement.
      (1)   Underground and overhead utilities that:
         (a)   Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations; or
         (b)   Do not require the placement of aboveground structures in the
floodway; or
         (c)   In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe
or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the existing stream bed;
and
         (d)   In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are
placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to catch
debris.
      (2)   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:
         (a)   Do not extend riverward or lake- ward of the existing adjacent
natural bank slope; and
         (b)   Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and
         (c)   Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at the outfall
location.
      (3)   Construction of sidewalks, athletic fields (excluding fences),
properly anchored playground equipment and patios at grade.
      (4)   Construction of shoreline and stream bank protection that:
         (a)   Does not exceed 1,000 feet in length;
         (b)   Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank;
         (c)   Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-sectional
area of the stream channel or bank of the lake; or
         (d)   Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the
preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where high channel
velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative
stabilization measures, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred materials.
Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble, and gabions should
be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
      (5)   Temporary stream crossing in which:
         (a)   The approach roads will be one-half foot or less above natural
grade.
         (b)   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up
the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or
outfall invert.
         (c)   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two
inches below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be non-
erosive material, such as rip-rap or gravel.
         (d)   All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise
stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of
construction.
         (e)   The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within
one year after authorization.

152.99
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 152.60 DUTIES OF THE ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.
   The Comptroller shall be responsible for the general administration and
enforcement of this chapter which shall include the following:
   (A)   Determining the floodplain designation. Check all new development
sites to determine whether they are in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). If
they are in a SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway, flood fringe or
in a floodplain on which a detailed study has not been conducted which drains
more than one square mile.
   (B)   Professional engineer review. If the development site is within a
floodway or in a floodplain on which a detailed study has not been conducted
which drains more than one square mile then the permit shall be referred to a
registered professional engineer (hereinafter referred to as P.E.) under the
employ or contract of the village for review to ensure that the development
meets the requirements of §
152.40. In the case of an appropriate use, the P.E. shall state in writing that
the development meets the requirements of §
152.40.
   (C)   Dam safety requirements. Ensure that an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit has
been issued or a letter indicating no dam safety permit is required, if the
proposed development activity includes construction of a dam as defined in §
152.01. Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or impoundment
structures.
   (D)   Other permit requirements. Ensure that any and all required federal,
state, and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain
development permit.
   (E)   Plan and permit issuance. Ensure that all development activities
within the SFHAs of the jurisdiction of the village meet the requirements of
this chapter and issue a floodplain development permit in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and other regulations of this community when the
development meets the conditions of this chapter.
   (F)   Inspection review. Inspect all development projects before, during,
and after construction to assure proper elevation of the structure and to
ensure they comply with the provisions of this chapter.
   (G)   Elevation and floodproofing certificates. Maintain in the permit files
an elevation certificate, certifying the elevation of the lowest flood
(including basement) of a residential or nonresidential building or the
elevation to which a nonresidential building has been floodproofed, using a
floodproofing certificate, for all buildings subject to §
152.32 for public inspection and provide copies of same.
   (H)   Records for public inspection. Maintain for public inspection and
furnish upon request base flood data. SFHA and regulatory floodway maps, copies
of federal or state permit documents, variance documentation, Conditional
Letter of Map Revision, Letter of Map Revision, Letter of Map Amendment and as-
built elevation and floodproofing or elevation and floodproofing certificates
for all buildings constructed subject to this chapter.
   (I)   State permits. Ensure that construction authorization has been granted
by IDNR/OWR for all development projects subject to §§
152.40 and
152.50, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to the village.
Upon acceptance of this chapter by IDNR/OWR and FEMA, the responsibility is
hereby delegated to the village as per 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3708 for
construction in the regulatory floodway and floodplain when roadways have not
been defined in §§
152.40 and
152.50. However, the following review approvals are not delegated to the
village and shall require review or permits from IDNR/OWR:
      (1)   Organizations which are exempt from this chapter, as per the
Illinois Compiled Statutes;
      (2)   Department of Transportation projects, or Department of Natural
Resources projects, dams, or impoundment structures as defined in §
152.01 and all other state, federal or units of local government projects,
including projects of the village and county, except for those projects meeting
the requirements of §
152.50(J);
      (3)   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, per §
152.50(E)(5);
      (4)   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to §
152.50(E)(4);
      (5)   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
compensatory storage as indicated in §
152.50(E)(1), (E)(2), and (E)(8);
      (6)   Permit issuance of structures within or over publicly navigable
rivers, lakes and streams;
      (7)   Any changes in the base flood elevation or floodway locations; and
      (8)   Base flood elevation determinations where none now exist.
   (J)   Cooperation with other agencies. Cooperate with state and federal
floodplain management agencies to improve base flood or 100-year flood and
floodway data and to improve the administration of this chapter. Submit data to
IDNR/OWR and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for proposed revisions of
a regulatory map. Submit reports as required for the National Flood Insurance
Program. Notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency of any proposed
amendments to this chapter.
   (K)   Promulgate regulations. Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary
to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter, subject, however, to
the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any ordinance changes.
(Ord. 7-28, passed 5-9-07; Am. Ord. 8-70, passed 7-16-08)
§ 152.61 VARIANCES.
   No variances shall be granted to any development located in a regulatory
floodway as defined in
§
152.01. However, when a development proposal is located outside of a regulatory
floodway and whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Comptroller and
Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (A)   Appeals of administrative decisions. The Comptroller is charged with
the duties of inspection and approval of structures and items subject to the
regulations contained in this chapter. In the event that a property owner or
some third party is shown to be affected by said Comptroller's application of
the regulatory provisions contained herein, said person or persons may file a
written petition to the Comptroller within 30 days setting forth the reasons
challenged. In accordance with existing procedures, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall then conduct a hearing providing interested parties with an opportunity
to be heard. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall then either approve, modify, or
overrule the determination of the Comptroller, as applied to the petitioning
party or parties of interest.
   (B)   Summary forwarded. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall forward a written
summary of the action taken to the President and Board of Trustees of the
village, setting forth the findings of the Comptroller and recommendations. The
President and Board of Trustees shall act by approving, modifying, reversing,
or remanding the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (C)   Variances permitted. The President and Board of Trustees of the
village, after receiving the findings and recommendations of the Zoning Board
of Appeals on a petition for a variance from the regulatory standards of this
chapter filed before said Commission, may grant variances from the regulatory
standards of this chapter in accordance with the following requirements:
      (1)   Fee. All petitions for a variance submitted to the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall be accompanied by the payment of a $200 fee to cover the
administrative costs for the processing of the petition.
      (2)   Criteria. No variance shall be granted unless the applicant
demonstrates that:
         (a)   The development activity cannot be located outside the SFHA;
         (b)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
         (c)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
         (d)   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety,
beneficial stream uses and functions, especially aquatic habitat, or creation
of a nuisance;
         (e)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
lost environmental stream uses and functions, rescue or relief operations,
policing, or repairs to stream beds and banks, roads, utilities, or other
public facilities;
         (f)   The provisions of §§
152.40(F) and
152.32(D) shall still be met;
         (g)   The activity is not in a regulatory floodway;
         (h)   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not represent a
general problem; and
         (i)   The granting of the variance will not alter the essential
character of the area involved including existing stream uses.
      (3)   Notice. The Comptroller shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of §
152.32 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
         (a)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
         (b)   Increase the risks to life and property; and
         (c)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant will acknowledge in writing that he or she assumes the
risk and liability.
   (D)   Historic places. Variances requested in connection with restoration of
a site or building listed on the Natural Register of Historical Places or
documented as worthy of preservation by the state Historic Preservation Agency
may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of
divisions (A) and (C)(2) of this section.
   (E)   Disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by
this subchapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based
on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of
study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that development, either inside or
outside of the SFHA, will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does
not create liability on the part of the village or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. 7-28, passed 5-9-07 ; Am. Ord. 8-70, passed 7-16-08)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   (A)    Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of
a variance resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. Upon
due investigation, the Comptroller may determine that a violation of the
minimum standards of this chapter exists. The Comptroller shall notify the
owner in writing of such violation.
   (B)   If such owner fails after ten days' notice to correct the violation:
      (1)   The village may make application to the Circuit Court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the Court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      (2)   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction
thereof, be fined not less than $50 nor more than $1,000 for each offense.
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues.
      (4)   The village may record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   (C)   The Comptroller shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a willful act to increase flood damages and, therefore, may cause
coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
   (D)   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION PROGRAM
§ 153.01 CREATION AND GOALS.
   There is hereby established a Neighborhood Preservation Program. The goals
of the Neighborhood Preservation Program are as follows:
   (A)   To prevent the deterioration and abandonment of housing in
transitional neighborhoods.
   (B)   To preserve, coordinate and concentrate maintenance efforts by the
village in designated neighborhoods.
   (C)   To promote private investment in housing in those neighborhoods.
   (D)   To promote community involvement in all such activities.
(`95 Code, § 153.01) (Ord. 79-5, passed 4-11-79)
§ 153.02 CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATING NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION AREAS.
   (A)   The village has conducted studies in consultation with community
representatives to determine which neighborhoods within the village should be
considered for designation as neighborhood preservation areas and will develop
appropriate programs for each neighborhood so designated.
   (B)   An area meeting any of the following criteria will be eligible for
designation as a neighborhood preservation area:
      (1)   Where the existing housing stock is now essentially sound but where
private financial institutions and property owners have recently begun to
withdraw financing;
      (2)   Where the housing stock has deteriorated but is in need of moderate
rehabilitation only;
      (3)   Where there are substantial numbers of housing units in violation
of existing village building codes;
      (4)   Where there have been recent increases in adverse housing
indicators;
      (5)   Where existing unique community resources distinguish the
neighborhoods, such as historic sites or buildings; and/or,
      (6)   Where economic development activities occur which alleviate
physical and economic distress through public and private investment, expand
economic opportunities for low and moderate income persons, enhance the
viability of commercial enterprises serving low and moderate income areas, and
meets the goals of a commercial development and/or revitalization strategy.
(`95 Code, § 153.02) (Ord. 79-5, passed 4-11-79)
§ 153.03 IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAM.
   (A)   Upon designation of neighborhood preservation areas by the village,
the village will transmit a communication to the County Bureau of
Administration, Office of the Chief Administrative Officer.
   (B)   This communication will include the following:
      (1)   A legal description of the neighborhood preservation areas
designated by the village, and an official village map delineating the area.
      (2)   A statement that the ordinance or resolution designating the
neighborhood preservation area did not become final until members of the public

purposes. The registration statement shall be deemed prima facie proof of the
statements therein contained in any administrative enforcement proceeding or
court proceeding instituted by the village against the owner or owners of the
building. Registration of a building in accordance with this section shall be
deemed to satisfy the registration requirements set forth in the village
ordinances and the notification requirement set forth in the village

      (2)   In addition to other information required by the Building
Commissioner, the registration statement shall include the name, street address
and telephone number of a natural person 21 years of age or older, designated
by the owner or owners as the authorized agent for receiving notices of code
violations and for receiving process, in any court proceeding or administrative
enforcement proceeding, on behalf of such owner or owners in connection with
the enforcement of this code. This person must maintain an office in Cook
County, Illinois, or must actually reside within Cook County, Illinois. An
owner who is a natural person and who meets the requirement of this subsection
as to location of residence or office may designate himself or herself as
agent. By designating an authorized agent under the provisions of this
subsection the owner is consenting to receive any and all notices of code
violations concerning the registered building and all process in any court
proceeding or administrative enforcement proceeding brought to enforce code
provisions concerning the registered building by service of the notice or
process on the authorized agent. Any owner who has designated an authorized
agent or until the owner files a new annual registration statement. Any owner
who fails to register a vacant building under the provisions of this subsection
shall further be deemed to consent to receive, by posting at the building, any
and all notices of code violations and all process in an administrative
proceeding brought to enforce code provisions concerning the building.
   (B)   Responsibilities of owner or manager. The owner of any building that
has become vacant, and any person maintaining, operating or collecting rent for
any building that has become vacant shall, within 30 days, do the following:
      (1)   Enclose and secure the building;
      (2)   Post a sign affixed to the building indicating the name, address
and telephone number of the owner and the owner's authorized agent for the

location so as to be legible from the nearest public street or sidewalk,
whichever is nearer; and
      (3)   Maintain the building in a secure and closed condition and maintain
the sign until the building is again occupied or until repair or completion of
the building has been undertaken.
   (C)   Liability insurance. The owner of any building that has become vacant

   (D)   Rules and regulations to be promulgated. The Building Commissioner may
issue rules and regulations for the administration of this section. These rules
may designate board-up materials and methods which must be used when securing a
building so that the boarding is reasonably incapable of being removed by

it is relevant to consider, among other factors, the percentage of the overall
square footage of the building and the presence of rental or for sale signs on
the property; provided that a residential property shall not be deemed vacant
if it has been used as a residence by a person entitled to possession for a
period of at least three months within the previous nine months and a person

(Ord. 02-26, passed 7-19-02)
§ 153.33 LIENS FOR PROPERTY MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES FOR VACANT BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Definition. A VACANT BUILDING is a building or portion of a building
which is:
      (1)   Defined in §
153.31 as "vacant"; or
      (2)   Defined in ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-20-15.1 as an "abandoned
residential property," being a residential dwelling unit that has been
unoccupied by any lawful occupant or occupants for at least 90 days, and for
which after such 90 day period the village has made good faith efforts to
contact the legal owner or owners of the property or, if known, the agent of
the owner, and no contact has been made.
   (B)   Nuisance declared. Vacant buildings that are indefinitely vacant and
in a state of disrepair or boarded are public nuisances in that they contribute
to the decrease in value of surrounding properties, precipitate disinvestment
by neighboring owners, provide a location for criminal activity, undermine the
aesthetic character of the neighborhood and village, and have other undesirable
effects.
   (C)   Nuisance abatement. The village is authorized to perform or provide
for property maintenance activities to abate the nuisance caused by a vacant
building, including the following:
      (1)   Cutting and removal of neglected weeds, grass, trees, and bushes as
authorized by §§
100.086 and
150.34(I) of this Code and ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-20-7;
      (2)   Pest control activities, as authorized by §§
50.20 and
150.34(K) of this Code and ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-20-8;
      (3)   Removal of infected trees as authorized by §
100.100 of this Code and ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-20-12;
      (4)   Removal of garbage, debris, and graffiti and related activities as
authorized by §§
157.06 and
150.34(K) and
Chapter 136 of this Code and ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-20-13; and
      (5)   Removal, securing, and enclosing of abandoned residential
properties as authorized by §
150.34(D) and ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-31-1.01.
   (D)   Charges for nuisance abatement. The village shall have the authority
to collect from the property owner the costs incurred in performing the
property maintenance activities to abate the nuisances described in this
section. The village shall send a bill for the cost to the property owner, his
or her agent, legal representative, or occupant in legal possession or control
of the premises.
   (E)   Traditional lien procedure. If a bill sent pursuant to division (D) of
this section is not paid in full within 30 days of the date of the bill, the
village shall have the authority to file and record a lien against the
property, pursuant to § 11-20-15 of the Illinois Municipal Code, ILCS Ch. 65,
Act 5, § 11-20-15. If, for any one property, the village engaged in any
nuisance abatement activity described in division (C) of this section on more
than one occasion during the course of one year, then the village may combine
any or all of the costs of those activities into a single notice of lien. The
lien must be filed in accordance with the lien procedure established by the
specific Code provision of which the property is alleged to be in violation or,
if no such procedure exists, then the following procedure shall apply:
      (1)   Notice of lien.
         (a)   The village or the person performing the service by authority of
the village, in its, his or her own name, may file a notice of lien in the
office of the recorder of deeds in the county in which the real estate is
located. The notice of lien shall be filed within one year after the cost and
expense is incurred.
         (b)   The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting
forth:
            1.   A description of the real estate that sufficiently describes
the parcel;
            2.   The amount of the cost and expense incurred or payable for the
activities; and
            3.   The date or dates when such cost and expense was incurred by
the village or someone working on behalf of the village.
         (c)   After recording, the notice of lien shall be sent by certified
mail to the property owner, his or her agent or legal representative or
occupant in legal possession or control of the premises and, if different, to
the person who received the tax bill for the preceding year.
      (2)   Release of lien. Upon payment of the cost after the notice of lien
has been filed as provided herein, the lien shall be released by the village or
person in whose name the lien has been filed, and the release shall be recorded
of record in the same manner as recording the notice of lien.
      (3)   Foreclosure of lien. Subsequent to the filing of the above-
described lien, the village may cause to be filed a complaint for foreclosure
of such lien, or upon becoming a defendant in a pending lawsuit affecting the
premises or real estate, by answer to the complaint or in the nature of an
intervening petition or cross-complaint the village may proceed in its
corporate name to foreclose such lien. An action to foreclose a lien under this
section must be commenced within two years after the date of filing notice of
lien. The property subject to a lien arising under this section shall be sold
for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to
pay the monies owing the village.
   (F)   Priority lien procedure for abandoned residential properties. The
priority lien procedure described in this division shall apply only to costs
incurred for property maintenance activities performed on abandoned residential
properties, as defined in division (A)(2) of this section, and is an
alternative to the traditional lien authorized by division (E) of this section.
If a bill sent pursuant to division (D) of this section is not paid in full
within 30 days of the date of the bill, the village shall have the authority to
file and record a priority lien against the property, pursuant to § 11-20-15.1

the village, in its, his or her own name, may file a notice of a priority lien
in the office of the recorder of deeds in the county in which the real estate
is located. The notice of lien shall be filed within one year after the cost
and expense is incurred. If, for any one property, the village engaged in any
nuisance abatement activity described in division (C) of this section on more
than one occasion during the course of one year, then the village may combine
any or all of the costs of those activities into a single notice of lien.
         (b)   The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting

            1.   A description of the abandoned residential property that
sufficiently describes the parcel;
            2.   The amount of the cost incurred or payable for the activities;
            3.   The date or dates when such cost was incurred by the village
or someone working on behalf of the village; and
            4.   A statement that the lien has been filed pursuant to one or
more of the property maintenance activities described in division (C) of this
section and authorized by ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, §§ 11-20-7(d), 11-20-8(d), 11-20-
12(d), 11-20-13(e), 11-31-1.01, as applicable.

mail to the property owner, his or her agent or legal representative or
occupant in legal possession or control of the premises and, if different, to
the person who received the tax bill for the preceding year.
         (d)   The village may not file a lien if the lender has provided
notice to the village that the lender has performed, or will perform, remedial
actions; provided, however, that the remedial actions must be performed or
initiated in good faith within 30 days of the lender's notice to the village.
      (2)   Recordkeeping. To enforce a lien pursuant to this division (F), the
village must maintain contemporaneous records that include, at a minimum:
         (a)   A dated statement of a finding by the village that the property
has become abandoned residential property;
         (b)   The date when the property was first observed to be unoccupied
by any lawful occupant;
         (c)   A description of the actions taken by the village to contact the
legal owner of the property, or if known, any agent of the owner;
         (d)   A statement that no contacts were made with the legal owner or,
if known, any agent of the owner;
         (e)   A dated certification by a village official of the necessity and
specific nature of the work performed;
         (f)   A copy of the agreement with the person or company performing
the work and the rates and estimated cost of the work, if applicable;
         (g)   Detailed invoices and payment vouchers for the work; and
         (h)   A statement whether the work was competitively bid, and if so, a
copy of all proposals submitted by the bidders.
      (3)   Release of lien. Upon payment of the cost after the notice of lien
has been filed as provided herein, the lien shall be released by the village or
person in whose name the lien has been filed, and the release shall be recorded
of record in the same manner as recording the notice of lien.
      (4)   Enforcement of lien. A lien under this division (F) is enforceable
by the village, or entity or person who performs work on behalf of the village,
at the hearing for confirmation of the foreclosure sale of the abandoned
residential property and is limited to a claim of interest in the proceeds of
the sale. The priority lien is superior to all other liens and encumbrances,
except tax liens.

§ 154.051 MAJOR SUBDIVISION FINAL PLAT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Filing deadline. Within one year after the date of the approval of the
preliminary plat by the Plan Commission, the subdivider shall file for approval
of final plat of a major subdivision for approval and recording as described
herein below.
      (1)   Time extensions. Upon the request of the subdivider made within the
first 270 days following the date of the approval of the preliminary plat as
aforesaid, and for good cause shown, the Plan Commission may extend the time
for submitting the final plat for approval for an additional 90 days, provided
that only one such extension may be granted with respect to any given
subdivision proposal.
      (2)   Revocation of preliminary plat approval. The subdivider's failure
to submit a final plat to the Plan Commission for approval within the time or
extension thereof set forth above shall operate as an automatic revocation of
the approval of the preliminary plat, and the subsequent subdivision of the
same property shall proceed only upon application to the village as set forth
herein for original applications.
   (B)   Filing requirements for final plat of major subdivision. These
requirements are cumulative to and augment the filing requirements for a
preliminary plat of a major subdivision. At the time of filing of a final plat
of major subdivision, the subdivider shall submit an engineering, drainage and

§ 154.053 AVOIDANCE OF PRELIMINARY PLAT PROCEDURES.
   An applicant may waive the right to preliminary approval process and may
instead file all of the data required in this section for such approval at the
same time as such applicant files engineering plans and the final plat. The
preliminary and final plat may then be filed and approved simultaneously if all
requirements hereof are met. Provided, if desired by the subdivider, the final
plat may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which
the subdivider proposes to record and develop at that time, and provided
further that if the development be staged, all staged final plats shall conform
substantially to the preliminary plat as approved. Approval for the final plat
may be submitted in stages with each stage reflecting a portion of the approved
preliminary plat which is proposed to be recorded and developed; provided,
however, that such portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations.
The final plat shall be essentially in accord with the preliminary plat.
However, before undertaking the formal procedures outlined in this chapter, an
applicant is urged to submit a preliminary plat and discuss the proposal with
the Comptroller and the Village Engineer to ascertain the requirements
affecting the subdivision.

unable to meet any federal or state requirement for reserves, is insolvent, is
in danger of becoming any of the foregoing, or is otherwise in danger of being
unable to honor such guarantee at any time during its term, or if the village
otherwise reasonably deems itself to be insecure, then the village shall have
the right to demand that the subdivider, developer, or redeveloper provide a
replacement guarantee from an institution satisfactory to the village. Such
replacement guarantee shall be deposited with the village not later than ten
days following such demand.
      (6)   If the subdivider, developer, or redeveloper fails or refuses to
complete the construction of the public and private improvements covered by the
guarantee or fails or refuses to correct any defect or deficiency in such
improvements upon request by the village, or in any other manner fails or
refuses to meet fully any of its obligations under the guarantee or the
applicable development agreement, then the village may, in its sole and
absolute discretion, retain all or any part of the guarantee. The village
thereafter shall have the right to exercise any other action it deems
reasonable and appropriate to mitigate the effects of such failure or refusal,
and to reimburse itself from the proceeds of the guarantee for all of its costs
and expenses, including legal fees and administrative expenses. If the funds
remaining in the guarantee are insufficient to repay fully the village for all
such costs and expenses, and to maintain a cash reserve equal to the required
guarantee during the entire time of such costs and expenses, and to maintain a
cash reserve equal to the required guarantee during the entire time such
guarantee should have been maintained, then the person shall, upon demand of
the village therefor, immediately deposit with the village such additional
funds as the village determines necessary.
   (E)   Performance guarantees for the installation of public and private
improvements shall be in a form approved by the Comptroller. The following
types of performance guarantee are acceptable, provided they are consistent
with the regulations below.

the total amount of the guarantee required is placed with the Comptroller and
administered in accordance with the provisions of the subdivision or
development agreement.
      (2)   Irrevocable letter of credit and cash; surety bond. An irrevocable
letter of credit or surety bond may be used as a guarantee, provided such
letter of credit or surety bond is issued by a financial institution approved
by the Comptroller, the administration of such letter of credit or surety bond
conforms to the terms of the development agreement, and the letter of credit or
surety bond is accompanied by a cash deposit in an amount not less than 10% of
the total guarantee amount. The cash deposit shall, at all times until
released, as provided herein, be maintained at not less than 10% of the initial
total guarantee amount. The financial institution issuing the irrevocable
letter of credit or surety bond shall be:

Illinois.
   (F)   The subdivider, developer, or redeveloper may make a written request
to the Village Engineer to partially reduce the amount of the approved
performance guarantee. The Village Engineer shall be authorized to approve such
partial reductions in the amount of the performance guarantee, provided:
      (1)   There shall be no more than three partial reductions approved in
the amount of the performance guarantee during the life of the subdivision;
      (2)   Partial reductions shall be authorized only following the
acceptable completion of the following improvements:
         (a)   All underground storm drainage, sanitary sewer and water supply
systems have been properly installed and all erosion and sediment controls are
operational;
         (b)   All curb, gutter, sidewalk and base course paving for public and

      (3)   The inspection reports for the subdivision evidence acceptable
completion of the above;
      (4)   The amount of such partial reduction shall not exceed 75% of the
estimated cost to construct such improvements;
      (5)   In no event shall the amount of the performance guarantee be
reduced to a level which, in the sole and absolute opinion of the Village
Engineer, would not allow the village to complete the installation of public
and private improvements associated with the subdivision; and
      (6)   In no event shall any portion of the cash deposit be reduced prior
to final release of the performance guarantee.
   (G)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, public
improvements shall not be considered accepted by the village unless and until
each of the following reviews and actions have been successfully performed:
      (1)   Filing with the Village Engineer a formal written request to accept
the improvements by the subdivider, developer, or redeveloper;
      (2)   Certification by the Village Engineer that all, or specific

included in the guarantee have been 100% completed to the satisfaction of the
Village Engineer, the Comptroller shall release the guarantee.
   (I)   Prior to the acceptance of required public improvements by the
village, the subdivider, developer, or redeveloper shall execute a maintenance
agreement, acceptable in form and substance to the Village Attorney, for the
repair or replacement of defective materials and workmanship for a period of
time extending two years from the effective date of village acceptance of such
improvements. A maintenance guarantee conforming with the requirements of this
division shall be submitted with the maintenance agreement. The amount of the
maintenance guarantee shall be 10% of the total amount of the initial
performance guarantee for the subdivision, development, or redevelopment. The
Village Engineer shall be authorized to execute such agreements on behalf of
the village following Board of Trustees acceptance of such public improvements.
If, after two years, no defects in workmanship or materials have developed, the
maintenance guarantee shall be released by the Village Engineer. In the event
any defects are identified by the Village Engineer during the term of the
maintenance guarantee, the balance of such guarantee shall be released only
after: the village has been fully reimbursed for amounts expended in correcting
defective improvements, or the subdivider or developer has successfully
repaired all such defects to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer.

§ 154.067 EQUALIZATION CONTRIBUTION TO PREEXISTING MUNICIPAL UTILITY
IMPROVEMENTS.
   Where the property comprising said subdivision or development has not
contributed to the cost of installation of the public water system, or the
public sewer system, the facilities of which are to be used by said
development, the subdivider or developer shall pay a fee or fees, for the
respective connections to said public water system and public sewer system or
any extensions of said systems fee shall be as follows:
   (A)   For connecting to the existing water mains as aforesaid, or any
extensions thereof, an amount equivalent to $50 multiplied by the number of
housing units within the subdivision or land to be served.
   (B)   For connecting to the existing sewer trunk lines and sewer system as
aforesaid or any extensions thereof, an amount equivalent to $50 multiplied by
the number of housing units within the subdivision or land to be served.
   (C)   The amount so payable shall be paid at the time when any subdivision
or development is approved and accepted by the Village Board. If said
subdivision or development is already approved and accepted by the Village
Board, then said amount shall be paid on or prior to making the respective
connection to the existing municipal water system, or existing municipal sewer
system, or any extensions of said respective systems.
   (D)   (1)   The amount so due and payable shall not affect or impair the
liability of any person or applicant to pay for inspection, license, permit or
service fees which are or may become due to the village by reason of any law or
ordinance heretofore or hereafter adopted by the Village Board but said amount
so due shall be considered and be a charge for the privilege of using the
existing sewer and water systems installed throughout the village towards the
cost of which said person or applicant or the land to be served have not
heretofore made any contribution.
      (2)   In addition to the foregoing, the Village Board may adopt
ordinances providing for the recapture of costs expended by a developer for
public improvements. Said recapture ordinances are intended to compensate a
developer or property owner who has installed a public improvement of a size
and character greater than that required to serve the original development in
order that future development may utilize such facilities. Such ordinances,
when adopted, shall provide for a fair and equal distribution of the additional
costs of said improvements beyond that otherwise borne by the developer and
shall further provide for the payment of subsequent developers of their fair
and proportionate share of the cost of said improvements upon utilization of
said improvements.
      (3)   The recapture payments provided by such ordinances shall be paid to
the village for the use and benefit of the original developer or designated
successor. Said recapture ordinances shall further provide for a reasonable
rate of interest as determined by the Village Board unless all parties to the
ordinance, including the original developer and the landowners to be
benefitted, shall agree to waive said interest. Said interest shall be
calculated at the rate determined by the Village Board.

§ 154.068 EQUALIZATION CONTRIBUTION FOR PREEXISTING PUBLIC SIDEWALKS.
   Where the property comprising said subdivision or development has not
contributed to the cost of installation of an existing public sidewalk, the
facilities of which are to be used by said subdivision or development, there
shall be charged and the subdivider or developer shall pay a fee or fees for
the respective sidewalk according to an engineer's estimate of cost prepared by
the Village Engineer. Said engineer's estimate of cost will be based on the
actual construction cost, if known, plus an increase based upon the increase in
the "Engineering News-Record" construction cost index. If the actual
construction cost is not known, then the estimate will be based upon the
construction cost for sidewalks in the past, plus an increase for the increase
in the "Engineering News-Record" construction cost index. Said fee shall be
paid prior to the issuance of a land development permit.

§ 154.069 RESERVATION TO PUBLIC USE.
   Whenever a proposed subdivision under the jurisdiction of this chapter has
an area of more than five acres, the subdivider, developer, or redeveloper may
be required to designate a minimum of 10% of the area, exclusive of public
streets and alleys, as "reserved for a period of one year for future
acquisition by a public agency and dedicated to public use, the price to be
paid for the land shall be fair market value at the time of acquisition". The
location of the area shall be referred to the Plan Commission for
recommendation and then the Village Board for approval and the area shall be
appropriately marked on the plat prior to the approval of the plat. The
acquisition shall take place within one year from the date of approval of the
subdivision or development. In the event a public agency does not acquire the
land within the one year period, the land shall be eligible for subdivision in
accordance with the then existing zoning standards and subdivision and
development regulations.

DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS
§ 154.080 MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS.
   Every subdivision shall comply with the terms and conditions of the official
plan, the zoning ordinance and this chapter, with the exception that any plat
which has received preliminary approval shall be exempt from any subsequent
amendments to the zoning ordinance, rendering the plat non-conforming as to
bulk, provided that approval of the final plat is obtained within one year from
the date of preliminary approval. In addition, the plat shall meet the minimum
design standards outlined below. Immediately following receipt of an
application for the approval of a subdivision, the Village Clerk shall forward
copies of the entire application with all supporting documentation to the
Comptroller, Village Engineer and the Village Attorney for their review and
analyses.
   (A)   Lots.
      (1)   Lot shapes. Every lot shall have four sides. Exceptions may be
approved when the applicant demonstrates that a four-sided lot is not feasible
because of peculiar topographical conditions, abutting lots of record or
abutting parcels not owned directly or indirectly by the applicant, or
preexisting buildings not owned directly or indirectly by the applicant. A lot
of other than four sides will not be approved if it appears that such lot has
been so formed solely to comply with the minimum area, depth and width
requirements of the zoning ordinance. As nearly as practicable, intersecting
lot lines shall form right angles with each other.
      (2)   Lot depths, area and widths. The size and orientation of lots shall

existing adjacent tract of land in nonconformity with requirements of the
official plan, the zoning ordinance or the minimum design standards of this
chapter.
   (B)   Streets and pedestrian ways. The plat of the proposed subdivision
shall provide for dedication of the necessary land for public streets proposed
by the plat and projected by the official plan. Where streets and alleys abut a
subdivision and are indicated by the official plan to be widened, land shall be
dedicated to provide one-half the required right-of-way width as measured from
the required centerline of such street or alley. In general, blocks shall not
exceed 1,200 feet in length with a practical maximum being 1,000 feet. Block
lengths and width shall be coordinated with the development of the land and
shall be provided in a manner that will allow the proper traffic flow and
pedestrian use.
      (1)   Width of rights-of-way. Width of street and alley rights-of-way
shall be as shown in the official plan for major streets; provided, however,

convenience and safety, and the proposed uses of the land to be served.
         (b)   Generally, the arrangement of streets within a subdivision shall
make provision for the continuation of existing or proposed streets in
adjoining areas and, when a new subdivision adjoins land susceptible of being
subdivided or resubdivided, new streets shall be carried to the boundaries of
the tract proposed to be subdivided.
         (c)   Whenever, in the opinion of the Mayor and Board of Trustees,
topography, state highways, rivers, water courses, or other physical conditions
require the platting and establishment of dead-end streets, such streets shall
have adequate width for turn around, which may include cul-de-sacs having a
radius of no less than 40 feet from center of cul-de-sac to outside edge of
pavement to ensure that emergency vehicles can access all lots fronting upon
the dead-end street within a reasonable amount of time.
         (d)   Streets in or near floodways. Streets platted near and/or within
floodways shall be located in compliance with the storm water management
ordinances of the village. In all instances, the elevation of street and

streets serving industrial and commercial property. Greater pavement width
requirements shall be based on the function of the particular street in
accordance with the traffic plan.
         (b)   Half streets. In the event any proposed street right-of-way is
at the edge of a subdivision and only half the proposed right-of-way (a minimum
of 33 feet) falls within the subdivision the road will be built to allow two
moving lanes of traffic (24 feet of pavement) as a minimum. In the event the
road benefits primarily the subdivider, the Plan Commission may recommend full
right-of-way width dedication and/or full improvement of the road.
         (c)   Frontage streets. Where deemed necessary, the Plan Commission
may recommend access streets be required to service areas fronting on major
thoroughfares.
         (d)   Alleys. The Plan Commission may recommend alleys or private
service roads be provided at the rear of all lots or tracts intended for
business, commercial, industrial and multi-family residential building uses.

ways for public facilities, parks, playgrounds, school grounds and other public
grounds as may be required by the Plan Commission to conform to the principles
set forth in the official plan. In addition, any public grounds designated on
the official plan which lie within a proposed subdivision shall be dedicated
for the use intended in the official plan.
   (D)   Utility and drainage easements. The plat of the proposed subdivision
shall provide for dedications of easements of sufficient widths to provide
subdivided lots with utility services; however, in no event shall such an
easement be less than 20 feet in width. Where practicable, such easements shall
be located at the rear and sides of each lot so as to provide continuity of
alignment of such easements from block to block. The plat of the proposed
subdivision shall also provide for dedications of easements necessary for storm
or flood water run-off channels and basins. In addition:

individual lots. A drainage easement shall be granted for all areas designated
on the final plat as retention or detention in the drainage plans of the
subdivision. An easement of a minimum of five feet by five feet offset from any
drainage facility and outside any easement required for drainage shall be
provided for electrical transformers and telephone junction centers. All
required easements shall be shown on the final subdivision plat. Easements
required by this subdivision may also be used for the installation of utility
facilities which do not interfere with the use of the easements for drainage
purposes.
      (6)   Cable television, telephone boxes and electrical transformers.
Electrical transformers, and telephone and cable television junction boxes
shall be located underground but when by necessity they are located above
ground, shall not be placed in any portion of a designated drainage or storm
water control facility.
      (7)   Final grading and top of foundation plans. At the time of final
plat approval the subdivider shall submit for approval by the Village Engineer,
a lot grading and foundation elevation plan. It shall show at each lot corner
the proposed U.S.G.S. elevation for that point. Arrows drawn along all lot
lines shall show the direction of drainage flow. The top of the foundation
shall be shown by a U.S.G.S. elevation. That elevation shall be noted inside
the symbol for the structure location on the lot. Where there is more than one
foundation level for the structure, the elevation for the lowest foundation
level shall be shown. The foundation elevation shall be such that the lot
drainage be designed to run away from the top of the foundation. In the event
conditions dictate that some parts of the lot be higher than the structure
foundation, the grading plan will show specific drainage configurations for the
lot specifying that all drainage is directed away from the foundation.
      (8)   Engineering and inspection. Improvements for sanitary sewer, water
main, storm sewer, road, concrete curb and gutter, electric street lighting
lines, electrical distribution system, drainage, and appurtenances thereto,
shall be submitted to the Village Engineer for approval before final approval
has been made of the subdivision plat by the Mayor and Board of Trustees. Any

obstructs, retards or changes the direction of the natural flow of water.
   (F)   Special standards for lots-in-depth.
      (1)   In the "R1" Single-family Residential District, whenever a proposed
subdivision provides for the division of an existing parcel of land, one or
more lots-in-depth may be permitted provided dividing the parcel in question
into conventional lots, each having full frontage upon a street, is impossible
because of lot configuration or natural features located on the land within the
proposed subdivision, such as watercourses, state highways, or parks.
      (2)   Provided the proposed subdivision meets the above requirements, a
lot-in-depth must conform to the following additional requirements:
         (a)   The lot-in-depth shall have frontage upon an existing street by
means of its stem, which shall be at least 20 feet wide, containing a minimum
12 foot wide driveway.
         (b)   Minimum four foot wide landscape buffers shall be provided:
adjacent to adjoining properties on both sides of the stem; and within the
stem. In order to assure visual clearance at the street, the shrub screen and
groundcover plantings located in these buffers and within ten feet of the edge
of pavement shall meet the approval of the Village Engineer prior to the
issuance of an occupancy certificate by the village for structures located on
the lot-in-depth.
         (c)   No building or other structure shall be placed or constructed
upon any part of the stem.
         (d)   Exclusive of the entire area of the stem, the entire remaining
area included within any permitted lot-in-depth shall contain 100% of the
minimum lot area for conventional lots in any such zoning district.
         (e)   Upon its review of a plat containing a lot-in-depth, the Plan
Commission shall require building setback lines from all lot lines to be
installed upon the platted area of the lot-in-depth. The minimum required
building setback lines of a lot-in-depth shall be dependent upon the required
zoning yards of any other lots adjacent to such lot-in-depth. Where a lot-in-
depth abuts a front or rear yard of an adjacent lot, the required building
setback lines shall be located away from the lot line a distance equal to 120%
of the required abutting front or rear yard. Where a lot-in-depth abuts a side
yard, the required building setback lines shall be located away from the lot
line a distance equal to 100% of the required abutting side yard.
         (f)   Lots-in-depth shall conform to all other applicable regulations
of this chapter.
   (G)   Unbuildable parcels. A subdivision shall not create or include
"outlots" or unsubdivided parcels. In addition, no subdivision shall include a
portion of a lot of record, without including the entire lot of record unless,
prior to the date of adoption of this chapter the portion of the lot of record
not included in the subject subdivision has been under separate ownership from
the portion of the lot of record included in the subject subdivision.

open space or improvements.
      (5)   Every property having a right to the use or enjoyment of such open
space or improvements must pay its pro rata share of the cost of the
association by means of an assessment to be levied by the association that
meets the requirements for becoming a lien on the property in accordance with
state statutes.
      (6)   The association must have the right to adjust the assessment to
meet changed needs. The membership vote required to authorize such adjustment
shall not be fixed at more than 51% of the members voting on the issue.
      (7)   The village must be given the right to enforce the covenants.
      (8)   The village must be given the right, after ten days' written notice
to the association: to perform any maintenance or repair work that the
association has neglected to perform; to assess the membership for such work;
and to have a lien placed against the property of any member failing to pay
such assessment. For this purpose alone, the village shall have all the rights
and powers of the association and its governing body under the agreements and
declarations creating the association.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall hereafter be known, cited and referred to as the Bellwood
Zoning Code.
(`95 Code, § 156.001) (Ord. 83-11, passed 9- -83)
§ 156.002 INTENT; PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted with the purpose of protecting and promoting
the public health, safety, comfort and general welfare. The fulfillment of this
purpose is to be accomplished by seeking to:
      (1)   Lessen congestion on the public streets.
      (2)   Avoid undue concentration of population.
      (3)   Prevent the overcrowding of land, thereby ensuring proper living
and working conditions and preventing the development of blight and slums.
      (4)   Establish adequate standards for the provision of light, air and
open space.
      (5)   Facilitate the provision of adequate transportation, and of other
public requirements and services such as water, sewerage, schools, and parks.
      (6)   Zone all properties with a view to conserving the value of
buildings and land, and encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout
the village.
      (7)   Protect residential, business, commercial and industrial areas
alike from harmful encroachment by incompatible uses and ensure that land
allocated to a class of uses shall not be usurped by other inappropriate uses.
      (8)   Avoid the inappropriate development of lands and provide for
adequate drainage, curbing of erosion and reduction of flood damage.
      (9)   Establish reasonable standards to which buildings and structures
shall conform.
      (10)   Encourage reasonable flexibility of development design through
appropriate innovation.
      (11)   Facilitate the recognition of beauty and aesthetics as a value and
standard throughout the village.
      (12)   Prevent such additions to, and alterations or remodeling of,
existing buildings or structures as would not comply with the restrictions and
limitations imposed herein.
      (13)   Provide for the regulation of nonconforming buildings and uses,
including the gradual elimination thereof.
      (14)   Foster a more rational pattern of relationship between
residential, business, commercial and manufacturing uses for the mutual benefit
of all.
      (15)   Isolate or control the location of unavoidable nuisance-producing
uses.
      (16)   Define the powers and duties of the administrative and enforcement
officers and bodies.
      (17)   Prescribe penalties for any violation of the provisions of this
chapter or of any amendment thereto.
   (B)   The standards and requirements contained in this chapter, and the
district mapping reflected on the Zoning Map, are intended to further the
implementation of the objectives of all current and certified village land use
plans, as well as protect all desirable existing structures and uses.
(`95 Code, § 156.002) (Ord. 83-11, passed 9- -83)
§ 156.003 SCOPE.
   (A)   All buildings erected hereafter, all uses of land or buildings
established hereafter, and all structural alterations or relocations of
existing buildings occurring hereafter shall be subject to all regulations of
this chapter which are applicable to the zoning districts in which such
buildings, uses or land shall be located.
   (B)   However, where a building permit for a building or structure has been
issued in accordance with law prior to the effective date of this chapter and
provided that construction is begun within 6 months of such effective date and
diligently prosecuted to completion (completion to be accomplished within 18
months of the adoption of this chapter) the building or structure may be
completed in accordance with the approved plans on the basis of which the
building permit has been issued, and further, may upon completion be occupied
under a certificate of occupancy by the use for which originally designated,
subject thereafter to the provisions of §§
156.085 et seq.
   (C)   Where the Zoning Administrator has issued a permissive use permit, a
conditional use permit, or a permit for a variation pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter, such permit shall become null and void unless work thereon is
substantially under way within 12 months of the date of the issuance of such
permit by the Zoning Administrator, and completed within 18 months of start of
construction.
   (D)   A conditional use permit shall be deemed to authorize only one
particular conditional use and shall expire if the conditional use shall cease
for more than 12 months for any reason.
   (E)   Where a lot is to be occupied for a permitted use without buildings,
the side yards and front yard required for such lot shall be provided and
maintained unless otherwise stipulated in this chapter, except that side yards
shall not be required on lots used for garden purposes without buildings or
structures and no side or front yards shall be required on lots used for public
recreation areas.
   (F)   No land which is located in a residence district shall be used for
driveway, walkway or access purposes to any land which is located in business
or industrial districts, or used for any purpose not permitted in a residence
district.
(`95 Code, § 156.003) (Ord. 83-11, passed 9- -83)
§ 156.004 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the
public health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience, prosperity and general
welfare.
   (B)   Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this chapter, upon
the use of land or buildings or upon the bulk of buildings, are either more
restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other
provision or this chapter or of any other law, ordinance, resolution, rule or
regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive or which
impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.
   (C)   Although the district requirements are couched in very specific terms
in most instances, reasonable flexibility is offered through such devices as
conditional use, planned development, and variations. A principal objective of
this chapter is the encouragement of appropriate innovation.
   (D)   This chapter is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or
any other private agreement, provided that where the regulations of this
chapter are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than
such easements, covenants, or other private agreements, the requirements of
this chapter shall govern.
   (E)   No building, structure or use which was not lawfully existing at the
time of the adoption of this chapter shall become or be made lawful solely by
reason of the adoption of this chapter; and to the extent that, and in any
manner that, the unlawful building, structure or use is in conflict with the
requirements of this chapter, the building, structure or use remains unlawful
hereunder.

   Every residential building hereafter erected on a lot or parcel of land
created subsequent to the effective date of this chapter shall provide a lot or
parcel of land in accordance with the lot size requirement of the district
within which it is located. In any residence district, on a lot of record on

regardless of the size of the lot, provided all other requirements of this
chapter are complied with; however, where two or more contiguous substandard
recorded lots are in common ownership and are of such size as to constitute at
least one conforming zoning lot, such lots or portions thereof shall be so
joined, developed and used for the purpose of forming an effective and
conforming zoning lot or lots. Such contiguous substandard lots in common
ownership shall be considered as being maintained in common ownership after the
effective date of this chapter for zoning purposes. In no case shall a lot
created illegally be considered a lot of record.

apply.
   (A)   Purpose. The flood plain regulations contained in this section are
established for the following purposes:
      (1)   To avoid or lessen the hazards to persons or damage to property
resulting from the accumulation or runoff of storm or floodwaters;
      (2)   To maintain the capacity of the flood plain to retain floodwaters;
      (3)   To provide for the development of flood plain lands with uses not
subject to severe damage by flooding and compatible with the other uses
permitted to various zones; and,
      (4)   To avoid the creation of new flood problems.
   (B)   Specific regulations.  
      (1)   No new or existing building or structures shall be erected or moved
within a flood plain, as indicated upon the official or certified flood plain
map, unless the lowest floor, including the basement floor, is at an elevation
which is not less than two feet above the flood base elevation for the site;
provided, however, that basement walls or the bottom of any opening therein is
not less than two feet above such elevation, and if plans and calculations for
such floor and walls prepared by a licensed engineer or architect clearly
indicate that the design is adequate to withstand expected forces and pressures
to which it may be subjected.
      (2)    The elevation of the ground for a minimum distance of 25 feet
immediately surrounding any building or structure erected or moved within a
flood plain shall be at an elevation of two feet above the flood base elevation
for the site and shall extend in width not less than 25 feet at, or above, the
elevation to a public street or accessway.
      (3)   The elevation of the finished surface at the crown of any new
street constructed within a flood plain shall be not less than two feet above
the flood base elevation for the area. The design of such streets or accessways
shall be such that the normal direction or course of drainage or runoff through
the area is not interrupted.
      (4)   If fill or any type of construction which would displace
floodwaters is placed within the flood plain, a flood reservoir shall be
constructed which shall hold floodwaters of equal volume to the volume of such
fill or construction placed below the flood base elevation. In the case of
streams and channels, such excavation shall be made opposite or just upstream
from the filled-in area. Each such flood reservoir shall have adequate
provision of drainage to the waterway. Upon compliance with the requirements of
this chapter, the President and Board of Trustees will, upon request of an
affected property owner, authorize the Village Clerk to issue a certificate of
compliance, all in accordance with the standard specifications of the village.

      (1)   Permitted uses of land or buildings, as hereinafter listed, shall
be permitted in the districts indicated under the conditions specified. Unless
otherwise specifically set forth, wherever a permitted use is named as a major
category in this subchapter, it shall be deemed to include all and only those
itemized uses under the major category listed in the R1 District. No building
or tract of land shall be devoted to any use other than a use permitted

yard.
      (3)   Only non-commercial vehicles shall be allowed to be parked in the
open on a lot or in the public right-of-way or street immediately abutting the
lot in any residential district.
      (4)   An exemption from this division (I) is granted for emergency
vehicles and for commercial vehicles standing or stopping temporarily, for up
to 90 minutes at a time, for commercial vehicles making deliveries, contractors
making repairs and the like.
   (J)   Functional families.
      (1)   Purpose. The village finds that regulations are needed to preserve
and enhance residential neighborhoods as stable, quiet places for citizens to
live and raise children, to protect public health, safety and welfare, and to
maintain property values. The village also finds that some residential living
arrangements differ from the traditional, biological family arrangement. This
division (J) is intended to reasonably regulate residential occupancy while
accommodating such alternative living arrangements. This division (J) is not
intended to conflict with, but rather supplement, the fair housing goals,
procedures and policies contained in
Chapter 94 of the Village of Bellwood Code of Ordinances.
      (2)   Conditional use permit. Five or fewer unrelated persons seeking to
occupy a dwelling unit as a single household must apply for and obtain a
conditional use permit as a functional family unless such persons satisfy
categories (2) and (3) of the definition of family contained in this chapter.
No conditional use permit will be issued for a functional family unless:
         (a)   The applicants demonstrate that the proposed functional family
has been licensed or certified by the State of Illinois as operators of a
community residence prior to, or within 60 days of receiving a functional
family conditional use permit;
         (b)   The functional family dwelling is located at least 1,800 feet
from any existing functional family dwelling, as measured from lot line to lot
line, unless the Plan Commission issues a separate conditional use permit
exempting a functional family dwelling from the 1,800-feet requirement;
         (c)   It is demonstrated that the zoning lot meets the off-street
parking requirements contained in division (J)(8) of this section; and
         (d)   First preference for occupancy in a functional family dwelling
is accorded to persons who currently reside in the village or are children or
parents of a person who resides in the village, through the submission of a
written policy statement, to the extent permissible under applicable state and
federal laws and regulations;
      (3)   Additional standards. For a functional family conditional use
permit to issue, the Plan Commission must find the following in addition to the
requirements set forth in §
156.160(G):
         (a)   The applicants share a strong bond or commitment to a single
purpose (e.g., religious orders);
         (b)   The applicants are not legally dependent on others not part of
the “functional family;”
         (c)   The applicants share a single household budget;
         (d)   The applicants prepare food and eat together regularly;
         (e)   The applicants share in the work to maintain the premises; and
         (f)   The applicants legally share in the ownership or possession of
the premises.
      (4)   Additional conditions. The Plan Commission may impose such
additional conditions it deems necessary to protect public health, safety and
welfare, to protect individual property rights, and to ensure that the intent
and objectives of this division (J) will be observed.
      (5)   Variations. Nothing in this division (J) prohibits the Village of
Bellwood Board of Trustees from granting a variation from the requirements of
this division (J) if the variation is reasonably necessary to provide a
handicapped person (as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 3602) equal opportunity to use
and enjoy a dwelling.
      (6)   Revocation. The village may revoke a functional family conditional
use permit if any license or certificate to operate a community residence is
revoked. The village may also revoke a functional family conditional use permit
on the same grounds as those permitted in this code and by state and federal
law.
      (7)   Lot size and yard requirements. Unless otherwise specified, the lot
size and yard requirements for each dwelling occupied by a functional family
will follow the requirements of the corresponding permitted use dwelling type
(i.e., single-family detached dwelling, two-family dwelling) for which the
functional family conditional use permit is sought.
      (8)   Off-street parking requirements. The off-street parking
requirements for each dwelling occupied by a functional family will follow the
requirements of the corresponding permitted use dwelling type (i.e., singly-
family detached dwelling, two-family dwelling) for which the functional family
conditional use permit is sought. In addition, a conditional use permit for a
functional family is subject to the following off-street parking standards and
regulations:
         (a)   Additional parking spaces may be required by the Zoning Board of
Appeals if any of the following conditions are met:
            1.   The property is located more than 300 feet from a bus stop.
            2.   Street parking available for visitor or staff parking is
limited.
            3.   The applicants intend to park more than two vehicles regularly
on the site and there is limited area available for tandem parking in the
driveway.
         (b)   In order for the Zoning Board of Appeals to determine if
adequate parking will be provided, the applicants must submit a plan indicating
the location of proposed off-street parking and an analysis of public parking
and transit facilities provided within a 300-foot radius of the parcel.
         (c)   The Zoning Board of Appeals may defer the provision of up to 40%
of the required spaces if shown on the approved plan for the permit. If the
Zoning Administrator determines that some or all of the deferred parking spaces
are needed, those spaces must be installed. Any person aggrieved by the Zoning
Administrator’s determination may appeal as provided in §
156.152(B)(1).

REDEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 156.075 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS; REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. The Redevelopment Overlay District is intended to recognize
that private investment undertaken to comply with the requirements of this Code
may, in certain areas and circumstances existing in the village, be
counterproductive to the village's long term land use goals and policies of
creating dynamic, pedestrian oriented mixed use areas that accommodate mixed
commercial and retail environments together with complementary medium and high
density residential development. Inappropriate investment in properties located
in areas characterized by underdevelopment, obsolete development or development
no longer in harmony with patterns emerging in the vicinity may simply delay
the time when economic conditions would warrant total redevelopment of the area
or may increase the ultimate cost of public programs designed to foster such
redevelopment. It is the purpose of this overlay district to provide the Board
of Trustees with discretion to temporarily modify, waive or vary standards of
this Code when doing so will prevent such counterproductive private investment
and will facilitate the type of mixed use development that the village believes
is critical to its long term social and economic well being.
   (B)   Overlay district designation; redevelopment as planned developments.
      (1)   Zoning Map. The Redevelopment Overlay District appears on the
Zoning Map as an "overlay district" imposed on top of other districts created
by this Code and referred to in this section as "base districts."
      (2)   Planned developments. Development of properties in the
Redevelopment Overlay District shall be approved pursuant to the procedures set
forth in §
156.160(M). In all events, development in the Redevelopment Overlay District
must comply with all regulations of the base district in which they are located
except to the extent that any such regulations are modified, waived or varied
by this section or a special permit granted in the overlay district. Where
there is any conflict between the Redevelopment Overlay District and the base
district, the provisions of the Redevelopment Overlay District shall control.
   (C)   Mapping restrictions; plan required.  
      (1)   The Redevelopment Overlay District shall be established in the
following areas of the village:
         (a)   Grant Street and Eastern Avenue Redevelopment District. The area
known as the Grant Street and Eastern Avenue Redevelopment District and legally
described as set forth in Ordinance 7-03, passed January 10, 2007.
         (b)   Cernan Avenue Redevelopment District. The area known as the
Cernan Avenue Redevelopment District and legally described as set forth in
Ordinance 7-03, passed January 10, 2007.
         (c)   I-290 and 25th Avenue Redevelopment District. The area known as
the I-290 and 25th Avenue Redevelopment District and legally described as set
forth in Ordinance 7-03, passed January 10, 2007.
         (d)   Lake Street and 25th Avenue Redevelopment District. The area

the Bellwood Avenue South Redevelopment District and legally described as set
forth in Ordinance 7-03, passed January 10, 2007.
      (2)   With the exception of the areas listed above, the Redevelopment
Overlay District shall not be mapped on the zoning district map except pursuant
to an application to amend the zoning district map filed pursuant to §
156.159; provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions of that
section, no such application to map a Redevelopment Overlay District shall be
filed unless accompanied by the information required pursuant to §
156.160(M) for the area proposed to be included in the Redevelopment Overlay
District.
   (D)   Redevelopment special permits.
      (1)   Nature of redevelopment projects. All redevelopment projects in the
Redevelopment Overlay District shall be a mix of commercial and retail uses
and, where appropriate, complementary medium to high density residential, or
mixed density residential development. Approval of a redevelopment project in
the Redevelopment Overlay District shall be subject to the issuance of a
redevelopment special permit processed and approved in accordance with §
156.160(M); provided, however, that no such permit shall be recommended or
granted except where the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Board of Trustees, in their sole and absolute discretion, that the
redevelopment project is consistent with the purposes for which Redevelopment
Overlay Districts may be established pursuant to this section.
      (2)   Lot area, yard, bulk requirements. The lot, yard, and bulk
requirements of the base district shall not apply, except as otherwise provided
below, to any redevelopment project. The following lot area, yard, and bulk
requirements shall apply to any redevelopment project:
         (a)   Minimum lot area: 25,000 square feet.
         (b)   Minimum perimeter yards:
            1.   The minimum required front, rear, and side yards of the base
district shall apply to the perimeter of a redevelopment project. There shall
be no corner side yard requirement for a redevelopment project.
            2.   For the purposes of determining the location of each yard, the
front yard shall be deemed to include the main ingress and egress into a
redevelopment project from an adjacent street.
            3.   In the event that a redevelopment project includes more than
one base district with differing yard requirements, the required perimeter
yards shall be determined by taking the average value of the minimum required
yards in each district (e.g. 40 foot required front yard + 30 foot required
front yard = 35 foot front yard for redevelopment project).
         (c)   Maximum height:
            1.   Residential: 65 feet;
            2.   Stand alone office commercial: 45 feet;
            3.   Stand alone retail: 35 feet;

developed with an impervious lot coverage that exceeds 80% of the lot area.
      (3)   Other development regulations.
         (a)   Base district regulations. Except as otherwise provided in
division (D)(3)(b) of this section, all applicable base district parking and
loading requirements, sign regulations, accessory use, and any buffer and
landscaping requirements shall apply to a redevelopment project.
         (b)   Redevelopment project in multiple base districts. Where a
redevelopment project is in two or more base districts, the base district with
the most restrictive regulations regarding parking and loading requirements,
sign regulations, accessory use, and any buffer and landscaping shall apply to
the redevelopment project.
         (c)   Modification, waiver, or variation of base district regulations.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this division (D)(3), the Plan
Commission may recommend and the Board of Trustees may authorize the
modification, waiver or variation of the parking and loading requirements; sign
regulations; accessory use; and any buffer and landscaping requirements
applicable in the base district. Such modifications, waivers or variations
shall be specified in the redevelopment special permit.
         (d)   Redevelopment agreement. In no event shall the Board of Trustees
adopt and approve a redevelopment special permit unless and until the applicant
and village have finally negotiated and agreed to all terms, conditions,
covenants, obligations, and requirements of a redevelopment agreement, the form
and substance of which shall be acceptable to the Village Attorney.

NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES
§ 156.085 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Establishment of districts. This chapter establishes separate
districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the location of the uses
which are permitted in that district. It is necessary and consistent with the
establishment of those districts that those nonconforming buildings, structures
and uses which substantially and adversely affect the orderly development and
taxable value of other property in the district not be permitted to continue
without restriction.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to provide for the
regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures and uses and to specify those
circumstances and conditions under which those nonconforming buildings,
structures and uses shall be permitted to continue.
(`95 Code, § 156.085) (Ord. 83-11, passed 9- -83)
§ 156.086 AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES.
   Any nonconforming building, structure or use which existed lawfully at the
time of the adoption of this chapter and which remains nonconforming, and any
such building, structure or use which shall become nonconforming upon the
adoption of this chapter, or of any subsequent amendment thereto, may be
continued subject to the regulations which follow.
(`95 Code, § 156.086) (Ord. 83-11, passed 9- -83)
§ 156.087 RESTRICTIONS ON NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES.
   Any lawfully existing building or structure which does not conform to the

the provisions of this subchapter.
   (A)   Repairs and alterations.  
      (1)   Repairs and alterations may be made to a nonconforming building or
structure, provided that no structural alterations which increase the bulk of
the building or structure shall be made in or to a pre-ordinance building or
structure, all or substantially all of which is designed or intended to
accommodate a use not currently allowed in the district in which it is located,
except those required by law or except to make the building or structure and
the use thereof, conform to the regulations of the district in which it is
located. For the purpose of this section, repairs shall include the replacement
of storage tanks where the safety of operation of the installation requires
such replacement, and other replacements of, or substitutions for, machinery or
equipment not involving structural alterations to the building or structure,
except as herein above provided.
      (2)   Repairs, alterations and structural changes may be made to a
nonconforming building or structure, all or substantially all of which is
designed or intended for a use permitted in the district in which it is
located, provided the repairs, alterations or structural changes conform to the
regulations of the district in which the building or structure is located.
   (B)   Additions and enlargements. A building or structure which is
nonconforming as to bulk, and is designed or intended for a permitted use,
shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner unless such additions or
enlargements thereto are made to conform to all of the regulations of the
district in which it is located.
   (C)   Relocation of building or structure. No building or structure shall be
moved in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any other lot
unless every portion of such building or structure which is moved, and the use
thereof, is made to conform to all of the regulations of the district in which
it is to be located.
   (D)   Restoration of damaged building or structure designed or intended for
a nonconforming use.
      (1)   A nonconforming building or structure which is destroyed or damaged
by fire or other casualty or act of God to the extent that the cost of
restoration to the condition in which it was before the occurrence shall exceed
50% of the cost of the restoration of the entire building new, shall not be
restored unless the building or structure, and the use thereof, shall conform
to all of the regulations of the district in which it is located.
      (2)   In the event such damage or destruction is less than 50% of the
cost of restoration of the entire building new, no repairs or reconstruction
shall be made unless such restoration is started within one year from the date
of partial destruction and is completed within one year thereafter.
      (3)   If the restoration is not started within one year of the calamity
and diligently prosecuted to completion, the building or structure shall be
removed and the area cleared by the owner, or at the owner's expense.
   (E)   Discontinuance of a nonconforming use.
      (1)   If the nonconforming use of a building, structure or premises is
discontinued for a continuous period of 365 days, it shall not be renewed, and
any subsequent use of the building, structure or premises shall conform to the
use regulations of the district in which the building, structure or premises is
located.
      (2)   The property owner of a nonconforming use that has become vacant
may make application to the Building Commissioner through the Zoning
Administrators Office for a temporary administrative approval allowing the
continuance of a nonconforming use of a building, structure or premises which
was originally and specifically designed for such a nonconforming use in the
zoning district in which it is located.
      (3)   The administrative approval when granted shall be in effect for a
period of two years from the date of approval and the property owner shall
cease said nonconforming use as of the last day of the temporary administrative
approval and any subsequent use of the building structure or premises shall
conform to the use regulations of the district in which the building structure
or premises is located.
      (4)   The property owner of a nonconforming use that has become vacant
may alternatively make application to the Village Board through the Zoning
Administrators Office requesting a permanent continuance of a nonconforming use
of a building, structure or premises which was originally and specifically
designed for such a nonconforming use in the zoning district where it is
located.
      (5)   Two-family dwellings which were originally and specifically
designed and build for the use as two-family dwellings and are a nonconforming
use in the R-1 Single-Family Residence and R-3 Limited General Residence Zoning
Districts shall be allowed to continue as two-family dwellings in these two
districts.
      (6)   Buildings and structures constructed as single-family dwellings and
modified to create a two-family dwelling in the R-1 and R-3 Zoning Districts
shall not be considered as part of the allowance to maintain a nonconforming
use as a two-family dwelling once the building or structure has become vacant
for more than the 365 days as noted above.
   (F)   Expansion of nonconforming use.
      (1)   The nonconforming use of part of a pre- ordinance building or
structure, all or substantially all of which is designed or intended to
accommodate a use not currently allowed in the district in which it is located,
may be extended throughout the building or structure in which the use is
presently located, but no changes or structural alterations which increase the
bulk of the building or structures shall be made unless such changes or
structural alterations, and the use thereof, conform to all the regulations of
the district in which the building or structure is located.
      (2)   The nonconforming use of part of a building or structure, all or
substantially all of which building or structure is designed or intended for a
use permitted in the district in which it is located, shall not be expanded or
extended into any other portion of such building or structure, nor changed to
any other nonconforming use.
      (3)   The nonconforming use of land, not involving a building or
structure, or in connection with which any building or structure thereon is
incidental or accessory to the principal use of the land, shall not be expanded
or extended beyond the area it occupies.
   (G)   Change of nonconforming use.
      (1)   The nonconforming use of a pre-ordinance building or structure, all
or substantially all of which is designed or intended to accommodate a use not
currently allowed in the district in which it is located, may be changed to a
use allowed in the most restrictive district in which the nonconforming use
which presently occupies the building or structure is a permitted or
conditional use, or to a use permitted in a more restrictive district. For the
purpose of this subsection, the R1 District shall be considered the most
restrictive and the I2 District the least restrictive district.
      (2)   No nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming use
when such nonconforming use is located in a building or structure, all or
substantially all of which building or structure is designed or intended for a
permitted use.
      (3)   The nonconforming use of land, not involving a building or
structure, or in connection with which any building or structure thereon is
incidental or accessory to the principal use of the land, shall not be changed
to any other use, except to a use permitted in the district in which the land
is located.

(`95 Code, § 156.088) (Ord. 83-11, passed 9- -83)
§ 156.089 ELIMINATION OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   This section is intended to gradually eliminate inappropriate
nonconforming uses of buildings or structures designed or intended for uses
allowed within the district in which they are located, but is not intended to

the design or intent of such building or structure.
      (1)   In all residence districts any use of a building or structure, all
or substantially all of which is designed or intended for a use permitted only
in a residential district, but is being used for a use permitted only in a
business or an industrial district, shall be terminated within six years of the
effective date of this chapter.

nonconforming use of building or structure shall be discontinued on the same
date the nonconforming use of the building or structure is discontinued.
   (B)   The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to any
nonconforming use associated with any building or structure, a substantial
portion of which is designed or intended for such a nonconforming use
regardless of the district in which such building or structure is located.

OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS
§ 156.110 SCOPE AND APPLICATION.
   (A)   Scope of regulations. The off-street parking and loading provisions of
this chapter shall apply as follows:
      (1)   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of this chapter, accessory parking and
loading facilities shall be provided as required in this chapter. However,
where a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this
chapter and provided that construction is begun within 6 months of such
effective date and diligently prosecuted to completion (completion to be
accomplished within 18 months of the effective date of this chapter), parking
and loading facilities in the amounts required for the issuance of the building
permit may be provided in lieu of any different amounts required by this
chapter.
      (2)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use and for at least
50% of any existing deficiency in parking or loading facilities.
      (3)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall
hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be
provided as required for such new use. However, if the building or structure
was erected prior to the effective date of this chapter, additional parking or
loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements
for the new use would exceed those for the existing use, if the latter were
subject to the parking and loading provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Existing parking and loading facilities. Accessory off-street parking
and loading facilities in existence on the effective date of this chapter and
located on the same lot as the building or use served shall not hereafter be
reduced below, or if already less than, shall not be further reduced below, the
requirements for a similar new building or use under the provisions of this
chapter.
   (C)   Permissive parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this chapter
shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or
loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, provided
that all regulations herein governing the location, design, and operation of
such facilities are adhered to.
   (D)   Damage or destruction. For any conforming or legally nonconforming
building or use which is in existence on the effective date of this chapter,
which subsequently thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion
or other cause, and which is reconstructed, re-established or repaired, off-
street parking or loading facilities need not be provided except that parking
or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage
or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in no case
shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in
excess of those required by this chapter for equivalent new uses or
construction.
   (E)   Submission of plot plan. Any application for a building permit, or for
an occupancy certificate where no building permit is required, shall include
therewith a plot plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any off-
street parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance with this
chapter.
(`95 Code, § 156.110) (Ord. 83-11, passed 9- -83)
§ 156.111 OFF-STREET PARKING.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Exemption. When the application of the off-street parking
provisions specified in division (B) of this section results in a requirement
of not more than three spaces on a single zoning lot in any business or
industrial district, such parking spaces need not be provided; however, where
two or more uses are located on a single zoning lot, only one of those uses
shall be eligible for the above exemption.
      (2)   Location.
         (a)   All parking spaces required to serve buildings or uses erected
or established after the effective date of this chapter shall be located on the
same zoning lot as the building or use served, except that parking spaces to
serve business or industrial buildings or uses may be located within 200 feet
of such use if the spaces are located in a business or industrial district.
         (b)   Buildings or uses existing on the effective date of this chapter
which are subsequently altered or enlarged so as to require the provision of
parking spaces under this chapter may be served by parking facilities located
on land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use served is
located, provided such facilities are within 200 feet walking distance of a
main entrance to the use served. Owners of property, nonconforming as to
parking, who elect to provide parking and become conforming may locate such
parking on land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use is
located, as allowed in this section.
         (c)   1.   Off-street parking spaces, open to the sky, may be located
in any yard except the required front yard or corner side yard in a general
residence or industrial district. In a single-family residence district not
more than two passenger vehicles may be parked in the required front yard or
corner side yard. Enclosed buildings and carports containing off-street parking
shall be subject to applicable yard requirements. However, any parking spaces
provided within the required front or corner side yard in a business district
shall be set back at least eight feet from the property line.
            2.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, off-street surface parking
spaces may be located in the required front yard of a lot located in a general
industrial district if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the
lot is no less than 12 acres; (ii) the lot shares a border with a railroad
right-of- way; and (iii) the lot is wholly bound by railroad or general
industrial district within the corporate limits of the village.
      (3)   Control of off-site parking facilities. In cases where parking
facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the
building or use served is located, such facilities shall be in the same
possession as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the
parking facilities are accessory. Such possession may be either by deed or
long-term lease, the term of such lease to be determined by the Zoning Board of
Appeals; and such deed or lease shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator.
The deed or lease shall require such owner or his or her heirs and assigns to
maintain the required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use
served or the deed or lease, whichever shall terminate sooner.
      (4)   Size. Except for parallel parking spaces, each required off-street
parking space shall be at least nine feet in width and at least 9 feet in
length, exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps, columns or office or work
areas. Such space shall have a vertical clearance of at least 7 feet, and shall
be measured at right angles to the axis of the vehicle. For parallel parking,
the length of the parking space shall be increased to 24 feet. All other
requirements as to size shall be as set forth in division (D), Off-Street
Parking Chart.
      (5)   Access. Except on residential lots, each off-street parking space
shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway at least, 12 feet wide or such
additional width and design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular
access to such parking space. All off-street parking facilities shall be
designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a
manner which will least interfere with traffic movement. In any event, all
driveways shall conform to all applicable driveway specifications adopted by
the village.
      (6)   Collective provision. Off-street parking facilities for separate
uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is
not less than the sum of the separate requirements of each such use and all
regulations governing location of accessory parking spaces in relation to the
use served are adhered to. Further, no parking space or portion thereof shall
serve as required space for more than one use unless otherwise authorized by
the Zoning Board of Appeals.
      (7)   Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking
spaces required by this chapter results in a requirement of a fractional space,
any fraction of less than one-half may be disregarded, while a fraction of one-
half or more, shall be counted as one parking space. Parking spaces required on
an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or
residing, or both, on the premises at any one time.
      (8)   Utilization. Except as may otherwise be provided for the parking of
trucks in the granting of conditional uses, required accessory off-street
parking facilities provided for uses listed in division (B) of this section
shall be solely for the parking of passenger automobiles of patrons, occupants
or employees of such uses.
      (9)   Design and maintenance.
         (a)   Plan. The design of parking lots or areas shall be subject to
the approval of the Zoning Administrator, in accordance with standards approved
by the Plan Commission and President and Board of Trustees.
         (b)   Character. Accessory parking spaces may be open to the sky, or
enclosed in a building.
         (c)   Surfacing. All open off-street parking areas shall be surfaced
with a dustless all- weather material. Proper drainage shall be provided.
         (d)   Screening and landscaping. All open vehicle parking areas
containing more than four parking spaces shall be effectively screened on each
side adjoining or fronting on property situated in a residence district or any
institutional premises by a wall, fence or densely planted compact hedge not
less than 4 feet nor more than 8 feet in height. However, the Board of Appeals
may waive this requirement if the closest point of such parking area is at
least 50 feet from the nearest residential or institutional property line.
         (e)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking
areas shall be directed away from residential properties and public streets in
such a way as not to create a nuisance. However, in no case shall such lighting
exceed three foot-candles measured at the lot line.
         (f)   Cleaning and maintenance. Except in the cleaning or maintenance
of parking lots utilizing motorized equipment may be performed between 11:30
p.m. and 6:00 a.m. each day, except for the removal of snow.
         (g)   Wheel stops. All parking lots shall be provided with wheel stops
or bumper guards so located on the periphery of parking lots that no part of
parked vehicles shall extend beyond the property line. Such stops or guards
shall be properly anchored or secured.
         (h)   Signs. Accessory signs shall be permitted on parking areas in
accordance with the provisions specified in the appropriate sign regulations in
§§
156.200 through
156.219.
         (i)   Repair and service.
            1.   Residence districts. No motor vehicle repair work or service
of any kind shall be permitted in association with parking facilities provided
in residence districts, with the exception of emergency service required to
start vehicles.
            2.   Business districts. No motor vehicle repair work or service of
any kind shall be permitted in conjunction with parking facilities, with the
exception of emergency service required to start vehicles.
            3.   Industrial districts. No motor vehicle repair work or service
of any kind shall be permitted in conjunction with any open accessory parking
facilities provided in an industrial district if such parking facilities are
within 200 feet of a residence district. Washing of accessory vehicles and
emergency service required to start vehicles shall be permitted.
   (B)   Specific requirements. All off-street parking spaces hereinafter
required by this chapter, except those required for one- and two-family
dwellings, shall be designed in accordance with one of the formulae set forth
in division (D), Off-Street Parking Chart. Off-street parking spaces shall be
provided in accordance with the specific parking classes as set forth in
division (C) of this section. Parking spaces for accessory uses not
specifically enumerated within a parking class shall be assumed to be included
in the principal (permitted or conditional) use requirement. If, for any
reason, the classification of any use, for the purpose of determining the
amount of off-street parking, or the number of spaces to be provided by such
use is not readily determinable hereunder, the parking class of such use shall
be fixed by the Zoning Administrator.

      (3)   Act upon the annual report from the Plan Commission and Zoning
Board of Appeals concerning the status of the zoning ordinance.

§ 156.155 ZONING CERTIFICATE.
   (A)   Except as hereinafter provided, no permit pertaining to the use of
land or buildings shall be issued by an officer, department, or employee unless
the application for such permit has been examined by the Zoning Administrator
or his duly appointed representative, and has affixed to it his certificate,
indicating that the proposed building or structure complies with all the

thereof, according to the registered or recorded plat of such land; and
      (2)   Additional drawings drawn to a scale in such form as may, from time
to time, be prescribed by the Zoning Administrator showing the ground area,

§ 156.156 OCCUPANCY CERTIFICATES.
   (A)   Certificate required. No buildings, or additions thereto, constructed
after the effective date of this chapter, and no addition to a previously
existing building shall be occupied, and no land, vacant on the effective date

all applicable standards. Pending the issuance of a regular certificate, a
temporary certificate may be issued to be valid for a period not to exceed six
months from its date during the completion of any addition or during partial
occupancy of the premises. The term of this temporary certificate may be
extended by mutual consent of the applicant and village. The occupancy
certificate shall be issued or written notice shall be given to the applicant
stating the reasons why a certificate cannot be issued, not later than 14 days
after the Zoning Administrator is notified in writing that the building or
premises is ready for occupancy.

§ 156.157 VARIATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose.

thereon shall be forwarded to the Board of Trustees for final disposition.
   (B)   Application and notice of hearing.  
      (1)   An application for a variation may be made by any person, firm or
corporation, or by any office, department, board, bureau or commission
requesting or intending to request application for a zoning certificate.

located within 250 feet of any lot line of the property included in the
requested variation.
   (C)   Standards for variations.  
      (1)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not vary the regulations of this
chapter unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it
in each specific case that:
         (a)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience
if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out;
         (b)   The conditions upon which an application for a variation is
based are unique to the property for which the variance is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
         (c)   The purpose of the variation is not based primarily upon a
desire to increase financial gain;
         (d)   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this chapter and
has not been created by any persons presently having an interest in the
property;
         (e)   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located;
         (f)   The granting of the variation will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood; and
         (g)   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property or substantially increase the congestion of
the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or impair natural drainage
or create drainage problems on adjacent properties, or endanger the public
safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the
neighborhood.
      (2)   The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose such conditions and
restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a variation as may be necessary to
comply with the standards established in this section and the objectives of
this chapter.
   (D)   Authorized variations.  
      (1)   Variations from the regulations of this chapter shall be granted by
the Zoning Board of Appeals only in accordance with the standards established
in division (C) of this section, and may be granted only in the following
instances and in no others. However, the degree or amount of exception or
variation cited below is the maximum allowance, not the recommended:
         (a)   To permit any yard or setback less than a yard or a setback
required by the applicable regulations;
         (b)   To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise
prohibited solely because of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots,
but in no event shall the respective area and width of the lot or lots be less
than 75% of the required area or width;
         (c)   To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two or more uses, provided that substantial use of such
facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours of
the same days of the week;
         (d)   To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading
facilities required by not more than one parking space or loading space, or 25%
of the required facilities, whichever is greater;
         (e)   To increase by not more than 40% the maximum distance that
required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use served; and
         (f)   To allow for the deferment of required parking facilities for a
reasonable period of time, such period of time to be specified in the variance.
      (2)   Requests for any variation other than those listed above shall be
decided by the President and Board of Trustees after a hearing thereon by the
Zoning Board of Appeals and subsequent recommendation to the President and
Board of Trustees.
   (E)   Action by the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals
shall approve or deny any requested variation or transmit written

the request from the Zoning Administrator unless such time period is extended
by mutual consent of the Board of Appeals and the applicant.
   (F)   Revocation. Where a variation has been granted pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter, such approval shall become null and void unless
work thereon is substantially under way within six months of the date of
issuance, unless extended by the Zoning Board of Appeals or President and Board
of Trustees, after public hearing.

(`95 Code, § 156.158) (Ord. 83-11, passed 9- -83)
§ 156.159 AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   Authority; declaration of public policy. For the purpose of promoting
the public health, safety, and general welfare, conserving the value of
property throughout the community, and lessening or avoiding congestion in the
public streets and highways, the President and Board of Trustees may, from time
to time, in the manner hereinafter set forth, amend the regulations imposed in
the districts created by this chapter or amend district boundary lines,
provided that in all amendatory ordinances adopted under the authority of this
section, due allowances shall be made for existing conditions, the conservation
of property values, the direction of building development to the best advantage
of the entire community, and the uses to which property is devoted at the time
of the adoption of such amendatory ordinance.
   (B)   Initiation of amendment.
      (1)   Text amendments may be proposed by the President and Board of
Trustees, Plan Commission, Zoning Board of Appeals, other village officials or
any interested person or organization.
      (2)   Map amendments may be proposed by the owner of the property
involved or the President and Board of Trustees, the Plan Commission, Zoning
Board of Appeals or other village officials.
   (C)   Application for amendment; procedure. An application for an amendment
to this chapter shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator in such form and
accompanied by such information as required by the Zoning Administrator. The
Zoning Administrator, upon receiving an application for amendment, shall
transmit the application, within ten days, along with all pertinent data filed
therewith, to the Plan Commission for review and recommendation to the
President and Board of Trustees.
   (D)   Hearing on application. The Plan Commission shall hold public hearings
upon each request for an amendment.
   (E)   Notice of hearing. Notice of time and place of such hearing shall be
published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation within the
village not more than 30 days nor less than 15 days before such hearing. In
addition, notices shall be sent by registered or certified mail to all owners
(as determined from current real estate tax records) of property located within
250 feet of any lot line of the property included in the proposed amendment.
   (F)   Findings of fact and recommendation of the Plan Commission.
      (1)   The Plan Commission shall submit written recommendations to the
President and Board of Trustees within 60 days of receipt of the application.
Extension of this time period may be allowed by mutual consent of applicant and
Plan Commission. Where the purpose and effect of the proposed amendment is to
change the zoning classification of particular property, the Plan Commission
shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific
case with respect to, but not limited to, the following matters:
         (a)   Existing uses of property within the general area of the
property in question;
         (b)   The zoning classification of property within the general area of
the property in question;
         (c)   The suitability of the property in question to the uses
permitted under the existing zoning classification;
         (d)   The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the
property in question, including changes, if any, which have taken place in its
present zoning classification; and
         (e)   The objectives of all current and certified land use plans for
the village.
      (2)   The Plan Commission shall not recommend the adoption of a proposed
amendment unless it finds that the adoption of such amendment is not
detrimental to the public interest. The Plan Commission may recommend the
adoption of an amendment changing the zoning classification of the property in
question to any higher classification than that requested by the applicant. For
the purpose of this subdivision, the R1 District shall be considered the
highest classification and the I2 District shall be considered the lowest
classification.
   (G)   Action by the President and Board of Trustees.
      (1)   The President and Board of Trustees shall not act upon a proposed
amendment to this chapter until it shall have received a written report and
recommendation from the Plan Commission on the proposed amendment.
      (2)   The President and Board of Trustees may grant or deny any
application for an amendment, or refer it back to the Plan Commission for
further consideration. However, in case of a written protest against any
proposed amendment of the regulations or districts, signed and acknowledged by
the owners of 20% or more, either of the areas of the land included in such
proposed change, or by the owners of 20% or more of the area of the land
immediately adjacent extending 100 feet therefrom, or by the owners of 20% or
more of the land directly opposite thereto extending 100 feet from the street
frontage of such opposite land such amendment shall not be passed except by
two-thirds vote of the President and Board of Trustees.
      (3)   In any event, the President and Board of Trustees shall grant or
deny the application for amendment within 45 days of receipt of the written
report and recommendation from the Plan Commission. Extension of this time
period may be extended by mutual consent of applicant and Board of Trustees.
   (H)   Effect of denial of amendment. No application for a map amendment
which has been denied by the President and Board of Trustees shall be
resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of the order of denial,
except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of change of condition found to
be valid by the Zoning Administrator; and no application for a text amendment
which has been denied shall be resubmitted within 90 days.
   (I)   Repeal of amendment. In any case where a change of boundary lines of
the zoning district map has been granted, and where no development has taken
place within one year, the Plan Commission may hold a public hearing, after
notice of public hearing has been given as specified in division (E) of this
section, and recommend to the President and Board of Trustees that such zoning
be affirmed or repealed and rezoned to its most appropriate district
classification.
(`95 Code, § 156.159) (Ord. 83-11, passed 9- -83)
§ 156.160 CONDITIONAL USE.
   (A)   Purpose. The development and execution of this chapter is based upon
the division of the village into districts within which districts the use of
land and buildings, and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in
relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that
there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot
be properly classified in any particular district or districts, without
consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land
and of the public need for the particular use in the particular location. Such
conditional uses fall into two categories:
      (1)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest.
      (2)   Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual
magnitude or nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with
respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
   (B)   Initiation of conditional use. Any person, firm, corporation, office,
department, or other legal entity having a freehold interest in land, or a
possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest
which may become a freehold interest or an exclusive possessory interest, and
which is specifically enforceable, may file an application to use such land for
one or more of the conditional uses provided for in this chapter in the zoning
district in which the land is located.
   (C)   Application for conditional use. An application for a conditional use
shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator on a form prescribed by the Zoning
Administrator. The application shall be accompanied by such plans and/or data
prescribed by the Plan Commission, and shall include a statement in writing by
the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed conditional use
will conform to the standards set forth in division (G) of this section. Such
application shall be forwarded, within ten days, from the Zoning Administrator
to the Plan Commission for review and recommendation to the President and Board
of Trustees.
   (D)   Hearing on application for conditional use. The Plan Commission shall
hold a public hearing on each application, at such time and place as shall be
established by the Plan Commission. The hearing shall be conducted and a record
of the proceedings shall be preserved in such manner as the Plan Commission
shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time.
   (E)   Notice of hearing. Notice of time and place of such hearing shall be
published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation within the
village not more than 30 days nor less than 15 days before such hearing. In
addition, notices shall be sent by registered or certified mail to all owners
(as determined from current real estate tax records) of property located within
250 feet of any lot line of the property included in the proposed conditional
use.
   (F)   Authorization. For each application for a conditional use, the Plan
Commission shall, within 60 days of receipt of the application, report its
written findings and recommendations to the President and Board of Trustees,
including the stipulations of additional conditions and guarantees that such
condition will be complied with when they are deemed necessary for the
protection of the public interest.
   (G)   Standards. No conditional use shall be recommended by the Plan
Commission, unless such Commission shall find:
      (1)   That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional
use will not be detrimental to, or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare;
      (2)   That the conditional use will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already
permitted, nor diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood;
      (3)   That the establishment of the conditional use will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for
uses permitted in the district;
      (4)   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
      (5)   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide
ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public
streets;
      (6)   That the proposed conditional use is not contrary to the objectives
of current and certified land use plans for the village; and
      (7)   That the conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to
the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as
such regulations may, in each instance, be modified pursuant to the
recommendations of the Plan Commission.
   (H)   Conditions and guarantees. Prior to the granting of any conditional
use, the Plan Commission may recommend and the President and Board of Trustees
may stipulate such conditions and restrictions, upon the establishment,
location, construction, maintenance and operation of the conditional use as is
deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure
compliance with the standards and requirements specified in division (G) of
this section. In all cases in which conditional uses are granted, the President
and Board of Trustees shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem
necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are
being and will be complied with.
   (I)   Action by the President and Board of Trustees.
      (1)   The President and Board of Trustees shall not act upon a proposed
conditional use permitted under this chapter until it shall have received a
written report and recommendation from the Plan Commission on the proposed
conditional use.
      (2)   The President and Board of Trustees may grant or deny, by
ordinance, or refer back to the Plan Commission for further study, any
application for conditional use, and may establish such conditions and
restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance and
operation of the conditional use, as is deemed necessary for the protection of
the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and
requirements specified in division (G) of this section.
      (3)   In any event, the President and Board of Trustees shall grant or
deny the application for conditional use within 45 days of receipt of the
written report and recommendation from the Plan Commission. Extension of this
time period may be extended by mutual consent of applicant and Board of
Trustees.
   (J)   Effect of denial of a conditional use. No application for a
conditional use, which has been denied wholly or in part by the President and
Board of Trustees, shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date
of the order of denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of
change of conditions found to be valid by the President and Board of Trustees.
   (K)   Revocation. In any case where a conditional use has not been
established (substantially under way) within one year from the date of granting
thereof, then, without further action by the President and Board of Trustees,
the conditional use or authorization thereof shall be null and void.
   (L)   Expiration and transferability.  
      (1)   A conditional use approval shall be deemed to authorize only one
particular conditional use and shall expire if the conditional use shall cease
for more than 12 months for any reason. However, the ownership of an authorized
conditional use may be changed if the use remains unchanged.
      (2)   If, prior to the issuance of a building permit, the person, firm,
corporation or organization to whom a conditional use permit has been granted
transfers his interest in the land upon which the permit has granted to another
person, firm, corporation or organization, such conditional use permit shall be
null and void.
   (M)    Planned developments. Planned developments are of such substantially
different character from other conditional uses that specific and additional
standards and exceptions are hereby established to govern the actions of the
Plan Commission and President and Board of Trustees.
      (1)   Purposes.
         (a)   A planned development conditional use is a privilege to be
earned and not a right which can be claimed simply upon complying with all the
standards established in this section. The Plan Commission and the President
and Board of Trustees may require any reasonable condition or design
consideration which will promote proper development of benefit to the
community. It is not intended that the President and Board of Trustees
automatically grant the maximum use exceptions or density increase in the case
of each planned development. The Plan Commission shall recommend and the
President and Board of Trustees shall grant only such increase or latitude
which is consistent with the benefit accruing to the village as a result of the
planned development. As a condition for approval, each planned development must
be compatible with the character and objectives of the zoning district or
districts within which it is located, and each planned development shall be
consistent with the objectives of the village land use plans.
         (b)   If a proposed planned development also constitutes a
subdivision, the required hearings and processes for subdivision and zoning
approval may be accommodated simultaneously.
         (c)   Some specific purposes of the planned development procedure are:
            1.   Residential planned development. To offer recreational
opportunities close to home, to enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by the
conservation of streams and local spots of natural beauty, to add to the sense
of spaciousness through the preservation of natural green spaces, to counteract
the effects of urban monotony and congestion in the streets, to encourage
cooperative relationships between neighbors and participation by all age groups
in the use and care of local open space tracts in new residential subdivisions,
to promote harmonious architecture between adjacent dwellings or institutional
buildings, and to encourage the placement of structures in proper relationship
to the natural characteristics of the site.
            2.   Business or commercial planned development. To promote the
cooperative development of business or commercial centers each with adequate
off-street parking, to control access points on thoroughfares, to separate
pedestrian and automobile traffic, to aid in stabilizing property values, to
develop centers of size and location compatible with the market potential, to
buffer adjacent residential areas with landscaped green spaces and to encourage
harmonious architecture between adjacent commercial structures and between
dwellings and commercial structures.
            3.   Industrial planned development. To promote the establishment
of industrial parks, to permit groups of industrial building with integrated
design and a coordinated physical plan, to encourage recreational facilities
within industrial area and to buffer adjacent residential areas with landscaped
green spaces.
      (2)   Procedure for approval.
         (a)   Pre-application conference.
            1.    Prior to filing a formal application for approval of a
planned development, the developer shall request a pre-application convenience;
such request shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator.
            2.    The purpose of such convenience is to allow the developer to
present a general concept of his proposed development prior to the preparation
or detailed plans. For this purpose the presentation shall include, but not be
limited to, the following:
               a.   Written "letter of intent" from the developer establishing
his intentions as to development of the land.
               b.   Topographic survey and location map.
               c.   Sketch plans and ideas regarding land use, dwelling type
and density, street and lot arrangement, and tentative lot sizes.
               d.   Tentative proposals regarding water supply, sewage
disposal, surface drainage and street improvements.
            3.   The Zoning Administrator shall advise the developer of the
zoning requirements, subdivision regulations, and village plans which might
affect the proposed development as well as the procedural steps for approval.
            4.   The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a record of all
documents submitted at the pre-application conference and a record of those
attending the conferences. No fee shall be charged for the pre-application
conference.
         (b)   Preliminary plan. The preliminary plan of the planned
development shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator, who shall in turn
forward copies to the Secretary of the Plan Commission for their consideration
and public hearing. The Plan Commission may request review of the planned
development by, and recommendations from, appropriate village departments and
offices. The required procedure for consideration and approval of the
preliminary plan shall be:
            1.   Submission of the following:
               a.   Written application for approval of a planned development
shall be made on forms and in the manner prescribed by the Plan Commission.
               b.   The application shall be accompanied by a fee consistent
with the approved fee schedule.
               c.   The preliminary plan and supporting data shall be in
accordance with the provisions of subdivision (5) of this division.
            2.   The Plan Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
application for a planned development in accordance with divisions (D) and (E)
of this section.
            3.   Following the public hearing and review of the preliminary
planned development and supporting data, the Plan Commission shall send its
findings and recommendations to the President and Board of Trustees which
shall, within 45 days, approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the
plan or return it to the Plan Commission for further consideration.
            4.   Approval of a preliminary planned development plan shall not
constitute approval of the final plan, rather it shall be deemed an expression
of approval of the layout submitted on the preliminary plan as a guide to the
preparation of the final plan or plans.
            5.   Upon approval of the preliminary plan by the President and
Board of Trustees a record shall be prepared, including findings of fact,
recommendations of the village departments and offices, exceptions or bonuses
granted, conditions applied, and modifications ordered.
         (c)   Final plan. The final plan shall be submitted by the developer
not later than 120 days (or such additional time as may be authorized by the
Plan Commission and President and Board of Trustees from time to time) after
approval of the preliminary plan. The preliminary and final plan may be filed
and approved simultaneously, if all requirements hereof are met. The final
planned development plan shall conform substantially to the preliminary plan as
approved and if desired by the developer, it may be submitted in stages with
each stage reflecting a portion of the approved preliminary plan which is
proposed to be recorded and developed; provided, however, that such portion
conforms to all requirements of these regulations. The required procedure for
approval of a final plan shall be:
            1.   The final plan and supporting data shall be filed with the
Zoning Administrator and forwarded by him to the Secretary of the Plan
Commission for certification that the final plan is in conformity with these
regulations and in agreement with the approved preliminary plan.
            2.   All final plans shall be accompanied by a written construction
schedule for the development.
         (d)   Recording the approved plan. A copy of the approved final plan
shall be recorded with the County Recorder of Deeds by the Zoning
Administrator. Proof of such recording shall be required prior to the issuance
of building permits.
      (3)   Changes in the planned development. A planned development shall be
developed only according to the approved and recorded final plan and all

      (6)   Use exceptions. The Plan Commission may recommend and the President
and Board of Trustees may authorize that there be permitted in part of the area
of a proposed planned development, and for the duration of such development,
specified uses not permitted by the use regulations of the district in which
the development is located, provided that the Commission shall find:
         (a)   That the uses permitted by such exceptions are necessary or
desirable and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the
planned development;
         (b)   That the uses permitted by such exception are not of such a
nature or so located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the surrounding
neighborhood; and
         (c)   That not more than 40% of the ground area or of the gross floor
area of such development shall be devoted to the uses permitted by the
exception. However, that in a residential planned development not more than 10%
of the total ground area in the planned development shall be devoted to uses
first permitted within the commercial districts; and no area within a
residential planned development shall be devoted to uses first permitted within
the industrial zoning districts.
      (7)   Bulk regulations. In the case of any planned development, the Plan
Commission may recommend and the President and Board of Trustees may authorize
exceptions to the applicable bulk regulations of this chapter within the
boundaries of such planned development, provided that the Plan Commission shall
find:
         (a)   That such exceptions shall be solely for the purpose of
promoting an integrated site plan no less beneficial to the residents or
occupants of such development as well as the neighboring property, than would
be obtained under the bulk regulations of this chapter for buildings developed
on separate zoning lots;
         (b)   That along the periphery of such planned developments, yards
shall be provided as required by the regulations of the district in which the
development is located; and
         (c)   That in a residential planned development the maximum number of
dwelling units permitted shall be determined by dividing the net development
area by the minimum lot area per dwelling unit required by the district or
districts in which the area is located, and then increasing this number by 40%.
Net development area shall be determined by subtracting the area set aside for
nonresidential uses from the gross development area, and deducting from the
remainder the area required for streets as set forth in the site plan. In no
event shall the area for streets be computed at less than 10% of the gross
development area. The area of land set aside for common open space or
recreational uses may be included in determining the number of dwelling units
permitted.
      (8)   Designation of permanent common open space.
         (a)   Permanent common open space shall be defined as parks,
playgrounds, parkway medians, landscaped green space, schools, community
centers or other similar areas in public ownership or other similar areas in
public ownership or areas covered by an open space easement.
         (b)   No plan for a planned development shall be approved, unless such
plan provides for permanent open space equivalent to at least 20% of the total
development area in residential planned developments.
      (9)   Minimum lot area in residential planned developments. Provided the
overall number of dwelling units per acre (density) is not increased beyond the
provisions of (M)(7)(d) of this section and provided that the permanent common
open space is in accord with division (M)(8) of this section, the planned
development may include minimum lot areas per dwelling unit smaller than those
normally required in the zoning district.

§ 156.206 STANDARDS FOR DYNAMIC DISPLAYS AND DYNAMIC OFF-SITE ADVERTISING
SIGNS.
   (A)   Findings.
      (1)   Studies show that there is a correlation between dynamic displays
and dynamic off-site advertising signs and the distraction of drivers that can
lead to traffic accidents. These distraction are created by among other things:
         (a)   Changing messages;
         (b)   Knowing that a sign has a changing message;
         (c)   Messages that do not convey a full message in one screen;
         (d)   Special effects used to change the message, such as fade-ins and
fade-outs; and
         (e)   Messages that are too small to be clearly seen or that contain
more than a simple message.
      (2)   These distractions are compounded and create a hazardous driving
environment in a corridor with multiple signs.
   (B)   Policy; intent. The regulations for dynamic displays and dynamic off-
site advertising signs are intended to minimize:
      (1)   Potential driver distraction;
      (2)   Proliferation of dynamic displays and dynamic off-site advertising
signs;
      (3)   Impact that dynamic displays can have on the use and enjoyment of
adjacent property; and
      (4)   To condition the use of dynamic displays in a manner that protects
public safety and welfare.
   (C)   Conditional use. All dynamic displays and dynamic off-site advertising
signs are conditional uses in all zoning districts designated in this chapter.
In addition to the regulations below, dynamic displays and dynamic off-site
advertising signs require the issuance of conditional use permits in accordance
with the provisions of §
156.160.
   (D)   General dynamic display regulations. Dynamic displays are allowed
subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   Dynamic displays are allowed only on ground, projecting, pole and
wall signs. Dynamic displays may occupy no more than 75% of the sign face area.
The remainder of the sign face must not have the capability to have any dynamic
display characteristics and must remain static. Only one dynamic display area
is allowed on a sign face;
      (2)   A dynamic display may not change or move more often than once every
minute;
      (3)   The images and messages displayed must be static and the transition
from one static display to another must be instantaneous without any special
effects;
      (4)   The images and messages displayed must be complete in themselves,
without continuation in content to the next image or message or to any other
sign;
      (5)   Every line of copy and graphics in a dynamic display must be at
least seven inches in height on a road with a speed limit of 25 to 34 miles per

inches on a road with a speed limit of 45 to 54 miles per hour, and 15 inches
on a road with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour or more;
      (6)   Dynamic displays must be designed and equipped to freeze the device
in one position if a malfunction occurs. The displays must also be equipped
with a means to immediately discontinue the display if it malfunctions, and the
sign owner must immediately stop the dynamic display when notified by the
village that it is not complying with the standards of this subchapter;
      (7)   A dynamic display may not be within 35 feet of another dynamic
display facing the same traveled right of way. In no case shall a dynamic
display be in a line of sight with another dynamic display.
      (8)   (a)   The village, through appropriate personnel, may exercise its
police powers to protect public health, safety, and welfare by requiring
emergency information to be displayed via any dynamic display. Upon
notification, the sign operators shall display in directed sign rotations:
            1.   Amber Alert emergency information; or
            2.   Emergency information regarding terrorist attacks, of natural
disasters.
         (b)   Emergency information messages are to remain in rotation
according to the designated issuing agencies protocols.

from the surface of the pavement of the lane closest to the structure. The
dynamic off-site adverting sign may occupy no more than 90% of the sign face
area. The remainder of the sign face must not have the capability to have any
dynamic display characteristics and must remain static. Only one dynamic off-
site advertising sign is allowed on a sign face;
      (2)   Dynamic off-site advertising signs display may not change or move
more often than once every 30 seconds;

notified by the village that it is not complying with the standards of this
subchapter;
      (7)   A dynamic off-site advertising sign may not be within 1,000 feet of
another dynamic display facing the same traveled right of way. In no case shall
a dynamic display be in a line of sight with another dynamic display.
      (8)   (a)   The village, through appropriate personnel, may exercise its
police powers to protect public health, safety, and welfare by requiring

            1.   Amber Alert emergency information; or
            2.   Emergency information regarding terrorist attacks, or natural
disasters.
         (b)   Emergency information messages are to remain in rotation
according to the designated issuing agencies protocols.
   (F)   Brightness. All dynamic displays and dynamic off-site advertising
signs must meet the following brightness standards:
      (1)   No dynamic displays or dynamic off-site advertising sign may be
brighter than is necessary for clear and adequate visibility;
      (2)   No dynamic displays or dynamic off-site advertising sign may be of
such intensity or brilliance as to impair the vision of a motor vehicle driver
with average eyesight or to otherwise interfere with the driver’s operation of
a motor vehicle;

such intensity or brilliance that it interferes with the effectiveness of an
official traffic sign, device or signal; and
      (4)   No dynamic displays or dynamic off-site advertising sign may
display light of such intensity or brilliance to cause glare or otherwise
impair the vision of the driver, or results in a nuisance to the driver.
      (5)   Dynamic displays or dynamic off-site advertising sign light
intensity exceeding the following intensity levels (NITS) constitutes
“excessive intensity or brilliance”:
 
Intensity Levels (NITS)
Color      Daytime Nighttime

been factory pre-set not to exceed 7,000 NITS and that the intensity level is
protected from end-user manipulation by password-protected software or other
method as deemed appropriate.
      (7)   Dynamic displays or dynamic off-site advertising sign will not be
configured to resemble a warning or danger signal or to cause a driver to
mistake the sign for a warning or danger signal.
   (G)   Removal of existing off-site advertising signs. In the event that the
applicant for a dynamic off-site advertising sign owns an existing off-site
advertising sign within 1,000 feet of the proposed location of a dynamic off-

mutually beneficial, cost effective method of removing, or otherwise bringing
into compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, nonconforming off-site
advertising signs.
      (1)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this §
156.210 or elsewhere, an owner or operator of a nonconforming off-site
advertising sign shall not be subject to the amortization or other
nonconforming use provisions of these sign regulations.

duly adopted.
      (3)   An owner or operator of a nonconforming off-site advertising sign
required to be removed under this division (J) shall receive a written
notification from the Building Commissioner that his, her, or its off-site
advertising sign has been designated for removal and shall be asked to declare
the value of the off-site advertising sign in writing from an independent
licensed appraiser. Such notification shall not be deemed a final
administrative action, nor shall it be deemed a final order, but shall only
serve to begin a negotiated process for removal of a nonconforming off-site
advertising signs.
      (4)   The village will use the appraisal as a basis for preparing an
amortization agreement that will establish a period of time that the off-site
advertising sign may remain in operation and, as appropriate, a cash settlement
payable at the end of the amortization period. The owner or operator shall
cooperate in the negotiations to arrive at an agreed upon amortization and, as
appropriate, cash settlement for removal of a nonconforming off-site
advertising sign.
      (5)   In the event that the village and owner or operator of an off-site
advertising signs cannot agree to the terms of an amortization agreement, the
village shall reserve the right, but have no obligation to, seek the
condemnation of a nonconforming off-site advertising sign in a court
proceeding.
      (6)   An amortization agreement shall be recorded in the Office of the
Cook County Recorder against the lot upon which the nonconforming off-site
advertising sign is located.

§ 156.217 SIGNS THAT REQUIRE SIGN PERMIT APPROVAL; PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Intent. Except as expressly provided in §§
156.213(A),
156.214(A) and
156.215(A), no sign shall be erected, enlarged, expanded, altered, relocated,
or maintained unless a sign permit shall have first been issued in accordance
with the provisions of this section. Routine sign maintenance, or changing of
parts designed to be changed shall not, standing alone, be considered an
alteration of the sign requiring the issuance of a sign permit.
   (B)   Authority. The Building Commissioner may, in accordance with the
procedures and standards set forth in this section, grant sign permits
authorizing the construction and maintenance of signs subject to the
regulations and standards contained in this subchapter.
   (C)   Procedure.
      (1)   Application. An application for a sign permit shall be filed by the
owner of, or any person having a contractual interest in, the lot on which the
sign is proposed to be located on a form provided by the Building Commissioner
and shall require the applicant to provide the following information. The sign
permit application shall be filed with the Building Commissioner, signed by the
applicant, and shall contain or have attached the following information at a
minimum:
         (a)   The name, address, and telephone number of the applicant, owner,
or owner’s representative, and the person, firm, corporation, or association
erecting the sign;
         (b)   A site plan, drawn to scale, depicting the location of the
building, structure, and lot upon which the proposed sign is to be attached or
erected;
         (c)   Photographs or drawings depicting the proposed sign and its
relationship to the building to which it is to be mounted or the surrounding
area;
         (d)   Three drawings of the proposed sign depicting the specifications
and method of construction and attachment or erection, as the case may be, to
the building or ground;
         (e)   One accurate color sketch or rendering depicting the proposed
colors proposed to be used on the sign and the existing surrounding materials;
         (f)   If required by the Building Commissioner, a master signage plan
depicting all existing and proposed signs on the building or the lot or both;
         (g)   Written consent of the owner, or the authority to act on behalf
of the owner, of the building, structure, and lot on which the sign is to be
erected;
         (h)   If required by the Building Commissioner, a copy of an
electrical permit;
         (i)   If required by the Building Commissioner, a copy of an insurance
policy or bond;
         (k)   A survey indicating the lot lines and a drawing that shows the
mounting technique and the underground details of the sign installation; and
         (l)   Any other information the Comptroller shall require to show full
compliance with this subchapter and all other laws and ordinances of the
village.
      (2)   Fees. Sign permit fees shall be in the amounts established from
time to time in the Building Code.
      (3)   Action by the Building Commissioner. Within 60 days following the
proper filing of a completed application, the Building Commissioner shall
either grant the sign permit or, by written notice stating the reasons
therefor, grant the application with modifications or conditions, deny the
application, or, where applicable, refer the application to the Plan Commission
for its review. The failure of the Building Commissioner to act within 60 days,
or such further time to which the applicant shall agree, shall be deemed to be
a decision granting the sign permit.
   (D)   Standards for sign permits. No sign permit shall be granted pursuant
to this section unless the applicant shall establish, at a minimum, the
following conditions:
      (1)   Visual compatibility. The proposed sign shall be visually
compatible with the building or lot on which the sign is proposed to be located
and surrounding buildings and structures in terms of height, size, proportion,
scale, materials, texture, colors, and shapes.
      (2)   Quality of design and construction. The proposed sign shall be
constructed and maintained with a high quality design and materials and a good
relationship with the design and character of the neighborhood.
      (3)   Appropriateness to site. The proposed sign shall be appropriate to
its location in terms of design, landscaping, and orientation on the lot, and
will not create a hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic, detract from the
value or enjoyment of neighboring properties, or unduly increase the number of
signs in the area.
      (4)   Compliance with this subchapter. The proposed sign shall comply
with all applicable provisions of this subchapter.
   (E)   Conditions on sign permits. As part of a sign permit, the Building
Commissioner may impose any conditions and limitations concerning the
construction and maintenance of the sign as may be necessary or appropriate to
ensure satisfaction of the standards set forth in this subchapter and the
purposes and objectives of this subchapter and to minimize any adverse effects
upon other property in the vicinity. These conditions shall be expressly set
forth in the sign permit. Violation of any condition or limitation shall be a
violation of this subchapter and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the
sign permit.
   (F)   Expiration of permits.
      (1)   Permanent signs. Sign permits for any sign other than a temporary
sign shall remain in effect until such time that the sign face, sign copy, or
structural elements are changed, modified, or altered so as to deviate from the
terms or conditions of the sign permit. Any such change, modification, or
alteration shall require the issuance of a new sign permit.
      (2)   Temporary signs. Sign permits for temporary signs shall remain in

GENERAL PROCEDURES
§ 157.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Buildings that are open and vacant and in a state of hazardous
disrepair are public nuisances in that they contribute to the decrease in value
of surrounding properties, precipitate disinvestment by neighboring owners,
provide a location for criminal activity, undermine the aesthetic character of
the neighborhood and village, and have other undesirable effects.
   (B)   Allowing certain buildings to remain open and vacant and in a state of
hazardous disrepair is detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare;
unreasonably interferes with the reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of
other premises within the neighborhood; may pose an extraordinary danger to
police officers or firefighters entering the premises in time of emergency; and
detracts from the appearance and good order of the neighborhood; and
   (C)   Pursuant to ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-31-1(c) of the Illinois Municipal
Code the village has the power to define, prohibit and abate buildings that are
open and vacant and in a state of hazardous disrepair within the village
limits.

§ 158.01 PURPOSE.
   The corporate authorities of the village desire to encourage homeownership
and promote a wide range of housing options within the village. Conversions of
apartment buildings to owner-occupied condominium buildings presents great
opportunity to increase owner occupied multi-family housing opportunities for
current and future village residents. While the village desires to facilitate
conversion of rental apartment buildings to owner-occupied condominium
buildings, the village wants to ensure that such conversions are done in a fair
and equitable manner to protect existing apartment residents. The village also
seeks to ensure that such conversions are done so in strict conformity with
current village codes, including, without limitation, building, life safety,
and zoning codes.

   (C)   The developer shall submit to the Building Commissioner estimates for
the cost of construction (or actual executed construction contracts) for public
and private improvements contemplated in the final engineering plan, as well as
the total estimated amount of deposits that the developer intends to take from
the contract purchasers of all condominium unit in the condominium project. The
total estimated deposits shall be based upon the required deposit amount the
developer establishes in the disclosure declaration, pursuant to §
158.03(C)(8)(g). The Building Commissioner shall review such estimates or
construction contracts and, if acceptable, approve the amount of the
performance guarantee. The amount of the performance guarantee shall be based
upon:
      (1)   One hundred twenty-five percent of the total estimate of
construction costs, deposits, and inspection fees for all guaranteed
improvements; or
      (2)   One hundred ten percent of the total construction costs as
indicated in an approved and executed construction contract, plus estimated
deposits and inspection fees for all guaranteed improvements.
   (D)   Performance guarantees shall be in a form approved by the Building
Commissioner and shall specify the terms and conditions noted below:
      (1)   Not less than 30 days prior to the expiration of such guarantee,
the Village Comptroller shall be given written notice by means of certified or
registered mail, indicating that such guarantee is to expire. No guarantee
shall expire absent such notice.
      (2)   Failure of the developer to install such guaranteed improvements
prior to the scheduled completion date, as specified in the approved site
development schedule, shall be considered a default by the developer and the
issuing institution.
      (3)   The guarantee shall only be released or reduced by the issuing
institution upon written certification by the Building Commissioner stating:
         (a)   That said guarantee may be released or reduced in accordance
with this section, and
         (b)   The amount of such discharge or reduction.
      (4)   If at any time the village determines that the institution issuing
the guarantee is without adequate capital, assets, earnings and liquidity and
is unable to meet any federal or state requirement for reserves, is insolvent,
is in danger of becoming any of the foregoing, or is otherwise in danger of
being unable to honor such guarantee at any time during its term, or if the
village otherwise reasonably deems itself to be insecure, then the village
shall have the right to demand that the developer provide a replacement
guarantee from an institution satisfactory to the village. Such replacement
guarantee shall be deposited with the village not later than ten days following
such demand.
      (5)   If the developer fails or refuses to complete the construction of
the public and private improvements, or reimburse a contract purchaser for a
deposit made on a terminated sale contract covered by the guarantee, or to
correct any defect or deficiency in such improvements upon request by the
village, or in any other manner fails or refuses to meet fully any of its
obligations under the guarantee or any other agreement, ordinance, rule, or
regulation of the village, then the village may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, retain all or any part of the guarantee. The village thereafter
shall have the right to exercise any other action it deems reasonable and
appropriate to mitigate the effects of such failure or refusal, and to
reimburse itself or a contract purchaser from the proceeds of the guarantee for
all of its costs and expenses, including legal fees and administrative
expenses. If the funds remaining in the guarantee are insufficient to repay
fully the village or all aggrieved contract purchasers for all such costs and
expenses, and to maintain a cash reserve equal to the required guarantee during
the entire time of such costs and expenses, and to maintain a cash reserve
equal to the required guarantee during the entire time such guarantee should
have been maintained, then the developer shall, upon demand of the village
therefor, immediately deposit with the village such additional funds as the
village determines necessary.
   (E)   Performance guarantees required under this section shall be in a form
approved by the Village Comptroller. The following types of performance
guarantee are acceptable, provided they are consistent with the regulations
below.
      (1)   Cash escrow. A cash deposit may be used as a guarantee, provided
the total amount of the guarantee required is placed with the Village
Comptroller.
      (2)   Irrevocable letter of credit and cash; surety bond. An irrevocable
letter of credit or surety bond may be used as a guarantee, provided such
letter of credit or surety bond is issued by a financial institution approved
by the Village Comptroller, and the letter of credit or surety bond is
accompanied by a cash deposit in an amount not less than 10% of the total
guarantee amount. The cash deposit shall, at all times until released, as
provided herein, be maintained at not less than 10% of the initial total
guarantee amount. The financial institution issuing the irrevocable letter of
credit or surety bond shall be:
         (a)   Insured by the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation or
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation;
         (b)   Chartered in the State of Illinois or have a registered agent in
Illinois;
         (c)   Have adequate capital, assets, earnings and liquidity to ensure
the financial soundness of the issuing institution, as determined by the
Village Comptroller; and
         (d)   In the case of a surety bond, be licensed and authorized by the
Illinois Department of Insurance to sell and issue sureties in the State of
Illinois.
   (F)   The developer may make a written request to the Building Commissioner
to partially reduce the amount of the approved performance guarantee. The
Building Commissioner shall be authorized to approve such partial reductions in
the amount of the performance guarantee, provided:
      (1)   There shall be no more than three partial reductions approved in
the amount of the performance guarantee during the life of the subdivision;
      (2)   Partial reductions shall be authorized only following the
acceptable completion of the following improvements:
         (a)   All underground storm drainage, sanitary sewer and water supply
systems have been properly installed and all erosion and sediment controls are
operational;
         (b)   All curb, gutter, sidewalk and base course paving for public and
private streets have been properly constructed; and
         (c)   All lots have been graded and all storm detention facilities are
operational;
      (3)   The inspection reports for the subdivision evidence acceptable
completion of the above;
      (4)   The amount of such partial reduction shall not exceed 75% of the
estimated cost to construct such improvements;
      (5)   In no event shall the amount of the performance guarantee be
reduced to a level which, in the sole and absolute opinion of the Building
Commissioner, would not allow the village to complete the installation of
public and private improvements associated with the subdivision; and
      (6)   In no event shall any portion of the cash deposit be reduced prior
to final release of the performance guarantee pursuant to this section.
   (G)   Acceptance of any dedicated public improvements in any condominium
project shall be as set forth in applicable village ordinances or as set forth
in any agreement or other document concerning the property.

warranties, provided the work was done in accordance with existing applicable

during the period of the warranty by a unit owner or the association, the
developer shall, within 30 days of receiving notice, make any required repairs
or replacements. If the developer fails to comply with the warranty provisions,

conditions require in case of emergency, the association may have the work done
and shall have recourse to the escrow or other security provided pursuant to

         (g)   In the event that the proposed small wireless facility is to be
attached to an existing pole owned by an entity other than the village, the
wireless provider shall provide legally competent evidence of the consent of
the owner of such pole to the proposed collocation.
      (2)   Application process. The village shall process applications as
follows:
         (a)   The first completed application shall have priority over
applications received by different applicants for collocation on the same
utility pole or wireless support structure.
         (b)   1.   An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the village fails to
approve or deny the application within 90 days after the submission of a
completed application.
            2.   However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the village in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than 75
days after the submission of a completed application.
            3.   The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the
ninetieth day after submission of the complete application or the tenth day
after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the village. The receipt of
the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the village's denial of the
permit request within the time limits as provided under this chapter.
         (c)   1.   An application to collocate a small wireless facility that
includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the village fails to approve or
deny the application within 120 days after the submission of a completed

            2.   However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the village in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than
105 days after the submission of a completed application.
            3.   The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the one-
hundred and twentieth day after submission of the complete application or the
tenth day after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the village. The
receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the village's denial
of the permit request within the time limits as provided under this chapter.
         (d)   The village shall deny an application which does not meet the
requirements of this chapter.
            1.   If the village determines that applicable codes, ordinances or
regulations that concern public safety, or the collocation requirements and
conditions contained in this chapter require that the utility pole or wireless
support structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall
be conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
            2.   The village shall document the basis for a denial, including
the specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is
based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the
village denies an application.
            3.   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the
village and resubmit the revised application once within 30 days after notice
of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application
fee. The village shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days
after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure
to resubmit the revised application within 30 days of denial shall require the
application to submit a new application with applicable fees, and
recommencement of the village's review period.
            4.   The applicant must notify the village in writing of its
intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis,
which may be submitted with the revised application.
            5.   Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the
deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not
apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different
structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment
associated with the small wireless facility.
         (e)   Pole attachment agreement. Within 30 days after an approved
permit, the village and the applicant shall enter into a master pole attachment
agreement, provided by the village.

         (a)   Within 30 days after receiving an application, the village must
determine whether the application is complete and notify the applicant. If an
application is incomplete, the village must specifically identify the missing
information. An application shall be deemed complete if the village fails to
provide notification to the applicant within 30 days after all documents,
information and fees specifically enumerated in the village's permit
application form are submitted by the applicant to the village.
         (b)   Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the village sends
the notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing
information.
      (4)   Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         (a)   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the
village; or
         (b)   A local, state or Federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      (5)   Consolidated applications. 
         (a)   An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities
within the jurisdiction of the village shall be allowed, at the applicant's
discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for
the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each
involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and
substantially the same type of structure.
         (b)   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities,
the village may remove small wireless facility collocations from the
application and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which
incomplete information has been provided or that do not qualify for
consolidated treatment or that are denied. The village may issue separate
permits for each collocation that is approved in a consolidated application.
      (6)   Duration of permits. 
         (a)   The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than
five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the
village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or
modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable village codes or any
provision, condition or requirement contained in this chapter.
         (b)   If PA 100-0585 is repealed as provided in Section 90 of the Act,
renewals of permits shall be subject to the applicable village code provisions
or regulations in effect at the time of renewal.
      (7) Means of submitting applications. Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information and notices to the village by personal
delivery at the village's designated place of business, by regular mail
postmarked on the date due or by any other commonly used means, including
electronic mail.
   (C)   Collocation requirements and conditions.
      (1)   Public safety space reservation. The village may reserve space on
municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the village's
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the village reasonably
determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      (2)   No interference with public safety communication frequencies. 
         (a)   The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless
facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety

         (b)   A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of
the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a
public safety agency's communications equipment.
         (c)   Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC’s regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency.
         (d)   If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the
wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
         (e)   The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility
based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with
the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to
remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      (3)   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities
on village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or
transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or
the electric supply zone of the pole.
         (a)   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
         (b)   For purposes of this division, the terms “communications space,”
“communication worker safety zone,” and “electric supply zone” have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      (4)   The wireless provider shall comply with ail applicable codes and
local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
      (5)   The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards
that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable
stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a village
ordinance, written policy adopted by the village, a comprehensive plan or other
written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way,
including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      (6)   Alternate placements. 
         (a)   With respect to an application for the collocation of a small
wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the village may propose
that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or
existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the
alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
         (b)   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the village,
the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does
not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
      (7)   Height limitations. 
         (a)   The village maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be
no more than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on
which the small wireless facility is collocated.
         (b)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a
height in excess of ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the
applicant shall apply for a special use permit in conformance with procedures,
terms and conditions set forth in the Village of Bellwood's Zoning Ordinance
and Zoning Code. A special use permit, when granted, shall limit the height of
any proposed wireless facility to the higher of:
            1.   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way
within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures
shall control the height limitation for such facility; or
            2.   Forty-five feet above ground level.
      (8)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
   (D)   Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows:
      (1)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of $650 for an application
to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or
wireless support structure, and $350 for each small wireless facility addressed
