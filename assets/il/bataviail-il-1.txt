      MEMO
To:   Mayor and City Council
From: Laura Newman, City Administrator
Date: August 8, 2025
Re:   ORD 2025-043 Amending 2025 Wages and Salaries for Non-Collective Bargained
      Employees
The Assistant Director of Public Works/
City Engineer gave notice that he was leaving on August 8, 2025, to pursue
another employment opportunity.
With the opening, sta? took the opportunity to review/
evaluate the current sta?ng structure and are
recommending the following changes:
∙   The current Assistant City Engineer to be promoted to the new position of City
Engineer
∙   Eliminate the position of Assistant City Engineer
∙   Promote the Electric Superintendent to a new position of Assistant Director of
Public
Works/Electric
∙   Eliminate the position of Assistant Director of Public Works/City Engineer
∙   Eliminate the position of Electric Superintendent
The additional duties for the electric utility that had previously been the
responsibility of the former Director of Public Works and Assistant Director of
Public Works/City Engineer justify upgrading the Electric Superintendent’s
position to Assistant Director/Electric. This position has oversight of just
the
electric utility. The engineering department will be managed by the City Engineer who will report to the
Director of Public Works.
In addition to these changes the engineering department is proposing to add a
Civil Engineer in place of the open Engineering Assistant position. A recent
search resulted in ?nding no suitable candidates for
the Engineering Assistant position, and with the Assistant Director of Public Works/
City Engineer leaving, the department needs another Civil Engineer to manage
its current workload.
The proposed changes result in annual cost savings of $147,166.
Sta? request that the City Council approve the proposed changes and the amended wage and salary
ordinance 2025-043 for non-collectively bargained employees re?ecting the
changes.

the changes made to said ordinances, under the direction of the governing body

under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such offense

incurred, or any right accrued or claims arising before the new ordinance takes
effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform, so far as

penalty, forfeiture or punishment be mitigated by any provision of a new
ordinance, such provision may, by consent of the party affected, be applied to
any judgment pronounced after the new ordinance takes effect.

implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions
upon the same subject, or any other ordinance.

the city herein repealed; or as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering
any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person,
firm or corporation, or as waiving any right of the city under any section or

was clearly intended to express such intent, an error relating to the numbering
of an ordinance or resolution, or is found to have been incorrectly copied from
an ordinance duly passed and approved by the mayor and city council, such
spelling shall be corrected by the city clerk and such word, words or numbers

and the provision shall have the same effect as though the correct words were
contained in the text as originally published. No such alteration shall be made

Batavia may attend a meeting electronically if the member meets the following
conditions:
      1.   The member shall notify the City Clerk at least twenty four (24)
hours in advance of the meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary
communications equipment can be arranged. Inability to make the necessary
technical arrangements will result in denial of a request for remote

unable to physically attend the meeting,

disability; or

         a.   A notice was received by a member of the Corporate Authority in
accordance with these rules, and
         b.   The member will be deemed authorized to attend the meeting
electronically unless a motion objecting to the member's electronic attendance
is made, seconded, and approved by two- thirds (2/3) of the members of the
Corporate Authority physically present at the meeting. If no such motion is
made and seconded or if any such motion fails to achieve the required vote by

off-site attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting if the
member is allowed to attend. The meeting minutes shall also reflect and state
specifically whether each member is physically present or present by electronic
means.

will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting and participate
in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject to all
general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and adhered to.

or both. The particular findings in the case, any recommendation for
discipline, and any fine imposed shall be a matter of public information.
      6.   If the hearing was closed to the public, the respondent may file a
written demand for a public hearing on the complaint within seven (7) business
days after the issuance of the recommendation for discipline or imposition of a
fine, or both. The filing of the demand shall stay the enforcement of the
recommendation or fine. Within fourteen (14) days after receiving the demand,
the commission shall conduct a public hearing on the complaint upon at least
forty eight (48) hours' public notice of the hearing and allow both parties the

protect the rights of the parties. Lack of preparation shall not be grounds for
a continuance. (Ord. 10-03, 3-15-2010)
1-14-8: JUDICIAL REVIEW:
Any final decision by a hearing officer that a code violation does or does not
exist shall constitute a final determination for purposes of judicial review
and shall be subject to review under the Illinois administrative review law.
(Ord. 10-03, 3-15-2010)
1-14-9: ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENT:
   A.   Any fine, other sanction, or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other
sanction, or costs imposed, remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of or the

accordance with applicable law.

code violation, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
findings, decision, and order of the hearing officer may be enforced in the
same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   C.   In any case in which a defendant has failed to comply with a judgment
ordering a defendant to correct a code violation or imposing any fine or other
sanction as a result of a code violation, any expenses incurred by the city to
enforce the judgment, including, but not limited to, attorney fees, court
costs, and costs related to property demolition or foreclosure, after they are
fixed by a court of competent jurisdiction or a hearing officer, shall be a
debt due and owing the city and may be collected in accordance with applicable
law. Prior to any expenses being fixed by a hearing officer pursuant to this
subsection, the city shall provide notice to the defendant that states that the
defendant shall appear at a hearing before the administrative hearing officer
to determine whether the defendant has failed to comply with the judgment. The
notice shall set the date for such a hearing, which shall not be less than
seven (7) days from the date that notice is served. If notice is served by
mail, the seven (7) day period shall begin to run on the date that the notice
was deposited in the mail.

of civil procedure or by the uniform commercial code, a lien shall be imposed
on the real estate or personal estate, or both, of the defendant in the amount
of any debt due and owing the city under this section. The lien may be enforced
in the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   E.   A hearing officer may set aside any judgment entered by default and set
a new hearing date, upon a petition filed within twenty one (21) days after the
issuance of the order of default, if the hearing officer determines that the
petitioner's failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause or at any time
if the petitioner establishes that the city did not provide proper service of
process. If any judgment is set aside pursuant to this subsection, the hearing
officer shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien which has
been recorded for any debt due and owing the municipality as a result of the
vacated default judgment. (Ord. 10-03, 3-15-2010)

conducted. The audit shall be conducted not less than seven (7) days nor more
than thirty (30) days from the date the notice is given, unless the taxpayer
and the local tax administrator agreed to some other convenient time. In the
event taxpayer is unable to comply with the audit on the date in question, the
taxpayer may request another date within the thirty (30) days, approved in
writing, that is convenient to the taxpayer and the local tax administrator.
   D.   Every taxpayer shall keep accurate books and records of the taxpayer's
business or activities, including original source documents and books of entry
denoting the transactions which had given rise or may have given rise to any
tax liability, exemption or deduction. All books shall be kept in the English
language and shall be subject to and available for inspection by the city.

its books and records for inspection by the city. If the taxpayer or tax
collector fails to provide the documents necessary for audit within the time
provided, the local tax administrator may issue a tax determination and
assessment based on the tax administrator's determination of the best estimate
of the taxpayer's tax liability.
   F.   If an audit determines there has been an overpayment of a locally
imposed and administered tax as a result of the audit, written notice of the
amount of overpayment shall be given to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days of
the city's determination of the amount of overpayment.
   G.   In the event a tax payment was submitted to the incorrect local
governmental entity, the local tax administrator shall notify the local
governmental entity imposing such tax. (Ord. 01-11, 2-19-2001)
3-14-9: APPEAL:
   A.   The local tax administrator shall send written notice to a taxpayer
upon the local tax administrator's issuance of a protestable notice of tax due,

assessment.

written notice to the taxpayer. The hearing shall be scheduled for a date
within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the written protest and petition for
hearing, unless the taxpayer requests a later date convenient to all parties.
   D.   If a written protest and petition for hearing is not filed within the
forty five (45) day period, the tax determination, audit or assessment shall
become a final bill due and owing without further notice.
   E.   Upon the showing of reasonable cause by the taxpayer and the full
payment of the contested tax liability along with interest accrued as of the
due date of the tax, the local tax administrator may reopen or extend the time
for filing a written protest and petition for hearing. In no event shall the
time for filing a written protest and petition for hearing be reopened or
extended for more than ninety (90) days after the expiration of the forty five
(45) day period. (Ord. 01-11, 2-19-2001)
3-14-10: HEARING:
   A.   Whenever a taxpayer or a tax collector has filed a timely written
protest and petition for hearing under section
3-14-9 of this chapter, the local tax administrator shall conduct a hearing
regarding any appeal. The taxpayer may request that a hearing officer conduct
the hearing rather than the local tax administrator, if the city has such a
hearing officer.
   B.   No continuances shall be granted except in cases where a continuance is
absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the taxpayer. Lack of preparation
shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any continuance granted shall not
exceed thirty (30) days.
   C.   At the hearing the local tax administrator/hearing officer shall
preside and shall hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax
determination, audit or assessment. The strict rules of evidence applicable to
judicial proceedings shall not apply.
   D.   At the conclusion of the hearing, the local tax administrator/hearing
officer shall make a written determination on the basis of the evidence
presented at the hearing. The taxpayer or tax collector shall be provided with
a copy of the written decision. (Ord. 01-11, 2-19-2001)
3-14-11: INTEREST AND PENALTIES:
In the event a determination has been made that a tax is due and owing, through
audit, assessment or other bill sent, the tax must be paid within the time
frame otherwise indicated.
   A.   Interest: The city hereby provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be five
percent (5%) per annum, based on a year of three hundred sixty five (365) days
and the number of days elapsed.
   B.   Late Filing And Payment Penalties: If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%)
of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the city issuing
a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file
penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the total tax
due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was required to be
filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a failure to file
penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance. (Ord. 01-11, 2-19-2001)
3-14-12: ABATEMENT:
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any late
filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local
tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure
to make a filing. (Ord. 01-11, 2-19-2001)
3-14-13: INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS:
The city may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with
the local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without
further notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 01-11, 2-19-2001)
3-14-14: STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS:
The city, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns in
a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due and owing.
The taxpayer shall have forty five (45) days after receiving notice of the
reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still
due and owing.
   A.   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four (4)
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   B.   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
city, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due, the
statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the
calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.
   C.   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer. (Ord. 01-11, 2-19-2001)
3-14-15: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 01-11, 2-19-2001)
3-14-16: PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES:
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the city
clerk's office. (Ord. 01-11, 2-19-2001)
3-14-17: LIENS:
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   A.   Timely remove the lien at the city's expense;
   B.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   C.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord. 01-
11, 2-19-2001)
3-14-18: APPLICATION:
This chapter shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all of
the city's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in conflict
with or inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter shall be controlling.

imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state,
who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to
ensure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.
The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion.

primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
   TAXPAYER: A person who individually or through his or her agents, employees,
or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability as
authorized by the ordinance.
   TELECOMMUNICATIONS: In addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly
ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information
transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide area telephone service,
private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter,

on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications.

intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this chapter,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the retailers' occupations tax act. (Ord. 02-45, 9-3-2002)
3-16-2: TAX IMPOSED:
A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all the following acts or privileges:
   A.   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in
the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six
percent (6%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer.
   B.   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in
the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six
percent (6%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multistate taxation of the act or
privilege that is subject to taxation under this section, any taxpayer, upon
proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be
allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this
section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such
other state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
state or local tax in this state.
   C.   The tax imposed by this chapter is not imposed on such act or privilege
to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution and
statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality. (Ord. 02-45, 9-3-2002)
3-16-3: COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS:
   A.   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the taxpayer
by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be
remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax collected by such
retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt
owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale
at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the
manner provided by the department.

show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of originating
or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax free on the
grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale
number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in
connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is
nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 02-45, 9-3-2002)

3-17-1: PURPOSE AND FINDINGS:
   A.   Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the citizens of the city of Batavia, and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of
sexually oriented businesses within the city of Batavia. The provisions of this
chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually
oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this
chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials
protected by the first amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and
exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither
is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material.
   B.   Findings: Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of
adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available
to the Batavia city council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City
of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American
Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976), FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215

496 (Tucson, Arizona "Memoranda From Citizens Advisory Planning Committee And
Assistant Chief Of Police", 1990); and American Planning Association planning
advisory service report no. 495/496 (Whittier, California study, 1994), the
Batavia city council finds:
      1.   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
      2.   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses engage in higher
incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
      3.   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
      4.   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions.
      5.   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
      6.   At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by
activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not
limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-
AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, non A, non B amebiasis, salmonella
infections and shigella infections.
      7.   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome) caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United
States: 600 in 1982; 2,200 in 1983; 4,600 in 1984; 8,555 in 1985; 253,448
through 1992, and more than 1,000,000 in 2006. (Reported by KA Fenton, RO
Valdiserri, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB
Prevention [proposed, Center for Disease Control, June 2006].)
      8.   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in the
state of Illinois.
      9.   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with 330,132 cases being reported in 2005.
(Reported by U.S. department of health and human services, August 2006.)
      10.   In his report of October 22, 1986, the surgeon general of the
United States has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may
be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      11.   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      12.   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      13.   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented
films.
      14.   The findings noted in subsections B1 through B13 of this section
raise substantial governmental concerns.
      15.   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      16.   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business
is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city of Batavia. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of
the premises and activities occurring therein.
      17.   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
      18.   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior and prevent minors
from working in such establishments.
      19.   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      20.   In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is
desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent, or who
are likely to be witnesses to such conduct.
      21.   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
      22.   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to, and prevents conduct which
leads to, the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      23.   The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of
the city of Batavia will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter. (Ord.

users to access content, information, electronic mail, or other services
offered over the public internet. (Ord. 07-83, 10-15-2007)
3-18-2: PEG ACCESS REQUIRED:
   A.   Not later than ninety (90) days after a request by the city, the holder
shall: 1) designate the same amount of capacity on its network to provide for
public, education, and government access use, as the incumbent cable operator
is required to designate under its franchise terms in effect with the city on
January 1, 2007; and 2) retransmit to its subscribers the same number of
public, education, and government access channels as the incumbent cable
operator was retransmitting to subscribers on January 1, 2007.
   B.   If the city (or the city's public, education, and government
programming providers) produces or maintains the public, education or
government programming in a manner or form that is compatible with the holder's
network, it shall transmit such programming to the holder in that form. If the
city (or the city's public, education, and government programming providers)
does not produce or maintain such programming in that manner or form, then the
holder shall be responsible for any changes in the form of the transmission
necessary to make public, education, and government programming compatible with
the technology or protocol used by the holder to deliver services. The holder
shall receive programming from the city (or the city's public, education, and
government programming providers) and transmit that public, education, and
government programming directly to the holder's subscribers within the local
unit of government's jurisdiction at no cost to the local unit of government or
the public, education, and government programming providers. If the holder is
required to change the form of the transmission, the local unit of government
or its designee shall provide reasonable access to the holder to allow the
holder to transmit the public, education, and government programming in an
economical manner.
   C.   The holder shall provide to subscribers public, education and
government access channel capacity at equivalent visual and audio quality and
equivalent functionality, from the viewing perspective of the subscriber, to
that of commercial channels carried on the holder's basic cable or video
service offerings or tiers without the need for any equipment other than the
equipment necessary to receive the holder's basic cable or video service
offerings or tiers.
   D.   The holder and an incumbent cable operator shall negotiate in good
faith to interconnect their networks, if needed, for the purpose of providing
public, education, and government programming. Interconnection may be
accomplished by direct cable, microwave link, satellite, or other reasonable
method of connection. The holder and the incumbent cable operator shall provide
interconnection of the public, education, and government channels on reasonable
terms and conditions and may not withhold the interconnection. If a holder and
an incumbent cable operator cannot reach a mutually acceptable interconnection
agreement, the local unit of government may require the incumbent cable
operator to allow the holder to interconnect its network with the incumbent
cable operator's network at a technically feasible point on their networks. If
no technically feasible point for interconnection is available, the holder and
an incumbent cable operator shall each make an interconnection available to the
public, education, and government channel originators at their local
origination points and shall provide the facilities necessary for the
interconnection. The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by the holder
unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. The interconnection required by this
subsection shall be completed within the ninety (90) day deadline set forth in
subsection A of this section.
   E.   The public, education, and government channels shall be for the
exclusive use of the city (or the city's public, education, and government
programming providers) to provide public, education, and government
programming. The public, education, and government channels shall be used only
for noncommercial purposes; however, advertising, underwriting, or sponsorship
recognition may be carried on the channels for the purpose of funding public,
education, and government access related activities.
   F.   Public, education and government channels shall all be carried on the
holder's basic cable or video service offerings or tiers. To the extent
feasible, the public, education and government channels shall not be separated
numerically from other channels carried on the holder's basic cable or video
service offerings or tiers, and the channel numbers for the public, education
and government channels shall be the same channel numbers used by the incumbent
cable operator unless prohibited by federal law. After the initial designation
of public, education and government channel numbers, the channel numbers shall
not be changed without the agreement of the city (or the city's public,
education, and government programming providers) unless the change is required
by federal law. Each channel shall be capable of carrying a national television
system committee (NTSC) television signal.
   G.   The holder shall provide a listing of public, education and government
channels on channel cards and menus provided to subscribers in a manner
equivalent to other channels if the holder uses such cards and menus. Further,
the holder shall provide a listing of public, education, and government
programming on its electronic program guide if such a guide is utilized by the
holder. It is the public, education and government entity's responsibility to
provide the holder or its designated agent, as determined by the holder, with
program schedules and information in a timely manner.
   H.   If less than three (3) public, education, and government channels are
provided within the city as of January 1, 2007, the city may initially request
the holder to designate sufficient capacity for up to three (3) public,
education, and government channels. The city or its designee that seeks to add
additional capacity shall give the holder a written notification specifying the
number of additional channels to be used, specifying the number of channels in
actual use, and verifying that the additional channels requested will be put
into actual use.
   I.   The holder shall, within ninety (90) days of a request by the city or
its designated public, education, or government access entity, provide
sufficient capacity for an additional channel for public, education, and
government access when the programming on a given access channel exceeds forty
(40) hours per week as measured on a quarterly basis. The additional channel
shall not be used for any purpose other than for carrying additional public,
education, or government access programming.
   J.   The public, education, and government access programmer is solely
responsible for the content that it provides over designated public, education,
or government channels. A holder shall not exercise any editorial control over
any programming on any channel designed for public, education, or government
use. (Ord. 07-83, 10-15-2007)

The community development director is authorized to issue portable sidewalk
sign permits, when permitted by the zoning code, for the use of sidewalks

sidewalk, subject to the following conditions in addition to the regulations in
the zoning code, title 10, chapter 4.4, sign regulations:
   A.   A portable sidewalk sign permit shall be required prior to placing any
sign on any public sidewalk. The city hereby reserves the right to limit the

   D.   In addition, any owner, property manager or agent or employee thereof
may be required to attend or re-attend a City of Batavia Crime Free Rental
Housing Program Seminar if the coordinator determines that attendance or re-
attendance is required for good cause. The coordinator, in determining whether
or not to require a specific person to attend or re-attend the Crime Free
Rental Housing Program Seminar, shall consider the following:
      1.   Activities that have occurred on or in connection with the rental
property that are indicative of a nuisance as described in section

proceedings or take other appropriate action to abate the nuisance.

entered on or after January 1, 2012, unless a crime free lease provision is
included in the lease substantially conforming to the language contained in a
sample crime free lease provision to be maintained by the coordinator and
provided at no cost by the City. Any clause or addendum reviewed and approved
by the coordinator and/or the City Attorney prior to execution shall be
conclusively determined to be in compliance with this section. At a minimum,
the clause shall make any criminal activity (not limited to violent criminal
activity or drug related criminal activity engaged by, facilitated by or
permitted by a renter, member of the household, invitee or other party under
the control of the renter) a lease violation; provide that proof of criminal
activity may be established by a preponderance of the evidence; and give the
landlord the authority to initiate an eviction proceeding due to criminal
activity as specified in the Illinois Compiled Statutes Forcible Entry and
Detainer Statutes.
   F.   Notice to a designated agent or property manager shall be considered
notice to an owner. Unless a designated agent is an owner, property manager or
other person with the authority or responsibility for the control or oversight
of the rental property, a designated agent shall be responsible only for
receiving notice. It shall be a violation of this chapter for a designated
agent to refuse notice or to fail to deliver the notice to the owner and
property manager.
   G.   An owner, property manager, or employee or agent thereof, shall be
considered to have satisfied the requirements of subsections A and B of this
section if the owner, property manager, or employee or agent thereof, has
completed a program substantially similar to the Batavia Crime Free Rental
Housing Program Seminar that has been approved by the Chief of Police or his

   TONAL NOISE: Any sound that can be judged as a single pitch or set of single
pitches by the CCO.
   WEEKDAY: Any day, Monday through Friday, that is not a legal holiday.
   C.   Enforcement Powers, Duties And Qualifications:
      1.   The provisions of this section shall be enforced only by a city
employee designated by the city administrator who has noise assessment
certification ("designated city employee").
      2.   Noise assessment certification can be obtained by: a) completing an
instructional program from a noise control engineer certified by the Institute
of Noise Control Engineering (INCE); b) completing a training session from a
designated city employee certified by an INCE engineer; c) having completed an
instructional program in community noise from another qualified training source
and demonstrating skill and competence to a noise certified designated city
employee; or d) having education or experience or a combination thereof and
having demonstrated competence to a noise certified designated city employee.
      3.   Noise measurements shall be taken by a designated city employee
certified in noise assessment and shall be taken in accordance with the
procedures specified in subsection D of this section.
      4.   The city's building commissioner shall have the power to coordinate
the noise control activities of the city, review the actions of other municipal
departments, review public and private projects for compliance with this
section. The city's director of community development may act in the building
commissioner's absence.
   D.   Sound Measurement Procedures:
      1.   Insofar as practicable, sound measurements shall be made while the
source under investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions and, as
necessary, at other conditions, including, but not limited to, design, maximum,
and fluctuating rates.
      2.   All tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following
procedures:
         a.   The designated city employee shall, to the extent practicable,
identify all sources contributing to the noise at the point of measurement.
         b.   Measurements shall be taken at or within the property line of the
affected person.
         c.   The sound level meter must be calibrated using only a calibrator
recommended by the measuring instrument manufacturer before and after each
series of readings.
         d.   The calibrator must be checked at least once each year by the
manufacturer or other qualified laboratory. Written documentation of the
calibrator check must be kept with the equipment at all times.
         e.   If the sound level meter is dropped, stored for any length of
time in an environment outside the manufacturer's recommended limits, or
physically damaged, it shall be sent back to the manufacturer for inspection,
recalibration, and repair if necessary.
         f.   No outdoor measurements shall be taken:
            (1)   During periods when wind speeds (including gusts) exceed
fifteen (15) miles per hour;
            (2)   Without an acoustically acceptable windscreen properly
attached to the microphone;
            (3)   Under any condition that allows the measuring instrument to
become wet (e.g., rain, snow, or condensation); or
            (4)   When the ambient temperature is out of the range of the
tolerance of the measuring instrument.
      3.   The report for each measurement session shall include the latest
version of the "noise measurement worksheet" (attached to ordinance 05-33 as
exhibit A). This worksheet shall include, but not be limited to:
         a.   The date and times at which measurements are taken;
         b.   The results of the calibration check;
         c.   The weather conditions;
         d.   The identification of all monitoring equipment;
         e.   A description of the source(s) and its operating cycle; and
         f.   The total sound level (level with the sources in question
operating);
         g.   The background sound level (level without the sources in question
operating).
      4.   Prior to taking noise measurements the designated city employee
shall explore the vicinity of the source in question to identify other sound
sources that could affect measurements, to establish the approximate location
and character of the principal sound source, and to select suitable locations
from which to measure the sound radiated from the source in question.
      5.   When measuring sound, the sound level meter shall be set for A-
weighting, linear averaging, and the proper range (i.e., where the sound level
registers in the upper measurement range without exceeding its limits). The
sample duration shall be at least ten (10) seconds.
      6.   The measuring instrument shall be placed at a minimum height of
three feet (3') above the ground and from any reflective surface. The
microphone shall be held at arm's length and pointed at the source at the angle
recommended by the measuring instrument's manufacturer.
      7.   If temporary sound sources unrelated to the measurements are plainly
audible, such as aircraft flyovers, barking dogs, or moving motorcycles, the
measurements should be postponed until these extraneous sounds have negligible
effect on the sound levels of interest.
      8.   The observation session should last for a period of time sufficient
to ensure that the sound levels measured are typical of the source in question.
      9.   To determine the source sound level, the background levels shall be
subtracted from the measured total sound levels as given in the worksheet. If
the total level does not exceed the background level by two (2) dBs or more,
the source level cannot be derived and a violation of this section cannot be
substantiated.
   E.   Sound Level Limitations:
      1.   No person shall cause, allow, or permit the operation of any sound
source on "industrial property" as defined herein in such a manner as to create
an effective source noise level that exceeds the limits specified in table 1 of
this section when measured at or within the real property line of the receiving
property.
 
TABLE 1
MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE EFFECTIVE SOURCE NOISE LEVELS
Industrial Property To: Daytime Hours Nighttime Hours
Industrial property     65            65
Commercial property     65            60
Residential property    60            50
 
         a.   The source noise level is determined by subtracting the total
measured sound level (i.e., the sound with the source on) from the background
sound level (i.e., the sound with the source off). If the noise source is
continuous and cannot be turned off to obtain a suitable background noise
reading, such a reading shall be obtained at a more distant location where the
noise is inaudible, yet the ambient sound level is similar in loudness and
character to what can be heard at the original receiver location.
         b.   The "effective" source noise level is determined by adjusting the
sound noise level for: 1) any adverse character (e.g., tonal, impulsive, bass),
and 2) for less than full time operation in any one hour period. Said
adjustments shall be made pursuant to the provisions of the "noise measurement
worksheet" (attached to ordinance 05-33 as exhibit A).
      2.   The following are exempt from the sound level limits within this
section:
         a.   Noise from emergency signaling devices or the generation of sound
in the performance of emergency work;
         b.   Noise from an exterior burglar alarm of any building provided
such burglar alarm shall terminate its operation within five (5) minutes of its
activation;
         c.   The generation of sound in situations within the jurisdiction of
the federal occupational safety and health administration.
         d.   Construction activity so long as same is in compliance with
section
4-4-4 of this chapter.
   F.   Specific Prohibited Acts:
      1.   No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit to be made verbally
or mechanically any noise disturbance, as defined in subsection E1 of this
section and which originates from any source as provided in subsection A2 of
this section.
      2.   No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit the following acts:
         a.   Operating or permitting the operation of any semitrailer or any
motor vehicle whose manufacturer's gross weight rating is in excess of ten
thousand (10,000) pounds, or any auxiliary equipment attached to such a
vehicle, for a period of longer than five (5) minutes in any hour while the
vehicle is stationary, for reasons other than traffic congestion or emergency
work, on a public right of way or public space within five hundred feet (500')
of "residential property", as defined in subsection B of this section. (Ord.
05-33, 8-1-2005)
4-4-7: PENALTY:
   A.   Violation of any provision of section
4-4-6 of this chapter shall be cause for a notice to appear to be issued by the
code compliance officer of the city.
   B.   Any person or entity that violates any provision of section
4-4-6 of this chapter shall be subject to a fine for each offense of not more
than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). If the violation is of a continuing
nature, each day during which it occurs shall constitute an additional,
separate and distinct offense, subject to the fine as set forth above. (Ord.

said police officer may, in lieu of the filing of a complaint in court, in the
first instance issue to such alleged violator a citation:
         a.   Advising said person that he has violated a specified ordinance;
         b.   Requesting him to make payment in an amount applicable to said
alleged violation as set forth above as settlement of said violation claim; and
         c.   Informing him that upon failure to so settle, a complaint will be
filed in the circuit court of Kane County charging him with such violation.
(Ord. 07-37, 4-2-2007)
      2.   Settlement: Pursuant to said citation, the person so accused of said
violation may settle and compromise the violation claim in respect to such code
violation by paying to the municipality the applicable amount as shown in the
schedule set forth as the settlement amount in subsection B1 of this section,
within a period to be specified in said citation, not more than ten (10) days
of the time said alleged offense was committed.
Such payment shall be made in accordance with the instructions contained in the
aforesaid citation, at the police department, which shall issue a receipt for
the money so received and promptly remit said amount to the city treasurer to
be credited to the proper municipal fund.
      3.   Final Notice, Penalty: In the event that the person to whom said
citation is issued fails to settle and pay said violation within the time
specified in the citation, a final notice shall be mailed to him. When, in
fact, the final notice has been mailed, the violation may then be settled and
compromised by paying the amount set forth in the schedule in subsection B1 of
this section plus five dollars ($5.00) within the time specified in the final
notice.
      4.   Issuance Of Complaint: In the event that the person to whom the
citation is issued fails to settle and pay said violation claim within the time
specified in the final notice (if one is served or mailed to him), then the
police officer is authorized to cause the citation (notice to appear - "O"
ticket) to be served upon said alleged violator and is authorized to file the
same as a complaint in the circuit court of Kane County and prosecute the same.
The officer, as an alternative, may file a formal complaint in the circuit
court of Kane County in lieu of the citation.
      5.   Court Penalty, Settlement Before Court Date: In the event that
payment is not made within the time prescribed in the final notice and the
citation or a complaint is filed in the circuit court, payment of any fine and
costs shall be in such amounts as may be determined and established by the
circuit court, but not to exceed the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for
any one violation; provided, that the offenses may be settled and compromised
for the amount specified in the notice to appear at least three (3) working
days before the court date. Such amount shall be the amount set forth in the
schedule set forth in subsection B1 of this section plus five dollars ($5.00),
plus court costs.

herein will not excuse securing of and the payment of a license fee provided

place of the alleged violation, an official device is not in proper position
and sufficiently legible to be seen by a reasonably observant person. Whenever
a particular section does not state that official traffic-control devices are
required, such section shall be effective even though no devices are erected or
in place. (1972 Code § 72.015)
6-4-5: OFFICIAL TRAFFIC-CONTROL DEVICES; PRESUMPTION OF LEGALITY:
   A.   Whenever official traffic-control devices are placed in position,
approximately conforming to the requirements of this Title, such devices shall
be presumed to have been so placed by the official act or direction of lawful
authority, unless the contrary shall be established by competent evidence.
   B.   Any official traffic-control device placed pursuant to the provisions
of this Title, and purporting to conform to the lawful requirements pertaining
to such devices shall be presumed to comply with the requirements of this
Title, unless the contrary shall be established by competent evidence. (1972
Code § 72.020)
6-4-6: TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND:
Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control devices exhibiting different
colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time, or in
combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for
special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and such lights shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   A.   Green Indication:
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left, unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including turning right or left, shall
yield the right of way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited.
      2.   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the time. Such vehicular traffic shall
yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and
to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      3.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as
provided in Section
6-4-7 of this Chapter, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the
sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any
marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   B.   Steady Yellow Indication:
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned
that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication
will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection.
      2.   Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed
by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in Section
6-4-7 of this Chapter, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to
cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then
start to cross the roadway.
   C.   Steady Red Indication:
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then
before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green
indication is shown.
      2.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as
provided in Section
6-4-7 of this Chapter, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not
enter the roadway.
   D.   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than in an intersection, the provisions of this
Section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which, by their
nature, can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.
(1972 Code § 72.025)
6-4-7: PEDESTRIAN-CONTROL SIGNALS:
Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"don't walk", are in place, such signals shall indicate as follows:
   A.   Walk: Pedestrians facing such signals may proceed across the roadway in
the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   B.   Don't Walk: No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the
direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his
crossing on the "walk" signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island
while the "don't walk" signal is showing. (1972 Code § 72.030)
6-4-8: FLASHING SIGNALS:
   A.   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a
traffic sign or signal, it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as
follows:
      1.   Flashing Red (Stop Signal): When a red lens is illuminated with
rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
      2.   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal): When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   B.   This Section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
the rules as set forth in subsection 6-5-4G of this Title. (1972 Code § 72.035)
6-4-9: LANE-DIRECTION-CONTROL SIGNALS:
When lane-direction-control signals are placed over the individual lanes of a
street or highway, vehicular traffic may travel in any lane over which a green
signal is shown, but shall not enter or travel in any lane over which a red
signal is shown. (1972 Code § 72.040)
6-4-10: DISPLAY OF UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS OR MARKINGS:
   A.   No person shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of any
highway an unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device which purports to be or
is an imitation of or resembles an official-control device or railroad sign or
signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or which hides
from view or interferes with the effectiveness of any official traffic-control
device or any railroad sign or signal.
   B.   No person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority permit
upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing thereon any commercial
advertising.
   C.   This Section shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection upon private
property adjacent to highways of signs giving useful directional information
and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official signs.
   D.   Every such prohibited sign, signal or marking is hereby declared to be
a public nuisance and the authority having jurisdiction of the highway is
hereby empowered to remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(1972 Code § 72.045)
6-4-11: INTERFERENCE WITH OFFICIAL SIGNS OR SIGNALS:
No person shall, without lawful authority, attempt to or in fact alter, deface,
injure, knock down or remove any official traffic- control device or any
railroad sign or signal or any inscription, shield or insignia thereon, or any
part thereof. (1972 Code § 72.050)
6-4-12: DESIGNATE CROSSWALKS AND ESTABLISH SAFETY ZONES:
The Chief of Police is authorized:
   A.   To designate and maintain, by appropriate devices, marks or lines upon
the surface of the roadway, crosswalks at intersections where, in his opinion,
there is particular danger to pedestrians crossing the roadway, and at such
other places as he may deem necessary;
   B.   To establish safety zones of such kind and character and at such places
as he may deem necessary for the protection of pedestrians. (1972 Code §
72.055)
6-4-13: TRAFFIC LANES:
   A.   The Chief of Police is hereby authorized to make traffic lanes upon the
roadway of any street or highway where a regular alignment of traffic is
necessary.
   B.   Where such traffic lanes have been marked, it shall be unlawful for the
operator of any vehicle to fail or refuse to keep such vehicle within the
boundaries of any such lane, except when lawfully passing another vehicle or
preparatory to making a lawful turning movement. (1972 Code § 72.060)
6-4-14: SCHOOL CROSSING SIGNALS:
   A.   Definition Of Signals: A school crossing signal is defined as a
permanently mounted, electrically-operated, signal device equipped with two-
way, two (2) color (red and yellow) signal heads, together with a diamond
shaped, single-faced sign reading, "school crossing", by which, at pre-
determined times and when actuated by push-button, traffic is directed to stop
so as to permit school children to cross the street or highway safely. (1972
Code § 78.001)
   B.   Locations: School crossing signals shall be erected and maintained at
the locations described in schedule V, which may be found on file in the office
of the City Clerk. If such locations are under the jurisdiction of the State of
Illinois, Department of Public Works and Buildings, the erection of such
signals shall be subject to the approval of said Department. (1972 Code §
78.005)
   C.   Operation: Whenever the red lens of a school crossing signal is
illuminated by rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop
before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line
when marked, or if none, then before entering the intersection, and pedestrians
within or entering the crosswalk at either edge of the roadway shall have the
right of way over vehicles so stopped. Drivers of vehicles having so yielded
the right of way to pedestrians entering or within the nearest crosswalk at an
intersection may proceed but shall also yield the right of way to pedestrians
within any other crosswalk at the intersection. If, in the event a school
crossing signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this Section also shall be applicable, except
as to provisions which, by their nature, can have no application. (1972 Code §
78.010)
   D.   Penalty: Any driver of a vehicle who fails to stop and yield the right
of way as above provided shall be punished by a fine of not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00). (1972 Code § 78.999; amd. 1986 Code)

forty inches (40") apart extending across the full width of the vehicle.
   CITY: The city of Batavia.
   COMMERCIAL VEHICLE: Any vehicle operated for the transportation of persons
or property in the furtherance of any commercial or industrial enterprise, for

   GROSS VEHICLE WEIGHT RATING (GVWR): The value specified by the manufacturer
or manufacturers as the maximum loaded weight of a single vehicle. The GVWR of
a combination of vehicles (commonly referred to as the "gross combination
weight rating" or GCWR) is the GVWR of the power unit plus the GVWR of the
towed unit or units. In the absence of a value specified by the manufacturer,
GCWR is determined by adding the GVWR of the power unit and the total weight of
the towed unit and any load on the unit.
   GROSS WEIGHT: The weight of a vehicle (whether operated singly or in a
combination) without load, plus the weight of the load thereon.
   HIGHWAY: The entire width between the boundary lines of every way publicly
maintained when any part thereof is open to the use of the public for purposes
of vehicular travel.

   MOTOR VEHICLE: Every vehicle which is self-propelled and every vehicle which
is propelled by electric power obtained from overhead trolley wires, but not
operated upon rails, except for vehicles moved solely by human power and
motorized wheelchairs. For this act, motor vehicles are divided into two (2)
divisions:
      1.   First Division: Those motor vehicles which are designed for the
carrying of not more than ten (10) persons.
      2.   Second Division: Those motor vehicles which are designed for
carrying more than ten (10) persons; those motor vehicles designed or used for
living quarters; those motor vehicles which are designed for pulling or
carrying freight, cargo or implements of husbandry; and those motor vehicles of
the first division remodeled for use and used as motor vehicles of the second
division.
   PERMIT ROUTE: The route authorized by the issuing authority with proper
jurisdiction over the roadway(s) for which permission has been granted to move
a vehicle or combination of vehicles that is in itself indivisible or carrying
an indivisible load that exceeds normal dimensions or weight or a combination
thereof.
   SEMITRAILER: Every vehicle without motive power, other than a pole trailer,
designed for carrying persons or property and for being drawn by a motor
vehicle and so constructed that some part of its weight and that of its load
rests upon or is carried by another vehicle.
   TANDEM AXLES: Any two (2) or more single axles whose centers are more than
forty inches (40") and not more than ninety six inches (96") apart, measured to
the nearest inch between extreme axles in the series, except as provided in 625

motor vehicle and so constructed that no part of its weight rests upon the
towing vehicle.

other vehicles and not so constructed as to carry a load other than a part of
the weight of the vehicle and load so drawn.
   B.   Overweight And/Or Overdimension Vehicles:
      1.   It shall be unlawful for any person to be in control of, to drive,
to park, or move on, upon or across or for the owner to cause or knowingly
permit to be parked, driven or moved upon or across, any street or highway

exceeding the size and weight limitations stated in the 625 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/15-102 (width), 5/15-103 (height), 5/15-107 (length), and 5/15-111
(weight).
      2.   Size and weight limitations while operating on city streets shall
not apply to fire apparatus or equipment for snow or ice removal operations
owned or operated by or for any governmental body or to implements of husbandry
temporarily operated or towed in a combination in the furtherance of a farm or
agricultural endeavor and to any vehicle or combination of vehicles operating
under the terms of a valid oversize and/or dimension permit issued by the city
under the authority of subsection C of this section.
      3.   Where lower size and weight limits or other restrictions are imposed
by ordinance under authority of 625 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/15-111, 5/15-

posted, it shall be unlawful to operate any vehicle or combination of vehicles
in excess of such size or weight limitations or in violation of such
restrictions.
      4.   Whenever any vehicle or combination of vehicles is operated in
violation of this subsection B, the owner and/or driver of such vehicle shall

following information in the special permit application:
         a.   The name and address of the owner or lessee of the vehicle.
         b.   Applicant's name.
         c.   Type of permit request, whether it be for a single trip, round
trip or multiple routing.
         d.   The description and registration (or the Illinois department of
transportation's (IDT) registration number or classification) of the power
unit.
         e.   Description of the object or vehicle to be moved.

      3.   For purposes of this subsection C, the following definitions apply:
   MULTIPLE MOVES: Those in such close proximity to each other (in distance or
in time) that the police department would consider incorporating two (2) or
more permit moves within one permit application. Multiple move permits when
granted by the police department shall be for a period of time not to exceed
ninety (90) days from the date of issuance.
   ONE-WAY OR SINGLE TRIP MOVEMENT: One move from the point of origin to the

calendar days, round trip routing valid for fourteen (14) calendar days and
multiple routings valid for a base period of three (3) months. Permits may be
issued for a maximum of four (4) consecutive permit periods (365 days) with the
permit fee calculated in the appropriate multiples of the base three (3) month
multiple trip permit. Permits are valid only for the date periods specified on
the permit and for the specific vehicle, load and routing as established by the
chief of police or designee. No substitution of vehicle, load or routing is
permitted without expressed written permission by chief of police or his or her
designee and the permit must be carried in the vehicle to which the permit

notice to the City. The Permittee shall deliver to City’s risk manager
duplicate copies of all insurance policies required hereunder and proof of full
payment thereof on or before the effective date of the Parklet/Pedlet revocable
license. From time to time, the Permittee shall procure and pay for renewals of
insurance required herein before it expires. The Permittee shall deliver to the
Department the renewal policy at least twenty (20) days before the existing
policy expires.
   D.   In any case where the original policy of any such insurance shall be
delivered to the Permittee, a duplicate original of such policy shall thereupon

and maintain any such insurance coverage and pay premiums therefor, with the
ultimate cost and expense thereof to be the responsibility of Permittee.
   F.   The obligation of collection upon the insurance policies furnished and
provided for by the Permittee or obtained by the City by reasons of the failure
of the Permittee to obtain them, shall be upon the Permittee, but the City
shall cooperate in such collection (but without expense to the City in such
reasonable degree as may be requested by the Permittee).
   G.   The City does not in any way represent that the types and amounts of
insurance required hereunder are sufficient or adequate to protect the
Permittee’s or contractor’s interests or liabilities but are merely minimum
requirements established by the City’s risk management division. The City
reserves the right to require any other insurance coverages that City deems
necessary depending upon the risk of loss and exposure to liability. (Ord. 21-

   A.   Enumerated: The following are hereby declared "public nuisances" under
this chapter:
      1.   Any tree, shrub, other plant, or portion thereof, whether located on
city or private property, which by reason of location or condition constitutes
a reasonable likelihood of danger to the health, safety, or welfare of the
general public, including those that obstruct the free passage of pedestrian or
vehicular traffic on streets or sidewalks or paths and trails, or which
unreasonably obstructs the view of any regulatory or traffic oriented public
sign on city property.
      2.   Any tree, shrub, other plant, or portion thereof, whether located on
city or private property, which by reason of location or condition constitutes
imminent danger to the health, safety, or welfare of the general public,
including those that obstruct the free passage of pedestrian or vehicular
traffic on streets or sidewalks or paths and trails, or which unreasonably
obstructs the view of any regulatory or traffic oriented public sign on city
property.
   B.   Right To Inspect: The officers, agents, servants and employees of the
city have the authority to enter onto private property following a reasonable
attempt to give notice to the property owner in the event there is located a
tree, shrub, plant or portion thereof which is reasonably suspected to be a
public nuisance. If entry to the property is refused, but there is reason to
believe that the suspected nuisance poses imminent danger to city property or
people thereon, officers, agents, servants and employees of the city may enter
on the property to inspect, but only to the extent necessary to confirm whether
imminent danger exists.
   C.   Abatement: The following are the prescribed means of abating public
nuisances under this chapter:
      1.   Any public nuisance under this chapter which is located on privately
owned property shall be pruned, removed, or otherwise treated by the property
owner or his/her agent in whatever fashion is required to cause the abatement
of the nuisance. Except as provided below, no property owner may be found
guilty of violating this provision unless and until the following requirements
of notice have been satisfied:
         a.   The city shall cause a written notice to be personally served or
sent by certified mail to the person to whom was sent the tax bill for the
general taxes for the last preceding year, or an adult resident or operator of
the premises;
         b.   Such notice shall describe the kind of tree, shrub, or other
plant or plant part, which has been declared to be a public nuisance; its
location on the property; the reason for declaring it a nuisance;
         c.   Such notice shall describe the premises by legal description or
by common description;
         d.   Such notice shall state the actions that the property owner or
occupant may undertake to abate the nuisance;
         e.   Such notice shall require the elimination of the nuisance within
thirty (30) days of the date of service of the notice, or such shorter period
of time as is deemed necessary for public safety and welfare by the city;
         f.   Such notice shall state that, if the nuisance is not adequately
and properly abated as required in the notice, the city shall enter on the
property, abate the nuisance, and the owner shall be liable for the costs of
the city to abate the nuisance. It shall also contain the right to appeal
described in section
7-2-8 of this chapter.
      2.   In instances in which it is determined that an imminent danger
exists that poses an immediate threat to the safety of the public such that
thirty (30) days to abate the nuisance would pose an unreasonable risk to the
public, the notice shall state, in addition to what is required above, such
shorter time period in which the nuisance must be abated to eliminate the
immediate risk to the public, and the right to appeal the determination of
imminent danger, which may be after the required abatement, in which case the
appeal shall only address the issue of imminent danger and whether the owner
shall be responsible for the cost of abatement if the abatement is undertaken
by the city.
   D.   Removal And Expense:
      1.   In the event any person owning the land upon which such a nuisance
described in subsection A1 of this section exists refuses to cure the condition
within the time frame contained in the notice after given, and no appeal is
sought in writing, then the city, its agents or contractors, may take any steps
necessary to remove the tree, or otherwise take those actions necessary to
abate the nuisance and such removal or abatement shall be at the expense of the
property owner.
      2.   In the event any person owning the land upon which such a nuisance
described in subsection A2 of this section exists refuses to cure the condition
after notice, or the city is unable to successfully give reasonable notice,
then the city, its agents or contractors, may take any steps necessary to
remove the tree, or otherwise take only those actions necessary to abate the
imminent danger, unless further authorized by the property owner. Such removal
or abatement shall be at the expense of the property owner.
   E.   Lien For Unpaid Charges: In the event that any tree removal or nuisance
abatement expense incurred by the city remains unpaid for more than ten (10)
days after said service is performed by the city, said unpaid charge shall
constitute a lien upon the real estate, and the city is hereby authorized, in
accordance with law, to file notice of lien in the office of the recorder of
deeds or registrar of titles of Kane and DuPage Counties and to foreclose this
lien against the property in a civil action to recover the money due and such
costs and expenses and fees as allowed by statute. Any such judgment shall be
enforced in accordance with law. Upon payment of all costs, expenses, charges
and penalties, the lien created under this subsection shall be released by the
city, which release shall be filed of record in the same manner as filing
notice of the lien, pursuant to law, the expense of said filing to be paid by
the violator aforesaid. (Ord. 13-22, 6-3-2013)
7-2-6: INTERFERENCE WITH FORESTRY OPERATIONS OR NUISANCE ABATEMENT:

comply with any notice issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, upon
being found guilty of violation, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each separate offense, each day during
which any violation of the provisions of this chapter shall occur or continue
shall be a separate offense.
   B.   If, as the result of the violation of any provision of this chapter,
the injury, mutilation, or death of a tree, shrub, or other plant located on
city property is caused, the cost of repair or replacement of such tree, shrub,
or other plant shall be borne by the party in violation. The replacement value
of trees and shrubs shall be determined in accordance with the latest revision
of "A Guide To The Professional Evaluation Of Landscape Trees, Specimen Shrubs,
And Evergreens", as published by the International Society Of Arboriculture and
shall take into account, but not be limited by, the expenses associated with
removal and planting, and time and maintenance necessary for a replacement tree
to reach parity with the damaged tree. (Ord. 13-22, 6-3-2013)
7-2-8: APPEAL:
Review of any decision rendered by the city relating to the subject matter of
this chapter, other than an issue determined by administrative adjudication
under this code or court order may be had when requested in writing by a person
claiming to have been aggrieved by such a decision. The appeal must be filed
with the city within thirty (30) days from the date of the decision. This
review may include interpretation and/or enforcement of the arboricultural
specifications manual, the city of Batavia urban forestry plan, a decision that
a public nuisance (other than one posing imminent danger) does or does not
exist, or other matters. A decision of imminent danger may be appealed only for
the purpose of determining whether the city should seek reimbursement for any
costs expended to abate such imminent danger. Such a review shall be conducted
by the city services committee if requested. The determination of the city
services committee shall be final, unless the issue involves expenditure by a
property owner or possessor in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) in
which case the issue may be appealed to the city council, if requested. Nothing
in this section shall be construed to limit the jurisdiction of any court of
law with regard to such disputes. (Ord. 13-22, 6-3-2013)

varieties and cultivars acceptable for planting on City rights-of-way or City
owned property. The trees are listed by their height and their respective table
includes their botanical name, common name, cultivars, growth rate, form and
suggested conditions/remarks. The size of tree to be planted will depend on the
width of the planting strip and available growing height.

damage to the trunk, crown and root system. Planting stock shall be handled by
the root ball and is not to be dragged, thrown or dropped off an elevated
platform.
      2.   Root balls of planting stock shall be monitored to prevent drying
out. They should be kept moist and watered if needed. If they are not to be
planted immediately root balls should be covered with mulch and kept moist.
      3.   Plants shall be secured during transit. The crowns of planting stock
shall be covered when transporting over extended distances or at high speeds to
prevent wind desiccation. (Ord. 08-11, 8-4-2008)
7-2A-6: PLANTING SPECIFICATIONS:
   A.   Site Criteria; Planting Of Trees:
      1.   Visibility.
      2.   Utility location.
      3.   Probability of long term survival.
      4.   Likelihood of private participation and financing.
      5.   Overall benefit to the community.
   B.   Development:
      1.   City Projects: The development or redevelopment of a site owned by
the city shall be subject to the planting standards of this article. City
projects include, but are not limited to: parks, streets, medians, substations,
treatment plants, plazas, and city buildings. These projects shall allow for
the appropriate amount of street tree plantings. All street tree aspects of the
plan shall be approved by the public works department.
      2.   Private Projects: Parkways or public thoroughfares within areas that
are developed or redeveloped by a privately funded individual, partnership or
entity shall be planted with the appropriate amount and composition of street
trees. The street tree plantings will be the financial responsibility of the
individual, partnership or entity responsible for the project. The street trees
shall be planted in the city owned parkways according to the standards of this
article. Special consideration should be given to plant lists, location and
spacing and planting standards. All street tree aspects of development or
redevelopment plans shall be approved by the public works department.
   C.   Location And Spacing:
      1.   Parkway Width: The minimum width of a parkway shall not be less than
four feet (4') between sidewalk and curb. Where the width is less than four
feet (4'), the tree shall be planted beyond the sidewalk toward private
property, if the city has right of way.
      2.   Visibility Triangle: No tree shall be planted on the parkway or in
any public thoroughfare at a distance less than that specified by the
visibility triangle formula or thirty five feet (35'), whichever distance is
determined appropriate by the city engineer, from the point of intersection of
any given street lines within the city.
      3.   Driveways; Alleys: Trees shall be planted at least ten feet (10')
(or less with written approval from the public works department) from driveways
and alleys.
      4.   Utility Poles, Lampposts, Etc.: Medium to large trees shall not be
planted closer than fifteen feet (15') from all utility poles, to allow for
line maintenance, and lampposts, for proper lighting. Small trees shall not be
planted closer than ten feet (10') from any utility poles or lampposts. All
trees shall be planted a minimum of ten feet (10') from all fire hydrants. Any
trees planted near water lines, sewer lines and utility manholes require
written approval of the public works department.
      5.   Road Signs: Trees planted near any road sign shall be placed in a
manner not to obstruct the visibility of any part of the sign at time of
planting or in the future. In the event that a sign will be moved to
accommodate a tree, the sign shall be moved before the time of planting.
      6.   Structures: No tree shall be planted within fifteen feet (15') of
any building or permanent structure except with approval of the public works
department.
      7.   Overhead Wires: When overhead wires are present above planting
strips only small trees shall be planted. Exceptions may be made by the public
works department if the wires overhead are either transmission or main
distribution lines that are at a height that will allow the planting of a
medium sized tree.
      8.   Spacing Of Trees:
         a.   Spacing of trees shall be determined by the public works
department according to the local conditions and characteristics of the tree to
be planted. General specifications are as follows:
 
Tree Size   Center To Center Span
Large tree   40 feet
Medium tree  30 feet
Small tree   20 feet
 
         b.   On streets that are unpaved, have no sidewalks or are without
curbs, the spacing and location of the planting sites will be determined by the
public works department.
   D.   Tree Standards:
      1.   No tree pit will be dug unless the location is marked by the public
works department or appropriate city official.
      2.   Pits for the planting of street trees shall be two (2) to three (3)
times the width of the root ball. The sides should slope gradually. The pit
should be saucer shaped or bowl shaped. The center of the hole should be firm
to help stabilize the tree. The tree should be planted slightly higher than it
was originally grown to allow for settlement. In poorly drained soil, the root
should be elevated in relation to the surrounding grade.
      3.   In soils that have a high clay content the soils should be amended
with twenty five percent (25%) organic matter. If stones or construction debris
are found they shall be removed and additional soil added.
      4.   Around the base of all newly planted trees a small berm of soil
slightly larger than the root ball shall be constructed. Mulch (wood chips)
should also be added within the berm. The mulch should be two (2) to four
inches (4") deep and shall not be against the base of the tree. Mulch rings
around trees shall be a minimum of four feet (4') across. Too much mulch or
volcano mulching is harmful to the health of the tree and shall be a violation
of this code.
      5.   Any nonbiodegradable wire, string or other material supporting the
root ball shall be removed, taking special note of the twine wrapped around the
base of the tree, and burlap laid back from the tree trunk before backfilling.
      6.   Backfilling shall be done in a way to minimize air pockets. (Ord.
08-11, 8-4-2008)
7-2A-7: EARLY MAINTENANCE:
   A.   Establishment: Newly planted trees need special attention to ensure
they become established. The first few years are a critical time in the life of
a tree as mortality rates can be excessively high. All maintenance practices
shall follow approved arboricultural practices.
   B.   Watering: Promptly after planting, the sod surrounding the tree should
be thoroughly saturated. A second watering to completely saturate the sod
should be done ten (10) to fourteen (14) days after planting. Additional
watering should not be necessary unless drought conditions occur.
   C.   Fertilization: Fertilization of newly planted trees is recommended only
after checking with a tree expert or arborist. The use of a high phosphorus
starting fertilizer is recommended in such a situation.
   D.   Inspection: Periodic inspections of newly planted trees for pests and
diseases should be done to ensure the continued health of the tree.
   E.   Pruning: The pruning of newly planted trees is not recommended, except
for the removal of dead or broken branches. Water sprouts should be removed
when they reach the diameter of a pencil. (Ord. 08-11, 8-4-2008)
7-2A-8: GENERAL MAINTENANCE:
   A.   Pruning:
      1.   All pruning of city trees shall conform to National Arborist
Association standards. Pruning should be done to promote general health and
vigor of the tree.
      2.   All trees shall be maintained as not to endanger, interfere or
conflict with public safety.
      3.   Under no circumstances shall a city owned tree be "topped" except
under special circumstances to be determined by the public works department.
"Topping" is the practice of severely pruning a tree, disregarding nodes and
crotches, to drastically reduce the height of a tree.
      4.   All medium to large trees shall be pruned, to allow vehicular and
pedestrian traffic unobstructed passage, to a height no less than eight feet
(8') above sidewalks and sixteen feet (16') above streets.
      5.   All cuts shall be made with a saw or pruner and only at nodes or
crotches with the method known as drop crotch pruning. Cuts shall be made
without cutting into the branch collar. All cuts shall be made at a forty five
degree (45°) angle from the branch bark ridge. Branches too large to be
supported by one hand shall be precut for safety and to avoid the splitting or
tearing of the bark. Large limbs shall be lowered safely in a controlled manner
with ropes and other equipment. No stubs or "dog ears" shall be left.
      6.   Spurs or climbing irons shall not be used for pruning trees.
      7.   Pruning of any type of parkway trees shall only be allowed from
November through April. Between May through October, pruning parkway trees is
allowed only in emergency situations or if a hazardous condition exists, or as
directed by the superintendent of streets.
      8.   After working on a diseased tree, all pruning equipment must be
disinfected before working on another tree.
      9.   Upon the completion of work performed on city trees, all branches,
twigs, leaves, chips and larger portions of the tree shall be promptly removed
and properly disposed of by those performing the work.
   B.   Spraying: No spraying of any city tree will be allowed without prior
approval of the public works department.
      1.   Precautions shall be undertaken to inform, warn and protect the
public before spray applications of pesticides and other potentially hazardous
chemicals begin. Local conditions such as wind and temperature shall be taken
into account before spraying. Drift potential shall be examined in relation to
the proximity to playgrounds, schools and high traffic density areas before any
spraying is performed.
      2.   Spraying shall only be performed by certified commercial pesticide
applicators and in accordance with accepted arboricultural standards and all
state and federal laws governing such work. The applicator shall have read and
understood label information of the chemicals being used.
      3.   Spraying shall only be done for specific insects or diseases with
the proper equipment, in the necessary strength, and applied at the proper time
to ensure control.
      4.   Dormant oils shall only be applied to specific species. They shall
only be applied when the air temperature will be above forty degrees (40°) for
a period of at least twenty four (24) hours after spraying.
      5.   All spray equipment should be kept clean and in good working order.
Spray machines should give uniform coverage. Tanks and other equipment shall be
washed out and drained in approved drainage areas.
      6.   Ineffectual control, damage, injury or death to plants, animals or
persons resulting from the use of spray materials exceeding the limitations of
the manufacturer's guarantee shall be considered the responsibility of the
licensed operator.
   C.   Fertilization: The fertilization of city trees shall be in accordance
with accepted arboricultural standards. Methods of applications for fertilizers
shall be determined by the public works department.
   D.   Cavities: The treatment of cavities shall be in accordance with
accepted arboricultural standards. The method for treatment of cavities shall
be determined by the city arborist.
   E.   Cabling And Bracing To Be Determined By The Public Works Department:
      1.   Cabling and bracing methods shall be in accordance with the National
Arborist Association or accepted arboricultural standards.
      2.   Cables should generally be placed two-thirds (2/3) the distance
between the crotch and branch ends. Rust resistant cables with a minimum of
common grade seven (7) strand cable shall be used. A thimble shall be used at
the end of the cable. The cable ends shall be spliced or properly wrapped. Lag
hooks or eyebolts with a washer and bolt shall be used to anchor the cable.
Under no circumstances is a cable to be wrapped around a branch.
      3.   Bracing is not to be used as a substitute for cabling but rather in
conjunction with cables. When using braces they shall be made of rust resistant
steel rods. All washers and bolts used with braces shall also be made of rust
resistant steel. (Ord. 08-11, 8-4-2008)
7-2A-9: TREE PROTECTION:
   A.   Protection Or Removal: In the circumstances where construction and
utility operations underground will affect the health of a tree, a
determination will be made considering the overall value of the tree. The
criteria for determining a value for a tree will be based on species, age,
condition, cost of preserving the tree, and urgency of work to be completed. A
decision based on this value will be made concerning the protection or removal
of the tree in question. This decision shall be made jointly by the public
works department and the city engineer or the appropriate city official.
   B.   Cutting Roots: Large roots shall be cut with the proper pruning
equipment. Clean, flush, smooth cuts shall be made on tree roots.
   C.   Open Work Pits: Work pits that need to be open for an extended time
require special protection methods for trees. The roots shall be cut closer to
the tree in relation to the construction zone. A temporary wall shall be put up
between the tree and construction zone. The area between the root zone and the
construction zone should then be backfilled and kept moist. Work pits should
not stay open any longer than necessary.
   D.   Construction Zones:
      1.   Trees to be protected in construction zones and the dimensions of
those zones shall be determined by the public works department and the city
engineer or appropriate city official.
      2.   Clearly mark the "root protection zone" before construction begins.
Snow fencing is often used for this purpose. Absolutely no activity or traffic
can be tolerated within the "root protection zones" during construction.
      3.   Mulch the "root protection zones" with wood chips generated from
tree removals. Mulch helps insulate the rooting environment from changes
imposed by opening the forest canopy.
      4.   Prune the crown to compensate for stress. Reducing the number of
leaves and branches will counterbalance the changes imposed on the root
environment. All trees must be pruned by a qualified arborist who can remove
the dead wood and selectively thin the live branches without disfiguring the
tree. Regular pruning may be required every three (3) to five (5) years.
      5.   Watering during dry periods is important, both during and after
construction. Shallow tree roots are very subject to drought stress. Mulch will
help reduce evaporation, but watering will be required during periods of scarce
rainfall. Water the entire root zone slowly so that the top eight (8) to twelve
inches (12") is thoroughly wet.
      6.   Fertilization of mature trees is not usually recommended as long as
growth is adequate and nutrient deficiencies are not evident. Mulch recycles
nutrients naturally. Heavy fertilization may stimulate excessive growth in the
top and could counteract pruning intended to reduce the crown size.
   E.   Utility Operations:
      1.   Any underground utility installations or operations that come in
conflict with city street tree roots are subject to the review and approval of
the public works department.
      2.   If the determination to tunnel under a tree for underground utility
installations or operations is made, the depth and distance shall be provided
by the public works department. Under no circumstances is the tunnel to be less
than two feet (2') in depth.
         a.   Recommendations for trenching and tunneling for utility
operations:
 
Tree Diameter  Distance Of Tunnel From Center Of  Minimum Depth Of  Tunnel Or
                Tree                               Trench
                
5–9 inches   6 feet                             21/2 feet
10–14 inches 10 feet                            3 feet
15–19 inches 12 feet                            31/2 feet
20 + inches    15 feet                            4 feet
 
(Ord. 08-11, 8-4-2008)
7-2A-10: TREE REMOVAL:
   A.   Determination And Criteria: Determination for removal of a tree will be
made by the public works department according to the following criteria. A tree
must meet one or more of these criteria to be considered for removal: (Ord. 08-
11, 8-4-2008)
      1.   A tree that is infected with an epidemic disease or insect where
control is not possible. Removal is the recommended practice to prevent
transmission. (Ord. 08-11, 8-4-2008; amd. Ord. 13-22, 6-3-2013)
      2.   A tree that poses an extreme public nuisance due to its species,
size, location or condition. Conditions that could be a public nuisance range
from the harboring of insects to excessive twig or limb breakage.
      3.   A tree that poses a severe safety hazard that cannot be corrected by
pruning, transplanting, or other treatments.
      4.   A tree that interferes with the growth of a more desirable tree(s).
      5.   A tree that has a negative aesthetic value.
      6.   Work improvements or installations will kill or render a tree a
public hazard.
      7.   Preservation of a tree is not cost effective.
      8.   A tree which is a recurring problem due to root interference with
water mains, sewer mains, water service lines, and sewer service lines.
   B.   Standards: All work performed in the removal of a tree shall be in
accordance with the National Arborist Association and ANSI Z133.1 standards.
   C.   Stumps: All stumps on city property shall be removed to a depth of at
least eight inches (8") and all holes remaining shall be filled in with soil
and planted with sod or seed.
   D.   Disease Prevention: Certain precautions must be taken when removing a
diseased tree to ensure the disease is not continuing to be transmitted after
the tree is taken down. These precautions, if any, shall be determined by the
public works department. After working on a diseased tree, all saws and other
cutting equipment must be disinfected before working on another tree.
   E.   Debris Removal: Upon the completion of work performed on city trees,
all branches, twigs, leaves, chips and larger portions of the tree shall be
promptly removed and properly disposed of by those performing the work. (Ord.
08-11, 8-4-2008)
7-2A-11: AMENDMENTS:
This article may be modified, amended, or extended at any time that experience,
new research or laws indicate improved methods or whenever circumstances make
it advisable. The amendments shall be made with the advice, assistance and
approval of the tree commission. All amendments to this article shall be
approved by the city council. (Ord. 08-11, 8-4-2008)

cremains only. Deceased pets, valuables, flowers, mementoes, etc. will not be
allowed in a niche or ossuary.
      3.   Niche and Ossuary openings can only be performed by Cemetery
employees.
      4.   The Cemetery Authority will be responsible, in general, for repairs
to the columbarium. The City of Batavia will take all reasonable care to ensure
the safety of interred cremains. However, the City will not be held responsible
for the loss or destruction of interred cremains due to vandalism, acts of
nature, leaving the cremains in a temporary urn, or any unforeseen
circumstances.
   B.   Columbarium Niches:

of each columbarium. The Cemetery will allow one cremains urn per single niche
if the total dimensions of the urn does not exceed the size of the niche.
      2.   Double niches-A columbarium may provide for double niches, and the
size of this space is inherent to what that columbarium allows. The Cemetery
will allow up to two cremains urns per double niche if the total dimensions of
both urns does not exceed the size of the niche. It is recommended to purchase
both urns at the same time to ensure a proper fit. If the niche is to be used
by one, double cremains urn, the urn cannot exceed the size of the niche.
      3.   For either size niche, leaving the cremains in the urn sent by the
crematorium is allowed if it meets the above size requirements. A standard

scattering garden where cremains are scattered on the ground. A tribute cover
allows for a memorial with the names of the deceased engraved. An ossuary
provides families with a dignified, secure, visible memorial that is
environmentally friendly, permanently, and easily accessible and economically
affordable.
   D.   Niche and Ossuary Purchases:

right of internment.
      3.   To maintain the columbarium in a uniform manner, The Cemetery
Authority will regulate the font pattern that is allowed for engraving on all
niche covers, including the ossuary memorial cover.
      4.   A Columbarium Memorial Permit must be applied for to do the

authorized by the Cemetery. If a niche cover, which covers two niches, is
damaged to the point of needing replacement, the cemetery will replace the
cover only. The cost of re-engraving the cover will be the responsibility of
the (two) niche owners or the families.
   I.   Removal of the Interred Cremains:

   A.   Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on city rights of way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights of way.
   B.   Duration: No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   C.   Preconstruction Meeting Required: No construction shall begin pursuant
to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and
all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the
permit at a preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting shall be held
at a date, time and place designated by the city with such city representatives
in attendance as the city deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose
of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations
necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation,
presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their
locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights of
way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent
property owners.

material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within sixty (60) days
after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with section
7-4-21 of this chapter. If the city denies the request for a variance, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right of way or modify the
facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.

subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors
shall comply with this section.
   B.   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may
be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or
umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy

legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance

deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the city and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. (Ord. 07-82, 10-15-2007)
7-4-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the city must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Provide a location convenient to the city and within the state of
Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the city engineer, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the city estimates are likely to be incurred if the
permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the city, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities
in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in
another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of
restoration in the previous phase or phases, the city engineer may, in the
exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of
security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the
permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal
to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of
this subsection for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The city, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the
fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee;
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund;
or
      5.   Fails to properly complete the site restoration work as required by
the permit specifications.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund,
the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the city with respect to the
security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved
by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or
exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other
right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city shall not be
entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which
may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 07-82, 10-15-2007)

The city may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time periods
provided in this subsection C.
   D.   Stop Work Order: In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the city may issue a stop work order immediately upon discovery
of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within subsection A of this
section.
   E.   Failure Or Refusal Of The Permittee To Comply: If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of subsection C of this section, the city or its
designee may, at the option of the city: 1) correct the deficiencies; 2) upon
not less than twenty (20) days' notice to the permittee, remove the subject
facilities or equipment; or 3) after not less than thirty (30) days' notice to
the permittee of failure to cure the noncompliance, deem them abandoned and
property of the city. The permittee shall be liable in all events to the city
for all costs of removal. (Ord. 07-82, 10-15-2007)

are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or maintenance by the
utility, all to the satisfaction of the city. This includes restoration of
entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using
materials and methods approved by the city engineer. Such cleanup and repair
may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or
any other requirement to restore the right of way to a condition substantially
equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project. The
time period provided in this section may be extended by the city engineer for
good cause shown. (Ord. 07-82, 10-15-2007)
7-4-20: MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE:
   A.   General: Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within rights of way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the city and at the utility's expense.
   B.   Emergency Maintenance Procedures: Emergencies may justify noncompliance
with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
city engineer or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing
him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling
public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature
of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the
city police shall be notified immediately.
      3.   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete
repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the
traveling public.
   C.   Emergency Repairs: The utility must file in writing with the city a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right of way within forty eight
(48) hours after an emergency repair. (Ord. 07-82, 10-15-2007)

a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of
this chapter from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance
should be granted.
   B.   Authority To Grant Variances: The city engineer shall decide whether a
variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: The city engineer may authorize
a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the city engineer may require the utility requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of
this chapter.
   E.   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the city
engineer under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to appeal to
the city council, or such other board or commission as it may designate. The
application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the city clerk within
thirty (30) days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or
determination. The city council shall commence its consideration of the appeal
at the council's next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven (7)
days after the filing of the appeal. The city council shall timely decide the
appeal. (Ord. 07-82, 10-15-2007)
7-4-22: PENALTIES:
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the city will
incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this chapter. Unless
the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the city's costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. 07-82, 10-15-2007)
7-4-23: ENFORCEMENT:
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the city may have for enforcement of this chapter. (Ord.

may cure the deficiencies identified in the notice of denial and resubmit a
revised application once within thirty (30) days after the notice of denial is
sent without payment of an additional application fee. The City shall have
thirty (30) days to approve or deny the resubmitted application or it is deemed
approved, if the applicant has notified the City of its intention to proceed
with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which notification may
be submitted with the resubmitted application. Review of a resubmitted
application is limited to the deficiencies cited in the original notice of
denial. This subsection does not apply if a revised application is not
resubmitted within thirty (30) days, or curing any deficiencies in the original
application requires review of a new location, new or different structure for
collocation, new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the
small wireless facility. In such cases, a new application and application fee
are required.
   K.   Consolidated Applications: Consolidated applications for small wireless
facilities for the collocation of up to twenty five (25) small wireless
facilities shall be allowed if the collocations each involve substantially the
same type of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of
structure. Each consolidated application shall provide all the information
required by this chapter for each small wireless facility at each location. If
such an application includes incomplete information for one or more small
wireless facility collocations, or includes requests for small wireless
facilities that do not qualify for consolidated treatment, or that are
otherwise denied, the City may remove such collocation requests from the
application and treat them as separate requests. Separate permits may be issued
for each collocation approved in a consolidated application.
   L.   Alternate Locations: If an applicant is seeking to install a new
utility pole as part of its application, the City may propose that the small
wireless facility be located on an existing utility pole or existing wireless
support structure within one hundred feet (100') of the proposed collocation.
The applicant shall accept the proposed alternate location so long as it has
the right to use the location on reasonable terms and conditions, unless the
alternate location imposes technical limits or additional material costs as
determined by the applicant. If the applicant refuses an alternate location
based on the foregoing, the applicant shall provide legally competent evidence
in the form of a written certification, under oath, describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons that prevent the alternate
location from being utilized.
   M.   Exemptions: No application, permit approval or fee shall be required
from a communications service provider authorized to occupy the right-of-way

      1.   Routine maintenance not requiring replacement of wireless facilities
if the wireless provider notifies the City in writing at least forty eight (48)
hours prior to the planned maintenance;
      2.   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities that
are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless provider
notifies the City in writing at least ten (10) days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications, including: a) equipment type
and model numbers, for the replacement of equipment consistent with the
equipment specifications information required on a permit application for
original installation; and b) information sufficient to establish that the
replacement is substantially similar. The wireless provider shall provide all
information necessary and requested by the City to establish that the
replacement is substantially similar. The City has the sole right and
responsibility to determine if a proposed small wireless facility is
substantially similar to the existing small wireless facility; or
      3.   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or replacement
of micro wireless facilities that are suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable Safety Codes.
The foregoing shall not exempt communications service providers from City
permitting requirements where traffic patterns are affected or lane closures
are required. (Ord. 18-51, 7-16-2018)
7-6-6: CONSTRUCTION:
Collocations for which permits are approved shall be completed within one
hundred eighty (180) days of issuance of the permit, unless the City agrees to
extend the period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a City utility
pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided that, for collocations that are not on City utility poles, the
applicant has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after the issuance
of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional
time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty (360) days
after issuance of the permit. Permit requests for commercial power for
collocations on City utility poles must be submitted simultaneously with the
application for collocating the small wireless facility. Permits that are not
completed within applicable timelines shall be void absent an extension granted
in writing by the City. (Ord. 18-51, 7-16-2018)
7-6-7: PERMIT DURATION:

on the date the application is submitted, and that is located within three
hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support
structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the City. The City may
designate which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of
the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the
height limitation for such facility; or
      2.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
   C.   Waiver Process: A wireless provider may, at the City's sole discretion,
receive a waiver from the Director of Public Works or his or her designee from
the maximum permitted height of a new pole set forth in this section, if the
wireless provider can establish that:
      1.   Because of a particular unusual condition, a particular hardship or
practical difficulty to the wireless provider would result, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience or a financial hardship, and such hardship or
difficulty has not been created by the wireless provider; and
      2.   Existing utility poles or wireless support structures, or a new
utility pole at the maximum permitted height for a new pole allowed by this
section cannot accommodate the wireless facility at a height necessary to
function effectively, under reasonable terms and conditions; and
      3.   The use of existing utility poles or other wireless support

2018)
7-6-9: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Public Safety Technology: A wireless provider's operation of a small
wireless facility may not interfere with the frequencies used by a public
safety agency for public safety communications. A wireless provider must
install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause
unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications
equipment. Unacceptable interference is determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licenses by a public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such
interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the
interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own
expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary to correct and eliminate the
interference, including, but not limited to, powering down the small wireless
facility and later powering up the small wireless facility for intermittent
testing, if necessary. The City may terminate a permit for a small wireless
facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not making a
good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the
abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety
spectrum established by the FCC, including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973
and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The burden to establish the good faith
effort shall be on the wireless provider, which shall timely deliver to the
City all information necessary to demonstrate its efforts to resolve the
interference consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations sections cited
above. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a
public nuisance and the small wireless facility may be abated through the
procedures for abatement of such nuisances set forth in this Code.
   B.   Restrictions: A wireless provider shall not construct or maintain any
wireless facility that:
      1.   Obstructs, impedes or hinders the usual travel of vehicles or
pedestrians or public safety on a right-of-way;
      2.   Obstructs the legal use of right-of-way by utility users;
      3.   Violates nondiscriminatory applicable codes;
      4.   Violates or conflicts with chapter 4, "Construction Of Utility
Facilities In Rights-Of-Way", of this title or other applicable regulations set
forth in this Code or otherwise adopted by the City, except to the extent such
chapters, sections or regulations may be modified by the provisions of this
chapter; or
      5.   Violates the Federal Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 USC
section 12101 et seq.), the Environmental Barriers Act 1 , the Illinois
Accessibility Code (71 Ill. Admin. Code tit. 71, sec. 400 et seq.), or other
applicable Federal or State laws.

provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements, if any, that
prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles
or equipment in the right-of-way.
      2.   Waiver: A wireless provider may, at the City's sole discretion,
receive a waiver from the Director of Public Works or his or her designee to
allow small wireless facilities to be located above ground in an area where
City ordinances or regulations prohibit or restrict above ground facilities if
the wireless provider can establish that:
         a.   Underground equipment is not technically feasible and there is no
reasonable alternative or location that is more aesthetically favorable to
adjacent property owners and to effective use and management of the right-of-
way; and
         b.   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
is necessary at the proposed location to provide coverage in a specified area;
and
         c.   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
will not disrupt traffic or pedestrian circulation or constitute a safety
hazard; and
         d.   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
will not interfere with public safety uses or frequencies; and
         e.   Space exists within the public right-of-way to accommodate the
above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location; and
         f.   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
will not create a safety hazard; and
         g.   The above ground small wireless facility is located and designed
in such a way so as to minimize its visual impact on adjacent properties; and
         h.   In any historical area, that the above ground small wireless
facility will not detrimentally affect the historical nature of the area.

facility is allowed, such equipment shall be screened around the perimeter in
accordance with a landscape plan sealed by a landscape architect licensed to
practice in the State of Illinois. Plant materials shall comply with this Code.
Landscaping and above ground facilities must meet vision triangle setback
requirements when near street and/or driveway intersections among other
requirements. The owner or wireless provider shall be responsible for
maintenance of all landscaping as provided in the approved landscape plan.
      4.   Future Undergrounding: The City may, from time to time, make a
decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles of a particular type
generally, such as electric utility poles, in all or a significant portion of
the City. In the event that such a utility pole has a collocated small wireless
facility in place at the time of such a decision, the City shall either:
         a.   Continue to maintain the utility pole, or install and maintain a
reasonable utility pole or wireless support structure for the collocation of
the small wireless facility or offer some other reasonable alternative that
allows the wireless provider to maintain service at that location; or
         b.   Offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider at a
reasonable cost, or allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole
so it can maintain service from that location.
   F.   Collocation Limits: Wireless providers shall not collocate small
wireless facilities on City utility poles that are part of an electric
distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone
of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole, including the tops of
electric transmission or distribution poles.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may
be located in the communications space on the City utility pole and on the top
of the pole (other than on the top of electric transmission or distribution
poles), if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with
NESC and all other applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subsection, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the NESC.
   G.   Code Compliance: Wireless providers shall comply with all applicable
codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.

follows:
         a.   Flow of energy delivered by the City to the customer, and flow of
energy delivered from the customer to the City shall be recorded by the
bidirectional meter.
         b.   Customer shall be billed monthly for all energy delivered by the
City, as recorded at the meter, at the appropriate unit rate based on the rate
classification under which the customer takes electric service from the City
including all taxes, fees and other charges that are applicable to the
customer’s rate classification.
         c.   Customer shall be credited monthly for all energy delivered to
the City, as measured at the meter. The value of energy delivered from the
customer shall be the lesser of 1) the appropriate unit rate based on the rate
classification under which the customer takes electric service from the City OR
2) a wholesale unit rate calculated by summing the prior- year average annual
locational marginal energy unit price, the prior-year average annual unit price
of capacity and the prior-year average annual unit cost of network
transmission, congestion and losses, all as reported at the BATAVIA Hub within
the PJM Regional Transmission Organization. All calculations shall be updated
annually by the City and applied to bills issued after August 1 of each year.
         d.   If, on August 1 of each year, the total connected capacity of all
customer-owned renewable generation facilities is less than twenty percent
(20%) of the City’s electric system peak from the prior calendar year, then a
Net Billing Transition Factor shall be added to the wholesale unit rate
credited to the customer in accordance with the following schedule:
            (1)   For bills issued after August 1, 2022 = $ 0. 045/kWh.
            (2)   For bills issued after August 1, 2023 = $ 0. 030/kWh.
            (3)   For bills issued after August 1, 2024 = $ 0. 015/kWh.
            (4)   For bills issued after August 1, 2025 = $ 0. 000/kWh.
      If the total connected capacity of all customer- owned renewable
generation facilities exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the City’s electric
system peak from the prior calendar year, then no Net Billing Transition Factor
shall be applied.

8-1B-4: EXTENSIONS:
If an extension of the utility' s system becomes necessary in order to service
a new development, redevelopment or upgrade an existing electric service, the
utility shall design, construct and furnish the necessary electrical
distribution facilities to provide electrical service. The developer or
customers shall pay the city the estimated cost of such extension as a
condition of final plat recordation, or building permit issuance. Upon
completion of the utility extension, as-built costs shall be calculated by the
city and provided to the developer or customers and any adjustments, if
necessary, shall be paid by the developer or customers or reimbursed by the
city. If prior to construction, and based on the following considerations, the
extension is deemed to be in the best interest of the utility and city, then
the utility and city may elect to enter into a formal written reimbursement
agreement with the developer or customers to codify cost sharing for the
extension work. Any potential cost sharing shall be administered as a
reimbursement after construction has been completed. Considerations in the
formation of a written agreement which changes the responsibility for extension
costs may include, but are not limited to:
   A.   The probability that additional developments or customers will utilize
such extension, based upon the city's corporate limits and the amount of
undeveloped property, if any, near the extension;
   B.   The extent to which the extension, at the utility's request, is larger
than reasonably necessary to serve the development;
   C.   The extent to which other modifications to the utility system are
required elsewhere;
   D.   Economic development considerations which could result in arrangements
for lessened or structured payments over time of such costs, including, but not
limited to:
      1.   The extent to which a new customer's power requirements, or a
current customer's increase in power requirements, allows the utility to
effectuate calculable savings by purchasing power in a different manner;
      2.   The size and duration of the increase in power requirements;
      3.   The extent to which a new customer provides financial assurance for
either the purchase of an amount of power and/or system improvements necessary
for the customer; and
      4.   The extent to which any modifications to the system for a new
customer can be used by others in the event the new customer leaves, or
substantially decreases its power requirements. (Ord. 89-29, 7-17-1989; amd.

Monthly volume charge per 100 cubic feet $6.00
 
   2.   Sewer Meters: The monthly sewer usage volume shall be considered to be
equal to the monthly water usage volume except in those cases where a separate
sewer meter or water meter is utilized. When a separate meter is utilized, the
monthly sewer usage volume shall be calculated based on actual meter readings.
   Sewer meters shall utilize traceable U.S. Bureau of Reclamation flume/level
system methods for measuring low flows, EPA transit time chordal velocity
methods for measuring high flows or other flow measuring methodologies as
approved by the Director of Public Works. Meters shall be designed for
permanent installation and shall have data collection and reporting
capabilities that are compatible with the City's meter reading systems. Meters
shall be calibrated by a manufacturer trained technician every twelve (12)
months. A copy of the calibration report shall be provided to the City for
review. Meters shall remain the property of the building owner and shall be
maintained, updated, repaired or replaced at the expense of the building owner
as necessary to produce accurate results as determined by the City. The monthly
sewer usage volume charge shall be calculated based on actual sewer meter
readings.
   A secondary water meter may be installed to measure flow to an isolated
portion of a building's plumbing system, or irrigation system, which has been
certified by a licensed professional plumber to not discharge to the sanitary
sewer system. The City shall have the right to inspect the meter and plumbing
system at any time to verify that it does not discharge to the sanitary sewer
system. The monthly sewer usage volume shall be calculated by subtracting the
volume recorded by the secondary water meter from the volume recorded by the
primary water meter.
      3.   Summer Usage:
         a.   For single-family dwelling units with no sewer meter and one
water meter, the monthly sewer usage volume shall be calculated as described in
subsection A2 of this section except in the case of the four (4) monthly
billings issued after June 15 of each year. For each of those billings, the
monthly sewer usage volume shall be considered to be the lesser of: 1) the
actual metered water usage, or 2) one hundred thirty percent (130%) of the
customer's average monthly metered water usage for the months of December,
January, and February preceding the period to be averaged.
         b.   In the case of customers who have not established an average
usage for the preceding December through February as described in subsection
A3a of this section, the monthly sewer usage volume for each of the four (4)
monthly billings following June 15 shall be the lesser of: 1) the actual
metered water usage, or 2) one thousand five hundred (1,500) cubic feet.
      4.   Estimates; Determination Of Charge; City Right To Work On Meter:
         a.   Whenever, for any cause, a meter fails to operate or no
measurement of the flow is available, or a meter was not or could not be read
during normal route of the reader, a reasonable estimate may be made by the
City of the amount of water supplied during the period of such meter failure or
nonmeasurement of flow and the user shall pay the rate on the estimated amount
of water supplied or waste discharge.
         b.   The City water/sewer utility reserves the right to upgrade,
replace, repair, service or read any meter as required. Upon proper notice from
the City, property owners shall make an effort to accommodate any such work.
Any owner who intentionally, or unintentionally, disregards such notice shall
pay a penalty of twenty five dollars ($25.00) per month until such work has
been completed. Such penalty shall be charged on the monthly utility bill from
the City.
   B.   Additional Significant Industrial User Charges:
      1.   In addition to the sewer usage charges contained in the preceding
section, significant industrial users, those with discharge concentrations of
BOD exceeding two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) and concentrations of
TSS exceeding two hundred forty milligrams per liter (240 mg/l), shall be
subject to the following monthly surcharge:
 
BOD surcharge    $0.42/pound
TSS surcharge    0.35/pound
 
Pounds of BOD and TSS to be used in the application of these surcharges shall
be calculated according to the following formula:
 
Pounds of BOD or TSS Sewer volume (100 cu. ft.) x     Concentration of BOD (200
                                                      mg/l) or TSS (240 mg/l)

waste in the sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly, obtains
water used thereon from sources other than water facilities of the city, then
in such case the city shall permit the discharge of such sewage or industrial
wastes into its sanitary sewage facilities, when the owner of such lot, parcel
of land or premises or some other interested party shall, at his expense,
install and maintain water meters meeting accepted standards of measurement or
install a sewage flow meter and recorder meeting accepted measurement
standards. Such meters shall be installed so as to measure water consumed or
wastes discharged on such lot, parcel of land or premises and the charges and
rates for services shall be based upon the aggregate quantity of water received
or discharged as measured by appropriate meters at the rates hereinabove
specified for sewer service only. (Ord. 85-21, 9-3-1985; amd. Ord. 88-61, 11-7-

reasonably tight metal or concrete cover at the ground surface.
   E.   Two (2) baffles, each located six inches (6") to nine inches (9") from
the inlet and the outlet or submerged inlet and outlet consisting of tees,
should extend twelve inches (12") beneath the sewage level in the tank;
additional baffles are not necessary.
   NOTE: Any septic tank will require cleaning at intervals when scum that
accumulates at the top and the sludge that settles to the bottom occupies too
much space, which condition should be checked every year. Abandoned septic
tanks, cesspools and seepage pits must be filled with good, solid fill
material. (Ord. 846, 12-16-1957)
9-8-10: DISTRIBUTION BOX:
   A.   A concrete or vitrified tile distribution box at the head of each
disposal field of sufficient capacity to accommodate a separate outlet for each

   NOTE: The areas in Table 11-8 provide for plumbing fixtures, and appliances
common to residential use. Automatic sequence washer, mechanical garbage
grinder, and dishwasher included.
   C.   The bottom of an absorption bed shall terminate in a porous formation
at least four feet (4') in thickness in accordance with Federal Housing
Authority Regulations 1103-8.8.
   D.   Absorption beds constructed in unstable filled ground are not
acceptable.
   E.   Percolation Tests:
      1.   An adequate number of tests shall be made for each lot, or if soil
conditions indicate, a greater number will be required to show clearly the
absorptive ability of the soil throughout the tract.
      2.   Each test hole shall be located by a key number on a topographic map
of the tract.
      3.   A soil boring shall be made for each lot to show clearly the type of
soil existing beneath the absorption area. The boring should extend to a point
at least six feet (6') below the finish grade of proposed absorption trenches.
      4.   One percolation test shall be made for each individual lot within
the proposed absorption field site.
      5.   All percolation tests required shall be performed in accordance with
the following:
         a.   Dig or bore the holes with horizontal dimensions of from four
inches (4") to twelve inches (12") and vertical sides to the depth of the
bottom of proposed absorption device. Holes can be bored with four inch (4")
diameter post-hole type auger.
         b.   Roughen or scratch the bottom and sides of the holes to provide a
natural surface. Remove all loose materials from the hole. Place about two
inches (2") of coarse sand or fine gravel in the hole to prevent bottom
scouring.
         c.   Fill the hole with clear water to a minimum depth of twelve
inches (12") over the gravel. By refilling, if necessary, or by supplying a
surplus reservoir of water (automatic siphon), keep water in hole for at least
four (4) hours, and preferably overnight. In sandy soils containing no clay,
the above saturation procedure is not necessary and the test can be made after
the water from one filling has seeped away.
         d.   Percolation rate measurements should be made on the day following
the saturation process, except in sandy soil.
         e.   If water remains in the test hole after overnight saturation,
adjust the depth to six inches (6") over the gravel. From a fixed reference
point, measure the drop in water level over a thirty (30) minute period.
         f.   If no water remains in the hole after overnight saturation, add
clear water to a depth of about six inches (6") over the gravel. From a fixed
reference point, measure the height of the water surface at approximately
thirty (30) minute intervals over a four (4) hour period, refilling the hole to
a depth of six inches (6") as necessary. The drop which occurs during the final
thirty (30) minute period is used to calculate the percolation rate.
         g.   In sandy soils, or other soil in which the first six inches (6")
of water seeps away in less than thirty (30) minutes, after the overnight
saturation period, the time interval between measurements can be taken as ten
(10) minutes and the test run over a period of one hour. The drop which occurs
in the final ten (10) minute period is used to calculate the percolation rate.
         h.   All such percolation tests shall be conducted and certified to by
a registered, professional engineer. (Ord. 62-12)
9-8-13: SEEPAGE TRENCHES:
   A.   All trenches in a disposal field shall comply with the following
standards:
 
Minimum bottom width of trench           18 inches
Maximum depth of cover of tile lines     30 inches
Recommended depth of cover of tile lines  18 inches
Maximum grade of tile lines     6 inches per 100 feet
Recommended grade of tile lines  2-4 inches per 100 feet
Minimum aggregate under tiles            6 inches
Minimum aggregate over tiles             6 inches
 
Bottom areas of separate trenches as nearly equal as practicable, especially
where tile fields are placed on ground of appreciable slope. Size and spacing
of trenches to conform to the following table:
 
Width At Bottom In Inches Square Foot At Bottom Per Minimum Spacing Center To
                          Lineal Foot               Center In Feet

36                        3.0                       10
 
   B.   Grade board, securely staked in the bottom of the trench, and left in
place under the tile during and after placing of aggregate material encasing
the tile, is recommended.
   C.   Upper halves of joints only are to be covered with pieces of tar paper
to prevent filtering of backfill material into the tile lines.
   D.   Where necessary to maintain proper grade and cover, a line may be
terraced by construction of suitable brick or concrete drop-boxes, or by use of
ells with cemented joints.
   E.   Aggregate shall be crushed stone, gravel, slag or similar material
having sufficient voids. Crushed stone, gravel and slag shall not contain more
than five percent (5%) dust and clay. Coarse aggregate used under the tile may
vary from one-fourth inch (1/4") to one and one-half inches (11/2") in size.
Material used on top of tile shall be sufficiently fine so as to prohibit
filtering of earth backfill into tile lines. If coarser material is used, straw
or untreated paper should be placed over the aggregate before ditch is filled
with each backfill.
   F.   The aggregate shall completely encase the tile as provided in
subsection A above, except that seepage trenches constructed within ten feet
(10') of large trees or dense shrubbery shall have at least twelve inches (12")
of aggregate beneath the tile. (Ord. 846, 12-16-1957)
9-8-14: SAND FILTERS AND SEEPAGE PITS:
Generally sand filters and seepage pits are not needed. They may be used to
supplement tile disposal lines only if space is not adequate for disposal
lines, soil does not readily absorb liquids, and there is no danger of
contaminating water supply. Permits for sand filters and seepage pits shall be
granted only if a study of the individual case shows the installation to be
practical and will not become objectionable or a danger to health. (Ord. 846,
12-16-1957)
9-8-15: SUMP AND SUMP PUMP:
Where a basement sump is used for the collection of drainage from foundation
footing drains, such drainage shall not be discharged into the septic tank or
sanitary sewer. Where it is necessary to pump laundry and toilet wastes, a
separate sump shall be provided for such purposes exclusively, and they shall
be discharged into the sanitary sewer or septic tank. (Ord. 846, 12-16-1957)
9-8-16: DISCHARGE OF SUBSURFACE SEEPAGE WATERS ONTO PUBLIC STREETS:
   A.   Prohibited Acts: It is hereby declared to be unlawful for any citizen
to:

seepage water from property owned by him into the Municipal sanitary sewer
system as provided for under Title 8, Chapter 3 of this Code.
      3.   Allow to be discharged or cause to be discharged any sewage, septic
tank discharge, "gray" water, or any toxic, noxious or pathogenic matter into a
Municipal storm sewer or ditch as provided for under Title 8, Chapter 3 of this
Code.
   B.   Connection To Storm Sewer Required: Whenever a City storm sewer abuts a
landowner's property, either on a public right of way or dedicated easement,
said landowner is required to connect his system of subsurface water seepage
removal, whether such system is a pumping system or a gravity system, into said
City storm sewer located outside of the paved portion of the street, including
the curb and gutters. The landowner shall obtain the approval of the City
Engineer prior to connecting to said system.
   C.   Approval Of Existing System: In areas where a viable piping system
exists for disposal of sump pump water, the owner need not connect to City
sewers, provided that the existing system is approved by the City Engineer. An
open ditch shall not be considered a viable system. A viable system shall be
considered a pipe outletting to a storm sewer, detention pond, or other
waterway.
   D.   Connection To Junction Box; Fee: Effective with the date of this
Section, in areas where the City provides a junction box outside the limits of
the paved area specifically for connecting to sump pump drainage, the property
owner shall be required to connect his sump pump drain to said junction box.
The property owner shall pay all costs for extending the sump pump drain line
to the junction box and yard restoration costs.
The property owner shall pay a connection fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00)
prior to connecting to the junction box unless the property owner participated
in an assessment program to have the sump pump drainage system installed, in
which case the connection fee shall be waived. A system of time payments may be
worked out with the City if the homeowner desires.
   E.   Street Repairing Or Repaving: Where sump pump water collection systems
are installed prior to repair and repaving of streets, said street improvements
shall not be started until all sump pump discharges are connected to the
system.
   F.   Lawn And Garden Watering: The property owners may use clean underground
seepage for grass and plant watering on their own property only. Homeowners may
wish to install a valved sump pump discharge system in order to utilize sump
pump water for lawn and garden watering in dry periods.
   G.   Time Extension For Compliance: Any landowner owning property in the
City who is not in compliance with any of the provisions of this Section shall
have ninety (90) days from the date of notification by the City to be in
compliance therewith, unless extenuating circumstances, such as frozen ground,
warrant a time extension. Granting time extensions shall be at the discretion
of the City.
   H.   Penalty: Any person who violates any of the provisions of this Section
shall, upon conviction, be fined the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for
each offense. Additionally, any person so convicted of violating any provisions
of this Section shall place himself in compliance therewith within thirty (30)
days of the date of his conviction. (Ord. 85-18, 6-17-1985)

length herein, for the purpose of prescribing regulations governing conditions
hazardous to life and property from fire or explosion, these certain codes
three (3) copies of which have been on file for more than thirty (30) days in
the office of the city clerk and which are known as:
   A.   International Code Council (ICC) international fire code - 2006, except
as deleted or modified by sections 9-11-2 and 9-11-3 of this chapter.
   B.   The National Fire Protection Association no. 101, 2000 edition, known
as the life safety code, the whole thereof. (Ord. 07-33, 3-19-2007)
9-11-2: AMENDMENTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL FIRE CODE/2006:
The following sections are amendments to the ICC international fire code. The
"F" numbers refer to the numbering system therein:
Section F-101.1: Insert for name of jurisdiction "city of Batavia, Kane and
DuPage Counties, Illinois."
Section F-102.10: Added as follows:
The strict application of the fire code would require installation of a fire
alarm system or sprinkler system in a structure existing as of August 15, 1994
which could cause hardship. Therefore, said installation shall only be required
on change of use and/or alterations (as defined in this code) exceeding 25% of
the physical value of the building, excepting the requirements of the National
Fire Protection Association no. 101 life safety code, which requirements shall
be applied.
Section F-103.5: Add a new section.
Whenever the terms "authority having jurisdiction," "chief of the fire
prevention bureau," "fire marshal," "code official," or "fire prevention
bureau" are used in this chapter it shall be held to mean the city of Batavia
fire code official.
Section F-108: Replace with the following:
   1.   Appeal Of Code Official Decision. Any person aggrieved by the decision
of the code official may appeal said decision. Application for appeal may be
made when the party asserts that the intent of the code has been met by the
party's submitted plans or construction or that the code has been incorrectly
interpreted or that substitute construction and protective assemblies and
systems will provide as good as or better structure or building when completed.
Any appeal shall be in writing as set forth below.
   2.   The city services committee shall receive and review any written
application for appeal of any such decision of the fire code official. Such
appeal must be filed with the city services committee within ten (10) days of
the code official's written decision.
   3.   Within forty-five (45) days of the date of filing the written appeal,
the designated committee shall meet in public session and take evidence from
the party filing the appeal and the code official with respect to the subject
of the appeal.
   4.   At the conclusion of the taking of the evidence, the committee shall
make written findings of fact together with its recommendation and forward same
to the full Batavia city council.
   5.   The final decision as to whether the appeal shall be granted shall be
made by the city council. In making this decision, the city council shall
review only the record of the evidence taken by the designated committee, which
shall include the committee's findings of fact and recommendation. No further
evidence may be presented to the city council. The granting of an appeal not
constituting a variation to the Batavia municipal code shall be accomplished by
a majority vote upon an appropriate motion. Any variation to the Batavia
municipal code shall be by duly adopted ordinance.
Section F-112: Added as follows:
Emergency Conditions:
In case there shall be, in the opinion of the fire official, actual and
immediate danger to life and property from the hazards of fire and explosion
arising from the hazardous storage, handling and use of materials in any use or
occupancy of buildings or premises, the fire official shall employ such labor
and machinery, equipment and devices and cause the necessary work to be done to
render said occupancy or property temporarily safe, whether the procedure
prescribed in this section has been instituted or not.
   1.   Where practical and time constraints permit, the owner, occupant or
other person responsible for the emergency condition shall be notified of the
emergency condition in writing, and shall have the option of making the
condition safe where practical.

   C.   Prior to the approval of a final plat by the city council, the
subdivider or developer shall pay to the city a fee for electrical engineering,
electrical layout and construction inspection for the electrical improvements
at a rate of seventy five dollars ($75.00) per residential living unit. The
cost of the electrical improvements shall not be included in the estimated
costs of improvements in subsection B of this section.
Prior to the recordation of a final plat, the subdivider or developer shall pay
the city a fee equal to two percent (2%) of the costs of construction of
improvements, as and for all inspection services rendered by the city during
said construction. The subdivider or developer shall also pay, prior to any
preliminary or final plat approval, the fee for the review and commentary upon
any proposed subdivision concept plan, preliminary and/or final plat by the
consulting land planner, as required in section
11-3-1 of this title.
   D.   Prior to granting a construction permit for site improvements that will
utilize best management practices, as noted in the Kane County stormwater
ordinance, a plat must be provided that includes the latest city of Batavia
stormwater easement language. If the current location already is encompassed by
a stormwater easement the owner will need to update the plat or provide a
separate easement document for recording with the relevant easement language as
approved by the city. To the extent the easement provides provisions for
facilities that will require ongoing maintenance and inspection requiring the
city to retain outside consultants for inspection and/or maintenance, the owner
of the underlying property shall be responsible to reimburse the city for the
cost plus a ten percent (10%) administrative fee. This shall apply from the
time the plants are installed until the plants are established and signed off
by a professional wetland scientist, typically three (3) to five (5) years from
the time they are installed. The said fees shall be waived if the site was
required to obtain an army corps of engineers permit that requires a five (5)
year monitoring and reporting document.
   E.   Prior to granting of a construction permit for site improvements, the
subdivider or developer shall pay an as built deposit fee equaling one percent
(1%) of the total estimated construction value, or one thousand dollars
($1,000.00), whichever is greater. This fee shall be paid at the same time as
the building permit fee is due. If a letter of credit is required for the
project the fee shall be included in the LOC for public improvements which is
also due prior to the release of the building permit. If the as built is
submitted within six (6) months of substantial completion and accepted by the
city engineer then the deposit shall be fully refunded. If at the six (6) month
time frame the as built has not been approved by the city engineer but has been
submitted for review, the fee may still be refundable, either full or partial,
as determined by the city engineer. If an as built is not submitted within six
(6) months of substantial completion, then the deposit will no longer be
refundable; the deposit shall be drawn from the LOC used by the city to obtain
as builts. For projects submitting letters of credit (LOC), the LOC shall not
be reduced or released until the as built is reviewed and approved by the city
engineer. For LOC held deposits, if the as builts are not submitted in the time
frame outlined in this section a draw will be done to pay for as builts. (Ord.
16-04, 2-15-2016)
11-2-5: VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS:
Where the subdivider can show that a provision of the standards of design,
required improvements or other provisions of this title would cause unnecessary
hardship if strictly adhered to, and where, because of topographical or other
conditions peculiar to the site or surrounding condition, and in the opinion of
the plan commission, a departure may be made without destroying the intent of
such provisions, the plan commission may recommend variations from these
requirements and provisions. Such recommendations shall be communicated to the
city council, in writing, with the reasons therefor. The city council may
approve variations from these requirements in specific cases which, in its
opinion, do not affect the general plan or the spirit of this title. (Ord. 873,
2-3-1958)
11-2-6: CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS:
The plan commission shall, from time to time, prepare and recommend, in
writing, to the city council such changes or additions to the provisions and
regulations herein contained for subdivision control, as the plan commission
may deem necessary or advisable. Such changes or additions shall become
effective after their adoption by the city council by its passage of an
amendment to this title. (Ord. 873, 2-3-1958)
11-2-7: PENALTY:
Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this title shall be
subject to a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each
violation thereof, and each day that a violation exists or continues shall
constitute a separate offense. (Ord. 873, 2-3-1958; amd. 1986 Code)

the final inspection for acceptance of the public improvements by the city
council, and/or the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, and within six (6)
months of substantial completion, a full size set of record survey drawings or
"as builts" shall be submitted to the engineering department for review and
approval. The record drawings shall consist of the approved final engineering
plans appended with information to show any field changes, change orders, and
additions made during construction. All corrections or changes shall be noted
on the plan sheets. No original information shown on the approved engineering
plans should be removed from the record survey plan sheets. All constructed
site dimensions, elevations, and locations for storm sewers, sanitary sewers,
water mains, utility services, all utility lines plugged, capped, or abandoned,
pavements, grading, stormwater detention/retention facilities, changes in
material, and all other site work shall be surveyed, verified and certified by
a professional land surveyor or professional engineer licensed in the state of
Illinois. The engineer that sealed the approved final engineering drawings
shall also certify the record survey drawings. All constructed dimensions and
GIS data shall be at the same level of detail and accuracy as the approved
final engineering plans.
All as built numerical values and material names shall be shown adjacent to the
plan value or name and circled. A single light line shall be struck through the
plan value or name such that it is still legible. A leader shall point from the
actual as built item to the circled change if further clarification is needed.
Once the engineering department has accepted the record survey drawings with
any subsequent additions and/or corrections made thereto, the owner/developer
shall provide the city with one mylar copy of the drawing and a digital version
of the same in a format compatible with the current city software standards.
Upon acceptance of the record survey drawings by the city engineer, the as
built deposit fee shall be refunded if it complies with the conditions as noted
and as required by subsection

section, "development" or "redevelopment" shall mean the subdivision or
resubdivision of lands, approval of a planned development under title 10 of
this code, a "deed division" which creates additional buildable lots, or
issuance of building permits for construction of residential dwelling units on
those lands upon which this chapter either has not been previously applied, or
for those units in excess of those upon which this chapter had been so applied.
   A.   Compliance: The obligation for compliance with this section shall be as
follows:
      1.   Subdivision Or Resubdivision: The person or entity seeking final
plat approval.
      2.   Planned Development Plan Or Plat: The person or entity seeking final
plan or plat approval.
      3.   Deed Division: A "deed division" or other development or
redevelopment of lands as set forth above; the person or entity applying for a
building permit on each newly created lot.
   B.   Criteria For Requiring School Site Dedication:
      1.   Amount Of Land Dedicated: The amount of land required to be
dedicated for school sites shall relate directly upon the ultimate number of
students to be generated by the development or redevelopment of land. The land
dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of: a)
estimated children to be served in each such school classification over the b)
maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school
classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to the c) said
minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school
classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the acres of
fully developed land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to
serve the estimated increased children in each such school classification.
      2.   School Classification And Size Of School Site: School
classifications and size of school sites shall be determined in accordance with
the following criteria:
 
School Classification By  Maximum Number Of Students Minimum Number Of Acres Of
Grades                    For Each Such School       Land For Each School Site
                          Classification             Of Such Classification
Elementary schools,
grades - kindergarten     600                        11 acres
through 5th (K - 5)
Junior high schools,
grades 6th through 8th (6 1,200                      28 acres
- 8)
High schools, grades 9th  2,000                      50 acres
through 12th (9 - 12)
 
      3.   Location: The officials of the school district shall work with city
planners, city council, and developers in properly locating school sites that
shall meet proper specifications including those listed in the general
conditions and criteria section of this report.
   C.   Criteria For Requiring A Contribution In Lieu Of School Site:
      1.   Where the development or redevelopment is small and the resulting
school site too small to be practical, or when available land is inappropriate
for a school site, as determined by the board of education, the board of
education shall so inform the city council and the city shall require that the
entity seeking such development or redevelopment be required to pay a cash
contribution in lieu of the land dedication required.
      2.   The cash contributions in lieu of school site dedications shall be
based on the fair-market value of the acres of land in the area improved as
specified herein that otherwise would have been dedicated as a school site.
Such improvements shall include consideration of grading, streets, water, storm
water and sewer systems, curbs and gutters, sidewalks, electrical service,
street trees and streetlights. It has been determined that the present fair-
market value of such improved land in and around the school districts within
the planning jurisdiction of the city is as follows:
      Beginning March 1, 2025: one hundred seventy five thousand dollars
($175,000) per acre. Properties that have received City Council approval for
development by an annexation agreement, planned development, conditional use or
final subdivision plat prior to March 1, 2025 may have land cash fees assessed
at the one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) per acre rate until March
1, 2025.
      Such figure shall be used in making any calculations relating to this
policy until evidence dictates raising or lowering this amount. In the event
that a subdivider or developer files a written objection with the city clerk
objecting to said fair market value figure, and in the event that negotiations
fail to achieve an acceptable alternative, the said fair market value shall be
determined by three (3) qualified appraisers, one of whom shall be appointed by
the city council, or by its duly appointed committee or commission, one of whom
shall be appointed by the subdivider or developer, and one of whom shall be
mutually agreed upon by the said two (2) appraisers so chosen. The fees and
costs of such appraisal shall be borne equally by the city and the subdivider
or developer.
      3.   Any such cash payment shall be made by the subdivider or developer
to the school district subsequent to the approval of the final plat or planned
unit development, prior to the mayor affixing his written approval to said
plat. Unless shown to the satisfaction of the city, it shall be assumed, and
cash payments shall be based upon the assumption that all units shall contain
three (3) bedrooms. At the time an actual building permit is applied for, if
additional bedrooms are contained in the dwelling, an additional fee determined
pursuant to this section shall be collected from the building permit applicant,
and the funds collected transmitted to the appropriate school district.
      4.   Cash payments in lieu of land shall be held by the city in a
separate account which may or may not be interest bearing. Disbursements to the
district may be made for qualified land acquisition or improvements after
submitting proof of expenditures for said acquisition or improvement. Land Cash
payments shall only be used on projects that are within the City limits or
within a school with an attendance area that includes the area where the Land
Cash fee was collected within the City limits. If used for buildings within the
City limits, funds may only be disbursed if the District obtains a building
permit from the City for said eligible improvements. Determination of
eligibility to disburse said funds shall be determined by the City in its sole
discretion.
      5.   Land values shall be reviewed by the city council every three (3)
years beginning in 2018.
   D.   Student Density Formula:
      1.    Student Density Formula: Density Formula: The following table of
student population density is generally based upon a thorough study of the
yields of existing new housing units and is generally indicative of current and
short-range projected trends in family size for new construction, and shall be
used in calculating the amount of required dedication of fully developed land
or the cash contributions in lieu thereof, until evidence of changes in local
conditions and housing trends make a revision of numbers practical and
necessary. The density table is therefore, subject to periodic review and
amendment:

   E.   Review: The present fair market value and student density formula
affecting this section shall be reviewed by the city plan commission every
three (3) years. After said review, any appropriate changes may be recommended
to the city council for action.
   F.   Exception: This section is not to affect lands of subdividers or
developers who have entered into an agreement with the city for annexation of
those lands, or for the use of those lands in a planned development, said
agreement having been entered into prior to the effective date of this section;
except that any lands which are the subject of an annexation agreement or
planned unit development shall come under the terms of this section, and this
section shall be fully enforceable against those lands, where the annexation
agreement or the planned unit development agreement may have expired and become
void because the lands affected were not developed within the time provided for
in said agreements. It is intended that the term "the lands affected were not
developed" is, for the purpose of this section, to mean that the final plat in
case of lands being developed in RO, R1-L, R1-M, R1-H, R2, R3 or R4 zoning
districts has not been approved by the expiration date of the agreement; or
that in the case of a development in an R5 zoning district, the building
permits have not been granted by the expiration date of the agreement in
question. School land-cash fees may be waived by the city council at time of
final plat for developments that are deed restricted housing for individuals
fifty five (55) and older.
   G.   Final Authority: No term within this section shall represent a
delegation of the city's authority to any particular school district, and the
city council shall retain the final authority over application of this section.
(Ord. 15-05, 7-6-2015; amd. Ord. 21-62, 11-15-2021; Ord. 2024-058, 12-2-2024)
11-6-2: DEDICATION OF PARK LANDS OR FUNDS:
As a condition of approval of the development or redevelopment of lands within
the corporate limits of the city, or within the planning jurisdiction of the
city (being 11/2 miles outside the corporate limits), the corporate authorities
may require the dedication of real property for a park or park sites, to serve
the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development or
redevelopment, to make an actual cash payment in lieu of actual land
dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the city, with the
concurrence of the park district in which the land is located, in accordance
with the criteria and formula contained within this section. For purposes of
this section, "development" or "redevelopment" shall mean the subdivision or
resubdivision of lands, approval of a planned development under title 10 of
this code, a "deed division" which creates additional buildable lots,
condominium development, any other development, whether a subdivision is
required or not under the law, issuance of building permits on property zoned
R5, or issuance of building permits for construction of residential dwelling
units on those lands upon which this chapter either has not been previously
applied, or for those units in excess of those upon which this chapter had been
so applied. Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the developer and city,
any land to be dedicated for park recreational purposes shall be platted,
dedicated and improved as part of the first phase of any subdivision.
   A.   Compliance: The obligation for compliance with this section shall be as
follows:
      1.   Subdivision Or Resubdivision: The person or entity seeking final
plat approval.
      2.   Planned Development Plan Or Plat: The person or entity seeking final
plan or plat approval.
      3.   Deed Division: A "deed division" or other development or
redevelopment of lands as set forth above; the person or entity applying for a
building permit on each newly created lot.
   B.   Criteria For Requiring Park And Recreation Land Dedication:

                                                    1,000 people
 
      2.   General Requirements For Land Contributions: Unless otherwise
waived, lands to be dedicated to any applicable park district shall conform to
the following criteria:
         a.   Location: The park district master plan, as then in effect,
adopted by the applicable park district shall be used as a guideline in
determining the general location of park sites. Generally, neighborhood park
sites should be accessible to the public and serve a population within one-half
(1/2) to one mile radius from the site, depending on the classification of the
park. Park sites should be located in conjunction with and adjacent to school
sites whenever possible and desirable. Community parks are intended to serve a
broader area and should offer a greater variety of facilities and activities.
         b.   Topography And Soils: Park sites must possess suitable topography
and soil types for the use to which they are dedicated. The developer shall
supply the park district with a minimum of one soil boring per acre to a
minimum depth of fifteen feet (15'). The developer shall also provide the park
district with a phase I environmental study and any hazardous materials found
on the site shall be removed by the developer prior to conveyance.
         c.   Stormwater And Surface Water Detention Or Retention Areas:
Stormwater and surface water detention and retention areas will be accepted at
the discretion of the board of commissioners of the applicable park district,
and not count toward the total land dedication.
         d.   Wetlands And Other Natural Areas: Wetland and other natural areas
will be considered acceptable only when they are considered significant in
size, quality, uniqueness, contain endangered plants or animal species, or are
adjacent to existing natural areas currently owned by the park district.
Wetland areas will be accepted at the discretion of the board of commissioners
of the applicable park district. Any such wetland area accepted by the
applicable park district shall not count toward the total land dedication
required herein.
         e.   Private Recreation Areas: No credit will be given toward the
total land/cash contributions for private recreation or open space provided by
the developer.
         f.   Dimensions: Sites should be generally rectangular in shape with
dimensions generally proportionate to the ratio of a depth of three (3) to a
width of two (2). These criteria shall not apply to sites contemplated for
extraordinary types of facilities such as, but not limited to, trails and
shoreline frontages.
         g.   Frontage: Thirty feet (30') of street frontage per acre of land
dedicated with a minimum of one hundred fifty feet (150') of frontage.
         h.   Access: Access to park sites and connections to other park sites
are to be provided by way of open accessways between homes and/or from public
right of way. The accessways should be, at a minimum, equal to the average lot
width within the proposed subdivision.
         i.   Drainage: Except for stormwater and surface water drainage
facilities servicing the park facilities constructed on the site, detention or
retention basins for stormwater drainage from the surrounding development will
not be located on park sites unless approved by the board of commissioners of
the applicable park district.
      3.   Improvements Required For Land Dedication: Park sites to be
dedicated by developer shall include the following land improvements:
         a.   Utilities: Each dedicated park site shall be provided with the
following utilities to the property line:
            (1)   Sanitary sewer adjacent to the site shall be a minimum of
eight inches (8") in diameter. If the sanitary sewer is across the right of way
from the park site, the developer shall provide a capped six inch (6") minimum
diameter service line to the property line, accessible by a manhole where
necessary, and as approved by the city in consultation with the park district.
            (2)   Water line adjacent to the site shall be a minimum of eight
inches (8") in diameter. If the water line is across the right of way from the
park site, the developer shall provide a capped one inch (1") minimum diameter
water line to the property line, as approved by the city in consultation with
the park district, and unless otherwise requested for a special facility.
            (3)   Storm sewers shall be provided at appropriate locations to
properly drain the park site, as approved by the park district.
            (4)   Other utilities, such as electric, gas and telephone shall be
provided adjacent to or at the property line. The utility extension for any
development adjacent to the park site shall be at the cost of that developer
and the park district shall be responsible solely for utility extensions
necessary to construct a park facility. The park district shall not be
responsible for utility extensions for any other purpose.
         b.   Grading: Each dedicated park site shall be graded to drain at a
minimum of two percent (2%) for open areas and slopes on berms, when berms are
required, shall not exceed four to one (4:1) (3:1 or steeper shall be deemed
unacceptable). Grading shall include, but not be limited to: berms for
separation, screening or aesthetics; placement of six inches (6") of topsoil
and fine grading. Grading and berming shall be in accordance with plans
approved by the park district.
         c.   Other Site Developments: The developer shall be required to
provide other site developments for the land to be dedicated for park purposes,
which site developments shall include, but not be limited to, the following.
         d.   Seeding: Seed entire park site with a blend approved by the park
district. Seeding shall include placement, watering as necessary and mowing
until such time as a full stand of turf is established and accepted by the park
district, but not less than one full growing season.
         e.   Landscaping: Developer shall purchase and install park landscape
as approved by the park district, per park district specifications. Landscape
shall include (per 2 acres); at a minimum:
            5 shade trees - 21/2 inch cal. B&B
            3 evergreen trees - 7 foot ht. B&B
            6 ornamental trees - 6 foot ht. B&B
            20 deciduous shrubs - 30 inch ht. or 7 gal.
            15 evergreen shrubs - 18 inch spr. or 5 gal.
         All trees will have to be from the city's approved tree list, unless
written permission is received from the city.
         As an alternative to the landscaping requirements set forth in this
subsection B3e the developer may, upon concurrence of the park district, make
the following cash contribution in lieu of the required improvement: the sum of
three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre; and for each fraction of an acre,
an equal fraction of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00).
         f.   Walks, Utilities And Sewers: Developer shall install all public
walks, curb, pavement, sewers and utilities along all park site frontages as
per city subdivision regulations.
         g.   Curb Cuts: Developer shall install curb cuts for maintenance
access areas, when parking is not required, as per park district
specifications.
         h.   Bonding Of Park Improvements: At such time as the developer
applies for development permits, a bond or irrevocable letter of credit in the
amount of one hundred percent (100%) of the value of all park improvements
shall be delivered to the park district and inure to the benefit of the park
district.
         i.   Completion: Unless otherwise agreed, the above listed park
improvements shall be completed at such time as the residential development
reaches fifty percent (50%) completion or at such time as fifty percent (50%)
of the residential building permits for the development have been issued,
whichever occurs earlier.
         j.   Storage Of Overburden: The storage of overburden on a park site
and the use of the park site as a borrow pit is prohibited, though temporary
storage shall be granted in some cases. Terms of such temporary storage shall
be determined by the park district. No foreign material shall be added to the
park site, except as approved by the park district.
         k.   Other: The developer will supply the park district with a
complete survey of the site and as built drawings, showing engineering and
utilities. The developer shall mark the corners of the property with permanent
monuments.
   C.   Reservation Of Additional Lands: Whenever the city's comprehensive plan
or the standards established by the applicable park district indicates that a
larger site than that required of the developer to be dedicated by this
section, and said site is wholly within the proposed subdivision, the park
district may request a reservation of additional property adjoining the
dedication site for subsequent purchase for park purposes. Such request shall
include the designation of specific property to be reserved on the final plat
and labeled a letter of intent stating the park district's intent to purchase
the property at the fair market value at the time of final subdivision
approval. The failure of the park district to initiate acquisition proceedings
within sixty (60) days of notice by the city shall cause the termination of the
"reserved" designation and will release said property for further development
within the subdivision regulations of the city.
   D.   Criteria For Requiring A Contribution In Lieu Of Park Sites:
      1.   Criteria: Where the development is small and the resulting park site
is too small to be practical, or when the available land is inappropriate for a
park site as determined by the board of commissioners of the applicable park
district, the board of commissioners shall so inform the City Council and the
City shall require that the subdivider or the developer be required to pay a
cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required. A cash contribution
in lieu of park site dedications shall be based on the fair-market value of the
acres of land in the area improved as specified herein that otherwise would
have been dedicated as a park site. Such improvements shall include
consideration of grading, streets, water and sewer systems, curbs and gutters,
sidewalks, electrical service, street trees and streetlights. It has been
determined that the present fair-market value of such improved land in and
around the park district within the planning jurisdiction of the City is as
follows:
      Beginning March 1, 2025: one hundred seventy five thousand dollars
($175,000). Properties that have received City Council approval for development
by an annexation agreement, planned development, conditional use or final
subdivision plat prior to March 1, 2025 may have land cash fees assessed at the
one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) per acre rate until March 1,
2025.
      Such figure shall be used in making any calculations relating to this
policy until evidence dictates raising or lowering this amount. In the event
that a subdivider or developer files a written objection with the city clerk
objecting to said fair market value figure, and in the event that negotiations
fail to achieve an acceptable alternative, the said fair market value shall be
determined by three (3) qualified appraisers, one of whom shall be appointed by
the city council, or by its duly appointed committee or commission, one of whom
shall be appointed by the subdivider or developer, and one of whom shall be
mutually agreed upon by the said two (2) appraisers so chosen. The fees and
costs of such appraisal shall be borne equally by the city and the subdivider
or developer.
      2.   Dedications Made Prior To Final Plat Approval: The dedications of
land and/or cash contributions required by this section shall be made by the
developer prior to the approval of a final plat in the case of lands being
developed into RO, R1-L, R1-M, R1-H, R2, R3 or R4 zoning districts, prior to
the issuance of a building permit in the case of land being developed in an R5
zoning district for which no previous contributions under this section were
made. Further, the dedications or contributions required under this section
shall be applicable and due when a division of property, or development or
redevelopment of property occurs which creates lots or dwelling units in
addition to the number of lots or dwelling units existing as of (the effective
date hereof), and in such cases be paid upon application for building permit
for each additional dwelling unit.
      3.   Density Formula: The following table of population density is
generally indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size
for new construction and should be used in calculating the amount of required
dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof:
DENSITY FORMULA FOR ESTIMATED POPULATION PER DWELLING UNIT
Type Of Unit Total Persons Per Unit
Type Of Unit             Total Persons Per Unit
Detached single-family:   
 2 bedroom              1.989
 3 bedroom              2.987
 4 bedroom              3.807
 5 bedroom              4.419
Attached single-family:   
 1 bedroom              1.050
 2 bedroom              1.899
 3 bedroom              2.277
 4 bedroom              3.328
Apartment, condominiums:  
 Efficiency             1.000
 1 bedroom              1.190
 2 bedroom              1.659
 3 bedroom              2.814
 
      4.   Cash Payments: Cash payments in lieu of land shall be held by the
city in a separate account which may or may not be interest bearing.
Disbursements to the district may be made for qualified land acquisition or
improvements after submitting proof of expenditures for said acquisition or
improvement.
      5.   Land Values: Land values shall be reviewed by the city council every
three (3) years beginning in 2018.
   E.   Review Of Present Market Value And Density Formula: The present fair
market value and density formula affecting this section shall be reviewed by
the city plan commission each year. After said review, any appropriate changes
may be recommended to the city council for action.
   F.   Exception: This section is not to affect lands of subdividers or
developers who have entered into an agreement with the city for annexation of
those lands, or for the use of those lands in a planned development, said
agreement having been entered into prior to the effective date of this section;
except that any lands which are the subject of an annexation agreement or
planned unit development shall come under the terms of this section, and this
section shall be fully enforceable against those lands, where the annexation
agreement or the planned unit development agreement may have expired and become
void because the lands affected were not developed within the time provided for
in said agreements. It is intended that the term "the lands affected were not
developed" is, for the purpose of this section, to mean that the final plat in
case of lands being developed in RO, R1-L, R1-M, R1-H, R2, R3 or R4 zoning
districts has not been approved by the expiration date of the agreement; or
that in the case of a development in an R5 zoning district, the building
permits have not been granted by the expiration date of the agreement in
question.
   G.   City's Authority: No term within this section shall represent a
delegation of the city's authority to any particular park district, and the
city council shall retain the final authority over application of this section.
(Ord. 15-05, 7-6-2015; amd. Ord. 2024-058, 12-2-2024)
11-6-3: SCHOOL DISTRICT CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT DEVELOPMENT FEES:
   A.   It is the stated policy of the city to exact school district capital
improvement development fees as a consequence of residential development within
lands annexed to the city after September 8, 1992. (Ord. 94-52, 8-15-1994)
   B.   Unless otherwise approved by the city council, all agreements for the
annexation of lands to be developed with residential uses shall contain terms
by which the entity seeking annexation shall agree to be bound by and comply
with the terms of this section relating to the calculation, payment and
collection of school district capital improvement development fees.
      1.   Criteria For Determining School District Capital Improvement
Development Fees: The following criteria shall govern the calculation of fees
under this section:
         a.   Requirement And Population Ratio: The amount of the development
fee required for school district capital improvement shall be directly related
to the ultimate number of students estimated to be generated by the residential
development. The development fee required to be paid as a condition of
annexation shall be determined by obtaining the product of the following:
            (1)   The estimated number of students to be served in the school
district in which the development is located; and
            (2)   The capital costs per student, excluding school site land
costs. Said fee shall then be adjusted for credits as established in this
section.
      2.   School District Capital Development Credit: In the calculation of
the fee, credit shall be given as follows:
         a.   Credit shall be given for the present value of the future stream
of real estate tax payments from the development attributable to debt service
for school district capital improvements. The credit shall be based on the
annual charge per dollar of assessed valuation.
         b.   Credit shall be given for the present value of the future stream
of real estate tax payments from the development allocated to the annual school
district capital improvement budget.
         c.   Credit shall be given for the per student amount of state
financial aid received by the school district and allocated to the annual
school district capital improvement budget.
         d.   The sum of all school district capital improvement credits shall
not exceed the total school district capital improvement development fee.
      3.   Information Sources: Calculations for the fee under this section
shall be based upon the dwelling unit - student population formula as
established in this chapter, capital improvement budget data from the school
district serving the development and the office of the Kane County tax
collector. Said sources shall be evaluated annually. (Ord. 92-84, 9-8-1992)
      4.   Payment And Collection Of Fees: Any fee payable under this section
shall be paid to the city as a condition of the issuance of a building permit
for a residential structure. (Ord. 94-52, 8-15-1994)
      5.   Collection And Transfer Of Fees To School District: The fees
collected under this section shall be transferred to the school district
serving the development only upon the following terms, to be contained in a
written agreement between the city and the affected school district:
         a.   Trust account shall be established by the school district, to be
designated as the "school district capital improvement development fee trust
account" (hereinafter "trust account"), which shall be maintained separate and
apart from all other accounts of the school district. All fees collected under
this section shall be deposited into this account immediately upon receipt.
         b.   The funds deposited into the above account shall be used solely
for growth necessitated capital improvements and additions to the school
district facilities and limited to:
            (1)   Design and construction plan preparation.
            (2)   Permitting and fees.
            (3)   Costs of land acquisition by condemnation, excluding the
actual compensation or consideration paid for the land.
            (4)   Construction and design of school district buildings,
facilities or improvements and additions thereto, including relocation of
utilities and/or landscaping.
            (5)   Construction management or inspection.
            (6)   Surveying, soils and material testing.
            (7)   Repayment of monies transferred or borrowed from any
budgetary fund of the school district, such funds borrowed subsequent to
September 8, 1992, and used to fund items payable under this section.
            (8)   Payment of principal and interest, necessary reserves and
costs of issuance of any bonds or indebtedness used by the school board to pay
for growth necessitated improvements and additions to the school district, as
permitted under this section.
            (9)   Refund of fees, due under subsection B6 of this section.
         c.   Funds on deposit within the trust account shall not be used for
any expenditure that would be classified as a maintenance or repair expense.
         d.   All funds within the trust account not immediately utilized shall
be invested to the extent permitted by law and the interest deposited into said
account to be used as provided herein.
         e.   The fees collected pursuant to this section shall be returned if
not utilized, pursuant to subsection B6 of this section.
         f.   The school district receiving the fees shall enter into an
indemnification agreement with the city by which it equally shares the cost of
any legal challenge to this section.
         g.   The school district shall furnish to the city, on at least an
annual basis, documentation necessary to calculate the capital development fee.
      6.   Return Of Fee For Nonuse: The fee collected under this section shall
be returned to the then current owner of the property on behalf of which such
fee was paid if such fees have not been expended or encumbered prior to the end
of the fiscal year immediately following the eleventh anniversary of the date
such fee was paid. Refunds due under these circumstances shall be made only in
conformance with the following procedure:
         a.   The then current owner shall petition the city for the refund
prior to the end of the fiscal year immediately following the eleventh
anniversary of the date of payment of the fee.
         b.   The petition shall be submitted to the applicable school district
on a form approved by the city and shall contain:

owner of the property on behalf of which the fee was paid.
            (2)   A certified copy of the latest recorded deed, a
representation that said instrument reflects the exact names of the then
current owners, and that the petitioner shall notify the city of any change in
ownership occurring prior to issuance of any refund.
            (3)   A copy of the most recent ad valorem tax bill.
         c.   Within ninety (90) days from the receipt of the petition for
refund, the city will advise the petitioner pursuant to a written verification
from the applicable school district of the status of the fee requested for
refund, and if such fee has not been expended or encumbered within the
applicable time period, then it shall be returned to the petitioner. For
purposes of this section, fees collected shall be deemed to be spent or
encumbered on the basis of the first fee in shall be the first fee out.
      7.   Failure To File Petition For Refund: Any owner entitled to a refund
who fails to file a timely petition for a refund upon becoming eligible to do
so shall be deemed to have waived any claim for a refund, and the applicable
school district shall be entitled to retain and apply the fees for growth
necessitated capital improvements and additions to the school system. (Ord. 92-

any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
      3.   The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on
any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's stormwater discharge.
      4.   The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      5.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by
the operator.
      6.   Unreasonable delay in allowing the authorized enforcement agency
access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit
and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES
permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an
offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable
access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this chapter.
      7.   If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able
to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling programs designed to verify compliance with this
chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

11-8-11: BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES REQUIRED:
The authorized enforcement agency will adopt requirements identifying best
management practices for any activity, operation, or facility that may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drainage
system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial
or industrial establishment will provide, at its own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drainage system or watercourses through the use of
these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to
the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this
section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan
(SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 16-46, 9-19-2016)
11-8-12: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 16-46, 9-19-2016)
11-8-13: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials that are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drainage system, or waters of the United
States said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notice of violation shall be done by certified mail, or by
personal delivery with an affidavit by the agent serving notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an
on site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years. (Ord.
16-46, 9-19-2016)
11-8-14: ENFORCEMENT:
Whenever the authorized enforcement agency finds that a person has violated a

to the city by reason of such violation. The liability shall be paid in not
more than twelve (12) equal payments. Interest at the rate of one percent (1%)
per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the thirtieth day
following the assessment of the fine. All partial payments shall first be
allocated to accrued interest and then to the outstanding principal amount then

11-9-3: Applicability
11-9-4: Replacement Standards
11-9-5: Procedure For Appeals
11-9-6: Definitions
11-9-1: TITLE:
   This Chapter 9 of the Subdivision Code shall be known and cited as the
"Batavia Tree Preservation Ordinance" or "Tree Preservation Ordinance".
(Ord. 23-42, 11-20-2023)
11-9-2: PURPOSE:
   The purpose of this section is to maintain and preserve existing trees in
the City and its planning area to the greatest extent possible, while allowing
for responsible development of private property. The section intends to
minimize the unnecessary removal of trees and, when removed; their appropriate
replacement.
(Ord. 23-42, 11-20-2023)
11-9-3: APPLICABILITY:
   Existing trees may not be removed from lots on a development site within the
City, wholly or in part, without a tree preservation or removal plan approved
by the Planning and Zoning Officer. This section applies to the development or
redevelopment of any property. This section does not apply to the removal of
trees located in the public right of way or existing single family or two-
family dwelling properties. The following shall be considered exempt from the
tree preservation requirements:
   A.   Trees located within the Public Right of Way.
   B.   Trees located on an existing undeveloped single family, or two-family
(duplex) properties plated prior to November 20, 2023.
   C.   Trees located on an existing developed single family, or two-family
(duplex) dwelling property.

11-9-4: REPLACEMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Location: Replacement trees must be planted on the zoning lot in
question to the greatest extent possible. A tree required to be planted under
Title 10 - Zoning Code Regulations or planted in the parkway does not qualify
as a replacement tree. If the replacement cannot be planted on the zoning lot
in question, then the Planning and Zoning Officer will determine a suitable
location for the replacement trees or a fee-in lieu of the replacement trees in
accordance with this section.
   B.   Replacement Rate: The caliper diameter of a mature tree is measured at
its breast height. The tree removed must be replaced within one year of the
date of approval, or the applicant will be required to pay the city an amount
equal to the full value of the tree to be removed. In the event that a tree
designated for preservation is destroyed, damaged, or removed during
construction process, such tree must be replaced at a rate double of what is
specified under the appropriate replacement rate table. Trees determined to be
removed contravening this section within a three (3) year period prior to a
development application shall also be replaced at double the specified
replacement rate. If it is determined that tree removal has occurred prior to
approval from the Planning and Zoning Officer, a fine of up to two thousand two
hundred fifty dollars ($2,250.00) per day for each lot in violation.
   Table 1 Undesirable Tree List and Government Agency Replacement Rate
   A tree listed on the Undesirable Tree List under
11-9-4 shall be replaced at a rate defined in Table 1. A tree located on a
property owned by a government agency shall be replaced at a rate defined in
Table 1.
 
Caliper of Tree to be Removed Number of Replacement Trees Required
6 to 12 inches                1

   C.   Replacement Size: The minimum caliper size for a replacement tree shall
be 2.5 inches.
   D.   Tree Valuation: The value of a tree for replacement shall be a set rate
of four hundred dollars ($400.00) per tree required for replacement as
determined by Tables 11-9-4-B.1-3.
   E.   Fee-In-Lieu: A fee-in-lieu of providing replacement trees may be
permitted with the written approval of the Planning and Zoning Officer in
instances where they determine that the planting of such trees on-site is not
practical. The fee required will be based upon a uniform fee per replacement
set by this Chapter. Such payment must be placed into a fund to be used by the
city for the acquisition, installation, and maintenance of replacement trees in
the public right-of-way or a city owned property or other suitable publicly
owned property in the Batavia Planning Area. The lot granted the fee-in-lieu
for replacement trees must be credited permanently by Notice of Decision
identifying the number of trees for which payment was received by the city. In
the event a lot is seeking a fee-in-lieu that exceeds fifty thousand dollars
($50,000.00) for the replacement of trees this must be credited permanently by
resolution identifying the number of trees for which payment was received by
the City.
   F.   Special Relief From Tree Preservation Requirements: The Planning and
Zoning Officer may waive the requirement of tree replacement or fee-in-lieu, if
a tree was not planted under an approved landscape plan if one of the following
criteria is met:
      1.   The tree is dead, dying, diseased, or a threat to public health or
safety.
      2.   The tree interferes with the provision of public services or is a
hazard to traffic.

CHAPTER 6
CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS
SECTION:
12-6-1: Applicability
12-6-2: Criteria
12-6-3: Procedure
12-6-1: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   Except as provided herein, a certificate of appropriateness shall be
required before a building permit is issued for any designated historic
landmark or any building, structure or property or part thereof in any historic
district or within the territorial jurisdiction of the Batavia historic
preservation commission. It is required if the building, structure or property
will be subject to construction, alteration, repair, demolition, relocation or
other material change that produces a major change in the exterior appearance.
   B.   Minor alterations or other changes that are determined by the
commission to have no impact on historic and architectural resources shall not
require a certificate of appropriateness. The commission shall recommend a
description of such minor repairs, alterations or other changes for which the
director of community development is authorized to issue a building permit
without a certificate of appropriateness.
   C.   The requirement for a certificate of appropriateness may be waived in
emergency circumstances which require immediate relief, repair, or demolition,
where the fire chief or building commissioner determines that an emergency
exists.
   D.   In the case of partial or complete natural destruction or demolition of
a designated landmark or structure within a historic district, a certificate of
appropriateness will be required prior to reconstruction. (Ord. 09-16, 3-16-
2009)
12-6-2: CRITERIA:
In making a determination whether to approve or deny an application for a
certificate of appropriateness, the Batavia historic preservation commission
and the city council shall be guided by the following sets of standards:
   A.   United States Secretary Of The Interior's Standards For Rehabilitation:
      1.   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site environment.
      2.   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
      3.   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings shall not be undertaken.
      4.   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
      5.   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
that characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
      6.   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities, and where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.
      7.   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of the
structure, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
      8.   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
      9.   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
      10.   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   B.   Design Guidelines: In addition to the secretary of the interior's
design guidelines, further design guidelines for applying the criteria for
review of certificates of appropriateness may be developed and adopted by the
historic preservation commission. The historic preservation commission shall
adopt design guidelines for applying criteria for adopting certificates of
appropriateness including, but not limited to, the secretary of the interior's
guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings. The design guidelines shall
at a minimum consider the following architectural criteria:
      1.   Height: The height of any proposed alteration or construction should
be compatible with the style and character of the structure and with
surrounding structures.
      2.   Proportions Of Windows And Doors: The proportions and relationships
between doors and windows should be compatible with the architectural style and
character of the structure and with surrounding structures.
      3.   Relationship Of Building Masses And Spaces: The relationship of a
structure within a historic district to the open space between it and adjoining
structures should be compatible.
      4.   Roof Shape: The design of the roof, fascia, and cornice should be
compatible with the architectural style and character of the structure and with
the surrounding structures.
      5.   Landscaping: Landscaping should be compatible with the architectural
character and appearance of the structure.
      6.   Scale: The scale of the structure after alteration, construction, or
partial demolition should be compatible with its architectural style and
character and with surrounding structures.
      7.   Directional Expression: Facades in historic districts should blend
with other structures with regard to directional expression. Structures in a
historic district should be compatible with the dominant horizontal or vertical
expression of surrounding structures. The directional expression of a landmark
after alteration, construction, or partial demolition should be compatible with
its original architectural style and character.
      8.   Architectural Details: Architectural details including types of
materials, colors, and textures should be treated so as to make a structure
compatible with its original architectural style and character of the landmark
or historic district. (Ord. 09-16, 3-16-2009)
12-6-3: PROCEDURE:
   A.   Application For A Certificate Of Appropriateness:
      1.   Subject to the provisions of section
12-6-1 of this chapter, every applicant seeking a building, demolition or sign
permit affecting the exterior architectural appearance of buildings, structures
or properties that are designated as landmarks or lying within a historic
district shall be required to submit an application for a certificate of
appropriateness. Such application shall be filed with the commission, at the
community development department of the city of Batavia with accompanying plans
and specifications. A filing fee may be required, as established by the city
council.
      2.   The application for issuance of a certificate of appropriateness
shall contain all of the following:
         a.   Street address of the property involved;
         b.   Legal description of the property involved, as well as the PIN;
         c.   Brief description of the present improvements situated on the
property;
         d.   A detailed description of the construction, alteration,
demolition or use proposed together with any architect drawings or sketches if
those services have been utilized by the applicant and if not, a sufficient
description of the construction, alteration, demolition, and use to allow the
determination of what final appearance and use of the real estate will be;
         e.   Owner's or beneficial owner's name and signature(s);
         f.   Developer's name, if different than owner, and signature;
         g.   Architect's name;
         h.   A filing fee if required;
         i.   Any other information that may be deemed necessary.
   B.   Historic Preservation Review Procedure:
      1.   The historic preservation commission shall review the application
for certificates of appropriateness at a public meeting within fifteen (15)
days of receipt of the application. At that time the historic preservation
commission will determine any additional information required to deem the
application complete.
      2.   If the historic preservation commission finds at its initial review
that the application merits further consideration, then the commission may
continue the request once until its next regularly scheduled meeting or a
maximum of fifteen (15) days, unless a further extension is consented to by the
applicant in writing.
      3.   The historic preservation commission shall process the application
as expeditiously as possible. At the next regularly scheduled meeting following
the receipt of the commission's requested information, a decision by the
Batavia historic preservation commission on the application shall be made. Upon
approval of the application, the commission shall direct the director of
community development to issue a signed certificate of appropriateness to the
applicant with copies forwarded to the building commissioner.
      4.   A certificate of appropriateness shall be invalid if major
adjustments, as determined by the director of community development, to the
plans reviewed by the commission, are necessary to obtain a building permit, or
if the building permit issued for the same work becomes invalid for any reason.
A building permit application shall be filed within one year from the date of
approval of the certificate of appropriateness or the certificate of
appropriateness shall become null and void.
      5.   All applications for demolition of entire buildings or structures
that are either landmarked or located within a historic district shall require
the approval of the city council upon recommendation of the commission. The
historic preservation commission, in making a determination whether to
recommend approval or denial of an application for demolition, and the city
council in acting on the recommendation, shall be guided by the following
procedures and standards.
   C.   Demolition Review Procedures And Standards: All demolition proposals
for properties located within a historic district, or that are locally
landmarked, require an application for a certificate of appropriateness.
Consultation with the BHPC staff prior to submitting an application is strongly
encouraged. The review process consists of at least two (2) public meetings,
and is structured to give ample time to the community, the applicant and the
BHPC to obtain information and study the proposal thoroughly. Applicants or
property owners will need to attend all meetings where the application is
discussed. Where demolition of a secondary or noncontributing structure is
proposed, the BHPC may at its discretion decide to streamline this process.
      1.   First Public Meeting:
         a.   The first public meeting will be held to consider the
architectural and historical significance of the building and to initially
review and discuss the proposed demolition. The BHPC may call upon expert
witnesses as needed. Applicants may also present testimony as to the
significance of the structure. The BHPC may schedule a site visit to the
property prior to formal consideration of the application.
         b.   Next, the BHPC will determine whether sufficient information has
been submitted with the application to allow thorough review, and whether all
alternatives to demolition have been considered (see "Documentation
Requirements Supporting Demolition", below).
         c.   If the BHPC finds that the documentation is complete and all
alternatives to demolition have been considered, it will vote to accept the
application and schedule the application for review at the next regular
meeting. If the application cannot be accepted because additional information
is needed, then the preliminary meeting will be continued until the next
regular BHPC meeting or such time as the additional information can be
submitted. The application is considered formally accepted as of the date of
the vote to accept it.
      2.   Second Public Meeting:
         a.   The BHPC will review the application using the review criteria
listed below. The criteria may vary depending on whether the structure was
determined to be significant, contributing or noncontributing in the district,
or if it is a landmarked property.
         b.   At the second meeting the BHPC will also preliminarily review any
claim of economic hardship (see "economic hardship" guidelines).
         c.   All applications for demolition of entire buildings or structures
that are either landmarked or located within a historic district shall require
the approval of the city council upon recommendation of the historic
preservation commission.
   D.   Review Criteria: The Batavia historic preservation commission shall use
the following criteria for review:
      1.   Significant Or Contributing Structures Or Landmarked Properties: If
the structure is deemed significant or contributing, or is a landmarked
property, then at least one of the following requirements must be met in order
for the BHPC to recommend approval of the demolition:
         a.   Retention of the structure constitutes a hazard to public safety,
which hazard cannot be eliminated by economic means available to the owner,
including the sale of the structure on its present site to any purchaser
willing to preserve the structure.
         b.   Preservation of the structure is a deterrent to a major
improvement program, which will be of substantial benefit to the community.
         c.   Preservation of the structure would cause an undue and
unreasonable financial hardship to the owner, taking into account the financial
resources available to the owner including the sale of the structure to any
purchaser willing to preserve the structure.
         d.   Preservation of the structure would not be in the interest of the
majority of the community.
      2.   Secondary Factors: If one or more of the primary criteria have been
met, then the BHPC may consider any or all of the following secondary factors
in deciding whether to recommend approval or denial of the application:
         a.   The effect of the demolition on the surrounding buildings.
         b.   The effect of the demolition on the historic district as a whole.
         c.   The value or usefulness of any replacement structure to the
community, and the appropriateness of its design to the historic district.
         d.   If the lot is to be left open, how the space will be treated and
the impact on the district as a whole.
         e.   The effect of the demolition on the local economy.
         f.   Whether the demolition will foster civic beauty.
         g.   The effect of the demolition on safeguarding the heritage of the
city, state or nation.
         h.   The effect of the demolition on promotion of the district for the
education, pleasure and welfare of the citizens of the city.
      3.   Noncontributing Structures: If a structure is deemed
noncontributing, the BHPC may consider any or all of the secondary criteria
above in deciding whether to recommend approval of a certificate of
appropriateness for demolition.
   E.   Emergency Demolition: The requirement for a certificate of
appropriateness may be waived in emergency circumstances, which require
immediate relief, repair, or demolition, where the fire chief or building
commissioner determines that an emergency exists.
   F.   Documentation Requirements Supporting Demolition:
      1.   Consideration by the property owner of profitable adaptive uses for
the property.
      2.   A report from a licensed architect or engineer with experience in
rehabilitation as to the structural soundness of any structures on the property
and their suitability for rehabilitation.
      3.   An estimate from an architect, developer, real estate consultant,
appraiser, or other real estate professional experienced in rehabilitation as
to the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of the existing
structure on the property including removal of the structure for preservation
on a new site.
      4.   Any other information necessary to determine if the property can be
reasonably used or yield a reasonable return to present or future owners.
   G.   Demolition Certificate Of Appropriateness Process:
      1.   The BHPC shall consider the application for a certificate of
appropriateness for demolition, and shall make a recommendation of approval,
approval with conditions or modifications, or denial. The commission may
suggest changes in the proposal that would cause the commission to reconsider
the application.
      2.   The recommendation of the BHPC shall be forwarded to the community
development committee (CDC) of the city council for its review. The CDC shall
review the historic preservation commission's recommendation, including
minutes, the application and any other documentation reviewed by the BHPC, and
shall make a recommendation to the full city council.
      3.   The city council shall review the recommendations of the community
development committee and historic preservation commission, including the
minutes, the application and any other documentation reviewed by them. The city
council may approve, approve with conditions or modifications, or deny the
application for a certificate of appropriateness, by the adoption of an
appropriate resolution. The city council's decision in the matter shall be
final subject only to administrative or judicial review as provided by law.
(Ord. 09-16, 3-16-2009)

commission to reconsider the application.
      2.   Within sixty (60) days of sending the notification of denial, the
applicant may submit an amended application.
      3.   The historic preservation commission shall consider an amended
application within fifteen (15) days of receipt.

provided by the director of community development.
      5.   If appealed, the community development committee of the city council
shall review the historic preservation commission's decision, including its
minutes, the application and any other documentation reviewed by the historic
preservation commission, and make a recommendation to the city council to
approve or deny a certificate of appropriateness. Information not considered by
the historic preservation commission shall not be considered by the community
development committee or city council in the review of the appeal.
      6.   The city council shall review the appeal of a denial of a
certificate of appropriateness in accordance with the recommendations of the
commission and committee. The city council may thereafter affirm the denial of
the certificate of appropriateness in accordance with the decision of the
commission, or, if the city council finds that the applicable criteria of this
section for granting a certificate of appropriateness are met, it may overrule
the commission's decision and approve a COA by the adoption of an appropriate
resolution.
      7.   The city council's decision in this matter shall be final subject
only to administrative or judicial review as provided by law. (Ord. 10-36, 11-
