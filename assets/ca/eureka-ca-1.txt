include the testimony of other witnesses, or the introduction of documents or
other evidence. Such testimony, written documents, or other evidence sought to

except for the rule that it shall be relevant and material to the issues of
whether the violation alleged in the citation occurred and whether the person
cited committed, caused or was responsible for the violation.

administrative hearing in person or by an authorized representative, a person
contesting an administrative citation may request that the hearing officer
decide the matter based on the face of the citation and any other documentary
evidence submitted by the person cited or the enforcing department prior to the
date of the hearing.
   (C)   Failure to appear at hearing. The failure of any person requesting an
administrative hearing to appear at the hearing in person or by an authorized
representative shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to be personally
present at the hearing and the hearing officer shall decide the matter based
upon the citation, any written materials which have previously been submitted
in anticipation of the hearing, and any other evidence which may be presented
at the hearing by the enforcement officer.
   (D)   Attendance of enforcement officer. The enforcement officer who issued
the administrative citation may, but is not required to, attend the

photographs or other documentation regarding the violation for consideration at
the hearing.

§ 10.53 DISPOSITION OF ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   If the hearing officer determines that the administrative citation should be
upheld, then the fine amount on deposit with the city shall be retained by the
city. If the fine was deposited with the city and the hearing officer
determines that the administrative citation should be canceled, the city shall
refund the amount of the deposited fine. If, pursuant to a hardship waiver, the
fine has not been deposited with the city, and the hearing officer determines
that the administrative citation should be upheld, the due date for the payment
of the fine shall be 30 calendar days from the date of service of the hearing
officer's decision.

(Ord. 638-C.S., passed 2-6-01; Am. Ord. 746-C.S., passed 11-17-09)
§ 10.57 LIEN PROCEDURE GENERALLY.
   (A)   Whenever an administrative fine has been imposed pursuant to this
subchapter on an owner of property for a violation occurring or existing on
that property and the fine has not been fully paid within 60 calendar days of
the date upon which such fine became due and payable, and is not the subject of
a pending appeal filed under Cal. Gov't Code § 53069.4, the finance officer may
initiate proceedings to establish and record a lien against the property.
   (B)   Prior to the recording of the lien, the finance officer shall prepare
and file with the City Clerk a report stating, for each property for which a
lien is proposed, the amount of the delinquent administrative fine, any
applicable penalties and interest, and an administrative fee established by
resolution of the City Council to recover the administrative costs incurred in
recording the lien and carrying out the lien procedures of this subchapter.
   (C)   The City Clerk shall fix a time, date, and place for hearing by the
City Council of the report and any protests or objections thereto.
   (D)   The finance officer shall cause written notice to be served on the
owner of each affected property not less than ten days prior to the time set
for the hearing. Such notice shall set forth the amount of the delinquent
administrative fine and any penalties and interest which are due. Such notice
shall be delivered by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to each
owner of such property to be assessed as that owner's address appears on the
last equalized assessment roll or supplemental roll of the County of Humboldt,
whichever is more current. Service by mail as provided for herein shall be
effective on the date of mailing, and the failure of any person to actually
receive such notice shall not affect the validity of the notice.
   (E)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Council may adopt a
resolution confirming, discharging, or modifying the amount of the lien
proposed for each affected property and order that the amount not discharged as
to any property be reduced to a lien against that property. The City Council
may thereupon order that the fee be specifically assessed against the property
involved. If the City Council orders that the fee be specially assessed against
the property, it shall confirm the assessment; and
   (F)   Thereafter said assessment may be collected at the same time and in
the same manner as ordinary real property taxes are collected and shall be
subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of
delinquency as provided for ordinary real property taxes. All laws applicable
to the levy, collection, and enforcement of real property taxes are applicable
to the special assessment.
   (G)   A lien may be foreclosed by an action brought by the city for a money
judgment.
   (H)   The city may recover from the property owner any costs incurred
regarding the process and recording of the lien and providing notice to the
property owner as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien.

   Once payment in full is received by the city for outstanding administrative
fines, penalties, interest, and administrative fees, the finance officer shall
provide the property owner or concerned escrow company or financial institution
with a notice of satisfaction of lien for recordation with the office of the
county recorder. Recordation of the notice of satisfaction shall cancel the
city's lien.

caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this
code, or the provisions of any code adopted by reference by this code, shall be

   The City Council hereby declares that this subchapter is adopted to achieve
the following, among other purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be
interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:
   (A)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the
requirements and limitations contained in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Div. 2, Part
1.5;
   (B)   To adopt a sales aid use tax ordinance which incorporates provisions
identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state insofar as those
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained
in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Div. 2, Part 1.5;
   (C)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and
provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State
Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable
to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes;
   (D)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a
manner that will, to the degree possible, be consistent with the provisions of
Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Div. 2, Part 1.5, minimize the cost of collecting city
sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping
upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this subchapter.
('63 Code, § 8-4.04) (Ord. 397-C.S., passed 12-20-83)
§ 35.053 CONTRACT WITH STATE.
   Prior to the operative date of this subchapter, this city shall contract
with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the
administration and operation of this sales and use tax ordinance; provided,
that if this city shall not have contracted with the State Board of
Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and
in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar
quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of
the first calendar quarter following the adoption of this subchapter.
('63 Code, § 8-4.05) (Ord. 397-C.S., passed 12-20-83)
§ 35.054 SALES TAX; PLACE OF SALE.
   (A)   Sales tax. For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at
retail a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate
stated in § 35.051 of this subchapter of the gross receipts of the retailer
from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in this city on
and after the operative date.
('63 Code, § 8-4.06)
   (B)   Place of sale. For the purposes of this subchapter, all retail sales
are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible
personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-
state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state
destination. The gross receipts from such sale shall include delivery charges,
when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the
place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place
of business in the state or has more than one place of business, the place or
places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under
rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of
Equalization.
('63 Code, § 8-4.07)
(Ord. 397-C.S., passed 12-20-83)

35.051 of this subchapter of the sales price of the property. The sales price
shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to state sales or
use tax regardless of the place to which delivery is made.
('63 Code, § 8-4.08) (Ord. 397-C.S., passed 12-20-83)
§ 35.056 ADOPTION OF PROVISION OF STATE LAW; LIMITATION.

this subchapter and except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions
of Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Part 1.5 of Division 2, all of the provisions of Cal.
Rev. & Tax. Code Part 1 of Division 2 are hereby adopted and made a part of
this subchapter as though fully set forth herein.
('63 Code, § 8-4.09)
   (B)   Limitation on adoption of state law. In adopting the provisions of
Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Part 1 of Division 2, wherever the state is named or
referred to as the taxing agency, the name of this city shall be substituted
therefor. The substitution, however, shall not be made when the word “State” is
used as part of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the
State Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, the State Treasury, or
the Constitution of the State of California; the substitution shall not be made
when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or
against the city, or any agency thereof rather than by or against the State
Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the
administration or operation of this subchapter; the substitution shall not be
made in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections
referring to the exterior boundaries of the state, where the result of the
substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with respect to
certain sales, storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property
which would otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use,
or other consumption remain subject to tax by the state under the provisions of
Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Part 1 of Division 2 or to impose this tax with respect
to certain sales, storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal
property which would not be subject to tax by the state under the said
provisions of that code; the substitution shall not be made in Cal. Rev. & Tax.
Code, §§ 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737,
6797 or 6828; and the substitution shall not be made for the word “State” in
the phrase “retailer engaged in business in this State” in Cal. Rev. & Tax.
Code § 6203 or in the definition of that phrase in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §
6203.

(Ord. 397-C.S., passed 12-20-83)
§ 35.057 PERMIT NOT REQUIRED.

§ 35.058 EXCLUSIONS AND EXEMPTIONS.

imposed by the state on a retailer or consumer.

the gross receipts from the sale of which have been subject to tax under a
sales and use tax ordinance enacted in accordance with Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code
Part 1.5 of Division 2 by any city and county, county, or city in this state
shall be exempt from the tax due under this subchapter.
   (C)   There are exempted from the computation of the amount of the sales tax

is made and directly and exclusively in the use of such aircraft as common
carriers of persons or property under the authority of the laws of this state,
the United States, or any foreign government.
   (D)   In addition to the exemptions provided in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code, §§
6366 and 6366.1, the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal
property purchased by operators of aircraft and used or consumed by such
operators directly and exclusively in the use of such aircraft as common
carriers of persons or property for hire or compensation under a certificate of
public convenience and necessity issued pursuant to the laws of this state, the

§ 35.060 ENJOINING COLLECTION FORBIDDEN.
   No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall
issue in any suit, action, or proceeding in any court against the state or this
city, or against any officer of the state or this city, to prevent or enjoin

Law” of the city.

§ 35.071 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   OCCUPANCY. The use or possession, or the right to use or possession, of any
public or private campground, of any room, or portion thereof, in any transient
accommodation for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes.
   OPERATOR. The person who is the proprietor of the transient accommodation,
whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession,
licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions
through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the
managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this
subchapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal.
Compliance with the provisions of this subchapter by either the principal or
the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   PERSON. Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association,
social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate,
trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or
combination acting as a unit.
   RENT. The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy
of space in a transient accommodation valued in money, whether to be received
in money, goods, labor, or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits,
property, and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   TRANSIENT ACCOMMODATION. Any structure, or any portion of any structure, or
public or private campground which is occupied, or intended or designed for
occupancy, by transients for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes and shall
include any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor
hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or
private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other
similar structure, or public or private campground, or portion thereof.
   TRANSIENT. Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by
reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for
a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar
days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in transient
accommodation shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has
expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and
occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a
person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and
subsequent to the effective date of the provisions of this subchapter may be
considered.

   For the privilege of occupancy in any transient accommodation, each
transient shall be subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of 10% of the
rent charged by the operator on or after January 1, 2009. Such tax shall
constitute a debt owed by the transient to the city, which debt shall be
extinguished only by paying to the operator or to the city. The transient shall
pay the tax to the operator of the transient accommodation at the time rent is
paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax
shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the
transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the transient accommodation. If for any
reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the transient accommodation,
the Director of Finance may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the
Director of Finance.

§ 35.078 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect such tax and to make within
the time provided in this subchapter, any report and remittance of such tax, or
any portion thereof required by the provisions of this subchapter, the Director
of Finance shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain the facts
and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the
Director of Finance shall procure such facts and information as he is able to
obtain upon which to base the assessments of any such tax imposed by the
provisions of this subchapter and payable by any operator who has failed or
refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the
Director of Finance shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator
the tax, interest, and penalties provided for by the provisions of this
subchapter. In the event such determination is made, the Director of Finance
shall give notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by
depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the
operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may,
within ten days after the service or mailing of such notice, make an
application in writing to the Director of Finance for a hearing on the amount
assessed. If an application by the operator for a hearing is not made within
the time prescribed, the tax, interest, and penalties, if any, determined by
the Director of Finance shall become final and conclusive and immediately due
and payable. If such an application is made, the Director of Finance shall give
not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this
section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in notice why
the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and
penalties. At such hearing the operator may appear and offer evidence why such
specified tax, interest, and penalties shall not be so fixed. After such
hearing the Director of Finance shall determine the proper tax to be remitted
and shall thereafter give written notice to the operator in the manner
prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such tax,
interest, and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable 15
days after the service or mailing of such notice unless an appeal is filed as
provided in § 35.079 of this section.

respect to the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties, if any, may appeal
to the Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 15 days
after the service or mailing of the determination of the tax due. The Council
shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall
give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The
findings of the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon
the appellant in the manner prescribed in this subchapter for the service of a
notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and
payable upon the service of notice.
   (B)   No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process
shall issue in any suit, action or proceeding in any court against the city or
an officer thereof, to prevent or enjoin the collection of taxes sought to be
collected pursuant to this chapter and payment of all tax, interest and
penalties shall be required as a condition precedent to seeking judicial review
of any tax liability.

   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment
to the city of any tax imposed by the provisions of this subchapter to keep and

§ 35.081 REFUNDS.
   (A)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest, or penalty has been
overpaid, or paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the city pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter, such amount
may be refunded as provided in divisions (B) and (C) of this section provided a
claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific
grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the Director of Finance
within three years after the date of payment. This claim shall be on forms
furnished by the Director of Finance.
   (B)   Any operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Director of Finance that the person from whom the tax has
been collected was not a transient; provided, however, neither a refund nor a
credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the
transient to the operator.
   (C)   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, paid more than
once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a
claim in the manner provided in division (A) of this section but only when the
tax was paid by the transient directly to the Director of Finance or when the
transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction
of the Director of Finance that the transient has been unable to obtain a
refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (D)   No refund shall be paid pursuant to the provisions of this section
unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.

§ 35.082 ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   (A)   Actions to collect. Any tax required to be paid by any transient under
the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to
the city. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the
city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing
money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an
action brought in the name of the City of Eureka for the recovery of such
amount.
   (B)   Recording tax lien. If any amount required to be paid to the city
under this chapter is not paid when due, the Finance Director may record in the
Office of the Humboldt County Recorder a certificate which specifies the amount
of tax, penalties and interest due, the name and address of the operator owing
the tax and liable therefor as it appears on the tax assessment roll, and the
fact that the Finance Director has complied with all provisions of this chapter
in the determination of the tax, interest and penalties required to be paid.
From the date of recording in the Office of the Humboldt County Recorder, the
amount to be paid together with interest and penalties shall constitute a lien
upon the real property in the county owned by the operator or acquired by the
operator afterwards and before the lien expires. The lien shall have the force,
effect and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for ten years from
the time of recordation of the lien unless sooner released or otherwise
discharged.
   (C)   Assessment and lien. Whenever delinquent taxes and penalties are not
paid to the city after proper notice, the total uncollected amount including
tax, penalties and administrative fees may become assessments, and the City
Clerk may compile a list of such assessments together with parcel number
designations and addresses upon which the assessments are being fixed. After
notice and hearing, and upon confirmation of the imposition of the liens by
resolution of the City Council, the City Clerk shall file a certified copy of
the approved resolution with the Humboldt County Tax Collector, directing that
all unpaid transient occupancy taxes, penalties and administrative fees be
entered as lien charges against said property as it appears on the current
assessment roll. Liens shall be collected at the same time and in the same
manner, subject to the same penalties and interest upon delinquencies, as the
general real property taxes are collected for the city. The City Clerk shall
present for recording appropriate notices of the imposition of these liens with
the Humboldt County Recorder.
   (D)   No lien preference. Nothing in this chapter shall give the city a
preference over any recorded lien which attached prior to the date when the
amounts required to be paid became a lien.
   (E)   Remedies not exclusive. The remedies and penalties provided for in
this chapter shall be cumulative and not exclusive, and shall not supersede or
limit any and all other remedies that may be available.

§ 35.083 PAYMENT OF TAXES PRIOR TO REFUND OR JUDICIAL RELIEF.
   No legal or equitable process shall be issued in any proceeding in any court
against the city or any officer to prevent or enjoin the collection of any tax
sought to be collected pursuant to this chapter, and payment of all tax,
interest and penalties shall be required as a condition precedent to seeking
judicial review of any tax liability.

§ 35.084 VIOLATIONS OF PROVISIONS.
   Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required,
or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to
furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the Director of
Finance, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor. Any person required to make, render, sign, or verity any
report or claim and who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with
intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by the
provisions of this subchapter to be made shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

      (3)   In those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to
sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the State of California, where
the result of the substitution would be to:
         (a)   Provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain

         (b)   Impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or
other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to
tax by the state under the said provision of that code; or
      (4)   In §§ 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715,
6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code.

institutions in containing costs and thereby to enable such health institutions
to establish lower rates and charges than would otherwise prevail and to
provide better service at such rates and charges. Unless the city intervenes to
provide such financing, such rates and charges may increase at an ever
accelerated pace because such health institutions cannot obtain financing at
equivalent cost from private sources.

invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this
chapter are declared to be severable. The Council hereby declares that it would
have adopted and passed this ordinance and each ordinance, section, subsection,

VOTING
§ 37.20 RANKED CHOICE VOTING.
   (A)   Definitions. For purposes of this subchapter, the following words,
terms and phrases have these definitions:
      CHOICE. An indication on a ballot of a voter's assigned ranking of
candidates (i.e., first choice, second choice, third choice, etc.) for any
single office, according to the voter's preference.
      CONTINUING BALLOT. A ballot that counts towards a continuing candidate.
      CONTINUING CANDIDATE. A candidate that has not been eliminated. In the
first round of counting, this means all candidates including write-ins.
      EXHAUSTED BALLOT. A ballot whose continuing candidates have all been
eliminated shall be declared "exhausted" and shall not count towards any
candidate in that round or in subsequent rounds.
      FINAL ROUND. The round in which there are only two continuing candidates.
      MAJORITY OF VOTES. Fifty percent of the votes plus one.
      NEXT RANKED. The highest ranked choice for a continuing candidate.
      OVERVOTING. An overvote occurs when an elector has ranked more than one
candidate for the same ranking. For example, if an elector selects more than
one candidate to be their first (or second, or third, etc.) choice.
      RANKED CHOICE VOTING. An election system in which voters rank the
candidates for office in order of preference, and the ballots are counted in
rounds that simulate a series of runoffs until the final round, whereupon the
one of those two candidates with the majority of votes is determined to be the
winner. RANKED CHOICE VOTING is also known as "instant runoff voting."
      ROUND OF COUNTING or ROUND. A step in the counting process during which
votes for all continuing candidates are tabulated for the purpose of
determining which candidate has achieved a majority of the votes cast for a
particular office, and, if no candidate has achieved a majority, which
candidate or candidates must be eliminated.
      SKIPPED RANKING. Occurs when an elector leaves a ranking blank and then
ranks a candidate in a subsequent ranking. For example, if an elector selects a
first-choice candidate and a third-choice candidate, but does not select a
second-choice candidate.
      UNDERVOTING. A ballot that has not candidates indicated at any ranking
shall be declared an "undervote" and shall not count towards any candidate in
that round or in subsequent rounds.
      VOTE.  A ballot choice that is counted toward the election of a
candidate. During each round of counting, each continuing ballot contains one
vote. All first choices are votes and lower ranked choices are potential runoff
votes that may, in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, become
votes that are subsequently credited for a continuing candidate.
(Ord. 928-C.S., passed 12-7-21; Am. Ord. 955-C.S., passed 7-16-24)
§ 37.21 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Ranked choice voting elections for the offices of Mayor and City
Council member must be conducted according to the procedures in this chapter.
   (B)   Ranked choice voting will commence not later than the 2024 General
Municipal Election and continue thereafter for all general municipal elections.
   (C)   The City Elections Official must coordinate with the Humboldt County
Registrar of Voters to implement ranked choice voting in the 2022 General
Municipal Election if that implementation is feasible.
   (D)   The agreement of the Humboldt County Registrar of Voters is a
precondition to the election services that allow the city to use ranked choice
voting and to consolidate the city's municipal election with November General
Elections prior to the use of ranked choice voting.
   (E)   Once a candidate receives a majority of the votes, the County's
Registrar of Voters is not required to continue counting to determine the
candidate ranking beyond first place.
   (F)   The County's Registrar of Voters will report the results of the first
round of tabulations and the final round of tabulations. The County's Registrar
of Voters is not required to report every round of tabulations.
   (G)   In the event that any ballot reaches a ranking with two or more
different candidates indicated, that ballot shall immediately be declared an
"overvote" and that ballot shall not count as a vote for any candidate in that
round or in subsequent rounds.
(Ord. 928-C.S., passed 12-7-21; Am. Ord. 955-C.S., passed 7-16-24)
§ 37.22 RANKED CHOICE VOTING BALLOT.
   (A)   In any Mayoral or Council member election conducted by ranked choice
voting, the ballot must allow voters to rank not less than three candidates,
including write-in candidates, in order of preference.
   (B)   The ballot must not interfere with a voter's ability to rank up to
three write-in candidates.
(Ord. 928-C.S., passed 12-7-21; Am. Ord. 955-C.S., passed 7-16-24)
§ 37.23 TABULATION.
   The ballots for each seat must be counted in rounds.
   (A)   In the first round, every ballot counts as a vote for the first-choice
candidate on that ballot.
   (B)   If no candidate receives a majority in the first or a subsequent
round, the candidate receiving the fewest number of votes in that round is
eliminated.
   (C)   Every ballot counting towards the eliminated candidate is then counted
again for votes cast for the next-ranked continuing candidate. All the
continuing ballots for all continuing candidates are then tabulated in a new
round.
   (D)   Where a skipped ranking situation arises, the elector's votes will be
counted as if no skipped ranking had occurred, and the County's Registrar of
Voters is directed to count the elector's next-ranked choice in the next round,
whether or not the choice is accurately sequentially numbered. In the example
above, this means that the elector's third-choice candidate would be counted as
the elector's second-choice candidate, and so on.
   (E)   In the final round, the candidate who receives the majority of votes
from the continuing ballots is the winner. If two candidates in the final round
are tied, the winner will be the tied candidate who received the higher number
of votes in round one.
   (F)   In the event that there is a tie in any other rank or round besides
the top two candidates in the final round, the candidate who is eliminated will
be selected by lot (e.g. by a coin flip or other random metric), unless such
selection is not necessary because a top candidate has already been determined.

sent by mail or email to at least three qualified bidders, whenever possible,
which may include contractors on the Qualified Contractors List.
      (2)   Bids in excess of informal bidding amount. If all bids received are
in excess of threshold amount for informal bidding the Council may award the
contract to the responsible bidder that submitted the lowest responsive bid, if
the Council determines that the cost estimate used as the basis for using
informal bidding was reasonable.
   (D)   Formal bidding. The notice inviting bids for contracts subject to
formal bidding, as set forth above, will be published as specified in the
Procurement Policies and Procedures, and will be subject to the provisions of
subsection (E), below.
   (E)   Requirements for informal and formal bidding.  Public works
procurements using informal bidding or formal bidding are subject to the
following provisions and as further specified in the Procurement Policies and
Procedures and subsection (F), below:
      (1)   Notice inviting bids. The notice inviting bids will be prepared
using the form approved by the Purchasing Agent, and must generally describe
the proposed project, describe how to obtain more detailed information, state
the time and place for bid submission, and provide such other information
required by laws. For formal bids, the bid documents must require submission of
bid security in the amount of 10% of the maximum bid price, as further
specified in the Procurement Policies and Procedures.
      (2)   Prequalified contractors. If the city chooses to prequalify
contractors, the notice inviting bids will only be sent to prequalified
contractors pursuant to subsection (A), above.
      (3)   Notice required. Notice to prospective bidders must be provided in
the manner required by the Procurement Policies and Procedures for informal
bidding or formal bidding, as applicable.
      (4)   Bid opening procedure — informal bids.
         (a)   Submittal. Bids will be submitted to the purchasing agent or his
or her designee by the time stated in the notice inviting bids. For contracts
subject to prevailing wage requirements, the bidding instructions must require
that the bidder's DIR registration number be submitted with the bid, and city
staff will check online to confirm that the bidder is currently registered with
the DIR before opening the bid. Bids that are submitted after the stated
deadline for bid submission, or bids for which staff determines that the bidder
lacks the required DIR registration will be returned.
         (b)   Opening. Bids will be opened at the time stated in the notice
inviting bids.
      (5)   Bid opening procedure — formal bids.
         (a)   Sealed bids. Bids must be submitted to the Purchasing Agent or
his or her designee in sealed envelopes, each identified as a bid on the
envelope. For contracts subject to prevailing wage requirements, the bidding
instructions must require that the bidder's DIR registration number be included
on the outside of the envelope, and city staff will check online to confirm
that the bidder is currently registered with the DIR before opening the bid.
Bids that are submitted after the stated deadline for bid submission, or bids
for which staff determines that the bidder lacks the required DIR registration
will be returned unopened.
         (b)   Opening. Bids will be opened in public at the time and place
stated in the notice inviting bids.
      (6)   Basis for award. The contract will be awarded, if at all, to the
responsible bidder that submits the lowest responsive bid.
   (F)   Bid security and bonds. For formal bids, each bid must be accompanied
by bid security in the amount of 10% of the maximum bid price (including
additive alternates, if applicable), in the form of cash or as a cashier's
check, certified check, or bid bond payable to the city. For any public works
contract over $60,000, the successful bidder will be required to provide a
payment bond and a performance bond, each for an amount equal to 100% of the
contract price, as a condition to performing any work on the project. Any bond
submitted pursuant to this subsection must be issued by a bond surety that is
admitted in California and on a bond form approved by the Purchasing Agent.
   (G)   Change orders. For purposes of complying with Charter Section 710
(Public Works), change orders affecting the scope of work, time requirements,
cost, or other substantive provisions affecting the city's interest are deemed
to be approved by the Council, provided the City Manager recommends the change
order, and (1) the change order cost falls within the change order contingency
previously approved for the contract, or (2) the change order cost does not
exceed the Purchasing Agent's approval authority.
   (H)   Alternative procurement methods authorized. Subject to authorization
by the Council and the limitations of laws, the city may use an alternative
procurement method for bidding on public works in excess of $1,000,000.
Alternative procurement methods may include design-build, design-build-operate,
construction-manager-at-risk, lease-leaseback, or any other procurement
methodology specifically approved by the Council and determined to be in the
city's best interests. The Purchasing Agent is expressly authorized to consider
award on the basis of "best value," which may be based on objective criteria
that may include, but not be limited to, price, features, functions, life-cycle
costs, experience, and past performance.
   (I)   Task order contract. A Master Agreement for performing minor
improvements and repairs on a task order basis, including pothole, sidewalk, or
utility pole repairs, may be awarded subject to the same competitive
procurement requirements that apply to any other public works contract, as may
be further specified in the Procurement Policies and Procedures.

§ 39.40 PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.
   (A)   Criteria.  Contracts for services may be awarded based on criteria
including, but not limited to, price, rates, demonstrated competence, and the
experience and qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the
services required. In selecting an individual or firm to provide required
services, any of the following may be considered:
      (1)   Experience on similar projects or providing similar services and
record of performance on previous contracts.
      (2)   The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and
efficiency of the firm, and personnel proposed to provide the services.
      (3)   The ability, capacity, and skill to perform the services.
      (4)   The proposed approach to complete the necessary elements of the
required services.
      (5)   The proposed lump sum fee and/or rate schedule for providing the

   (B)   Vendors List.  Service contracts estimated to cost over $60,000 and up
to $200,000 may be procured from qualified service providers on the Vendors
List, if established, in accordance with informal competitive procurement
procedures that may be provided in the Procurement Policies and Procedures. If
no Vendors List is established or if there are insufficient qualified service
providers for the required services on the Vendors List, the services will be
procured by a request for proposals or request for qualifications, as may be
further specified in the Procurement Policies and Procedures.
   (C)   Competitive procurement of services.  Service contracts estimated to
cost in excess of $200,000 will be procured by (1) request for proposals for

qualifications for service contracts for ongoing or on-call services, or by a
combination of both methods, as may be further specified in the Procurement
Policies and Procedures.
   (D)   "Architectural and engineering services." Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in this subchapter, all contracts for "architectural

to include all architectural, landscape architectural, environmental,
engineering, land surveying, and construction project management services, will
be procured pursuant to a fair, competitive selection process as specified in
Cal. Government Code § 4529.12, and as may be further specified in the
Procurement Policies and Procedures.
   (E)   Professional services. For professional service contracts other than
for "architectural and engineering services," as defined above, that will be
(1) less than $100,000, and (2) can be provided by a well-qualified local
business, the Purchasing Agent, or designated department may negotiate with a
local business for the services subject to prior approval from the Council.
   (F)   Grant funded projects. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
in this subchapter, alternate procurement procedures that are more restrictive
may be used to comply with conditions applicable to grant funding.
   (G)   Master Agreement for services. A Master Agreement for performing
ongoing or on-call services, may be awarded subject to the same competitive
procurement requirements that generally apply to contracts for the underlying
services, as may be further specified in the Procurement Policies and

§ 39.41 EXCEPTIONS TO COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.
   Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter to the contrary, but
subject to the limits of laws, the following procurements may be made without
any competitive procurement process.
   (A)   Sole source. A purchase may be made or contract awarded without a
competitive procurement process when there is only one reasonable and
practicable source for the required goods or services because of the unique
quality of the goods or services; availability; compatibility with existing
city programs, equipment or systems; or fitness for a particular use. Such a
sole source purchase must be determined to meet the Procurement Policies and
Procedures and be recommended for approval by the Purchasing Agent and be
approved by the Council.
   (B)   City's best interest. Except where otherwise required by laws or by
applicable funding conditions, goods and services may be obtained by negotiated
contract and without a competitive procurement process, when the Council
determines that, due to the nature of the goods or services, (1) a competitive
procurement process is not likely to serve the best interests of the city or to
result in the lowest price, or (2) there is a less expensive alterative (e.g.
state contract, used equipment, etc.) that will serve the city equally as well.
   (C)   Emergencies. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter,
upon determining that an emergency exists, as defined above, the Council or
City Manager may dispense with otherwise applicable competitive procurement
procedures to authorize a procurement necessary to address, avoid, or
ameliorate the circumstances creating the emergency or the resulting damage or
potential damage. An emergency procurement will be limited in scope and
duration to the extent necessary to satisfy the emergency need. The City
Manager must report to the Council any emergency purchase made and the basis
therefor at the next Council meeting following the emergency procurement.
   (D)   Urgent purchases.  The Purchasing Agent may authorize immediate
purchases of goods or services up to $30,000, without compliance with otherwise
applicable competitive procurement procedures, for goods or services that are
required on an urgent basis based on unforeseen and unforeseeable
circumstances, if the Purchasing Agent determines that the time required for
the applicable competitive procurement would outweigh the potential benefits
under the specific circumstances. A procurement made on an urgent basis will be
documented as specified in the Procurement Policies and Procedures. Lack of
planning or reasonable foresight will not constitute justification for an
urgent purchase.
   (E)   Purchases not susceptible to competitive bidding process. Except where
otherwise required by laws or by applicable funding conditions, goods and
services may be procured by negotiated contract and without a competitive
procurement process, for procurements which are not readily adaptable to the
open market and bidding processes. Such procurements include, but are not
limited to: (1) utility services (telephone, gas, water, sewer and electricity)
provided to city buildings and facilities, (2) franchises awarded by the
Council, (3) insurance or bond premiums, and (4) subscriptions, memberships,
software licenses, advertisements and travel expenses.
   (F)   Miscellaneous. Use of a competitive procurement process may be
dispensed with if it would be impossible, impractical, or incongruous or when
the amount involved is less than $5,000.
   (G)   Other. Competitive procurement processes may be dispensed with in
accordance with any other section of the city Charter or this chapter that
provides such an exemption, or by approval of the Council in accordance with
laws.
(Ord. 861-C.S., passed 9-19-17; Am. Ord. 892-C.S., passed 12-3-19)
§ 39.42 MISCELLANEOUS.
   (A)   Estimate of requirements. All offices, boards, and commissions must
file detailed requisitions or estimates of their requirements for procurements
of goods or services in such manner, at such times, and for such future periods
as the Purchasing Agent prescribes. Such requisitions and estimates must be
filed with the Purchasing Agent on such forms as he or she prescribes.
   (B)   Encumbrance of funds. Except in cases of emergency when necessary for
the protection of the public peace, health, safety, welfare, property, or
interests of the city or general public, the Purchasing Agent must not issue
any purchase order for goods or services unless there exists in the account
against which the purchase is to be charged a sufficient unencumbered
appropriation balance in excess of all unpaid obligations to pay for the
purchase.
   (C)   Surplus supplies and equipment. All offices, boards, and commissions
must submit to the Purchasing Agent, at such time and in such forms as he or
she prescribes, reports showing all equipment, materials, and supplies which
are no longer used or which have become obsolete, worn out, or scrapped. The
Purchasing Agent has the authority to sell all equipment, materials, and
supplies which have become unsuitable for public use or to exchange the same
for, or trade in the same on, new equipment, materials, and supplies.

40.03   Standard procedure for transfers of city-owned real property
§ 40.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   From time to time the city determines that it may be desirable to
transfer city-owned real property to another entity or individual.
   (B)   Since 1976, the city has utilized a "Policy and Procedure Memorandum"
to provide advisory guidelines to the City Council, the Planning Commission and
the staff regarding the procedures by which transfers of real property should
be handled.
   (C)   The City Council finds and declares that there is now a need for the
city to be able to distinguish certain transfers from others and that mandatory
controls and procedures to govern the transfer of city-owned real property from
the city to another entity or individual should be provided in the Municipal
Code and the purpose of the following provisions are to provide authority for
the City Council to make those distinctions and to set forth the mandatory
controls and procedures.
(Ord. 632-C.S., passed 11-2-99)
§ 40.02 EXPEDITED TRANSFERS OF CITY-OWNED REAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   The City Council may utilize an expedited process to transfer city-
owned real property to a non-profit organization without consultation with or
advice from the Planning Commission and without complying with the provisions
set forth in the Policy and Procedure Memorandum governing real property
transfers as it has or may be amended, if the City Council finds all of the
following:
      (1)   The property to be transferred has been utilized for a purpose that
is of benefit to the community for such period of time that the Council
believes the continued use of the property for substantially the same purpose
will not have an overly disruptive impact on the surrounding neighborhood or
its inhabitants;
      (2)   The property to be transferred will continue to be utilized for
substantially the same purpose that is has been used and that purpose is of
benefit to the community;
      (3)   The instrument conveying the property from the city to the non-
profit organization contains a clause requiring the property to revert back to
the city in the event the property ceases to be used for the benefit of the
community in a way that is at least substantially similar to the way that it is
being used at the time of the transfer;
      (4)   The non-profit organization receiving the property is providing
substantial value and consideration to the community and to the city in the
nature of services rendered to the community;
      (5)   The value to be received by the community and the city by
transferring the property to the non-profit organization exceeds the value of
continuing city ownership of the property; and
      (6)   The proposed transfer of property has been subjected to a minimum
of two public hearings before the City Council which were separated by no fewer
than seven days, and which were noticed by publication in a newspaper of
general circulation.
(Ord. 632-C.S., passed 11-2-99)
§ 40.03 STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR TRANSFERS OF CITY-OWNED REAL PROPERTY.
   In all cases excepting those in which the City Council makes the findings
set forth in §
40.02 above, transfers of city-owned real property shall be conducted in
conformance with the procedures set forth in the Policy and Procedure
Memorandum governing disposal of surplus property as that Memorandum may be
amended.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 50.001 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the
wastewater collection and Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) for the city.
This chapter shall apply to all persons using the POTW. It provides for the
setting of user charges and fees for the equitable distribution of costs to all
users. Revenues derived from the application of the provisions of this chapter
shall be used to defray the city's cost of operating and maintaining an
adequate wastewater collection and treatment system and to provide sufficient
funds for capital outlay, bond service costs, capital improvements depreciation
and pretreatment. This chapter also enables the city to comply with all
applicable state and federal laws including the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et
seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403).
   (B)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
interfere with the operation of the POTW;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which may
pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise
be incompatible with the POTW;
      (3)   To ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge
is maintained at a level which allows its use and disposal in compliance with
applicable statutes and regulations;
      (4)   To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and
sludge in the course of their employment and to protect the general public;
      (5)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the POTW;
      (6)   To enable the city to comply with its NPDES permit conditions,
sludge use and disposal requirements and any other federal or state laws to
which the POTW is subject.

applicable user charges and fees, the city issues a permit for such direct
discharges.
   (B)   No person shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW,
directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through
or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW
whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any
other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirement.
Furthermore, no person may contribute the following substances to the POTW:
      (1)   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the municipal
wastewater collection and POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams
with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140° F (60° C) using the test methods
specified in 40 CFR 261.21.

of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case solids
greater than one-inch or 25.4 millimeters in any dimension.
      (4)   Any wastewater containing pollutants, including oxygen demanding
pollutants (BOD, and the like), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or
pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other
pollutants, will cause interference with either the POTW, or any wastewater
treatment or sludge process; or which will constitute a hazard to humans or
animals.
      (5)   Any wastewater having a temperature greater than 150° F (65.5° C),
or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in
interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the
introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104° F (40° C).
      (6)   Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral
oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through, but in no

§ 50.108 BILLING; PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYMENT.
   (A)   Billing.
      (1)   All sewer service charges shall become due and payable to the city
as of the date of billing. All sewer service charges shall become delinquent 28
days from and after the date of billing. All bills delinquent 28 days or more
shall be subject to a 1.5% per month finance charge.
      (2)   All bills for such charges shall be issued by the Director of
Finance. They shall be combined with bills or statements for water services
where the premises in question are connected to the water system. The bills
shall state their purpose (water and sewer services) and shall list separately
the charge for water service and the charge for sewer service and the total
charge for both services. Neither charge may be paid separately from the other.
If the real property with sewer service is not connected to the water system, a
separate bill shall be rendered for sewer service only. All bills shall be for
monthly or bimonthly periods. The Director of Finance shall have the power to
require any user to pay bills monthly if, in his discretion, monthly payments
are required for the protection of the city.

§ 50.121 COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (A)   Inspection and sampling. The City Manager shall have the right to
enter the facilities of any industrial user to ascertain whether the purpose of
this chapter, and any permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and
whether the industrial user is complying with all requirements thereof.
Industrial users shall allow the City Manager or his representatives ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
      (1)   Where an industrial user has security measures in force which
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
industrial user shall make necessary arrangement with its security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel for the city,
state, and EPA shall be permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibilities.
      (2)   The city, state, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the
industrial user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
      (3)   The city may require the industrial user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
industrial user at its own expense. The monitoring equipment should normally be
situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that the
facility will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. All devices
used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated yearly to
ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the City
Manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be
born by the industrial user.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing city personnel access to the
industrial user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
      (6)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's
requirements and all applicable local agency construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the city, unless a time extension is otherwise granted
by the city.
('63 Code, § 5-5.701)
   (B)   Search warrants. If the City Manager has been refused access to a
building, structure, or property or any part thereof, and if the City Manager
has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this chapter or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection
program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety, and welfare of the community, then the City Attorney may apply to the
appropriate court for a search and/or seizure warrant describing therein the
specific location subject to the warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if
anything, may be searched and/or seized on the property described. In the event
of an emergency affecting public health and safety, inspections shall be made
without the issuance of a warrant.

§ 50.122 PUBLICATION OF INDUSTRIAL USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in
the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the significant
industrial users and categorical industrial users which, during the previous 12
months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean:
   (A)   CHRONIC VIOLATIONS OF WASTEWATER DISCHARGE LIMITS, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all of the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a
numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits,
as defined by 40 C.F.R. 403.3(l);
   (B)   TECHNICAL REVIEW CRITERIA (TRC) VIOLATIONS, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant
parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as
defined by 40 C.F.R. 403.3(l) multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC=1.4 for
BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   (C)   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by 40 C.F.R. 403.3(l) (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous
limit, or narrative standard) that the POTW determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public);
   (D)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its
emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   (E)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final
compliance;
   (F)   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports,
periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
   (G)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance;
   (H)   Any other violation which the city determines will adversely affect
the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.

§ 50.123 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. Whenever the City Manager finds that any
person has violated or is violating this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the City
Manager or his agent may serve upon said person a written notice of violation.
Within seven days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the person to the City
Manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the person of liability for
any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any
action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The City Manager may enter into consent orders,
assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement
with any person responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include
specific action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance within a
time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force
and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §
50.123(D) and (E) and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (C)   Show cause hearing. The City Manager may order a person which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the City Manager and
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice
shall be served on the person, specifying the time and place for the meeting,
the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request
that the person show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least seven days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
person as defined in §
50.002 and required by §
50.052(B). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the person.
   (D)   Compliance orders. When the city finds that a person has violated or
continues to violate this chapter, wastewater discharge permits or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, he may issue an
order to the person responsible for the discharge directing that the person
come into compliance within 30 days. If the person does not come into
compliance within 30 days, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and
properly operated. Compliance orders may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order release the person of liability for any violation, including
any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a
prerequisite to taking any other action against the person.
   (E)   Cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the City Manager finds that a person is violating this
chapter, the person’s wastewater discharge permit, any order issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the person’s past
violations are likely to recur, the City Manager may issue an order to the
person directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
person to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements;
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
      (2)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to
taking any other action against the person.
   (F)   Administrative citation.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, any person that
is found to have violated any provision of this chapter, its wastewater
discharge permit, and orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement may be issued an administrative citation and fine in
accordance with
Chapter 10 of this code.
      (2)   Fine amounts shall be consistent with a schedule of fines and fees
as adopted and amended from time to time by resolution of the City Council.
      (3)   Fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the
case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines may be
assessed for each day during the period of violation.
      (4)   Appeals of administrative citations shall follow the process
proscribed in
Chapter 10 of this code.
      (5)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a prerequisite for
taking any other action against the person.
   (G)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The City Manager may immediately suspend a person’s discharge
(after informal notice to the person) whenever such suspension is necessary in
order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to
present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The City Manager may also immediately suspend a person’s
discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an
endangerment to the environment.
         (a)   Any person notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a person’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City
Manager shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The City Manager
shall allow the person to recommence its discharge when the person has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment
has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in this chapter are
initiated against the person.
         (b)   A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence to the City Manager, prior to the date
of any show cause or termination hearing as set forth in this chapter.
      (2)   Nothing in this division (G) shall be interpreted as requiring a
hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   (H)   Termination of discharge.
      (1)   In addition to those provisions in §
50.059, any person that violates the following conditions of this chapter,
wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, is subject to
discharge termination.
         (a)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the person’s premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling;
         (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
50.020 through
50.025.
      (2)   Such person will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under division (C) of
this section why the proposed action should not be taken.

§ 50.124 JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Injunctive relief. Whenever the person has violated a pretreatment
standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter,
wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment requirement, the city may petition the Superior Court for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as may be appropriate in
restraining the continuance of such violation.
(‘63 Code, § 5-5.1101)
   (B)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   Any person which has violated or continues to violate this chapter,
any order, or wastewater discharge permit hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a minimum civil penalty
of $1,000 per violation per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term
average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period
of the violation.
      (2)   The city may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
      (3)   When a discharge of wastes causes an obstruction, damage, or other
impairment to the POTW, the city may assess a charge against the person for the
cost of the work required to clean or repair the POTW and add such charge to
the person’s service charge.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a prerequisite for
taking any other action against a person.
   (C)   Criminal penalties.
      (1)   Any person that willfully or negligently violates any provision of
this chapter, any orders, or wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least $1,000 per violation per day or
imprisonment for not more than one year or both.
      (2)   Any person that willfully or negligently introduces any substance
into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least
$1,000 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one year. This
penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury
or property damage available under state law.
      (3)   Any person that knowingly makes any false statements,
representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or
other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this
chapter, wastewater discharge permit or order, or who falsifies, tampers with,
or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of at least $1,000
per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one year or both.
      (4)   In the event of a second conviction, a person shall be punished by
a fine of not more than $2,000 per violation per day or imprisonment for not
more than two years or both.

§ 50.126 REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The provisions in §§
50.122 through
50.125 of this chapter are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right
to take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant
user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance
with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the city reserves the right
to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further,
the city is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any
noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently.

§ 50.127 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Upset.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the
extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subsection (3) of this division (A) are met.
      (3)   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause
(s) of the upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
         (c)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five days):
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance.
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue.
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
      (6)   The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to
the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the
facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary
source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
('63 Code, § 5-5.1301)
   (B)   Bypass.
      (1)   (a)    BYPASS shall mean the intentional diversion of wastestreams
from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility.
         (b)    SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE shall mean substantial physical damage
to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provision of subsections (3) and (4) of this division
(B).
      (3)   (a)    If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten days before the
date of the bypass if possible.
         (b)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware
of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times,
and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-
case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
      (4)   (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement
action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and,
            3.   The industrial user submitted notices as required under
subsection (3) of this division (B).
         (b)   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in subsection (4)(a) of division (B).

PRIVATE SEWER LATERAL INSPECTION
§ 50.201 PURPOSE.
   This chapter sets forth the methods by which the city may require inspection
and repair of private sewer laterals (both upper and lower). The city finds
that many sewer service laterals in Eureka are old and deteriorated and, as a
result, subject to failure as well as inflow and infiltration (I & I) from
groundwater and stormwater runoff. Eliminating inflow and infiltration from
Building Sewers is required by § 50.020 of this code and is necessary to ensure
effective and efficient operation of the POTW and to comply with the terms and
conditions of the city's current wastewater discharge permit.

§ 50.202 TRIGGERING EVENTS.
   All gravity sewer laterals, including all pipes and appurtenances from the
building envelope to the public main, shall be inspected and repaired/replaced
at the property owner's expense, when any of the following triggering events
occurs unless the property owner presents satisfactory proof to the city that
the sewer lateral including clean-out is less than 25 years old and has been
inspected pursuant to a city-issued permit:
   (A)   Whenever any real property located within the city is to be sold,
transferred or vested in any other person or entity.
   (B)   Application for building and/or plumbing permits with an aggregate
valuation that exceeds $50,000 or which involves the addition of two or more

performed by a qualified licensed plumbing contractor or utility evaluation
service approved by the city. Footage which does not comply with the following
standards will not be accepted:
      (1)   Video shall be provided in electronic format and submitted by
uploading as required by the city.
      (2)   Camera footage shall be taken from the building sewer cleanout to
the public sewer main.
      (3)   Video footage shall include the running distance from the point of
origin.
      (4)   Whenever possible, the sewer shall be free of debris or flows which
obstruct visibility.
      (5)   The camera shall be fed at a rate that allows a technician to make
observations of pipe condition. Footage shall pause at junctions and obvious
defects including pipe offsets, cracks, obstructions and areas of infiltration.

completed within one year following issuance of the notice to repair or as
required by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 893-C.S., passed 12-17-19; Am. Ord. 939-C.S., passed 12-6-22)
§ 50.207 FEE IN LIEU OF REPAIR, REPAIRS PERFORMED BY THE CITY AND RECOVERY OF
COSTS.
   (A)   At the property owner's option as an alternative to repairing or
replacing the lower sewer lateral, the property owner may furnish to the city a
fee for repair of the lower lateral in an amount as may be adopted by
resolution and updated as necessary based on the estimated cost of such work.
   (B)   This fee shall be paid prior to sale of the property or final approval
of any permit, plan, alteration or commencement of use triggering replacement.
   (C)   Payment of the fee in lieu satisfies the requirement to repair/replace
the lower lateral only and do not apply to repair/replacement of the upper
lateral.
   (D)   If, after being provided notice the sewer lateral repair/replacement
are not completed by the property owner within the required time limits,
including any extensions granted, the city shall complete the required repair/
replacement. The costs of the repair/replacement shall become a lien upon the
property served by the sewer lateral and may be recovered in an action brought
thereof in the name of the city; or, in the alternative, such cost and
expenditure may be placed upon the county tax bill to be collected by for the
benefit of the city.
   (E)   Prior to the city causing the lien to be placed on the county tax
bill, the City Clerk shall notify the property owner of the intent to place the
cost of the repair/replacement on the county tax bill and shall give the

§ 50.209 EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   The City Engineer may waive sewer lateral inspection and/or repair
required under this subchapter upon his/her determination that compliance is
physically infeasible. Economic hardship is not a sufficient basis for waiving
the inspection requirements of this chapter. This subchapter shall not apply
if:
      (1)   The city has issued a lateral certificate or approved installation
or replacement of the sewer lateral at any time during the previous 25 years
and there is no evidence that the lateral is defective or that conditions have
changed;
      (2)   If the inspection and/or installation compliance is physically
impossible.
      (3)   The city determines inspection is unnecessary because sewer piping
is less than ten feet long and existing physical conditions would prevent
infiltration and inflow.
      (4)   The ownership transfer is exempt from tax reassessment as
determined by the Humboldt County Assessor and the transfer is solely between
spouses, registered domestic partners, parent(s) and child(ren), grandparent(s)
and grandchild(ren) or results from the death of a co-tenant.
   (B)   If after inspection the City Engineer determines that it is in the
city's best interest, the repairs required by this subchapter may be postponed
to a date certain. In this event, the City Engineer must put the reasons for
the determination in writing and identify a date certain by which the repair
must be made. The date certain will in no event be more than five years from
the date of the inspection. The written determination will be in the form of an
instrument that will be recorded against the subject property.

§ 51.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND AUTHORITY.
   The City Council of the City of Eureka finds and declares:
   (A)   State recycling law, Assembly Bill 939 of 1989, the California
Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (Cal. Public Resources Code §§ 40000 et
seq., as amended, supplemented, superseded, and replaced from time to time),
requires cities and counties to reduce, reuse, and recycle (including
composting) solid waste generated in their jurisdictions to the maximum extent
feasible before any incineration or landfill disposal of waste, to conserve
water, energy, and other natural resources, and to protect the environment.
   (B)   State recycling law, Assembly Bill 341 of 2011 (approved by the
Governor of the State of California on October 5, 2011, which amended Cal.
Public Resources Code §§ 41730, 41731, 41734, 41735, 41736, 41800, 42926,
44004, and 50001 of, and added §§ 40004, 41734.5, and 41780.01 and Chapter 12.8
(commencing with § 42649) to Part 3 of Division 30 of, and added and repealed §
41780.02, as amended, supplemented, superseded and replaced from time to time),
places requirements on businesses and multi-family property owners that
generate a specified threshold amount of solid waste to arrange for recycling
services and requires jurisdictions to implement a mandatory commercial
recycling program.
   (C)   State organics recycling law, Assembly Bill 1826 of 2014 (approved by
the Governor of the State of California on September 28, 2014, which added Cal.
Public Resources Code Chapter 12.9 (commencing with § 42649.8) to Part 3 of
Division 30 of the Public Resources Code, relating to solid waste, as amended,
supplemented, superseded, and replaced from time to time), requires businesses
and multi-family property owners that generate a specified threshold amount of
solid waste, recycling, and organic waste per week to arrange for recycling
services for that waste, requires jurisdictions to implement a recycling
program to divert organic waste from businesses subject to the law, and
requires jurisdictions to implement a mandatory commercial organics recycling
program.
   (D)   SB 1383, the Short-lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Act of 2016,
requires the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery
("CalRecycle") to develop regulations to reduce organics in landfills as a
source of methane. The regulations place requirements on multiple entities
including jurisdictions, residential households, commercial businesses and
business owners, commercial edible food generators, haulers, self-haulers, food
recovery organizations, and food recovery services to support achievement of
statewide organic waste disposal reduction targets.
   (E)   SB 1383, the Short-lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Act of 2016,
requires jurisdictions to adopt and enforce an ordinance or enforceable
mechanism to implement relevant provisions of SB 1383 regulations. This chapter
will also help reduce food insecurity by requiring commercial edible food
generators to arrange to have the maximum amount of their edible food, which
would otherwise be disposed, be recovered for human consumption.
   (F)   Requirements in this chapter are consistent with other adopted goals
of the city including the Humboldt Regional Climate Action Plan and the City of
Eureka Zero Waste Action Plan.
   (G)   The city adopts this chapter in order to comply with SB 1383
requirements in a manner that is consistent with and continues to implement the
city's previously adopted programs, policies and goals including the following:
      (1)   Reduce litter and other illegal solid waste disposal practices;
      (2)   Maintain a healthy, safe, economical, coordinated, and orderly
regulation of collecting, transporting, and/or disposing of solid waste kept,
accumulated or produced within the city;
      (3)   Encourage environmentally acceptable programs of source separation,
recycling, composting and salvaging, and the reduction of the total solid waste
generated on a city-wide and per capita basis;
      (4)   Provide for the storage, collection, transportation, diversion and
recovery of marketable and recyclable materials in compliance with state
requirements and the waste reduction and recycling goals set forth therein;
      (5)   Divert waste out of landfills so as to extend landfill life and
reduce the need to expand or build new landfills;
      (6)   Prevent nuisances and hazards to public health caused by improper
solid waste and garbage disposal, accumulation, storage and removal;
      (7)   Eliminate solid waste and garbage as a breeding site for insects or
other vectors, and a food source for rodents and other animals; and
      (8)   Reduce blighting conditions.

§ 51.03 MANDATORY COLLECTION SERVICE.
   (A)   Use of city's franchise collection/hauler service required.
      (1)   The periodic collection of garbage, recyclable items, organics and
other solid waste materials from improved properties in the city benefits
occupants of places and premises in the city, and promotes and protects the
health, safety and welfare of all residents of the city. Therefore, collection
services provided by the city's franchise collector/hauler are mandatory for
all owners of improved property within the city in or from which solid waste is
created, accumulated or produced.
      (2)   Solid waste must be regulated to the extent necessary to protect
the health, safety, and welfare of the public, to conserve disposal capacity,
to meet state laws and to ensure cost effective public service. To this end,
the City Council finds that to give practical effect to this policy, a
mandatory collection ordinance to regulate the collection of waste, and a
comprehensive system for the storage, collection, removal, transport, recovery
of marketable and recyclable materials, compostable materials and disposal of
solid waste in the city is essential.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   Mandatory collection service is required for the three-bin
collection of garbage, recyclable items, organics and other solid waste
materials generated on all occupied properties within the city, as identified
in this chapter. As mandatory collection service is implemented and becomes
available pursuant to the subscription guidelines of this chapter, the owner,
tenant or occupant of every parcel with one or more businesses and/or
residential buildings approved for occupancy and located within the city must
subscribe to and thereafter use regularly the collection service franchised by
the city.
      (2)   No provision herein contained should be construed to conflict with
any provision of the Integrated Waste Management Act, the Medical Waste
Management Act, or any other state or federal law. In the event such a conflict
exists, or should exist in the future, state or federal law should be
controlling. This chapter is not intended, nor shall it apply to transfer
stations or other solid waste disposal facilities.
   (C)   Subscription to collection service. Subscription to mandatory
collection service should not be required until the service becomes available
to each affected property. The property owner of each occupied premises must
assume responsibility for subscribing to collection service within seven days
of either written notification from the city or occupancy of the premises,
whichever is sooner. At the city's discretion, providing collection service to
all properties may be implemented in phases as determined by what is most
efficient and cost effective and as programs become available and economically
viable.
   (D)   Property owner responsible for securing collection service. The owner
of any improved property in or from which garbage, recyclable and organic
materials is created, accumulated or produced is responsible for subscribing to
the collection service to be rendered to such property by the city's franchised
collection service. It is the property owner's responsibility, not the
tenant's, to secure and maintain collection services.
   (E)   Payments on behalf of owner permitted. Nothing in this chapter is
intended to prevent an arrangement, or the continuance of an existing
arrangement, under which payments for collection service are made by a tenant
or tenants, or any agent on behalf of the owner; however any such arrangement
will not affect the owner's obligation to the city or to the franchise
collector/hauler for payment for such service.
   (G)   Written notice required for non-use. The city's franchise collector/
hauler must give written notice to the City Manager or designated
representative of the address of any occupied premise within the city which is
not subscribing to the collection and disposal service provided by the
collection service franchised by the city.
   (H)   Failure to subscribe.
      (1)   If the City Manager has reason to believe that any person required
to subscribe for service has failed to subscribe or failed to maintain a
subscription for service, the City Manager may cause written notice to be
mailed to the owner of the real property so affected directing the owner to
subscribe for such service within ten days after the date of the notice.
      (2)   Any such notice must state that if the person to whom it is
directed fails within the ten day period to subscribe for such collection
service, or fails to appear and show sufficient cause why such person should
not be required to subscribe, the Manager may authorize such service and the
charges therefore will be assessed against the real property upon which the
premises served are located.
      (3)   After notice and a public hearing, unpaid delinquent accounts may
be confirmed by the City Council, and the amount confirmed will constitute a
lien on the property. The lien will continue until the amount of the charges
and interest thereon at the legal rate, computed from the date of confirmation
of the charge, is paid in full or until it is discharged of record.
      (4)   Alternatively, or in addition, the confirmed amount may be made a
personal obligation of the property owner of record. Alternatively, or in
addition, the confirmed amount may be specially assessed against the real
property involved, and collected at the same time and in the same manner as
ordinary real property taxes.
   (I)   Exemptions. Property owned by federal, state or local governments will
be exempt from the requirements of this section.

collection location for collection by the city's authorized franchise
collector/hauler will remain the property of the bulky goods generator until
such bulky goods are collected by such authorized franchise collector/hauler.

city's discretion:
   (A)   De minimis waivers. The city may waive a commercial business'

to appear before the City Manager, or a designated representative, at a time
specified within the notice to show cause why such person should not be
required to subscribe for the collection of garbage, recyclables, and organic
waste. In addition, any property owner not receiving a notice may arrange to
appear before the City Manager, or a designated representative, at a time
specified to show cause why such person should not be required to subscribe for
the collection service. At the appearance, the Manager may find excluded from
the requirements of said section only those persons who show:
         (a)   That they are not owners of the property mentioned; or
         (b)   That the property is not within the city limits; or
         (c)   That the property is vacant; or
         (d)   That the residential unit or structure on the property is vacant
or temporarily unoccupied for a period in excess of one month; or
         (e)   Unique parcel specific conditions which compel the property
owner, tenant or occupant to self haul their garbage, recyclables and organic
waste to the transfer station. Such conditions may include properties with
long, narrow or steep driveways where the franchisee, in the opinion of the
City Manager, is unable to properly and safely use the franchisee's equipment,
and granting such exclusion would not create a nuisance; or
         (f)   That the owner or occupant legally recycles and composts
virtually all their solid waste so that no unsanitary condition, hazard to
health, or public nuisance will arise upon the premises owned, managed or
controlled by them if they are not provided with collection and disposal
services by a collector.
      (2)   Declaration required.
         (a)   All persons claiming an exclusion per this section must occupy
the property and will be asked to sign a declaration or affidavit, under
penalty of perjury, once per year stating that they legally recycle and compost
virtually all their solid waste so that no unsanitary condition, hazard to
health, or public nuisance will arise upon the premises owned, managed or
controlled by them.
         (b)   The signed affidavit must be submitted in person, electronically
or through the mail on or before June 1 in order to be excluded from
subscribing to collection services for the subsequent fiscal year (July 1
through June 30). Those affidavits submitted electronically must have a
timestamp on or before June 1. Those affidavits submitted through the mail must
be postmarked on or before June 1. There will be a five-day grace period for
extenuating circumstances as deemed appropriate by the City Manager, or a
designated representative.
   (B)   Any exclusion granted by the City Manager is revocable for cause, as
determined by the City Manager. Any exclusion granted by the City Manager can
be made conditional, as needed to ensure continuing eligibility. Violations of
any such conditions can result in the revocation of the exemption, and/or
result in the assessment of penalties under Eureka Municipal Code §
10.99.
(Ord. 943-C.S., passed 2-21-23)
§ 51.14 DISCONTINUING SERVICE UPON VACANCY.
   The owner of any premises required to subscribe to a collection service
under this chapter may discontinue service when the premises are vacant or the
occupant is traveling out of town for one or more months. The owner is required
to submit written notice of such vacancy to the city's franchise collector/
hauler. Monthly collection fees will continue to accrue until such time as
notice is received by the city's franchise collector/hauler. This section may
be used by the owner no more than twice per calendar year. In the event of a
dispute arising under this section, the dispute shall be reviewed as set forth
in this chapter.

§ 51.16 RATE DEVIATIONS.
   (A)   Metered rates. The city's franchise collector/hauler will include
metered service which provides market based incentives to reduce waste and
increase waste diversion through curbside collection of recyclable waste
materials. Metered service will require that residents and other users,
particularly those who recycle and compost the vast majority of their waste,
have the opportunity to pay lower rates for smaller garbage bins/carts, thus
encouraging higher rates of waste diversion.
   (B)   Appropriate rates. The accumulation of solid waste in certain
instances may be so far above the normal or average, that the rates approved by
the City Council may not be sufficient to fairly compensate the collector for
collecting the same, or the accumulation of solid waste in certain instances
may be so far below the normal average that the rates fixed by the City Council
may not be fair and just to the property owner obligated to pay for the removal
of solid waste. If, after attempting to resolve the rate difference, either the
collector or the property owner believes such to be the fact, a written
application may be made to the City Manager for potential relief, and it will
be the duty of the City Manager to make an investigation and, if possible, to
fix a rate fair to both parties.
   (C)   Disputes over charges made by collectors, or as to the character of
the service performed, will be decided by the City Manager or designee.
(Ord. 943-C.S., passed 2-21-23)

of vectors, or the creation of a nuisance. It shall be unlawful for any person
to allow solid waste to accumulate outside of an authorized waste container.
(Ord. 943-C.S., passed 2-21-23)
§ 51.18 CONTAINERS.
   (A)   Franchise collector/hauler to provide containers. The city's franchise
collector/hauler will provide containers to properties subscribing to
collection service. The franchise collector/hauler will provide a variety of
container sizes to meet the different needs of households. It will be the duty
of every property owner, tenant, lessee, or occupant of any premises to arrange
for containers large enough to hold all solid waste ordinarily accumulated on
the premises in one week's time. Containers must be watertight, have suitable
bails or handles and a tight-fitting cover.
   (B)   Maintenance and location.
      (1)   All containers, when leaking or in a defective state, must be
cleaned, repaired or replaced by the franchise collector/hauler or owner of the
container.
      (2)   Individually-serviced residences. Containers must be placed for
collection day such that they are easily accessible for collection as approved
by the collector. Such placement should occur no earlier than 5:00 p.m. on the
day prior to the scheduled collection day, nor later than 10:00 p.m. Emptied
containers should be removed promptly from the curb, no later than the day

   (B)   All other occupancies will have solid waste removed at least once a
week.
   (C)   Notwithstanding divisions (A) and (B) above, every occupancy will
remove and/or subscribe to a waste removal schedule as frequently as necessary
to maintain sanitary, nuisance-free, vector-free, clean and aesthetic
conditions on the premises.
   (D)   Said solid waste will be collected and removed pursuant to the
schedules of this section except when prevented by disruptions due to strikes,
severe and unusual weather conditions, or other acts of God which prevent
collection, or holidays interrupting the normal seven-day collection cycle.
   (E)   Except in cases of emergency, no regularly scheduled collection will
be made on Sunday.
(Ord. 943-C.S., passed 2-21-23)
§ 51.20 DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS.
   (A)   When a delinquent account is forwarded to the city by the city's
franchise collector/hauler, the city will then, pursuant to the authority
contained in Cal. Gov't Code § 38790.1, attempt to collect the delinquent fees
in the manner described in Cal. Gov't Code § 25831.

to gather or collect the same except as provided in this chapter.
   (B)   The city may issue permits to non-profit organizations for temporary

each such removal in violation hereof from any designated recycling collection
location will constitute a separate and distinct offense.
   (B)   Any person who violates any provision of this chapter will be subject

§ 53.12 METER TESTS.
   (A)   If a customer desires to have the meter serving his premises tested,
he shall first make a deposit in an amount as adopted by resolution from time
to time following a public hearing by the City Council.
   (B)   Should the meter register more than 2% fast, the deposit will be
refunded. Should the meter read less than 2%, the deposit will be retained. If
a meter tested at the request of a customer is found to be more than 2% fast,
the excess charge for the time service was rendered the customer requesting the
test, or for a period of six months, whichever shall be the lesser, shall be
refunded to the customer. If a meter tested at the request of a customer is
found to be more than 25% slow in the case of residential service, or more than
2% slow for other than residential service, the city may bill the customer for
the amount of the undercharge based upon corrected meter readings for the
period, not exceeding six months, the meter was in use. If a meter is found not
to be registering, the charge for service shall be at the minimum monthly rate,
or shall be based on the estimated consumption for a comparable period, or
shall be by such other method as is determined by the Director of Finance, and
his decision shall be final.

CROSS-CONNECTIONS
§ 53.55 PURPOSE.
   The provisions of this subchapter set requirements to:
   (A)   Protect the public potable water supply of the city from the
possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within the water users
internal distribution system or the water users private water system such
contaminants or pollutants which could backflow into the public water systems;
   (B)   Promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections,
actual or potential, between the water users in plant potable water system and
non-potable water system, plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems; and,
   (C)   Provide for the maintenance of a continuing Program of Cross-
Connection Control which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of the city's potable water systems.
('63 Code, § 5-10.101) (Ord. 469-C.S., passed 5-5-88)
§ 53.56 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AIR GAP SEPARATION. The unobstructed vertical distance through the free
atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water
to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of the
receptacle, and must be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe
measured vertically above the flood level rim of the vessel. In no case may the
gap be less than one inch.
   AUXILIARY SUPPLY. Any water source or system other than the public potable
water system, that may be available in the building or on the premises.
   BACKFLOW. The reversal of flow, other than in the intended direction, into
the distribution of the public water system from a user connection.
   BACK PRESSURE. The backflow caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler, or
other means that could create pressure within the system greater than the city
water supply.
   BACK SIPHONAGE. A form of backflow due to a negative or subatmospheric
pressure within the water system.
   BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE. A state device to counteract back pressure or
prevent back siphonage.
   CROSS-CONNECTION. Any physical arrangement whereby a public water system is
connected, directly or indirectly, with any other nonpotable water system,
sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage, reservoir, plumbing fixture, or other
device which contains, or may contain, contaminated water, sewage, or other
waste or liquid contamination into the public water system as a result of
backflow. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, movable sections, swivel or
changeover devices, or other temporary or permanent devices through which, or
because of which, backflow could occur, are considered to be cross-connections.
   DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY (DCVA). An approved assembly composed of two
single, independently acting check valves, including tightly closing shutoff
valves located at each end of the assembly and suitable connections for testing
the watertightness of each check valve.
   REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE (RPBD). An approved
device incorporating two or more check valves and an automatically operating
differential relief valve located between the two checks, two shutoff valves,
and equipped with the necessary appurtenances for testing. The device must
operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves, less
than the pressure on the public water system side of the device. At cessation
of normal flow, the pressure between the check valves must be less than the
supply pressure. In the case of leakage of either check valve the differential
relief valve must operate to maintain the reduced pressure by discharging to
the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure drops below two pounds per square inch,
the relief valve must open to the atmosphere thereby providing an atmospheric
zone between the two check valves.
   USER CONNECTION. The point of connection of a user's piping to the public
potable water supply of the city.
   WATER USER. Any person obtaining water from the public water supply of the
city.
('63 Code, § 5-10.102) (Ord. 469-C.S., passed 5-5-88)
§ 53.57 POLICY.
   No user connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the
city unless the water supply is protected as required by state laws and
regulations and this chapter. Service of water to any premises shall be
discontinued by the city if a backflow prevention assembly is required by this
chapter and same is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found
that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed, by-passed, or if an
unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be
restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.

§ 53.58 INSPECTION AND DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   The water user's system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times
to authorized representatives of the city to determine whether cross-
connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of
these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known the city shall
deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a
physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the
condition in conformance with the state and the city statutes relating to
plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
('63 Code, § 5-10.104) (Ord. 469-C.S., passed 5-5-88)
§ 53.59 WHERE PROTECTION IS REQUIRED.
   An approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on each service
line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately
inside the building being served; but, in all cases, before the first branch
line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist:
   (A)   In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not
or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not
acceptable as an additional source by the city, the public water system shall
be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved
backflow prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the degree of
hazard.
   (B)   In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other
objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or
potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be
protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow
prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard.
This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from
the utility system which have been subject to deterioration in quality.
   (C)   In the case of premises having internal cross-connection that cannot
be permanently corrected or controlled, or intricate plumbing and piping
arrangements, or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily
accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to
ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water
system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an
approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line.
('63 Code, § 5-10.105) (Ord. 469-C.S., passed 5-5-88)
§ 53.60 TYPE OF PROTECTIVE DEVICE REQUIRED.
   The type of protective assembly required under §
53.58 of this subchapter shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as
follows:
   (A)   In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply
and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system
shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced
pressure principle backflow prevention assembly.
   (B)   In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that
would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the
public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved
double check valve assembly.
   (C)   In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to
health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential
hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected
by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will
exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical
manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants.
   (D)   In the case of any premises where there are “uncontrolled” cross-
connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be
protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection.
   (E)   In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or
other prohibitions or restriction, it is impossible or impractical to make a
complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be
protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air-gap
separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly on each service to the premises.

§ 53.62 INSPECTION AND TESTINGS.
   It shall be the duty of the water user at any premises where backflow
prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and
operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the
Director of Community Services deems the hazard to be great enough he may
require certified inspections at more frequent intervals. These inspections and
tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by the
assembly manufacturer's representative, or by a certified tester approved by
the city. It shall be the duty of the Director of Community Services to see
that these tests are made in a timely manner. The water user shall notify the
city in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that an official
representative may witness the tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be
repaired, over-hauled or replaced at the expense of the water user whenever
said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such test, repairs, and
overhaul shall be kept and made available to the city. Failure of the water
user to comply with the inspection, maintenance, and reporting provisions of
this section shall result in discontinuance of service as prescribed in §§
53.57 and

§ 55.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The California Public Utilities Code under Chapter 2.3 of Division 1,
Part 1 allows electric utility customers to aggregate their electric loads as
members of their local community with community choice aggregators, where a
community choice aggregator may be any city, county, or group of cities or
counties who have elected to combine the loads of their programs through the
formation of a joint powers agency established under Chapter 5 (commencing with
Section 6500) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the California Government Code.
   (B)   The City of Eureka has been investigating options to provide electric
services to constituents within its service areas with the intent of achieving
greater local involvement over the provisions of electric services, competitive
electric rates, the development of clean, local renewable energy projects,
reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and the wider implementation of energy
conservation and efficiency projects and programs through a community choice
aggregation (CCA) program.
   (C)   The City of Eureka is a member of the Redwood Coast Energy Authority
(RCEA), a joint powers authority formed by the County of Humboldt, Cities of
Arcata, Blue Lake, Eureka, Ferndale, Fortuna and Rio Dell, Trinidad and the
Humboldt Bay Municipal Water District, to act as a regional agency to promote
sustainable energy initiatives that reduce energy demand, increase energy
efficiency, and advance the use of clean, efficient and renewable resources
available in the region.
   (D)   The RCEA is authorized by ordinance to act as a community choice
aggregator to implement and operate a CCA program under California law.
   (E)   RCEA has established key CCA program goals of maximizing the use of
local renewable resources while also providing competitive rates to customers.
These goals are aimed at supporting local economic development as well as
reducing the environmental impacts resulting from the use of electricity in a
technically and economically feasible manner.
   (F)   To analyze the feasibility of operating a CCA program that achieves
these goals, RCEA has procured independent technical support services to
conduct the appropriate development and operational studies, including
technical, financial and risk analyses. These studies will assist RCEA, its
member agencies, and the community in evaluating a potential rate structure and
energy portfolio, and, ultimately, potential CCA program viability prior to
formal launch of a CCA program through the filing of an Implementation Plan
with the CPUC.
   (G)   Participation in a CCA program implemented and operated by the RCEA,
rather than independently electing to become a community choice aggregator,
will reduce the City's financial exposure from community choice aggregation, if
any, because RCEA's joint power authority structure immunizes its member
agencies from its debts, liabilities and obligations, and therefore the debts,
liabilities and obligations of a CCA program.
   (H)   Electric customers have the right to opt out of the CCA program and
continue to receive service from the existing utility under Public Utilities
Code § 366.2.
   (I)   Under the RCEA CCA program structure, the city will have CCA program
voting privileges on the RCEA Board of Directors as set out in the RCEA Amended
and Restated Joint Powers Agreement effective December 15, 2015.
(Ord. 838-C.S., passed 6-21-16)
§ 55.02 PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION.
   Based on all of the above, the City Council of the City of Eureka elects to
implement a Community Choice Aggregation program within the city's jurisdiction
by and through the RCEA, subject to the determination of the RCEA, based on its
CCA program developmental and operational analyses and member agency input,
that a CCA program based on the key goals set out above is not technically or
economically feasible and consequently decides not to launch the CCA program.
(Ord. 838-C.S., passed 6-21-16)
§ 55.03 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this ordinance is
for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not
affect the validity of the remaining portion of this ordinance. The City
Council of the City of Eureka hereby declares that it would have passed this
ordinance and every section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase thereof,
irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences,
clauses, or phrases be declared unconstitutional or invalid.

§ 56.11 REGULATION OF PERMITS.
   The following regulations shall be applicable to permits issued pursuant to

   (B)   The permit shall be revocable, and the right thereunder shall be
subordinate to any prior right of the city to use the street or easement for
public purposes. The permit shall be conditional upon the right of the city to

where, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works, that action is
reasonable and necessary to avoid a crossing conflict for the benefit of any

arrange to do the work of the restoration of city property, tideland or street
surfaces at the expense of the permittee. If the permittee fails to refill any

excavation, the Director of Public Works shall have the right to perform the
work and to collect from the permittee in the name of the city the cost
thereof.
   (G)   The Director of Public Works shall have the right to remove any
structure or encroachment constructed, installed, or maintained in violation of
the provisions of this chapter, and to restore the city property, tideland,
street or easement to its condition prior to the excavation, construction, or
installation, and to collect in the name of the city the cost thereof.
(Ord. 887-C.S., passed 8-6-19)
§ 56.12 EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   An excavation or encroachment may be made without first obtaining a
permit for the repair or replacement of a facility previously installed or
constructed only when necessary for the immediate protection or preservation of
life or property, and provided the permit shall be obtained on the first
business day thereafter, and further provided that the excavation or
encroachment is made in a manner which fully protects the health, safety, and
welfare of the general public.
   (B)   A public utility which holds a franchise issued by the city or state
which authorizes the use of the city streets for infrastructure shall not be
required to obtain a permit for routine maintenance operations in streets or
easements. For the purpose of this section, routine maintenance shall be
defined as isolated spot repairs which are not part of a larger coordinated
project and are four square feet or four feet long, or smaller. This exception
shall not relieve the permittee from notifying the city of the work being
performed nor does it waive the right of the Director of Public Works to
regulate the location of utilities and to resolve conflicts between the various
users of the streets.
   (C)   The provisions of this chapter shall not be applicable to signs and
other similar installations.
(Ord. 887-C.S., passed 8-6-19)
§ 56.13 FEES AND DEPOSITS.
   (A)   A fee schedule may be adopted by resolution of the Council
establishing permit fees and inspection fees for the various types of
excavations, installations, construction, and encroachments. The permit fee
shall be paid at the time the application for the permit is filed, and the
inspection fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of the permit. Permit fees
represent the value of staff time in processing a permit application and are
non-refundable.
   (B)   All past due fees, fines and penalties owed by the applicant must be
paid before a permit will be issued.
   (C)   If a permit violation occurs no other application will be processed
until the fines and penalties have been paid and all permit conditions are met.
   (D)   If an account is past due or not in good standings, a permit cannot be
issued until the account is brought into good standing. To bring the account to
good standing, all fees and fines must be paid.

(Ord. 887-C.S., passed 8-6-19)
§ 56.14 BLANKET PERMITS.
   (A)   The Director of Public Works may issue to any applicant a blanket
permit for a series of excavations, installations, or encroachments of the same
type and may prescribe a procedure for the payment of the fees therefor on a
monthly or annual basis. The provisions of this section shall be broadly
construed to reduce the administrative costs of both the applicants and the
city.
   (B)   Applicants seeking blanket permits are encouraged to communicate
planned excavations with the city, other utility owners and/or other applicants
in an effort to coordinate project schedules and minimize impacts to the
roadway and traveling public.
(Ord. 887-C.S., passed 8-6-19)
§ 56.15 VIOLATIONS - REVOCATION AND OTHER PENALTIES.
   (A)   Any violation of this chapter may be enforced though administrative
citation, as an infraction or misdemeanor, or by any remedy available to the
city under this code or under state law.
      (1)   Any fines shall be paid by the permittee prior to issuance of any
additional permits for work in the City of Eureka.
   (B)   Suspension. Whenever the Engineer finds it necessary to suspend an
encroachment permit to protect the public health or safety from imminent
danger, the Engineer may immediately suspend any such permit pending a hearing
for remedial action or revocation. The Engineer shall, within three working
days of the emergency suspension, give a written notice of such suspension to
the permittee, by personal service or by first class mail, postage prepaid, to
the last known address of the permittee. The permittee may, within 15 days
after service of such a written notice of suspension, file with the City
Manager a written request for hearing regarding the suspension. The City
Manager or his or her designee shall schedule a hearing on the suspension
within five working days of receipt of a request for hearing. If the City
Manager or his or her designee, after the hearing, finds that the public health
or safety requires correction or alteration of any condition caused by, or
existing on the site of the encroachment, he or she shall issue one or more of
the following:
      (1)   An order to correct any particular noncompliance.
      (2)   A revocation of the encroachment permit.
      (3)   A continued suspension of the encroachment permit, until such time

is based, and the action taken. The decision of the City Manager or his or her
designee shall be final, except a decision to revoke the permit which may be
appealed to the City Council in accordance with §
39.01 of this Code.
   (D)   Revocation. The Engineer may recommend that the City Manager revoke a
permit where he or she finds that:
      (1)   The permittee has violated any provision of this code or conditions
of the permit;
      (2)   The permittee has failed to pay any required fees, or to post or
maintain any bond or insurance required by this chapter;
      (3)   The encroachment for which the permit was granted adversely affects
the safety, capacity, or integrity of the city's public right-of- way or
increases the city's liability exposure;
      (4)   The encroachment is causing the city to incur substantial
additional maintenance costs; or
      (5)   Material misrepresentations, omissions, or inaccuracies were made
in the application for the permit.
   (E)   The Engineer shall give the permittee at least ten days' written
notice of a hearing before the City Manager or his or her designee on the
proposed revocation of a permit issued pursuant to this Chapter, setting forth
the grounds for such action. If, after reviewing all evidence presented before
or at the public hearing, the City Manager or his or her designee makes any one
of the five findings set forth above, he or she may revoke the permit.
   (F)   The City Manager or his or her designee shall, within ten days after
the close of the hearing, render a written opinion, stating the findings upon
which the decision is based, and the action taken. The decision of the City
Manager or his or her designee may be appealed to the City Council in
accordance with §
39.01 of this code.

STREET OPENING AND PAVEMENT RESTORATION REGULATIONS
§ 56.30 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   The public right-of-way is a unique public resource held in trust for
the benefit of the public. This physically limited resource requires proper
management to maximize its efficiency and minimize the costs to taxpayers, to
protect against foreclosure of future economic expansion because of premature
exhaustion of the public right-of-way, and to minimize the inconvenience to and
negative effects on the public from use of the public right-of-way by
contractors and utility companies.
   (B)   To achieve the purpose of this chapter, the City of Eureka shall
endeavor to coordinate its Capital Improvement Programs with those of utility
companies and franchisees with facilities in, on, under or above the public
right-of-way. Information about any planned work in the right-of-way shall be
shared at the earliest possible time. Utility owners and franchisees are
encouraged to coordinate their street excavations so that all work is done
simultaneously and the street is not excavated more than once within a 12-month
period.
(Ord. 887-C.S., passed 8-6-19)
§ 56.31 PROHIBITION PERIOD.
   (A)   For streets having recently received new pavement consisting of at
least a one-half inch thick layer of asphalt, the prohibition period shall be
five years from the date of installation.
   (B)   For those streets with chip seal, slurry seal coating, or micro paving
(or similar) with less than one-half inch of new pavement, the prohibition
period shall be three years from the date of installation.
   (C)   For streets not sealed or paved within the last three to five years
the prohibition period shall end when the PCI drops below 80 according to the
city's most recent PCI survey/study.
   (D)   Utilities shall plan well enough in advance to determine alternate
methods of making necessary repairs to avoid excavating in prohibition streets.
Exceptions are as follows:
      (1)   Emergencies that endanger life or property.

section, the Council shall find that the public convenience and necessity
require such acquisitions or improvements, or both, in the manner provided in
Section 17 of Article XIII of the Constitution of the state.
      (1)   Preliminary determination of necessity. A resolution of preliminary
determination shall be adopted describing in general terms the proposed
improvement or acquisition and setting a time and place when and where any and
all persons interested may appear and show cause, if any they have, why the
Council should not find and determine that the public convenience and necessity
require the proposed acquisition or improvement without compliance with the
Special Assessment Investigation, Limitation, and Majority Protest Act of 1931
(being Cal. Streets and Highways Code §§ 2800 et seq.).

time and place of hearing. A copy of the resolution shall be published in one
or more issues of a newspaper published and circulated in the city, and a copy

Investigation Act of 1931 shall not apply. Such findings may be incorporated in
the resolution ordering the improvement and/or acquisition.
      (5)   Modification. When proceedings are held for a change and
modification, the resolution of intention to change and modify shall be deemed

with reference thereto, and the order of the Council determining the
convenience and necessity therein shall be final and conclusive.

zones, the resolution of intention shall so state, giving the percentages to be
raised from lands in each zone.
      (4)   Designation. Each zone shall be designated by a different letter or
number and shall be plainly shown on the map or plat of the assessment district
filed in the office of the City Clerk and referred to in the resolution of
intention, either by separate boundaries, coloring, or other convenient and
graphic method, so that all persons interested may with accuracy ascertain
within which zone any parcel of land is located.
      (5)   Plat. It shall be sufficient, in all cases where the assessment
district is to be divided into such zones according to benefits, if the
resolution of intention states that fact and refers to the plat or map for the

may devote a portion of its property to uses such as retail stores, bus depots,
gasoline service stations, helicopter landing areas, or any other commercial
uses when, in its judgment, it is convenient or necessary to conduct or permit
such use in order to utilize properly the property in a parking facility. Any

members, may determine that any parcel of property acquired from the proceeds
of the bonds or any improvements, extensions, or replacements thereof or

highway, public property, or private property in such inoperable or neglected
condition that the owner's intention to relinquish all further rights or
interests in it may be reasonably concluded. In reference to highways,

   (A)   The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or
inoperative vehicles or parts, on private or public property, including
highways, creates a condition tending to reduce the value of private property,
promotes blight and deterioration, invites plundering, creates fire hazards,
constitutes an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety
of minors, creates a harborage for rodents and insects and is injurious to the
health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or
inoperative vehicle or parts, on private or public property, including
highways, is declared to constitute a nuisance which may be abated in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

in the vehicle or part thereof, except as provided in Cal. Veh. Code § 22661
(c).
   (C)   The ten-day notice of intention to abate and remove a vehicle or part
thereof, when required by this chapter, shall contain a statement of hearing
rights of the owner of the property on which the vehicle is located and of the
owner of the vehicle. The statement shall include notice to the property owner

ten days after the mailing of notice of intention to abate and remove the
vehicle or at the time of signing a release.

land without the consent of the landowner and that he (or she) has not
subsequently acquiesced in its presence, then the local authority shall not
assess costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property
on which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such cost from
the owner.
   (J)   If the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located submits a
sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle
on his (or her) land within such time period, this statement shall be construed

submitting such request.
   (K)   The Chief of Police or his designee may impose such conditions and
take such other action as it deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry
out the purpose of this chapter. It may delay the time for removal of the

appropriate. The Clerk shall give written notice of the time and place of the
hearing to the appellant, to the owner of the land, and the owner of the
vehicle. In conducting the hearing, the City Council shall not be limited to

completely enclosed within a building in a lawful manner where it is not
visible from the street or other public or private property; or a vehicle or

in connection with the business of a licensed dismantler, licensed vehicle
dealer, or junk yard.

RESTRICTIONS ON BUTANE SALES
§ 92.10 REGULATION OF THE SALE, PURCHASE, AND POSSESSION OF BUTANE.
   (A)   Findings and purpose.
      (1)   The northern region of our state has experienced a recent increase
in explosions caused from the manufacture of honey oil (also known as hash oil)
in clandestine labs using refined butane of 5x and higher. These incidents have
caused considerable property damage, personal injury and even incidents of
death to those participating in the manufacturing process, and to innocent
bystanders.
      (2)   That the use of refined butane 5x or higher is done to dissolve the
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) resin, which concentrates into a liquid/oil form as
a result of the butane's stripping process. The stripping of the THC through
use of refined butane of 5x or higher causes flammable butane vapors to
accumulate low to the ground and remain exposed to ignition sources. Studies
suggest that 99.5% of the extracted THC Butane mixture will volatilize into the
immediate area and remain in a form that is odorless and latent to the human
eye and only detected through a combustible gas instrument.
      (3)   A honey lab using 5x refine butane and higher presents a serious
hazard for first responders as the gas has no odor and can only be detected by
a combustible gas instrument. Such conditions present a grave risk of loss
where devices typically deployed by first responders are capable of igniting
the gas resulting in an explosion.
      (4)   That the resale of refined butane 5x and higher occurs at levels
that are only relevant to the manufacture of honey oil. That such sales and
possession of butane should be regulated to prevent the use of butane in the
manufacture of honey oil where such activity presents grave dangers and adverse
health risks to the occupants of the City of Eureka and the first responders
therein.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions
apply:
      BUTANE. Iso-butane, n-butane, and butane of power 5x or greater.
      CANISTER. A single butane canister of a storage quantity of 300 ml (10.6
ounces).
      CODE. The Eureka Municipal Code.
      COUNT. The number of canisters of refined butane.
      CUSTOMER. Any person who is sold or acquires during a transaction

natural person.

distribute or supply, whether for monetary gain or other consideration.

acquisition or disposition of property by whatever means effected.

      (3)   It is unlawful for any customer of retailer/reseller to purchase or
acquire per calendar month any number of butane canisters or tanks that exceed
a combined total storage quantity of 600 ml of butane, whether sold

   (D)   Tracking of butane sale and records retention. Every vendor shall do
all of the following:

('63 Code, § 11-4.02)
(Ord. 2874, passed 7-18-61; Am. Ord. 375-C.S., passed 10-19-82)
§ 93.02 CAMPING PERMITTED ONLY IN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED AREAS.
   (A)   Statement of purposes. The City Council finds that:
      (1)   The streets, parks, public buildings and grounds, and other public
areas in the city should be readily accessible and available to residents and
the public at large. Public property within the city is not specifically
designed for the purposes of camping or overnight sleeping activities and so
does not have the facilities necessary to protect the property from overuse and
unsanitary conditions potentially injurious to public health. The use of public
property for camping purposes interferes with the rights of others to use the
areas for the purposes for which they were intended, such as transportation,
municipal operations, recreation, and open space.
      (2)   There is no specific site or sites that should be designated for
camping because it is the experience of the city and other municipalities that
sites where camping is continuous or camping populations are numerous become
public health, environmental degradation, and policing problems.
      (3)   Camping activities may constitute a public health and safety hazard
when conducted without the proper security and sanitary facilities and
precautions. The necessity to clean up, repair or remediate public property
that has been used for unlawful camping may result in substantial costs to the
public.
      (4)   This section must be interpreted not to criminalize any person
based on their status as a homeless individual. To that end, whenever an issue
of interpretation arises, this section must be interpreted in a manner
consistent with the holding in Martin v. City of Boise (9th Cir. 2019) 920 F.3d
584.
      (5)   The law enforcement response to a violation of this section should
prioritize the city's restorative justice and diversion programs in preference
to citations for infractions when offenders are willing and able to participate
in those programs.
   (B)   Definitions.  For purposes of this section, the following definitions
apply, unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
      ACCOMMODATION. A place that is protected from the elements and offers
sleeping and restroom facilities and that does not require a person to forego
the exercise of any State or Federal Constitutional right in order to stay
there.
      AVAILABLE. Obtainable by the specific person taking into account that
person's characteristics and circumstances.
      TO CAMP or CAMPING. To place, pitch or occupy camp facilities; to live
temporarily in a camp facility or outdoors; to use camp paraphernalia.
      CAMP FACILITIES. Tents, huts, lean-tos, vehicles, vehicle camping outfits
or temporary shelters, cook stoves or fire pits, however constructed.
      CAMP PARAPHERNALIA. Bedrolls, tarpaulins, cots, beds, mattresses,
sleeping bags, hammocks, camp stoves or cooking implements or similar
materials.
      INVOLUNTARY CAMPING. Camping by a person at such time as there is no
accommodation accepting homeless persons within the city that is available to
that same person.

         (d)   The area 75 feet from the centerline of any officially-
designated recreational or multi-use trail on city property;
         (e)   The Downtown/Old Town Business District as defined in Appendix A

         (f)   The Northern Gateway Business District A, as defined in Appendix
B to Ord. 913-C.S.;
         (g)   The Waterfront Business District, as defined in Appendix C to
Ord. 913-C.S.;
         (h)   The Henderson Center Business District, as defined in Appendix D
to Ord. 913-C.S.;
      PROHIBITED TIME OF DAY. The time between 30 minutes after sunrise and 30
minutes before sunset. EXCEPTION: Subject to the Prohibited Place and Private
Property restrictions, and the restrictions of §§
130.11 and
130.13 of this code, a person who is involuntarily camping lawfully may remain
in place through the course of the day when the weather is actively, measurably
raining or snowing or the temperature is below 40 degrees Fahrenheit as of 30
minutes after sunrise.
      VOLUNTARY CAMPING. Camping for which no city permit has been issued, on
any public property within the city, at such time as there is an accommodation
available to the person that that person refuses to avail him/her or their self
of for any reason that is unrelated to the person's exercise of a First
Amendment or other state or federal constitutional right.
   (C)   Unlawful camping.
      (1)   It is unlawful and a public nuisance to camp voluntarily, occupy
camp facilities or use camp paraphernalia in, on or under any public property,
except as permitted by an exception approved expressly or by policy adopted by
the City Council.
       (2)   It is unlawful and a public nuisance, whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, to camp, occupy camp facilities or use camp paraphernalia in, on
or under any public property in a prohibited place or during the prohibited
time of day.
      (3)   It is unlawful and a public nuisance, whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, to camp, occupy camp facilities or use camp paraphernalia on
public or private property in a manner that meets the definition of
“obstructive conduct” found in §
130.11 or obstructs rights-of-way under §
130.13 of the Eureka Municipal Code.
   (D)   Involuntary camping - when and where lawful. Involuntary camping on
public property is lawful when and where it is not otherwise unlawful under
division (C), above.
   (E)   Camping on private property. Camping on private property is lawful if
the owner of 50% or more of the fee interest in the property is present at all
times the camping is occurring, and if the camping is occurring accessory to an
existing permitted residential use on the property, and the property is zoned
for residential use only. Notwithstanding the foregoing exemption, if the
camping is creating or maintaining a nuisance as defined in this Code or is
without the express written consent of an owner of 50% or more of the fee
interest in the property, then it is unlawful. On lands not described above in
respect to permitted use and zoning, unless the land is specifically zoned and
approved for camping, all other camping on private property is unlawful and a
nuisance.
   (F)   Penalty. A violation of this section is an infraction and is subject
to the following penalties:
      (1)   A fine not exceeding $25.00 for a first violation;
      (2)   A fine not exceeding $35.00 for a second violation of this section
within one year of a prior violation:
      (3)   A fine not exceeding $50.00 for each additional violation of this
section within one year of two prior violations.
   (G)   Severability. If any provision, subdivision, sentence, clause or
phrase of this section as now constituted or later amended, or its application
to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, unconstitutional or otherwise

smoking is prohibited by law, including, without limitation, within a
reasonable distance required by this chapter from any area in which smoking is

threaten any reprisal, or effect any reprisal, for the purpose of retaliating

that the method of construction provided for in this section is necessary,
hereby declares and specifies that whenever any railroad tracks of any
description exist upon any street in the city which the Council has ordered to
be graded and paved with a wearing surface laid on a concrete or other base,
the resolution ordering such work, unless the Council shall by resolution have
declared to the contrary, shall be deemed to constitute a requirement that the
person having such railroad tracks shall improve the portions of the street
used by such tracks between the rails and for two feet on each side thereof and
between the tracks, if there are more than one, with improvements similar in
all respects to, with the same materials, under the same specifications and
superintendence, and to the like inspection and satisfaction as the rest of the
streets are graded and paved, subject to the following additions which the
Council has adjusted and determined to be necessary:
   The person having such railroad tracks shall excavate the roadbed of such
railroad tracks to a depth not less than six inches of gravel ballast, which
gravel ballast shall be thoroughly tamped or rolled to an elevation even with
the bottom of the ties, and shall place concrete between and to the full depth
of the ties used in such railroad tracks, which concrete shall be of the
mixture set forth in the specifications for such work. The concrete shall be
brought solidly under the base of the rails and elsewhere shall be brought to a
true finish.
('63 Code, § 7-3.201)
   (B)   The rails used on such railroad tracks shall be of the girder, groove,

SIDEWALK AND CURB IMPROVEMENT PROCEEDINGS
§ 98.45 FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.
   The Council finds and declares as follows:
   (A)   That the lack of improved sidewalks in the city in many instances
forces pedestrians, particularly school children, to walk in the streets and to
be subjected to the hazards of vehicular traffic;
   (B)   That the lack of sidewalks during rainy weather has caused unhealthy
conditions resulting from pedestrians walking through mud or water along
streets or dirt sidewalks;
   (C)   That the lack of improved curbs and gutters in the city permits poor
drainage and the accumulation of puddles of water and filth, impedes the
operation of street sweepers, fire trucks, and police cars, and subjects
children and pedestrians in the normal sidewalk area to accidental injury and
the hazards of vehicular traffic; and,
   (D)   That the lack of adequate improved curbs and sidewalks is dangerous to
the public health, safety, and welfare of the inhabitants of the city.

   (A)   Before adopting any resolution ordering the construction of a sidewalk
or curb, or both, in front of that portion of any parcel of private property
abutting upon any public street or place, and if it appears that the public
convenience, necessity, health, safety, and welfare require such construction

ordered and the private property in front of which the improvement proposed to
be ordered is to be constructed by giving its lot and block number according to
the official city or assessment map, or in such other manner as to reasonably
describe such property. The resolution shall also set a time and place when and
where any person interested, owning, or having an interest in the real property
in front of which the improvement proposed to be ordered is to be constructed
may file written objections and appear and show cause, if any they have, why
the Council should not find and determine that the public convenience,
necessity, health, safety, and welfare require the proposed improvement and why
the proposed improvement should not be carried out. The time of hearing shall

STREET PLANTINGS
§ 98.70 STATEMENT OF POLICY.
   (A)   It is recognized that, generally, provisions for the planting of trees
and other growth in that portion of the public streets not used for vehicular
traffic promote the public interest and general welfare, but, in so doing, due
consideration must be given to pedestrian and vehicle safety and to the
possibility of interference with the movement of vehicular and pedestrian
traffic and interference with surface, subsurface, and overhead public and
utility improvements and facilities.
   (B)   It shall be the policy of the city to foster, encourage, and authorize
the planting of trees and other growth in that portion of the public streets
and ways not used for vehicular traffic provided such planting is made in
accordance with an approved street planting plan and where it appears that such
planting will not unreasonably interfere with the rights of the public in the
adjacent public street, or unreasonably interfere with vehicular or pedestrian
traffic, or unreasonably interfere with surface, subsurface, or overhead public
and utility improvements and facilities.

§ 98.701 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The City recognizes substantial economic, environmental and aesthetic
importance of trees and plantings within the community and public streets
acknowledging that:
   (A)   Tree-lined streets help to make a city safer and more livable by:
calming and slowing traffic; making it safer for children to walk and bicycle
to school; welcoming pedestrians and bicyclists and encouraging healthful
exercise; reducing noise levels in neighborhoods; fostering community pride and
ownership, which have been shown to reduce crime; and
   (B)   Tree-lined streets contribute to a prosperous and robust local economy
by increasing residential property values; improving the attractiveness of
business districts; enticing outside businesses and industries seeking to
relocate; making the city more inviting to residents and tourists; and
   (C)   Tree-lined streets help to increase a city's tax base by making the
city more attractive to potential homeowners and businesses; and
   (D)   Tree-lined streets contribute to a healthier environment by enticing
people to live in the city closer to their jobs; thereby, saving time and
energy required for commuting by helping to slow global warming; and
   (E)   Trees must be carefully chosen and placed in order to avoid
potentially adverse effects on buildings, solar access, sidewalks and
automobiles; and
   (F)   It shall be the City's policy to utilize applicable techniques,
methods and procedures to preserve, whenever feasible, all trees and plantings
on City property; to facilitate continued planned replacement and future
planting by the City and adjacent property owners; facilitate the permit
process for new street plantings; and to establish maintenance responsibility
for all street plantings.

be used without conflict with the zoning regulations. The City Council may
authorize the issuance of such permit, license or certificate of occupancy if
it finds that such proposed use conforms to the one in which the right-of-way
is classified as provided for in
Chapter 155 of the Eureka Municipal Code, that the particular right-of-way is
not needed for transportation or for the movement of traffic, and that such
proposed use would not be contrary to the public interest and would not be
hazardous to the public health, safety and general welfare.

renewed until all fees and charges due and payable shall have been paid in
full.

privileges or uses. Additional or varying uses shall not be allowed except as
provided in the ordinances and regulations of the city.

   (F)   Moorage spaces may be reassigned at the discretion of the Harbor

sublet.
   (I)   Any berthing assignment permit or temporary berthing assignment permit
may be revoked immediately by the Harbor Master if the holder thereof violates

holder thereof shall at all times keep the Harbor Master informed of his
current mailing address, telephone number, legal owner's address, and insurance
company of record. The holder shall also notify the Harbor Master immediately
upon any change of ownership of the vessel to which his berthing assignment
permit applies, and shall further notify the Harbor Master immediately upon
vacating the mooring spaces assigned to the vessel. Failure to keep the Harbor
Master informed as to the holder's current mailing address, telephone number,
legal owner's address, and insurance company of record shall be grounds for
revocation of the berthing assignment permit.

of a berthing assignment permit that the berthing assignment permit has been
revoked pursuant to this chapter, and after the expiration of 11 days from the

remains due and unpaid for 30 days after billing. Past due accounts, in
addition to the late penalty charge, should have interest accrued at 1.5% per
month.
   (D)   Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as a waiver by
the city of any rights and privileges granted by this chapter nor as a waiver
of any right which the city may have against the vessel or the holder of any
berthing assignment permit therefor under this chapter.

§ 100.18 BERTHING REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Berth assignment. Berth assignments shall be made from a chronological
waiting list. A vacant berth assignment will be offered first to that person
highest on the list for that size berth assignment and then, if refused, in
sequence to those next on the list. Acceptance of a berth assignment must be
indicated within five days of notification by payment of rent and deposits, and
execution of a berthing assignment permit and indemnity agreement, and a
statement of ownership and registration. A permittee must occupy this berth
assignment with the boat owned and currently registered or documented to him
within ten days from the date of assignment. A “leave of absence” may be
granted for periods exceeding seven months which will relieve the boater from
rent obligations and entitle the permittee to the first available berthing
assignment at the end of such “leave of absence.” Leaves of absence are not
intended to facilitate substantial regular berthing at other harbors. No
permittee may transfer his berthing assignment. Should he not desire to retain
the berth assignment for his own use, it shall be available for reassignment.
No permittee shall sublet or subrent his berth assignment to another person.
The Harbor Master shall have the authority to move or relocate in the harbor
any boat berthed therein. Such changes may be required for the safety and
protection of personal property or as indicated, in order to obtain optimum
utilization of facilities available. The Harbor Master may, when deemed
necessary, permit vessels to use unoccupied moorings or berths for temporary
assignment of guest or transient vessels. No benefit shall accrue to the
permittee on account of fees collected for temporary assignments.
('63 Code, § 11-1.401)
   (B)   Safe mooring. All vessels will be required to furnish fenders or
fender material as approved by the Harbor Master. The use of tires or similar

vessel to a vessel already occupying a mooring or berth without the approval of
the master of that vessel and a berthing assignment permit from the Harbor
Master.

   (D)   Obstruction of wharves, floats and piers.
      (1)   City owned piers, floats, gangways and docks shall be kept clear at
all times of any miscellaneous gear, debris, material, or other hazardous
obstructions except as permitted by tidelands lease.
      (2)   Any condition aboard or around any boat, float or gangplank caused
by the berth holder which in the opinion of the Harbor Master constitutes a
fire hazard, health menace, danger to the public safety, or aesthetic
distraction shall be corrected or removed immediately to the satisfaction of
the Harbor Master. In addition to other remedies, in the event of the refusal
or the neglect of the owner or the permittee to remedy forthwith the
aforementioned conditions when reported to him, the Harbor Master shall remove
the cause of the complaint at the sole expense of the owner and cancel the
berth assignment of such owner or permittee.
      (3)   No person shall build or place in, on or about the Harbor any
structures such as steps, walkways, gangplanks, finger floats, rubbing piles,
dock boxes, or the like, without prior written approval of the Harbor Master.

   (E)   Maintenance of boat in berth.
      (1)   Boat maintenance work in berths shall be limited to that ordinarily
required to keep a vessel seaworthy and in good condition. Berth renters shall
not conduct any major reconstruction work that would tend to make a boat
unseaworthy or unsightly. No such work shall be undertaken except as may be
provided in a site authorized for such work. Berth renters performing

§ 103.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the use and installation of alarm
devices, to promote their responsible use, and to reduce or eliminate the
incidence of false alarms. The Eureka Police Department and the Humboldt Bay
Fire Joint Powers Authority ("JPA") (of which the City of Eureka is a member
agency) respond to over 1,100 false alarms every year, often at the same
location. Before the city joined the JPA, the Eureka Fire Department also
responded to a large number of false alarms every year. This high incidence of
false alarms reduces the ability of Police and Fire to respond to valid alarms
and other emergencies, which constitutes a hazard to emergency responders and
to the general public.
(Ord. 921-C.S., passed 9-7-21)
§ 103.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply

   ACCESSIBILITY. Any building or portion thereof that is serviced by an alarm
must be capable of being reached by the emergency responders whether by patrol
vehicle, fire apparatus, by foot, or no more than 300 feet from where the
emergency vehicle can be parked. If there is any barrier such as a wall, gate,
cliff, dog or any other material object that prevents, impedes or jeopardizes
the safety of the emergency responders so that the alarm and/or building cannot
be checked, it will be classified as "Inaccessible".
   ALARM ADMINISTRATOR. The administrator of the alarm is based on the nature
of the alarm. Security alarms, including; burglary, duress, intrusion, panic,
robbery/holdup alarms, or alarms resulting in Police Department response will
be administered by the Eureka Police Department. Fire and life safety alarms,
including; private fire alarm systems and private medical alarms, chemical
release alarms, carbon monoxide (CO) alarms, or alarms resulting in Fire
Department response administered by the Fire Department. The Police Chief may
assign the administrative tasks that are the responsibility of the city in this
chapter. The Humboldt Bay Fire Joint Powers Authority (or any third party under
contract with the city to provide fire protection services) may contract with
the city for the administration of this chapter, on its behalf. If, at any
time, a department, whether internal to the city, is established to provide
fire protection services, then the Fire Chief of that department may assign the
administrative tasks.
   ALARM COMPANY. Any person, firm or corporation engaged in the business of
selling, leasing, maintaining, servicing, repairing, altering, replacing,
moving, removing, installing or monitoring an alarm system in or on any
building, place or premises. This chapter specifically excludes retail

to the satisfaction of the Finance Department that such statement does not set
forth the true facts of the business for which a license is required.
   (B)   In the event the issuance of a license is withheld pursuant to the
provisions of this section, the Finance Department shall, concurrently with the
withholding of the license, deliver a written statement to the applicant

   (A)   If any person fails to file any required statement within the time
prescribed, or if, after demand therefor has been made by the Finance
Department, he fails to file a corrected statement within 15 days after
notification so to do, or it appears to the satisfaction of the Director of
Finance that a statement filed does not set forth the true facts of the
business for which a license is required, the Director of Finance shall
determine the amount of license tax due from such person by means of such
information as he may be able to obtain.
   (B)   In case such determination is made, the Department of Finance shall
give notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing
it in the United States Post Office at Eureka, California, postage prepaid,

appearing on his last license or application. Such person may, within ten days
after the serving or mailing of such notice, make an application in writing to
the Director of Finance for a hearing before the Director of Finance on the
amount of the license tax. If such an application is made, the Director of
Finance shall give not less than five days' written notice, in the manner
prescribed herein, to the licensee to show cause, at a time and place fixed in
such notice, why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for such
license. At such hearing, the licensee may appear and offer evidence why such
specified tax should not be fixed as the license tax. After such hearing, the
Director of Finance shall determine the proper tax to be charged and shall
forthwith give written notice to the licensee in the manner prescribed herein
of such determination and the amount of such tax.
   (C)   If an application by the licensee for a hearing is not made within the
time prescribed, the license tax determined by the Director of Finance shall

   CABLE SYSTEM. A facility consisting of a set of closed transmission paths
and associated signal generation, reception, and control equipment that is
designed to provide cable service which includes video programming and which is
provided to multiple subscribers within a community, but such term does not
include: (A) a facility that serves only to retransmit the television signals

of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, except that such facility shall
be considered a cable system (other than for purposes of 47 U.S.C. § 541(c)) to

directly to subscribers, unless the extent of such use is solely to provide
interactive on-demand services; (D) any facilities of any electric utility used

calculation. If a franchise granted pursuant to this chapter specifies a
franchise fee established as the result of limiting applicable law, the city
shall have the option to renegotiate the amount of the franchise fee upon a
change in applicable law. Nothing herein requires a person to pay amounts in
excess of any limits that may be established by state or federal law.
   FRANCHISEE or GRANTEE. A person holding a cable communications system
franchise granted by the city.
   GROSS REVENUES. All cash, credits, property, or other consideration of any

such other revenue sources as may now exist or hereafter develop. The
definition shall be interpreted in a manner which permits the city to collect
the maximum franchise fee permitted by law, irrespective of the source of
revenue. GROSS REVENUES, however, shall not include any bad debt (defined as
unpaid subscriber or advertiser accounts), any taxes on services furnished to a
grantee and imposed directly upon any subscriber or user by the state, city or
other governmental unit and collected by a grantee on behalf of said
governmental unit. The amount paid as a franchise fee shall not be deducted
from gross revenues unless required to be deducted under federal law.

discrete, and limited portion of the public rights-of-way to construct,
operate, or repair a communications facility.

definition, that any transfer or cumulative transfer of a voting interest by a
person or group of persons acting in concert of 10% or more of grantee, or
person that controls grantee, or any change in the managing general partners of
a grantee is a change of control.
      (2)   TRANSFER does not include:

   Grantees of franchises existing as of the effective date of this chapter
shall, in addition to all the obligations and duties prescribed by the terms of
their existing franchises, be subject to the substantive and procedural

§ 114.08 FILING AN APPLICATION.
   A person seeking to obtain a franchise; transfer a franchise; extend the
term of an existing franchise; renew a franchise; or modify an existing
franchise to add new services that are required to be authorized by a franchise
pursuant to this chapter, shall submit a signed original of its application and
six copies to the Clerk of the Board. The Clerk of the Board shall make a
proposal available for public inspection. The application must conform to all
of the requirements of this chapter. Requests for other types of franchise
modifications may be processed by the city without an application, and
submitted for approval. However, nothing herein shall prevent the city from
requiring a application in the event the city determines, based on the nature
of the requested modification, that the public interest would best be served by
the submission of a application pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
§ 114.09 APPLICATION FEE.
   (A)   An applicant shall pay all reasonable costs incurred by the city
related to the processing of any application. Processing costs shall include,
but not be limited to, the costs of services rendered by any city employee,
agent or representative, including consultants and attorneys.
   (B)   The initial deposit of the application fee for the consideration of an
application for issuance, renewal, transfer, or modification of a franchise
shall be in the amount of $5,000, or for a license in the amount of $1,000,
which deposit shall be submitted with the application. The city may, as costs
are incurred, draw upon the deposit to recover its administrative costs,
including, but not limited to, the reasonable cost of outside consultants
retained by the city related to the city's consideration and processing of a
franchise or license. The City Manager, at any time, may require the applicant
to deposit additional sums if it appears that the initial deposit or subsequent
deposits will be exhausted prior to the final action by the city relating to
the consideration by the city of an application for issuance, renewal,
transfer, or modification of a franchise or license. The applicant will not be
entitled to further consideration by the city its requested action until such
time as the additional deposit required by the City Manager has been deposited
with the city. In the event the amount of the deposit of an applicant is in
excess of the amount of the administrative expenses of the city related to the
action requested, then the applicant shall be entitled to a return of any such
excess amount. In addition, an applicant that is awarded a franchise or a
license shall pay the city a sum of money sufficient to reimburse it for all
publication expenses incurred by it in connection with the granting of a
franchise or license. Such payment shall be made to the Auditor-Controller of
the city within 30 days after the city furnishes the franchisee or licensee
with a statement of such expenses.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
§ 114.10 NATURE OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Scope. A franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall authorize
and permit a franchisee to construct, operate, maintain and repair a cable
system or an OVS (as applicable) to provide cable service in the city, and for
that purpose to erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct,
maintain facilities appurtenant to such system in, on, over, under, upon,
across, and along the public rights-of-way, and along such other public
property that the city may authorize a franchisee to use.
   (B)   Nothing passes by implication. A franchise shall not convey rights
other than as specified in this chapter, or in a franchise agreement; no rights
shall pass by implication.
   (C)   Franchise not in lieu of other authorizations. A franchise shall not
include, or be a substitute for:
      (1)   Compliance with requirements for the privilege of transacting and
carrying on a business within the city, including, but not limited to,
complying with the conditions the city may establish before constructing
facilities for, or providing, non-cable services;
      (2)   Any permit, agreement or authorization required in connection with
operations on or in public rights-of-way or public property, including by way
of example and not limitation, encroachment permits for street construction;
      (3)   Any permits or agreements for occupying any other property of the
city or private entities to which access is not specifically granted by the
franchise.
   (D)   Franchisee must comply with other laws. A franchise does not relieve a
franchisee of the franchisee's duty to comply with all the city ordinances and
regulations, and every franchisee must comply with the same. Likewise, the
rights granted under a franchise are subject to the exercise of police and
other powers the city now has or may later obtain, including but not limited to
the power of eminent domain. Every franchise shall be deemed to incorporate all
the requirements of the City Charter.
   (E)   Franchise not a grant of property rights. A franchise does not convey
title, equitable or legal, in the public rights-of-way. Rights granted may not
be subdivided or subleased.
   (F)   Franchise non-exclusive. No franchise shall be exclusive, or prevent
the city from issuing other franchises or authorizations, or prevent the city
from itself constructing, operating or repairing its own cable communications
system with or without a franchise.
   (G)   Franchise term. Every franchise shall be for a term of years, which
term shall be eight years, unless a franchise specifies otherwise.
   (H)   Costs borne by franchisee. Unless otherwise specifically stated in a
franchise, or is required or permitted by law, all acts which a franchisee is
required to perform under the franchise or applicable law must be performed at
the franchisee's expense.
   (I)   Failures to perform. If a cable communications system operator fails
to perform work that it is required to perform within the time provided for
performance, the city may perform the work and bill the operator therefor. The
operator shall pay the amounts billed within 30 days.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
§ 114.11 ADMINISTRATION OF CHAPTER; ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Adoption of regulations. The city may from time to time adopt
regulations to implement the provisions of this chapter. This chapter, and any
regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter, are not contracts with any
franchisee, and may be amended at any time. Nothing in this section shall
affect a franchisee's right to challenge the lawfulness or applicability of a
future exercise of the police or legislative power of the city.
   (B)   Delegation. The City Manager or designee(s) are hereby authorized to
administer the provisions of this chapter and any franchise issued pursuant
thereto, and to provide any notices (including noncompliance notices) and to
take any action on the city's behalf that may be required hereunder or under
applicable law.
   (C)   No waiver. The failure of the city, upon one or more occasions, to
exercise a right or to require compliance or performance under a franchise or
any other applicable law shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of such
right or a waiver of compliance or performance, unless such right has been
specifically waived in writing.
   (D)   Administration of public, educational and government access. The city
may designate one or more entities, including itself, to control and manage the
use of public, educational and government access channels, facilities and
equipment.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
§ 114.12 TRANSFERS.
   (A)   Prior approval required. Every franchise shall be deemed to be held in
trust, and to be personal to the franchisee. Any transfer that is made without
the prior approval of the city shall be deemed invalid.
   (B)   Exception for mortgages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
chapter, pledges in trust or mortgages of the assets of a cable communications
system to secure the construction, operation, or repair of the system may be
made without application and without the city's prior consent. However, no such
arrangement may be made without the city's prior consent if it would in any
respect under any condition prevent the cable communications system operator or
any successor from complying with the franchise or applicable law; or permit a
third party to succeed to the interest of the operator, or to own or control
the system, without the prior consent of the city. Any mortgage, pledge or
lease shall be subject to and subordinate to the rights of the city under any
franchise, this chapter, or other applicable law.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
Penalty, see § 114.15
§ 114.13 GENERAL CONDITIONS UPON CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION AND REPAIR.
   (A)   Franchisee must follow local rules. The construction, operation, and
repair of cable communications systems shall be performed in compliance with
all lawful and applicable laws, ordinances, departmental rules, regulations,
and practices affecting such system. By way of example, and not limitation,
this includes zoning and safety codes, construction standards, regulations for
providing notice to persons that may be affected by system construction, and
directives governing the time, place and manner in which facilities may be
installed in the public rights-of-way. Persons engaged in the construction,
operation, or repair of communications facilities shall exercise reasonable
care in the performance of all their activities and shall use commonly accepted
methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to
cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public or to property.
   (B)   No permit without franchise. A franchise is required before a permit
may be issued for work associated with the construction of a cable
communications system. Any permit issued for such work to, or on behalf of, a
person that does not hold a franchise shall vest no rights in the permittee;
the permit may be revoked at will, and the permittee shall remove all
facilities installed under the permit upon the city's demand.
   (C)   Permits must be obtained. Construction, operation, or repair of a
cable communications system shall not commence until all required permits have
been obtained from the proper city officials and all required fees have been
paid. All work performed will be performed in strict accordance with the
conditions of the permit. Upon order of the city, any work and/or construction
undertaken that is not completed in compliance with the city's requirements, or
which is installed without obtaining necessary permits and approvals shall be
removed.
   (D)   No interference. Interference with the use of the public rights-of-way
by others, including others that may be installing cable communications
systems, must be minimized. The city may require a person using the public
rights-of-way to cooperate with others through joint trenching and other
arrangements to minimize adverse impacts on the public rights-of-way.
   (E)   Plans for and publicizing work. Work shall be publicized as the city
may direct from time to time. The publication of work may be used to notify the
public and operators of other communications systems of the impending work in
order to minimize inconvenience and disruption to the public.
      (1)   Each cable communications system operator shall provide the city a
plan for any initial system construction or for any substantial rebuild,
upgrade or extension of its facility, which shall show its timetable for
construction of each phase of the project, and the areas of the city that will
be affected.
      (2)   The city may from time to time, when the city receives application
for a permit to use a particular route, or upon its own initiative, designate
by published order a route or proposed route for installation of communications
facilities and may: (1) require all persons who wish to emplace underground
facilities along that route or any part thereof to install them during a
specified period; and (2) otherwise prohibit emplacement of such facilities
along the route or any part thereof for 24 months or after such other, longer
period as is necessary to protect the public interest.
   (F)   Existing poles to be used. To the extent possible, operators of cable
communications systems shall use existing poles and conduit. Additional poles
may not be installed in the right-of-way, nor may pole capacity be increased by
vertical or horizontal extenders, without the permission of the city.
      (1)   To minimize disruption of public passage or infrastructure, to
forestall or relieve exhaustion of public rights-of-way capacity, or to protect
environmentally sensitive areas, the city may require as a condition of issuing
any public rights-of-way permit for erection of new poles or construction of
underground conduit, the installation of which requires excavation of or along
any traveled way, that the franchisee, licensee, or holder of the rights-of-way
permit emplace pole space or empty conduits in excess of its own present and
reasonably foreseeable requirements for the purpose of accommodating the city
and/or other franchisees and licensees.
   (G)   Undergrounding.
      (1)   Whenever all existing utilities are located underground in an area
in the city, every cable communications system operator in the same area must
locate its cable communications system underground.
      (2)   Whenever the owner of a pole locates or relocates underground
within an area of the city, every cable communications system operator in the
same area shall concurrently relocate its facilities underground.
      (3)   The City Manager may, for good cause shown, exempt a particular
system or facility or group of facilities from the obligation to locate or
relocate facilities underground, where relocation is impractical, where
ordinary engineering practices making undergrounding impractical, or where the
city and the subscriber's interest can be protected in another manner. Nothing
in this division (G) prevents the city from ordering communications facilities
to be located or relocated underground under other provisions of the municipal
code.
   (H)   Prompt repairs. Any and all public rights-of-way, other public
property, or private property that is disturbed or damaged during the
construction, operation, maintenance or repair of a cable communications system
shall be promptly repaired by the operator. Public property and public rights-
of- way must be restored to the satisfaction of the city and to a condition as
good or better than before the disturbance or damage occurred. No tree trimming
shall be performed without the permission of the city and other affected
authorities, and any tree trimming must be performed in strict accordance with
the municipal code.
   (I)   Movement of facilities for government.
      (1)   A cable communications system operator shall, within a reasonable
period of time specified by the city, protect, support, temporarily disconnect,
relocate, or remove any of its property when required by the city by reason of
traffic conditions; public safety; public right-of-way construction and repair
(including regrading, resurfacing or widening); public right-of-way vacation;
construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes, power
lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of government-owned system or
utility, public work, public facility, or improvement; or for any other purpose
where the work involved would be aided by the removal or relocation of the
cable communications system. Collectively, such matters are referred to below
as the “public work.”
      (2)   The city shall provide written notice describing where the public
work is to be performed as far in advance as reasonably possible but in any
event at least one week prior to the deadline by which a cable communications
system operator must protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or
remove its facilities. Such action on the part of the franchisee shall be
undertaken at no cost to the city. Provided that, in an emergency where a cable
communications system creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to
health, safety, or property, the city need not provide one week's written
notice but should make an effort to contact the franchisee by telephone to
enable the franchisee to take prompt action. After such effort on the part of
the city to contact the franchisee by telephone, the city may protect, support,
temporarily disconnect, remove, or relocate any or all parts of the cable
communications system without further notice, and charge the cable
communications system operator for costs incurred.
   (J)   Movement for others.
      (1)   To accommodate the construction, operation, or repair of the
facilities of another person authorized to use the public rights-of-way or
public property, a franchisee shall, by a reasonable time specified by such
person, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, temporarily relocate or
temporarily remove its facilities. The franchisee must be given written notice
describing where the construction, operation or repair is to be performed at
least 15 days prior to the time by which its work must be completed.  
      (2)   A cable communications system operator shall, on the request of any
person holding a valid permit issued by a governmental authority, temporarily
raise or lower its wires by a time specified to permit the moving of buildings
or other objects. A cable communications system operator shall be given not
less than seven days advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.
The reasonable costs associated with of such temporary removal, relaying,
relocation, or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid in advance by the
person requesting the same.
   (K)   Abandonment in place.
      (1)   A cable communications system operator may abandon any property in
place in the public rights-of-way upon written notice to the city. However, if,
within 90 days of the receipt of written notice of abandonment, the city
determines that the safety, appearance, functioning or use of the public right-
of- way and facilities in the public right-of-way will be adversely affected,
the property must be removed by a date specified by the city.
      (2)   A cable communications system operator that abandons its property
must, upon request, transfer ownership of the properties to the city at no
cost, and execute necessary quitclaim deeds and indemnify the City against
future costs associated with mitigating or eliminating any environmental hazard
associated with the abandoned property.
   (L)   System subject to inspection. Every cable communications system
facility shall be subject to inspection and testing by the city upon reasonable
prior notice and conditions. Each operator must respond to requests for
information regarding its system and plans for the system as the city may from
time to time issue, including requests for information regarding its plans for
construction, operation and repair and the purposes for which the plant is
being constructed, operated, or repaired.
   (M)   Underground services alert. Each operator of a cable communications
system that places facilities underground shall be a member of the regional
notification center for subsurface installations (Underground Services Alert)
and shall field mark the locations of its underground communications facilities
upon request. The operator shall identify the location of its cable
communication system for the city at no charge.
   (N)   Plan for construction. Every franchise shall specify for the city a
construction schedule that will apply to any required construction, upgrade or
rebuild of the cable communications system. The schedule shall provide for the
prompt completion of the project, shall show its timetable for construction of
each phase of the project, with benchmarks for deliverables and the areas of
the city that will be affected. The city shall have the right to impose
penalties on the operator for a failure to meet the accepted timetable and
benchmarks.
   (O)   Use of facilities by the city. The city shall have the right to
install and maintain, free of charge upon any poles or in any conduit owned by
a franchisee, any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere
with the cable service operations of the franchisee.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
§ 114.14 PROTECTION OF CITY AND RESIDENTS.
   (A)   Indemnity required. No franchise shall be valid or effective until and
unless the city obtains an adequate indemnity from the franchisee. The
indemnity must:
      (1)   Release the city from and against any and all loss, damage,
expense, cost (without limitation the cost of litigation) liability and
responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation or maintenance
of the cable communications system. Each cable communications system operator
must further agree not to sue or seek any money or damages from the city in
connection with the above mentioned matters.
      (2)   Indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the city, its elected and
appointed officers, agents, and employees, from and against any and all
liability, loss, damage, cost, claims, demands or causes of action of any kind
or nature, and the resulting losses, costs, expenses, reasonable attorneys'
fees, liabilities, damages, orders, judgments or decrees sustained by the city
or any third party arising out of, or by reason of, or resulting from or of the
acts, errors or omissions of the cable communications system operator or its
agents, independent contractors or employees related to or in any way arising
out of the construction, operation or repair of the system.
      (3)   Provide that the covenants and representations relating to the
release, indemnification, and hold harmless provision shall survive the term of
the franchise or other authorization and continue in full force and effect as
to the party's responsibility to indemnify.
   (B)   Insurance required. A franchisee (or those acting on its behalf) shall
not commence construction or operation of the system without obtaining
insurance in amounts and of a type reasonably satisfactory to the city. The
required insurance must be obtained and maintained for the entire period the
franchisee has facilities in the public rights-of-way. If the franchisee, its
contractors, or subcontractors do not have the required insurance, the city may
order such entities to stop operations until the insurance is obtained and
approved.
   (C)   Proof. Certificates of insurance and endorsements, reflecting evidence
of the required insurance and naming the city as an additional insured, and
other proofs as the city may find reasonably necessary, shall be filed with the
city. For persons issued franchises after the effective date of this chapter,
certificates and other required proofs shall be filed within 30 days of the
issuance of a franchise, prior to the commencement of construction, once a year
thereafter, and whenever there is any change in coverage. For entities that
have facilities in the public rights-of-way as of the effective date of this
chapter, the certificate and endorsements shall be filed within 60 days of the
effective date of this chapter, annually thereafter, and whenever there is any
change in coverage, unless a pre-existing franchise provides for filing of
certificates and/or endorsements in a different manner. In the event that the
insurance certificate and/or endorsements provided indicates that the insurance
shall terminate or lapse during the term of the franchise or license, then in
that event, the cable communications system operator shall furnish, at least 30
days prior to the expiration of the date of such insurance, a renewed
certificate of insurance and endorsement as proof that equal and like coverage
has been or will be obtained prior to any such lapse or termination during the
balance of the franchise or license under which the cable communications system
operates.
   (D)   Certificate contents. All certificates and/or endorsements shall
contain a provision that coverages afforded under these policies will not be
canceled until at least 30 days' prior written notice has been given to the
city. Policies shall be issued by companies authorized to do business under the
laws of the State of California. Financial ratings of the insurer shall be no
less than “A” VII or better in the latest edition of “Best's Key Rating Guide”,
published by A.M. Best Guide.
   (E)   Insurance amounts. A cable communications system operator (and those
acting on its behalf to construct or operate the system) shall maintain the
following minimum insurance. The city shall be named as an additional insured
by endorsement on the general liability and automotive policies; those
insurance policies shall be primary and contain a cross-liability clause.
      (1)   (a)   Comprehensive general liability insurance to cover liability,
bodily injury, and property damage. Exposures to be covered are: premises,
operations, products/completed operations, and certain contracts. Coverage must
be written on an occurrence basis, with the following limits of liability:
            1.   Bodily injury:
               a.   Each occurrence:   $1,000,000
               b.   Annual aggregate:   $3,000,000
            2.   Property damage:
               a.   Each occurrence:   $1,000,000
               b.   Annual aggregate:   $ 3,000,000
            3.   Personal injury:
               Annual Aggregate:   $3,000,000
         (b)   Completed operations and products liability shall be maintained
for two years after the termination of the franchise or license (in the case of
the cable communications system owner or operator) or completion of the work
for the cable communications system owner or operator (in the case of a
contractor or subcontractor).
         (c)   Property damage liability insurance shall include coverage for
the following hazards: X - explosion, C - Collapse, U - underground.
      (2)   Workers' compensation insurance shall be maintained during the life
of this contract to comply with statutory limits for all employees, and in the
case any work is sublet, each cable communications system operator shall
require the subcontractors similarly to provide workers' compensation insurance
for all the latter's employees unless such employees are covered by the
protection afforded by each cable communications system operator. Each cable
communications system operator and its contractors and subcontractors shall
maintain during the life of this policy employers liability insurance. Workers'
compensation insurance shall include a waiver of subrogation clause in favor of
the city. The following minimum limits must be maintained:
         (a)   Workers' compensation:   Statutory
         (b)   Employer's liability:      $500,000 per occurrence
      (3)   Comprehensive auto liability:
         (a)   Bodily injury:
            1.   Each occurrence:   $1,000,000
            2.   Annual aggregate:   $3,000,000
         (b)   Property damage:
            1.   Each occurrence:   $1,000,000
            2.   Annual aggregate   $3,000,000
      Coverage shall include owned, hired, and non-owned vehicles. In every
franchise or license agreement the city shall reserve the right to require any
other insurance coverage it deems necessary depending upon exposures.
   (F)   Performance bond. Every operator of a cable communications system
shall obtain and maintain a performance bond to ensure the faithful performance
of its responsibilities under this chapter and any franchise. The amount of the
performance bonds shall be set by the city franchise, but shall not be less
than 10% of the estimated cost of constructing or (in the case of existing
systems) upgrading the system, and shall include a sufficient amount to cover
the removal of facilities and/or restoration of city facilities within the
right-of-way. The bond is not in lieu of any additional bonds that may be
required through the permitting process. The bond shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to the City Attorney and Risk Manager. Bonds must be obtained prior
to the effective date of any franchise, transfer or franchise renewal, unless a
franchise specifically provides otherwise.
   (G)   Security fund. Every cable communications system operator shall
establish and maintain a cash security fund or provide the city an irrevocable
letter of credit in the amount of $100,000 to secure the payment of fees owed,
to secure any other performance promised in a franchise, and to pay any taxes,
fees, penalties or liens owed to the city. The letter of credit shall be in a
form and with an institution acceptable to the city. Should the city draw upon
the cash security fund or letter of credit, the cable communications system
operator shall, within 14 days, restore the fund or the letter of credit to the
full required amount. This security fund/letter of credit may be waived or
reduced by the city for a franchisee where the city determines in its
discretion that a particular franchisee's operations are sufficiently limited
that a security fund/letter of credit is not necessary to secure the required
performance. The city may from time to time require a Franchisee to change the
amount of the required security fund/letter of credit to reflect changed risks
to the city and to the public, including delinquencies in taxes or other
payments to the city. The cash security fund or letter of credit must be
obtained prior to the effective date of any franchise, license, transfer or
franchise renewal, unless a franchise specifically provides otherwise.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
§ 114.15 ENFORCEMENT AND REMEDIES.
   (A)   Franchise violation; notice and procedures. Before revoking a
franchise or issuing an order to assess liquidated damages, the city shall
follow the procedures set forth below:
      (1)   The city shall notify a cable communications system operator in
writing of any alleged violation (“violation notice”) of a franchise or this
chapter. The violation notice shall:
         (a)   Identify the violation;
         (b)   Direct the cable communications system operator to cure the
violation or show cause why the violation cannot or should not be cured; and
         (c)   State the time for the cable communications system operator's
response, which shall be at minimum 30 days from the date of issuance of the
violation notice, except for violations that present a danger to public health,
safety or welfare, in which case the time for response may be shortened.
      (2)   Within the time period designated for response, the cable
communications system operator shall respond in writing to the city, indicating
that:
         (a)   The cable communications system operator intends to contest the
violation notice and describing all facts relevant to its claim; or
         (b)   The cable communications system operator has completely cured
the violation, in which case the cable communications system operator shall
provide documentation demonstrating that the violation has been completely
cured; or
         (c)   The cable communications system operator has begun to correct
the violation, however, the violation cannot be corrected immediately despite
the cable communications system operator's continued due diligence, in which
case the operator shall describe in detail the steps already taken and
operator's proposed plan and time schedule for completely curing the violation.
Correction of the violation is not complete until all damages and penalties
owed are paid in full.
      (3)   If the cable communications system operator contests the violation
notice or the city determines that the cable communications system operator has
failed to completely cure the violation, to submit an acceptable plan to cure
the violation, or to work diligently to cure the violation, the city shall
schedule a hearing before the City Council (“violation hearing”). The city
shall provide the cable communications system operator written notice of the
violation hearing at least 20 days prior to the hearing (“hearing notice”).
      (4)   The hearing notice shall indicate:
         (a)   The time and place of the violation hearing;
         (b)   The nature of the violation; and
         (c)   The cable communications system operator's right to present oral
and written testimony at an open and public meeting.
      (5)   At the violation hearing, the City Council shall hear and consider
evidence from the cable communications system operator, city staff and members
of the public regarding the alleged violation. The cable communications system
operator shall be given an opportunity to present any and all evidence relating
to the alleged violation.
      (6)   If, based upon the evidence presented at the violation hearing, the
City Council finds that cable communications system operator has violated a
franchise, this chapter or any applicable state or federal law, the City
Council may issue an order assessing liquidated damages if provided for by the
cable communications system operator's franchise, or, subject to division (B)
of this section and the terms of the cable communications system operator's
franchise, revoke or shorten the franchise.
   (B)   Revocation and termination. The City Council may revoke a franchise or
reduce the term of a franchise if it finds, after complying with procedures set
forth above, that a cable communications system operator has violated this
chapter or its franchise or license; has defrauded or attempted to defraud the
city or subscriber; or has attempted to evade the requirements of this chapter
or its franchise or license. Except as to violations that are impossible to
cure, and as provided in divisions (C) and (D) of this section, the franchise
may only be revoked if the franchisee:
      (1)   Was given notice of the default; and
      (2)   Thirty days to cure the default; and
      (3)   The franchisee failed to cure the default, or to propose a schedule
for curing the default acceptable to the city where it is impossible to cure
the default in 30 days.
   (C)   Exception for certain acts. No opportunity to cure is required for
repeated violations, and fraud and attempted fraud shall be deemed incurable.
Further, the city may declare a franchise forfeited without opportunity to cure
where a franchisee:
      (1)   Voluntarily stops providing service it is required to provide; or
      (2)   Transfers the franchise without the prior consent of the city.
   (D)   Exception for bankruptcy.
      (1)   A franchise will terminate automatically by force of law 120
calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the
appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the
franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment
for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding. However, the
franchise may be reinstated within that 120-day period, if:
         (a)   Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated;
or
         (b)   Such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise, and has executed an
agreement, approved by any court having jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to
be bound by the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise.
      (2)   In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the
facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee, the city may revoke the
franchise following a public hearing before the City Council by serving notice
upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the
franchise and all rights and privileges thereunder will be revoked and will
terminate 30 calendar days after serving such notice, unless:
         (a)   The city has approved the transfer of the franchise to the
successful bidder; and
         (b)   The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to
assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise and this
chapter.
   (E)   Effect of termination or forfeiture. Upon termination or forfeiture of
a franchise, whether by action of the city as provided above, or if a franchise
expires and is not renewed, the franchisee must stop using the cable
communications system for the purposes authorized by the franchise. The city
may take possession of some or all of franchisee's facilities, or require the
franchisee or its bonding company to remove some or all of the franchisee's
facilities from the city's property, and restore affected property to its same
or better condition. This provision does not permit the city to remove
facilities that are used to provide another service for which the franchisee
holds a valid franchise issued by the city or if the franchisee's facilities
are otherwise lawfully located on the city property pursuant to applicable
local, state or federal law.
   (F)   Remedies cumulative. Remedies provided for under this chapter or under
a franchise shall be cumulative. Recovery by the city of any amounts under
insurance, the performance bond, the security fund or letter of credit, does
not limit a franchisee's duty to indemnify the city; or relieve a franchisee of
its franchise obligations or limit the amounts owed to the city.
   (G)   Liquidated damages required in franchise. A franchise granted pursuant
to this chapter shall require liquidated damages, in an amount to be specified
in the franchise, for specified breaches of the franchise, including but not
limited to, failure to commence construction, failure to meet construction plan
benchmarks, failure to comply with rebuild plan benchmarks, failure to commence
service, and material breach of franchise obligation(s). The franchise shall
also provide that the city may withdraw liquidated damages owed from the
grantee's security deposit, after complying with the procedures set forth in
division (A) of this section. Liquidated damages shall commence on that date
that performance was due and/or failed, and continue until the grantee
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that the grantee has fully
performed its obligations giving rise to the payment of liquidated damages. Any
obligation to pay liquidated damages does not in any way affect the grantee's
obligation to pay franchise fees or perform other franchise obligations and
such liquidated damages do not constitute franchise fees and are not subject to
any limitations on franchise fees contained in 47 U.S.C. § 542(b). The grantee
acknowledges that any obligation to pay liquidated damages are not costs of
satisfying franchise requirements as provided in 47 C.F.R. § 76.925. The
grantee agrees it will not pass the cost of any liquidated damages to
subscribers through subscriber rates or itemize or otherwise identify on
subscriber bills any obligation the grantee may have to pay liquidated damages.
   (H)   Penalties, fines and other monetary sanctions.
      (1)   Penalties. In addition to any other remedies provided for in this
chapter or otherwise available by law, the city shall have the power to impose
monetary penalties in the event a grantee violates any provision of this
chapter, a franchise, or any regulation lawfully adopted thereunder. The
amounts of such penalties shall be specified in the franchise and shall be
based on the following principles:
         (a)   Penalties shall exceed the financial benefits to a grantee
delaying or failing to comply with the applicable requirement;
         (b)   Even where such benefits are not easily discernible, the
penalties shall be high enough to have a significant deterrent effect on a
grantee; and
         (c)   Penalties shall be sufficient to protect the city and other
affected parties against loss of revenues resulting from violations.
      (2)   Other monetary sanctions. A franchise shall also provide for fines,
liquidated damages and other monetary sanctions, the amounts of which shall
also reflect the foregoing principles.
      (3)   Private suit against a grantee.
         (a)   Any person or organization adversely affected by a violation, or
by a pattern and practice of violations, shall have the right to sue a grantee
in a court of competent jurisdiction for damages and for injunctive and other
relief to require enforcement of the franchise. Organizations shall be entitled
to sue on behalf of themselves or their members.
         (b)   The remedy herein provided shall be in addition to any remedies
provided by law.
         (c)   Except in emergency situations in which immediate relief is
required, private litigants shall notify the City Attorney not fewer than ten
days prior to filing suit. However, suit by the city shall not preempt the
private litigant's right to proceed.
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided herein, any person who violates any
provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500 for
each offense; each day of said violation shall constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
§ 114.16 BOOKS AND RECORDS.
   (A)   Generally. Each cable communications system operator shall provide the
city access to books and records related in whole or in part to the
construction, operation, or repair of the cable communications system, or a
group of systems of which the system is a part, so that the city may inspect
and copy these books and records. The records include, but are not limited to
revenue records and other records related to compliance with any provision of
this chapter or a franchise. A franchisee is responsible for obtaining or
maintaining the necessary possession or control of all such books and records,
so that it can produce the documents upon request. Books and records must be
maintained for a period of five years, except that a franchise may specify a
shorter period for certain categories of voluminous books and records where the
information contained therein can be derived simply from other materials. The
phrase BOOKS AND RECORDS shall be read expansively to include information in
whatever format stored.
   (B)   Production. Books and records requested shall be produced to the city
by a time and at a location in the city designated by the City Manager.
However, if the requested books and records are too voluminous, or for security
reasons cannot be copied and moved, then the franchisee may request that the
inspection take place at some other location mutually agreed to by the city and
the franchisee, provided that:
      (1)   The franchisee must make necessary arrangements for copying
documents selected by the city after its review; and
      (2)   The franchisee must pay all travel and additional copying expenses
incurred by the city (above those that would have been incurred had the
documents been produced in the city) in inspecting those documents or having
those documents inspected by its designee.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
§ 114.17 REPORTS.
   (A)   Obligation to submit. The City Manager may from time to time direct a
franchisee to prepare reports and to submit those reports by a date certain, in
a format prescribed by the City Manager, in addition to those required by this
chapter for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of this
chapter and the franchise.
   (B)   Quarterly reports. Unless an exemption is granted by the City Manager
within 45 days of the end of each calendar quarter, a franchisee shall submit a
report to the city containing the following information:
      (1)   The number of service calls (calls requiring a truck roll) received
during the prior quarter and the percentage of service calls compared to the
subscriber base; and
      (2)   The total estimated hours of known outages as a percentage of total
hours of operation. An outage is a loss of sound or video on any signal, or a
significant deterioration of any signal affecting two or more subscribers.
   (C)   Annual reports. Unless an exemption is granted by the City Manager, no
later than 120 days after the end of its fiscal year, a franchisee shall submit
the following information:
      (1)   A revenue report from the previous calendar year for the cable
communications system, certified by an officer of the franchisee and a
similarly certified statement setting forth the computation of gross revenues
used to calculate the franchise fee for the preceding year and a detailed
explanation of the method of computation showing gross revenues by category

charges, miscellaneous, other); and what, if any, deductions were made from
gross revenues in calculating the franchise fee (e.g., bad debt, credits and
refunds), and the amount of each deduction.
      (2)   A report showing, for each applicable customer service standard,
the Franchisee's performance with respect to that standard for each quarter of
the preceding year. In each case where the franchisee concludes it did not
comply fully, the franchisee will describe the corrective actions it is taking
to assure future compliance. In addition, the report should identify the number
and nature of all the customer service complaints received and an explanation
of their dispositions.

§ 114.20 EXEMPTIONS.
   The City Manager may temporarily exempt any franchisee from its obligations
under §§
114.16 through
114.19 if the Manager determines that the requirement would be unduly
burdensome or unnecessary, and that the city and subscriber interests may be
adequately protected in some other manner.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
§ 114.21 PRIVACY.
   A franchisee shall take all reasonable steps required so that it is able to
provide reports, books and records to the city, including by providing
appropriate subscriber privacy notices. Each franchisee shall be responsible
for redacting data that applicable law prevents it from providing to the city.

or federal subscriber privacy laws.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
§ 114.22 PROCEDURES FOR PAYING FRANCHISE FEES AND FEES IN LIEU OF FRANCHISE
FEES.
   (A)   Fees paid quarterly. The franchise fee paid pursuant to Special Rules
Applicable to Cable Systems or fee in lieu of franchise fee paid pursuant to
open video systems shall be paid quarterly unless otherwise specified in a
franchise. Payment for each quarter shall be made to the city not later than 45
days after the end of each calendar quarter.
   (B)   Quarterly statement. Unless a franchise provides otherwise, a
franchisee or other entity subject to a fee under Special Rules Applicable to
Cable Systems or open video systems shall file with the city within 45 days of
the end of each calendar quarter a statement showing gross revenues during the
preceding quarter and the number of subscribers served.
   (C)   Acceptance of payment not a release. No acceptance by the city of any
payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the
correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such payment be construed as a
release of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable.
   (D)   Fee not in lieu of taxes. Neither the franchise fee under Special
Rules Applicable to Cable Systems, nor the fee paid in lieu of the franchise
fee under open video systems, is a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other
assessment of general applicability (including any such tax, fee or assessment
imposed on both utilities and cable operators or their services, but not
including a tax, fee or assessment which is unduly discriminatory against cable
operators or cable subscriber(s).
   (E)   Failure to pay franchise fee. In the event that a fee payment is not
received by the city on or before the due date set forth in this §
114.22 or in a franchise, or the fee owed is not fully paid, the person subject
to the fee will be charged interest from the due date at an interest rate equal
to 3% above the rate for three-month Federal Treasury Bills at the most recent
United States Treasury Department sale of such Treasury Bills occurring prior
to the due date of the franchise fee payment.
   (F)   Final statement of gross revenues. Within 90 days of the date a
franchisee ceases operations under a franchise (whether because of franchise
termination, transfer, bankruptcy or for any other reason), the franchisee
shall file a final statement of gross revenues covering the period from the
beginning of the calendar year in which the operations ceased to the date
operations ceased. The statement shall contain the information and be certified
as required by §
114.17(C)(1).

the noise, exhaust and pollutants, if any, that will be generated by the
operation of the same; provided, however, that, if some of the descriptive data
is not available at the time of application, the franchise may issue subject to
conditions that the data be filed and approved by the city before construction
begins and that the franchise will be deemed to be forfeited if the data is not
supplied and approved; provided, further, that the foregoing proviso does not
authorize the grant of a franchise where there is not sufficient information to
appraise the impact of the applicant's proposal;
         (c)   A map of the general route the facility will follow; a
designation of the portions of the system that will be placed above ground and

including, as appropriate given the system proposed, an estimate of the
availability of space in conduits and an estimate of the cost of any necessary
rearrangement of existing facilities;
         (d)   A description, where appropriate, of how services will be
converted from existing facilities to new facilities, and what will be done
with existing facilities.
         (e)   A demonstration of how the applicant will reasonably meet the
future cable-related needs and interests of the community, including
descriptions of the capacity, facilities and support for public, educational,
and governmental use of the system (including institutional networks) the
applicant proposes to provide and why the applicant believes that the proposal
is adequate to meet the future cable- related needs and interests of the
community. A demonstration of the financial qualifications of the applicant,
including at least the following:

complete the construction to meet the time frame proposed and to operate the
cable system proposed certified by the applicant's chief financial officer.
         (f)    A demonstration of the applicant's technical ability to
construct and/or operate the proposed cable system;
         (g)   A demonstration that the applicant is legally qualified, which
proof must include a demonstration that the applicant:
            1.   Has received, or is in a position to receive, necessary
authorizations from state and federal authorities;
            2.   Has not engaged in conduct (fraud, racketeering, violation of
antitrust laws, consumer protection laws, or similar laws) that allows the city
to conclude the applicant cannot be relied upon to comply with requirements of
franchise, or provisions of this chapter;
            3.   Is willing to enter into a franchise, to pay required
compensation and to abide by the provisions of applicable law, including those
relating to the construction, operation or repair of its facilities; and has
not entered into any agreement that would prevent it from doing so; and
            4.   The applicant must not have submitted an application for an
initial or renewal franchise to the city, which was denied on the ground that
the applicant failed to propose a cable system meeting the cable-related needs
and interests of the community, or as to which any challenges to such
franchising decision were finally resolved (including any appeals) adversely to
the applicant, within three years preceding the submission of the application.
         (h)   An applicant may show that it would be inappropriate to deny it
a franchise by virtue of:
            1.   The particular circumstances surrounding the acts or omissions
at issue;
            2.   The steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing
therefrom and to prevent their recurrence; and the lack of involvement of the
applicant's principals; or
            3.   The remoteness of the acts or omissions from the operation of
communications systems.
         (i)   The extent that the applicant is in any respect relying on the

affiliate, proofs should be provided for that person.
         (j)   A description of the applicant's prior experience in cable
system ownership, construction, and operation, and identification of cities and
counties in California in which the applicant or any of its principals have a
cable franchise or any interest therein, provided that an applicant that holds
a franchise for the city and is seeking renewal of that franchise need only
provide this information for other cities and counties in California where its
franchise is scheduled to expire during the 12-month period prior to the date
its application is submitted to the city and for other cities and counties in
California where its franchise had been scheduled to expire during the 12-month
period after the date its application is submitted to the city. If an applicant
has no other franchise in California, it shall provide the information for its
operations in other states.
         (k)   An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized
officer thereof certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the
application, and certifying that the application meets all requirements of
applicable law.
      (2)   To be accepted for filing, an original and six copies of a complete
application must be submitted. All applications shall include the names and
addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of the applicant with respect
to the application.
      (3)   An applicant (and the transferor and transferee, in the case of a
transfer) shall respond to any request for information from the city, by the
time specified by the city.
   (C)   Incomplete applications. An application may be rejected if it is
incomplete, or if the response to requests for information is not timely and
complete.

§ 114.31 APPLICATION FOR AN INITIAL FRANCHISE OR RENEWAL FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Scope. This section establishes additional provisions that apply to an
application for an initial franchise, or a renewal franchise application that
is not governed by 47 U.S.C. § 546(a)-(h).
   (B)   Process. Any person may apply for an initial or renewal franchise by
submitting an application therefor on that person's own initiative, or in
response to a request for proposals issued by the city. If the city receives an
unsolicited application, it may choose to issue a request for additional
proposals, and require the applicant to amend its proposal to respond thereto.
The city shall promptly conduct such investigations as are necessary to act on
an application.
   (C)   Consideration of application. In determining whether to grant a
franchise, the city may consider:
      (1)   The extent to which an applicant for renewal has substantially
complied with the applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable
franchise;
      (2)   Whether an applicant's quality of service under its existing
franchise, including signal quality, response to customer complaints, billing
practices, and the like has been reasonable in light of the needs of the
community;
      (3)   Where the applicant has not previously held a cable system
franchise in the city, whether the applicant's record in other communities
indicates that it can be relied upon to provide high-quality service throughout
any franchise term;
      (4)   Whether the applicant has the financial, legal, and technical
ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment set forth in an
application, and to satisfy any minimum requirements established by the city;
      (5)   Whether the applicant's application is reasonable to meet the
future cable-related needs and interests of the city, taking into account the
cost of meeting such needs and interests;
      (6)   Whether issuance of a franchise is in the public interest
considering the immediate and future effect on streets, public property, and
private property that will be used by the applicant's cable system;
      (7)   Whether issuance of the franchise would reduce competition in the
provision of cable service in the city;
      (8)   Such other matters as the city is authorized or required to
consider.
   (D)   Issuance of franchise. If the city determines that issuance of a
franchise would be in the public interest considering the factors described
above, it may offer a franchise agreement to the applicant. No franchise shall
become effective until the franchise is unconditionally accepted by the
applicant, approved by the City Council, and the franchise agreement is signed
by both parties.

§ 114.32 APPLICATION FOR RENEWAL FRANCHISE FILED PURSUANT TO 47 U.S.C. §546.
   (A)   Scope. This section establishes additional provisions that apply to
applications for renewal governed by 47 U.S.C. § 546(a)-(g).
   (B)   Process. A franchisee which intends to exercise rights under 47 U.S.C.
§ 546(a)-(g) shall submit a notice in writing to the city in a timely manner
clearly stating that it is activating the procedures set forth in those
sections. The city shall thereafter commence any proceedings that may be
required under federal law, and upon completion of those proceedings, the city
may issue a request for proposals and an application may be submitted for
renewal. The city may preliminarily deny the application by resolution, and if
the application is preliminarily denied, the city may conduct such proceedings
and by resolution establish such procedures and appoint such individuals as may
be necessary to conduct any proceedings to review the application.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
§ 114.33 APPLICATION FOR TRANSFER.
   (A)   Scope. This section establishes additional provisions that apply to
applications for transfer approval.
   (B)   Information. An application for transfer must contain all the
information required by the City Manager, by §
114.30, and all information required by any FCC transfer form.
   (C)   Consideration of application. In determining whether a transfer
application should be granted, denied, or granted subject to conditions, the
city may consider the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the
transferee to operate the cable system; any potential impact of the transfer on
subscriber rates or services; whether the incumbent cable operator is in
compliance with its franchise; whether the transferee owns or controls any
other cable system in the city, whether operation by the transferee may
eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the city;
and whether operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer would
otherwise adversely affect subscribers, the public, or the city's interest
under this chapter, the franchise, or other applicable law. The proposed
transferee shall pay all reasonable costs incurred by the city in reviewing and
evaluating the applications.
   (D)   Minimum conditions. In order to obtain approval of a transfer, an
applicant must show, at a minimum, that: the transferee is qualified; the
transfer will not adversely affect the interests of subscribers, the public, or
the city; and those noncompliance issues have been resolved. No application
shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by
and accept all terms of this chapter and the franchise, and that it will assume
the obligations, liabilities, and responsibility for all acts and omissions,
known and unknown, of the previous franchisee for all purposes.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
§ 114.34 LEGAL QUALIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Standards.
      (1)   The applicant must be willing to comply with the provisions of this
chapter and applicable laws; and to comply with such requirements of a
franchise as the city may lawfully require.
      (2)   The applicant must not have had any cable system or OVS franchise
validly revoked, (including any appeals) by the city within three years
preceding the submission of the application.
      (3)   The applicant must not have had an application to the city for an
initial or renewal cable system franchise denied on the ground that the
applicant failed to propose a cable system meeting the cable-related needs and
interests of the community, or as to which any challenges to such franchising
decision were finally resolved (including any appeals) adversely to the
applicant, within three years preceding the submission of the application; and
must not have had an application for an initial or renewal OVS franchise denied
on any ground within three years of the application.
      (4)   The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if, at any time
during the ten years preceding the submission of the application, the applicant
was convicted of fraud, racketeering, anti-competitive actions, unfair trade
practices or other conduct of such character that the applicant cannot be
relied upon to deal truthfully with the city and the subscribers, or to
substantially comply with its obligations.
      (5)   The applicant must have the necessary authority under California
and federal law to operate a cable system, or show that it is in a position to
obtain that authority.
      (6)   The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it files
materially misleading information in its application or intentionally withholds
information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide.
      (7)   For purposes of divisions (A)(2) through (4) of this section, the
term applicant includes any affiliate of the applicant.
   (B)   Exception. Notwithstanding division (A) of this section, an applicant
shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to show that a franchise should
issue even if the requirements of divisions (A)(3) and (4) are not satisfied,
by virtue of the circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by
the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence,
the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the
matter from the operation of a cable system.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
Penalty, see § 114.15
§ 114.35 FRANCHISE FEE.
   A cable operator shall pay to the city a franchise fee in an amount equal to
5% of gross revenues, or such other amount as may be specified in the
franchise; provided, however, that if the franchise specifies an amount, that
amount shall be subject to increase should federal limits on fee payments be
eliminated or changed and other cable operators are subject to a higher fee.
   (A)   Bundled services. In the event that the franchisee shall, during the
term of the franchise, offer bundled, tied, or combined cable services (which
are subject to the franchise fee) with non-cable services (which may not be
subject to the franchise fee) to individual subscribers, the combined revenues
from such bundled services shall be allocated consistent with the rates or
prices advertised by the franchisee through its marketing materials or on its
published rate card. In the event the franchisee does not advertise or publish
separate prices for the combined services, the percentage that the price for
the combined services is discounted from the regular retail rates of the
individual services shall be pro-rated across all the services in the bundled
package; provided, however, that the net revenues derived from services subject
to mandatory tariff rates imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission
(or other governmental entity having such authority) shall be deducted from the
combined revenue to determine the revenue subject to the franchise fee. As an
example, the franchisee may offer a “bundle” of video, voice and data services
for a flat fee of $75 where the retail rate for the services purchased on an
individual basis would equal $100. Assuming that there is no service subject to
the mandated tariff rate, the grantee would apply a 25% discount to each
service. Thus, if the retail rate for the cable service in the bundle were $50,
the grantee would recognize cable service revenue in the amount of $37.50 and
pay a franchise fee on that revenue.
   (B)   The definition of GROSS REVENUE is to be as inclusive as possible
consistent with existing applicable law. If a change in federal law occurs
subsequent to the effective date of this chapter, such change shall not impact
the gross revenues definition in such a way to reduce gross revenues, unless
the change specifically preempts the affected portion of the definition above.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
Penalty, see § 114.15
§ 114.36 NO EXCLUSIVITY.
   A franchisee may not require a subscriber or a building owner or manager to
enter into an exclusive contract as a condition of providing or continuing
service. However, nothing herein prevents a franchisee from entering into an
otherwise lawful, mutually desired exclusive arrangement with a building owner
or manager of a multiple dwelling unit or commercial subscriber.
(Ord. 678-C.S., passed 4-20-04)
§ 114.37 MINIMUM FRANCHISE CONDITIONS.
   In addition to satisfying such additional or stricter conditions as the City
finds necessary, based on its investigations, the following elements shall be
required in every franchise serving more than 1,000 subscribers: An operator
who provides service in an area which is defined as “isolated rural” maybe
exempted from the minimum franchise requirements for that area.
   (A)   System design. Each franchisee shall provide a cable system which uses
at least 750 MHz equipment of high quality and reliability. Each franchisee
shall install and activate the return portion of the cable system in the sub-
low frequency spectrum of 5 MHz to 30 MHz.
   (B)   Public, educational and government use of the system.
      (1)   A franchisee shall provide a minimum of three channels for PEG
access to each subscriber.
      (2)   Each franchisee shall install, maintain, and replace as necessary,
a dedicated, bi-directional fiber optic link between its headend and a location
designated by the city as the primary access center.
      (3)   Each franchisee shall install, maintain, and replace activated two-
way cable plant and all headend, cable plant, and node equipment required to
make it operable so that the city, schools, and all designated PEG access
centers and access facilities located within the franchise area will be able to
send and receive signals (video, audio, and data) using the activated two-way
cable plant.
      (4)   Each franchisee shall ensure that technically adequate signal
quality, routing systems, and switching and/or processing equipment are
initially and continuously provided for all access interconnections both within
the franchisee's cable system and with other cable systems throughout the
duration of its franchise.
      (5)   In the event a franchisee makes any change in the cable system and
related equipment and facilities or in the franchisee's signal delivery
technology which directly or indirectly substantially affects the signal
quality or transmission of access programming, the franchisee shall, at its
expense, take necessary steps or provide necessary technical assistance,
including the acquisition of all necessary equipment, to ensure that the
capabilities of access programmers are not diminished or adversely affected by
such change.
      (6)   A franchisee shall maintain all access channels (both upstream
channels and downstream channels) and all interconnections of access channels
at the same level of technical quality and reliability as the best commercial
channels carried on the grantee's system.
   (C)   Service to franchise area. It is the policy of the city to ensure that
every cable system provide service in its franchise area upon request to any
person or any government building. Each franchisee shall extend service upon
request within its franchise area, provided that a franchise may permit a
franchisee to require a potential subscriber to contribute a fair share of the
capital costs of installation or extension as a condition of extension or
installation in cases where such extension or installation may be unduly
expensive. Service must be provided within time limits specified in division
(D) of this section.
   (D)   Time for extension.
         (1)   Except as a franchise otherwise provides, service must be
extended upon request to any person or to any government building in a
franchisee's franchise area:
            (a)   Within seven days of the request, where service can be
provided by activating or installing a drop;
            (b)   Within 90 days of the request where an extension of one-half
mile or less is required; or
            (c)   Within six months where an extension of one-half mile or more
is required.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchisee shall not be deemed
to be in violation of this section in the event the franchisee uses reasonable
efforts to complete the extension in a timely manner but weather or other
circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the franchisee to prevent such
timely completion.
   (E)   Technical standards. A cable system within the city shall meet or
exceed the technical standards set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 76.601 and any other
applicable technical standards.
   (F)   Testing. Each cable operator shall perform at its expense such tests
as may be necessary to show whether or not the franchisee is in compliance with
its obligations under applicable FCC standards, this chapter or a franchise.
   (G)   Interconnection. Upon request of the city, every cable system shall be
required to interconnect with every other cable system within the city, or
adjacent to the city, on fair and reasonable terms for purposes of providing
PEG and I-Net services.
   (H)   Continuity of service. Each franchisee shall, during the term of the
franchise, ensure that subscribers are able to receive continuous service. In
the event the franchise is revoked or terminated, the franchisee may be
required to continue to provide service for a reasonable period to assure an
orderly transition of service from the franchisee to another entity. A
franchise may establish more particular requirements under which these
obligations will be satisfied.

Penalty, see § 114.15
§ 114.38 RATE REGULATION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION.
   (A)   All rates subject to regulation. The city may regulate any of the
cable operator's rates and charges, except to the extent it is prohibited from
doing so by law. The city will regulate rates in accordance with FCC rules and
regulations, where applicable. Except to the extent FCC rules provide
otherwise, all rates and charges that are subject to regulation, and changes in
those rates or charges must be approved in advance. The City Manager may take
any required steps to file complaints, toll rates, issue accounting orders or
take any other steps required to comply with FCC regulations. The City Council
shall be responsible for issuing rate orders that establish rates or order
refunds.
   (B)   No rate discrimination. Except to the extent the city may not enforce
such a requirement, a cable operator is prohibited from discriminating in its
rates or charges or from granting undue preferences to any subscriber,
potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers;
provided, however, that a franchisee may offer temporary, bona fide promotional
discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such
discounts are offered on a non-discriminatory basis to similar classes of
subscribers throughout the franchise area; and a franchisee may offer discounts
for the elderly, the disabled, or the economically disadvantaged; and such
other discounts as it is expressly entitled to provide under federal law, if
such discounts are applied in a uniform and consistent manner.
   (C)   Redlining prohibited. A cable operator shall not deny access or charge

be imposed as follows:
         (a)   Two hundred dollars for each day of each material breach, not to

breach, not to exceed $3,000 for each occurrence of the material breach.
      (2)   Any penalty assessed under this section will be reduced dollar for
dollar to the extent any liquidated damage provision of a franchise imposes a
monetary obligation on a franchisee for the same customer service failures, and
no other monetary damages may be assessed. The city will provide notice, and
impose penalties under this section pursuant to the procedures established by
Cal. Gov't Code § 53088.2(r).

§ 114.41 APPLICATIONS FOR GRANT OR RENEWAL OF FRANCHISES.
   (A)   Initial and renewal franchise: application.
      (1)   A written application shall be filed with the city for grant of an
initial or renewal franchise.
      (2)   To be acceptable for filing, a signed original of the application
shall be submitted together with six copies. The application must conform to
any applicable request for proposals, and contain all information required
under division (B) of this section. All applications shall include the names
and addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of the applicant with
respect to the application.

that must be provided in connection with a request for proposals or an
application for an initial or renewal franchise. At a minimum, each application
must: identify the applicant, where it plans to construct its system, and the
system construction schedule; show that the applicant will provide adequate
channels, facilities and other support for public, educational and government
use (including institutional network use) of the OVS; and show that the

at least the following:
         (a)   A description of the services that are to be provided over the
facility.
         (b)   Identification of the area of the city to be served by the
proposed system, including a description of the proposed franchise area's
boundaries.
         (c)   The location of proposed facility and facility design, including
a description of the miles of plant to be installed, and a description of the
size of equipment cabinets, shielding and electronics that will be installed
along the plant route, the power sources that will be used and a description of
the noise, exhaust and pollutants, if any, that will be generated by the
operation of the same.
         (d)   A map of the route the facility will follow; a designation of
the portions of the system that will be placed above ground and the portions
that will be placed underground, and the construction techniques that the
operator proposes to use in installing the system aboveground and underground;
a schedule for construction of the facility, describing when and where
construction will begin, how it will proceed, benchmarks for competition of
phases, and when it will be completed; and the expected effect on right-of-way
usage, including information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to
accommodate the proposed system, including, as appropriate given the system
proposed, an estimate of the availability of space in conduits and an estimate
of the cost of any necessary rearrangement of existing facilities.
         (e)   A description, where appropriate, of how services will be
converted from existing facilities to new facilities, and what will be done
with existing facilities.
      (3)   Evidence satisfactory to the city that the applicant has the
financial resources to complete the proposed project, and to construct, operate
and repair the proposed facility over the franchise term. It is not the intent
of the city to require an applicant to prove that the services it proposed to
offer will succeed in the marketplace.
      (4)   Evidence satisfactory to the City that applicant is technically
qualified to construct, operate and repair the proposed facility. At a minimum,
the applicant must show that it has experience or resources to ensure that work
is to be performed adequately, and can respond to emergencies during and after
construction is complete.
      (5)   Evidence satisfactory to the city that the applicant is legally
qualified, which proof must include a demonstration that the applicant:
         (a)   Has received, or is in a position to receive, necessary
authorizations from state and federal authorities;
         (b)   Has not engaged in conduct (fraud, racketeering, violation of
antitrust laws, consumer protection laws, or similar laws) that allows the city
to conclude the applicant cannot be relied upon to comply with requirements of
the franchise, or provisions of this chapter;
         (c)   Is willing to enter into a franchise, to pay required
compensation and to abide by the provisions of applicable law, including those
relating to the construction, operation or maintenance of its facilities, and
has not entered into any agreement that would prevent it from doing so;
      (6)   An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer
thereof certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the
application, and certifying that the application meets all requirements of
applicable law.
      (7)   An applicant may show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a
franchise by virtue of: the particular circumstances surrounding the acts or
omissions at issue; the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing
therefrom and to prevent their recurrence; and the lack of involvement of the
applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the acts or omissions from the
operation of open video system facilities.
      (8)   To the extent that the applicant is in any respect relying on the
financial or technical resources of another person, including another
affiliate, the proofs should be provided for that person. An applicant will be
presumed to have the requisite financial, or technical or legal qualifications
to the extent such qualifications have been reviewed and approved by a state
agency of competent jurisdiction; or if applicant is a holder of a franchise in
the city for a cable system or open video system, and conduct under such other
franchise provides no basis for additional investigation.
   (C)   Procedure for applying for grant of a franchise.
      (1)   A person may apply for an initial or renewal franchise on its own
initiative or in response to a request for proposals. Upon receipt of an
application the city shall promptly proffer the applicant a proposed OVS
agreement, which shall be mailed to the person requesting its issuance and made
available to any other interested party. The city may request such additional
information as it deems appropriate.
      (2)   An applicant shall respond to requests for information completely,
and within the time directed by the city, and must strictly comply with
procedures, instructions, and requirements the city may establish.
      (3)   An application may be rejected if it is incomplete or the applicant
fails to follow procedures or respond fully to information requests.
   (D)   Evaluation. In evaluating a franchise application, the city may
consider the following:
      (1)   The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with
the applicable law and the material terms of any existing city OVS franchise;
      (2)   Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal
qualifications to hold an OVS franchise;
      (3)   Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements
established by the city for, or will otherwise provide adequate public,
educational, and governmental use capacity, facilities, or financial support
(including with respect to institutional networks);
      (4)   Whether issuance of a franchise would require replacement of
property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use of the
public rights-of-way;
      (5)   Whether the approval of the application may eliminate or reduce
competition in the delivery of cable service in the city.
   (E)   Issuance. If the city finds that it is in the public interest to issue
a franchise considering the factors above, and such other matters as it is
required or entitled to consider, and subject to the applicant's entry into an
appropriate OVS agreement, it shall issue a franchise. Prior to deciding
whether or not to issue a franchise, the city may hold one or more public
hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on
an application may be received.
   (F)   Legal qualifications. In order to be legally qualified:
      (1)   The applicant must be willing to comply with the provisions of this
chapter and applicable laws, and to comply with such requirements of an OVS
agreement as the city may lawfully require;
      (2)   The applicant must not hold a cable system franchise, or have
pending an application for a cable system franchise;
      (3)   The applicant must not have had any cable system or OVS franchise
validly revoked, (including any appeals) by the city within three years
preceding the submission of the application;
      (4)   The applicant may not have had an application for an initial or
renewal cable system franchise to the city denied on the ground that the
applicant failed to propose a cable system meeting the cable-related needs and
interests of the community, or as to which any challenges to such franchising
decision were finally resolved (including any appeals) adversely to the
applicant, within three years preceding the submission of the application;
      (5)   The applicant may not have had an application for an initial or
renewal OVS franchise denied on any grounds within three years of the
application.
      (6)   The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if, at any time
during the ten years preceding the submission of the application, applicant was
convicted of fraud, racketeering, anti-competitive actions, unfair trade
practices or other conduct of such character that the applicant cannot be
relied upon to deal truthfully with the city and the subscribers or to
substantially comply with its obligations.
      (7)   The applicant must have the necessary authority under California
and federal law to operate an OVS, and must be certified by the FCC under
Section 653 of the Cable Act.
      (8)   The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it files
materially misleading information in its application or intentionally withholds
information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide.
      (9)   For purposes of divisions (F)(2) through (5) of this section, the
term “applicant” includes any affiliate of the applicant.
   (G)   Exception. Notwithstanding division (F) of this section, an applicant
shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to show that a franchise should
issue even if the requirements of divisions(F)(4) through (6) of this section,
by virtue of the circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by
the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence,
the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the
matter from the operation of a Cable system.

with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that discuss the transaction.
      (3)   For the purposes of determining whether it shall consent to a
transfer, the city or its agents may inquire into all qualifications of the
prospective transferee and such other matters as the city may deem necessary to
determine whether the transfer is in the public interest and should be
approved, denied, or conditioned. If the transferee or franchisee refuse to
provide information, or provide incomplete information, the request for
transfer may be denied.
   (C)   Determination by the city.
      (1)   In deciding whether a transfer application should be granted,
denied or granted subject to conditions, the city may consider the legal,
financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the OVS;
whether the incumbent OVS operator is in compliance with its OVS agreement and
this chapter and, if not, the proposed transferee's commitment to cure such
noncompliance; whether the transferee owns or controls any other OVS or cable
system in the city, and whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or
reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the city; and whether
operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer would adversely affect
subscribers, the public, or the city's interest under this chapter, the OVS
agreement, or other applicable law.
      (2)   In order to obtain approval of a transfer, an applicant must show,
at a minimum, that: the transferee is qualified; the transfer will not
adversely affect the interests of subscribers, the public or the city; and that
noncompliance issues have been resolved. No application shall be granted unless
the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of
this chapter and the franchise, and that it will assume the obligations,
liabilities, and responsibility for all acts and omissions, known and unknown,
of the previous franchisee for all purposes. The proposed transferee shall pay
all reasonable costs incurred by the city in reviewing and evaluating the
applications.

§ 114.55 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Access to a cable communication system operator's records shall not be
denied to the city on the basis that said records contain proprietary
information. Refusal to provide information to the city required herein, or

Subject to applicable law, including the California Public Records Act, Cal.
Gov't Code §§ 6250 et seq., the city shall keep any information which is marked
“proprietary” or “confidential” (and, under applicable law, deemed
“proprietary” or “confidential”) submitted by the franchisee or licensee as
required under this chapter or by a franchise or license (“information”) in
confidence, as contemplated by Cal. Gov't Code § 6254.15. In the event that the
city believes requested information must be disclosed, the city shall not
disclose the Information or any part thereof to any third party, government
agency or regulatory body seeking to inspect or obtain the information under a
California Public Records Act request without first informing the cable
communication system operator of such request and affording the cable
communication system operator the opportunity to resist such disclosure at its
sole cost and expense. The city shall not be liable to a cable communication
system operator for any submission or disclosure of such information to a third
party as required by applicable law or to a government agency or regulatory
body seeking the information and claiming jurisdiction in any of these events.
Nothing in this §114.55 shall limit the right of the cable communication system
operator to contest disclosure or submission to a third party as required by
law or to a government agency or regulatory body asserting jurisdiction over it
or such subject matter before such disclosure shall be effected.

this chapter to file one or more applications for a franchise. Any operator
timely filing such an application under this division (A) shall not be subject
to a penalty for failure to have such a franchise so long as said application
remains pending; provided, however, nothing herein shall relieve any cable
communications system operator of any liability for its failure to obtain any
permit or other authorization required under other provisions of the municipal
code, and nothing herein shall prevent the city from requiring removal of any
facilities installed in violation of the municipal code.
   (B)   Persons holding franchises. Any person holding an existing franchise
for a cable communications system may continue to operate under the existing
chapter to the conclusion of its present term (but not any renewal or extension

franchise; and provided further that such person shall be subject to the other
provisions of this chapter to the extent permitted by law.
   (C)   Persons with pending applications. Pending applications shall be

STATE VIDEO SERVICE FRANCHISES
§ 114.57 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. This section is applicable to video service providers who
have been awarded a state video franchise under the Cal. Public Utilities Code
§§ 5800 et seq. (the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006
[“DIVCA”]), to provide cable or video services in any location(s) within the
incorporated boundaries of the city. It is the purpose of this section to
implement within the incorporated boundaries of the city the provisions of
DIVCA and the rules of the California Public Utilities Commission promulgated
thereunder that are applicable to a “local franchising entity” or a “local
entity” as defined in DIVCA.
   (B)   Rights reserved.
      (1)   The rights reserved to the city under this §
114.57 are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by
this
Chapter 114 or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a
right shall affect any other rights which may be held by the city.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided by DIVCA, a state franchise shall not
include, or be a substitute for:
         (a)   Compliance with applicable requirements for the privilege of
transacting and carrying on a business within the city, including, but not
limited to, compliance with the conditions that the city may establish before
facilities may be constructed for, or providing, non-video services;
         (b)   Any permit or authorization required in connection with
operations on or in public rights-of-way or public property, including, but not
limited to, encroachment permits, street work permits, pole attachment permits
and street cut permits; and
         (c)   Any permit, agreement or authorization for occupying any other
property of the city or any private person to which access is not specifically
granted by the state franchise.
      (3)   No permit issued by the city to a state franchise holder is itself
a franchise, nor shall any permit create a vested right that would prohibit the
city from revoking or amending the permit.
   (C)   Compliance with city ordinances. Nothing contained in this subchapter
shall be construed so as to exempt a state franchise holder from compliance
with all ordinances, rules or regulations of the city now in effect or which
may be hereafter adopted which are consistent with this subchapter or Cal.
Public Utilities Code §§ 5800 et seq., or any obligations under any franchise
issued by the city insofar as those obligations may be enforced under Cal.
Public Utilities Code §§ 5800 et seq.
   (D)   Compliance with DIVCA. When a video service provider holding a state
franchise provides notice to the city pursuant to § 5840(m) of DIVCA that it is
commencing to provide video service to the city, a holder of a local franchise
is entitled to seek a state franchise pursuant to § 5930(c) and the upon
issuance of a state franchise by the California Public Utilities Commission for
the franchise area the local franchise shall terminate.

114.61, all provisions of Title IX Chapter 98 (Streets and Sidewalks) of the
Eureka Municipal Code, and all City administrative rules and regulations
developed to any of these provisions, as now existing or as hereafter amended,
shall apply to all work performed by or on behalf of a state franchise holder
on any city public rights-of-way, public property, or city easement.
   (B)   Permits. Prior to commencing any work for which a permit is required
by Title IX Chapter 98, a state franchise holder shall apply for and obtain a
permit in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 20 and shall comply with

applicable requirements of Division 13 of the Cal. Public Resources Code, §§
21000 et seq. (the California Environmental Quality Act).

5880, each state franchise holder shall install and maintain equipment to allow
the Humboldt County Emergency Management Office to air audio and video messages
on the video system to alert subscribers to emergency situations. This
capability shall be remotely activated without the assistance of the state
franchise holder and shall allow a representative of the city to override the

with FCC regulations, agreed with the broadcaster, not to override the channel
for EAS messages.
(Ord. 762-C.S., passed 1-4-11)
§ 114.63 PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL, AND GOVERNMENT ACCESS CHANNEL CAPACITY, SUPPORT,
INTERCONNECTION, AND SIGNAL CARRIAGE.
   (A)   PEG channel capacity.
      (1)   A state franchise holder shall designate a sufficient amount of
capacity on its network to allow the provision of four PEG channels to satisfy
the requirement of Cal. Public Utilities Code § 5870 within the time limits
specified therein.
      (2)   A state franchise holder shall provide an additional PEG channel
when the city satisfies the standards set forth in Cal. Public Utilities Code §
5870(d) or any entity designated by the City to manage one or more of the PEG
channels.
   (B)   PEG support.
      (1)   Amount of PEG support fee. Any state franchise holder shall pay to
the city, or if directed by the city, to the city’s designated PEG provider, a
PEG fee equal to 1.401%.
      (2)   The PEG support fee shall be used for PEG activities, in a manner
that is consistent with the terms of the incumbent cable operator’s franchise
during the period of January 1, 2006 to December 30, 2006 and settlements.
      (3)   A state franchise holder shall remit the PEG support fee quarterly,
within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter. Each payment made shall
be accompanied by a summary, detailing how the PEG support fee was calculated.
      (4)   In the event that a state franchise holder fails to pay the PEG
support fee when due, or underpays the proper amount due, the state franchise
holder shall pay interest at the rate per year equal to the highest prime
lending rate during the period of delinquency, plus 1%, or the maximum rate
specified by state law.
      (5)   Notwithstanding Cal. Public Utilities Code § 5870(n), upon the
expiration of any state franchise, without any action of the City Council, this
section shall be deemed to have been automatically reauthorized, unless the
state franchise holder has given the City Manager and the City Council written
notice 60 days prior to the expiration of its state franchise that the section
will expire pursuant to the terms of Cal. Public Utilities Code § 5870(n).
   (C)   PEG carriage and interconnection.
      (1)   As set forth in Cal. Public Utilities Code §§ 5870(b) and 5870(g)
(3), state franchise holders shall ensure that all PEG channels are receivable
by all subscribers, whether they receive digital or analog service, or a
combination thereof, without the need for any equipment other than that needed
to receive the lowest cost tier of service. PEG access capacity provided by a
state franchise holder shall be of similar quality and functionality to that
offered by commercial channels (unless the PEG signal is provided to the state
franchise holder at a lower quality or with less functionality), shall be
capable of carrying a National Television System Committee (NTSC) television
signal, and shall be carried on the state franchise holder’s lowest cost tier
of service. To the extent feasible, the PEG channels shall not be separated
numerically from other channels carried on the lowest cost tier of service and
the channel numbers for the PEG channels shall be the same channel numbers used
by any incumbent cable operator, unless prohibited by federal law. After the
initial designation of the PEG channel numbers, the channel numbers shall not
be changed without the agreement of the city unless federal law requires the
change.
      (2)   Where technically feasible, each state franchise holder and each
incumbent cable operator shall negotiate in good faith to interconnect their
networks for the purpose of providing PEG programming. Interconnection may be
accomplished by any means authorized under Cal. Public Utilities Code § 5870
(h). Each state franchise holder and incumbent cable operator shall provide
interconnection of PEG channels on reasonable terms and conditions and may not
withhold the interconnection. If a state franchise holder and an incumbent
cable operator cannot reach a mutually acceptable interconnection agreement for
PEG carriage, the city may require the incumbent cable operator to allow each
state franchise holder to interconnect its network with the incumbent cable
operator’s network at a technically feasible point on the state franchise
holder’s network as identified by the state franchise holder. If no technically
feasible point of interconnection is available, each state franchise holder
shall make interconnection available to each PEG channel originator programming
a channel in the city and shall provide the facilities necessary for the
interconnection. The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by each state
franchise holder requesting the interconnection unless otherwise agreed to by
the parties.

(Ord. 824-C.S., passed 11-17-15)
§ 130.11 AGGRESSIVE AND OBSTRUCTIVE CONDUCT.
   (A)   Purpose and findings.
      (1)   The purpose and intent of this section is to protect the safety and
welfare of the general public and improve the quality of life and economic
vitality of the City of Eureka by imposing reasonable restrictions on
aggressive and obstructive conduct while respecting the constitutional rights
of free speech and privacy for all citizens.
      (2)   Aggressive conduct typically includes using profane, offensive or
abusive language or acts directed at another person, threats of physical
contact, or the intentional blocking of the movement of a person or their
bicycle or vehicle. The City Council finds that an increase in aggressive and
obstructive conduct throughout the city has become disturbing and disruptive to
persons and businesses and has contributed not only to the loss of access to
and enjoyment of places open to the public, but has also created an enhanced
sense of fear of intimidation, disorder, and apprehension.
      (3)   The City Council finds that aggressive or obstructive conduct is
especially intimidating and threatening at or near banks, or in close proximity
to automated teller machines. Such activity often carries with it an implicit
threat to both persons and property.
      (4)   This law is timely and appropriate because current laws and city
regulations are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems. In
enacting this legislation, the City Council recognizes the availability of
community service and other sentencing alternatives, which may be appropriate
remedies for violations of this law. The goal of this law is to protect persons
from the fear and intimidation resulting from certain kinds of aggressive or
obstructive conduct.
   (B)   Applications.
      (1)   The provisions of this section apply generally to all property
throughout the City of Eureka wherein any of the conditions specified are found
to exist; provided, however, that any conduct or condition which would
otherwise be deemed a violation of this section, but which is permitted or
authorized under any state or federal law, including state or federal
constitutional provisions, is not a violation of this section.
   (C)   Definitions. For purposes of this chapter, the following words, terms
and phrases have these definitions:
      AGGRESSIVE CONDUCT. Means any of the following:

threatening physical contact with another person without that person's consent;
         (c)   Persisting in closely following, approaching, or accosting a
person after that person has informed the person following, approaching or
accosting that they do not want to be followed, approached or accosted;
         (d)   Using threatening gestures toward a person; or
         (e)   Using profane, offensive or abusive language towards a person in

      (2)   The provisions of this section are declared to be separate and
severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision,
section or portion of this section, or the invalidity of the application
thereof to any person or circumstance does not affect the validity of the
remainder of this section, or the validity of its application to other persons
or circumstances.

dismantled on public and private property, tends to create conditions that
reduce property values, and promote blight and deterioration and result in a
public nuisance. Abandoned carts also create potential hazards to the health
and safety of the public, and interfere with pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
      (2)   This section is intended to ensure that measures are taken by the
owners of shopping carts to prevent the removal of the shopping carts from the
cart owner's business premises, to make removal of the cart a violation of the
Code, and to facilitate the retrieval of abandoned and derelict shopping carts
in a manner consistent with state law and to use an administrative citation
program to establish appropriate fines intended to act as a reasonable
deterrent in preventing violations.
   (B)   Definitions. The definitions set forth in this section shall govern
the application and interpretation of this section.

GRAFFITI CONTROL REGULATIONS
§ 131.10 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide a program for removal of
graffiti from walls and structures on both public and private property and to
provide regulations designed to prevent and control the further spread of
graffiti in the city. The increase of graffiti on both public and private
buildings, structures and places is creating a condition of blight within the
city which results in a deterioration of property and business values for
adjacent and surrounding properties all to the detriment of the city. Allowing
graffiti to remain increases the likelihood of additional graffiti being placed
on the property. Graffiti constitutes not only unattractive blight but also
increases the likelihood of criminal activity when left in place.
   (B)   The City Council finds and determines that graffiti is obnoxious and a
public nuisance which must be abated so as to avoid the detrimental impact of
such graffiti on the city and to prevent the further spread of graffiti.
   (C)   The City Council further finds that substantial amounts of graffiti
are created by minors; that parents and guardians should be made responsible
for the avoidance and removal of graffiti created by minors; and that penalties
and requirements are needed to ensure that parents exercise appropriate control
over and assume responsibility for the actions of minors under their control.
While the property is a victim of the graffiti, where the responsible party
fails to correct the defacing graffiti, it is always the duty of the property
owner to remove graffiti as soon as reasonably possible.
(Ord. 639-C.S., passed 2-6-01)

   This chapter may be cited as the "City of Eureka Chronic Nuisance Property
Ordinance."
(Ord. 817-C.S., passed 10-20-15)
§ 134.02 PURPOSE.
   Chronic nuisance properties present grave health, safety and quality of life
concerns where the persons responsible for such properties have failed to take
corrective action to abate the nuisance condition. Chronic nuisance properties
have a tremendous negative impact upon the quality of life, safety and health
of the neighborhoods where they are located. This chapter is enacted to remedy
nuisance activities that are particularly disruptive to quality of life and
repeatedly occur or exist at properties by providing a process for abatement.
This remedy is not an exclusive remedy available under any state or local laws
and may be used in conjunction with such other laws.
   Also, chronic nuisance properties are a financial burden to the city by the
repeated calls for service to the properties because of the nuisance activities
that repeatedly occur or exist on such property. This chapter is a means to
ameliorate those conditions and hold accountable those persons responsible for
such property.
(Ord. 817-C.S., passed 10-20-15)
§ 134.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following words or phrases shall have the
meaning prescribed below:
   ABATE means to repair, replace, remove, destroy, or otherwise remedy a
condition, which constitutes a violation of this chapter by such means and in
such a manner and to such an extent as the applicable city department director
or designee(s) determines is necessary in the interest of the general health,
safety and welfare of the community.
   CONTROL means the ability to regulate, manage, restrain, dominate,
counteract or govern property, or conduct that occurs on a property.
   CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTY means property on which nuisance activities
exceeding the threshold amount occur or exist during any 12-month period.
   DRUG-RELATED ACTIVITY means any unlawful activity at a property which
consists of the manufacture, delivery, sale, storage, possession, or giving
away of any controlled substance as defined by state law.

provided in Cal. Penal Code §§ 370 and 371.
         (g)   Any public nuisance as specified in EMC §
150.163:
            1.   If multiple nuisance violations are present, all such
violations shall collectively be considered a single nuisance activity at the

that the city has responded to nuisance activities that qualify for at least

§ 134.09 CHRONIC NUISANCE DESIGNATION.

period, a written notice shall be issued to all responsible parties.
   (B)   The notice of designation required by this chapter shall:

      (3)   Summarize the evidence of the nuisance activity occurring on the

of the date of the notice to develop a plan for voluntary abatement of nuisance
activities at the property;
      (6)   Notify all responsible persons that failure to respond within the
allotted time will result in the property being designated as a Chronic
Nuisance property and that administrative fines will be imposed by the city
pursuant to §
10.36.
   (C)   If the person responsible fails to respond to the notice within the
time prescribed, the Chief of Police or his or her designee(s) may:
      (1)   Issue the person responsible an administrative citation and fine
pursuant to §
10.36, punishable by a fine as adopted by resolution of the City Council. Fines
shall recur with each and every subsequent instance of Chronic Nuisance
Activity at the property; and
      (2)   Refer the matter to the City Attorney for civil or criminal
prosecution and abatement.
(Ord. 817-C.S., passed 10-20-15)
§ 134.10 VOLUNTARY ABATEMENT PLAN.
   (A)   If the person responsible requests a meeting with the Chief and agrees
to abate the nuisance activity, the Chief of Police or his or her designee(s),
and the person responsible, may negotiate an agreed-upon course of action which
would abate the nuisance activity. This Voluntary Abatement Plan shall be
signed by both parties and shall include:
      (1)   Specific corrective measures to abate nuisance activities at the
property;
      (2)   A reasonable timeframe for completion of corrective measures;
      (3)   Language stating that if all corrective measures are not completed
within the agreed-upon timeframe, or are ineffective at eliminating and
preventing nuisance activities at the property, that the property may at any
time be designated a Chronic Nuisance property subject to fines and/or
abatement. Corrective measures include, but are not limited to:
         (a)   Management changes such as hiring an on-site or off-site
property manager, eviction of problem tenants, and adoption of strict
background checks for new occupants;
         (b)   Improvements such as security lighting, cameras, fencing, locked
gates, removal of vegetation, posting of signage and other physical changes
intended to abate nuisance activity;
         (c)   Repair of broken windows, painting, landscaping, removal of junk
and debris, increasing the size and/or frequency of garbage collection service
removal of inoperable vehicles and any other measures intended to correct and
prevent nuisance activities at the property.
   (B)   If a voluntary abatement plan cannot be negotiated, or if the measures
are ineffective at eliminating nuisance activity at the property, the property
shall be designated a Chronic Nuisance property and the matter shall be
forwarded to the City Attorney for enforcement action. Provided, that in the
event the Chief of Police or his or her designee(s) or the City Attorney
determines that the person responsible has taken reasonable steps to abate the
nuisance activity, the City Attorney shall not commence an enforcement action
under this chapter, notwithstanding the continuance of the nuisance activity.
(Ord. 817-C.S., passed 10-20-15)
§ 134.11 COMMENCEMENT OF ACTION.
   (A)   Once the matter is referred to the City Attorney, the City Attorney
shall immediately review and make a determination to initiate legal action
authorized under this chapter or state statute, or may seek alternative forms
of abatement of the nuisance activity. The City Attorney may initiate legal
action on the chronic nuisance property and seek civil penalties and costs in
court for the abatement of the nuisance.
   (B)   In determining whether a property shall be deemed a chronic nuisance
property and subject to the court's jurisdiction, the city shall have the
initial burden of proof to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the
property is a chronic nuisance property. The city may submit official police
reports and other affidavits outlining the information that led to arrest(s),
and other chronic nuisance activity occurring or existing at the property. The
failure to prosecute an individual, or the fact no one has been convicted of a
crime is not a defense to a chronic nuisance action.
   (C)   Once a court determines the property to be a chronic nuisance, the
court may impose a civil penalty against any or all of the persons responsible
for the property, and may order any other relief deemed appropriate. A civil
penalty may be assessed for no less than $500 and no more than $1,000 per day
for each day the nuisance activity continued to occur following the date of the
original warning by the Chief of Police or his or her designee(s), as described
in §
134.08. In assessing the civil penalty, the court may consider the following
factors, citing to those found applicable:
      (1)   The actions taken by the person responsible to mitigate or correct
the nuisance activity;
      (2)   The repeated or continuous nature of the nuisance activity;
      (3)   The statements of the neighbors or those affected by the nuisance
activity; and
      (4)   Any other factor deemed relevant by the court.
   (D)   The court which determined the property to be a chronic nuisance
property shall also assess costs against the person responsible in the amount
it costs the city to abate, or attempt to abate, the nuisance property.
   (E)   The court shall have jurisdiction of all civil infractions issued
pursuant to this chapter.
   (F)   If the court determines the property to be a chronic nuisance
property, the court shall order the property closed and secured against all
unauthorized access, use and occupancy pursuant to §
134.12 below.
(Ord. 817-C.S., passed 10-20-15)
§ 134.12 SUMMARY CLOSURE.
   (A)   If the court determines the property to be a chronic nuisance
property, the court shall:
      (1)   Order the property closed and secured against all unauthorized
access, use and occupancy for a period of not less than six months and up to
one year, and may impose a civil penalty and costs.
      (2)   Order the property posted with a notice stating that occupants have
30 days to remove belongings prior to the property being closed. The notice
shall state the reasons for the closure and shall give the approximate time and
date of the closure.

EARTHQUAKE HAZARD REDUCTION IN EXISTING BUILDINGS
§ 150.065 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to promote public safety and welfare
by reducing the risk of death and injury resulting from the effects of
earthquakes on unreinforced masonry buildings constructed prior to the adoption
and enforcement of Building Codes requiring earthquake resistant design. Such
buildings are widely recognized for sustaining life-hazardous damage, including
partial or complete collapse during moderate to strong earthquakes.
   (B)   The provisions of this subchapter are intended as minimum standards
for structural seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of
injury and loss of life. Compliance with these standards will not necessarily
entirely prevent injury or loss of life or prevent earthquake damage to
rehabilitated buildings. This subchapter does not require alteration of
existing electrical, plumbing, mechanical or fire safety systems unless they
constitute a hazard to life or property.
   (C)   This subchapter provides systematic procedures and standards for
identification and classification of hazards in unreinforced masonry buildings
based on their present use and condition. Priorities, time periods and
standards are also established under which these buildings are required to be
structurally analyzed and strengthened or demolished.
('63 Code, § 9-7.101) (Ord. 504-C.S., passed 11-21-89)
§ 150.066 SCOPE.
   (A)   The provisions of this subchapter shall apply to all buildings
constructed or under construction prior to the adoption and enforcement of
earthquake resistant code requirements, or for which a building permit was
issued prior to January 1, 1940, which have unreinforced masonry walls,
foundations, piers or other structural elements.
   (B)   This section shall not apply to any solely residential building
containing five or fewer dwelling units; to structures used solely as
warehouses or similar purposes not for human habitation; or to buildings owned
by the state or federal governments.
   (C)   Structures which come within the scope of this subchapter, not
identified and included in the original survey report made as a part of SB547
implementation, shall comply with the requirements of this subchapter. For
these buildings, applicable time limits in accordance with §
150.070 of this subchapter shall begin on the date of notification of the
owner, by the Building Official.

VACANT AND/OR BOARDED BUILDINGS
§ 150.095 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds as follows: Vacant buildings are a major cause and
source of blight in residential and nonresidential neighborhoods, especially
when the owner of the building fails to actively maintain and manage the
building to ensure that it does not become a liability to the neighborhood.
Vacant buildings, substandard or unkempt buildings, and long-term vacancies
discourage economic development and dampen the appreciation of property values.
Vacant buildings are potential fire hazards that can jeopardize the ability of
owners of neighboring property to secure or maintain affordable fire insurance.
It is the responsibility of property ownership to prevent owned property from
becoming a burden to the neighborhood and community and a threat to the public
health, safety, or welfare. One vacant building that is not actively maintained
and managed can be the cause of spreading blight. Vacant buildings are also a
potential source of much needed housing, and the City Council encourages
property owners to return vacant buildings to useful purposes whenever
possible. It is the purpose and intent of the City Council, through the
adoption of this ordinance, to define the responsibilities of owners of, and to
establish registration and monitoring programs for, vacant commercial,
industrial and residential buildings and properties.
(Ord. 956-C.S., passed 9-3-24)
§ 150.096 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   VACANT BUILDING. A building, structure, unit, or space intended for lawful
occupancy but which is without a lawful resident or occupant or which is not
being put to a lawful commercial, residential or industrial use, and which may
be unoccupied and unsecured; unlawfully occupied and/or occupied and secured by
boarding or other similar means; unoccupied and a dangerous structure; or
unoccupied, with city municipal code or nuisance violations extant.
(Ord. 956-C.S., passed 9-3-24)
§ 150.097 OWNER RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (A)   The owner of a vacant building must actively maintain and monitor the
building. Active maintenance and monitoring must include:
      (1)   Maintenance and appropriate watering and care of landscaping and
plant materials;
      (2)   Maintenance of the exterior of the building, including but not
limited to, paint and finishes, in good condition;
      (3)   Regular removal of all trash, debris, and graffiti;
      (4)   Maintenance of the building or structure in continuing compliance
with applicable codes and regulations.
   (B)   No person may allow a building or structure they own or control that
is designed for human, industrial, or commercial use or occupancy to stand
vacant for more than ninety days unless one of the following applies:
      (1)   The building is the subject of an active building permit for repair
or rehabilitation, or a permit for demolition, and the owner is progressing
diligently to complete the repair, rehabilitation, or demolition, as evidenced
by commencement and continuation of permitted work and related inspections;
      (2)   The building is being actively maintained and monitored as required
by division (A) above, and is actively, and in good faith, being offered for
sale, lease, or rent.
   (C)   Owners experiencing exceptional, demonstrable, and specific hardships
or circumstances may present written evidence of such, in the form of a
declaration by the owner of owner's representative, to the Public Works
Director or designee. If such circumstances or hardships are convincingly
demonstrated, the owner may be granted up to a one-time, six-month stay of
enforcement of this subchapter.
(Ord. 956-C.S., passed 9-3-24)
§ 150.098 MONITORING PROGRAM; PURPOSE AND OPERATION.
   (A)   Because of the potential economic and public health, welfare, and
safety problems caused by vacant buildings, the city needs to monitor vacant
buildings, so that these buildings do not become attractive nuisances, are not
used by trespassers, are properly maintained both inside and out, and do not
become a blighting influence in the neighborhood.
   (B)   There is a substantial cost to the city for monitoring vacant
buildings and that cost should be borne by the owners of the vacant buildings.
   (C)   The Public Works Director or designee is responsible for administering
a program for identifying and monitoring the maintenance of all vacant
buildings or structures in the city.
   (D)   The purpose of the monitoring program is:
      (1)   To promptly identify buildings that become vacant.
      (2)   To order vacant buildings that are open and accessible to be
secured against unlawful entry.
      (3)   To initiate appropriate proceedings against any vacant building
owners to prevent buildings from becoming or remaining substandard or a public
nuisance.
      (4)   To ensure and encourage buildings be used for the highest and best
purpose and to promote a flourishing community.
   (E)   Notice of vacant building:
      (1)   Upon discovery of a potential vacant building by a code enforcement
officer or receipt of a complaint about a vacant or boarded building from any
source, the city may, after inspection, determine that the building or
structure should be classified as a vacant building.
      (2)   If the city determines that a building or portion of a building may
be classified as a vacant building under this subchapter, the city will
ascertain the identity of, and contact the owner or agent of the owner, and
advise the owner in writing that the building or structure is vacant and advise
as to which measures must be taken to secure and maintain the vacant building.
      (3)   If the city determines that a building or structure is vacant it
may cause a "Notice of Vacant Building" to be recorded in the chain of the
title to the property, which notice will reference the provisions of this
subchapter and disclose that administrative penalties and costs may likewise be
assessed against the owner and property if the building or structure is allowed
to remain in a vacant condition. Upon correction of any unlawful vacancy
conditions on the property and satisfaction of any penalties or assessments on
the property, the city will record a rescission or cancellation of the Notice
of Vacant Building.
      (4)   If the owner fails to respond within sixty days of the written
notice, the vacant building will constitute a nuisance, and the city may,
without further notice, and by any lawful means, abate the nuisance.
      (5)   The owner will be liable for the costs incurred by the city for
inspections or to secure the building or structure, including costs incurred to
ascertain ownership of the property and obtain title information, prepare
notices, and any and all administrative costs together with actual labor or
material cost or expense incurred by the city to secure the vacant building and
otherwise abate the nuisance. If the owner does not reimburse the city within
60 days of being billed therefore, the city will pursue a lien against the
property for all the expenses incurred by the city.
   (F)   Vacant building plan and timetable:
      (1)   The owner of any vacant building must submit to the city for
approval a vacant building plan. The vacant building plan and timetable must
include, at a minimum, the following information:
         (a)   A description of the premises, including the address thereof;
         (b)   The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all owners with a
right of control over the vacant building or structure;
         (c)   The names and addresses of all known lien holders and other
parties with an ownership interest in the vacant building or structure;
         (d)   The name, address, and telephone number of the owner's property
manager or agent, and stating whether the property manager or agent has the
authority to act independently on the owner's behalf to repair or maintain the
property;
         (e)   The period of time the building is expected to remain vacant;
         (f)   If the owner plans on demolishing the building, the date the
building is scheduled for demolition, and whether or not all permits have been
issued for the demolition;
         (g)   If the owner plans on returning the building to a lawful
occupancy and use, the estimated date for returning the building to a lawful
occupancy and use, and a list of improvements necessary to return the vacant
building to a lawful occupancy and use, and a timeline for obtaining all
necessary permits to affect the listed improvements;
         (h)   A plan for regular inspection and maintenance of the building
during the period of vacancy;
         (i)   Measures the owner will employ to secure the building to prevent
access by trespassers, including, at a minimum, the installation and/or repair
and maintenance of adequate windows and doors, as well as at least one of the
following:
            1.   Installation and maintenance of adequate locks for windows and
doors.
            2.   Employment of security officers to the satisfaction of the
city.
            3.   Installation, operation, and monitoring of an electronic
security system, which monitors doors and windows by glass breakage or motion

system, other than sole reliance on the City's Police Department.
            4.   Any other methods as specified by the city.
         (j)   Measures the owner will employ to monitor and inspect the
property on a weekly basis. The weekly monitoring and inspection must be
performed by the owner, property manager, or agent of the owner with full
authority to maintain and make repairs to the property on a weekly basis.
         (k)   Measures the owner will take to ensure that the building returns
to the market as either livable or commercial space as soon as practicable.
      (2)   Any and all repairs required to implement the plan and timetable
must comply with all applicable City of Eureka ordinances, codes, and
regulations. The owner will be required to notify the city in writing of any
changes in information supplied within ten days of the change.
      (3)   In the event that the owner fails to comply with the vacant
building plan and timetable, the city will notify the owner or authorized agent
in writing of its intent to institute appropriate administrative, civil or
other legal action to secure compliance with this subchapter.
   (G)   Monitoring fee imposed. Any vacant building, as defined in this
subchapter will be subject to a quarterly monitoring fee to recover the city's
regulatory costs to monitor the status of the vacant building. The monitoring
fee will be set by resolution of the City Council. The monitoring fee will be
assessed until such time as the building or structure is no longer vacant and
will likewise be applicable even when a vacant building plan and timetable are
in effect. The monitoring fee will be imposed upon the initial determination
that the building is vacant. The fee will thereafter be billed to the owner on
a quarterly basis until such time as the building or structure is no longer
vacant or boarded.
   (H)   Code enforcement response fee. In addition to the monthly monitoring
fee imposed under this section, the city also establishes a further and
separate enforcement response fee for actual costs incurred by the city to
respond to or abate substandard or blighted conditions existing in or about the
property upon which the vacant building is located. Such costs may include, but
not be limited to, personnel costs involved with inspecting or responding to
calls for service at the property, personnel costs involved in abating the
substandard or blighted conditions existing on the property, costs of any
materials or supplies either purchased or supplied by the city in connection
with the abatement of any substandard or blighted condition in or about the
property, costs of any contracted services, including the costs of materials,
supplies, and labor provided by the city's contractor, if any, costs of
procuring title or ownership information concerning or related to the property,
as well as any other incidental enforcement costs incurred by the city in
connection with remedying the substandard or blighted conditions existing on
the property. The amount of the code enforcement response fee will be based on
actual personnel, materials, and contract costs plus a 10% administrative fee.

OPERATION OF HOTELS AND MOTELS
§ 150.300 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to ensure the continued availability of
transient lodging within the City of Eureka; and to protect the public
interest, health, safety and welfare by ensuring continued maintenance of
hotels through the issuance of a lodging permit to own or operate a hotel
within the city, regardless of the date of the hotel's construction. Further,
this subchapter establishes standards for the issuance of said permit;
establishes rules and regulations under which such permit shall remain in
force, be denied or revoked; and provides penalties for violations.
(Ord. 798-C.S., passed 10-1-13)
§ 150.301 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The city is committed to the health, safety, and welfare of its
residents and visitors.
   (B)   Statistics compiled by the Police and Fire Departments indicate that
hotels and motels in the city can have disproportionately high rates of police
and emergency calls for service due to violence, prostitution, and drug
activity, which can have a negative impact on the health, safety, and welfare
of the community.
   (C)   The City Council recognizes that it is necessary for the city to apply
its available emergency services resources in accordance with the needs of the
community at large, and to adjust the application of those resources as
necessary to address changes in those needs.
   (D)   The U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing
Services' (COPS) Problem-Oriented Guide for police titled Disorder at Budget
Motels (January 2005) outlines general principles for an effective strategy for
reducing crime at hotels, including regulating management practices through
calls for service/room ratios and taking action against hotels that have a
calls for service/room ratio of greater than 1.0 annually.
   (E)   Excessive levels of Municipal Code violations (such as plumbing,
electrical, and sanitation) in a hotel are detrimental to human health and
welfare and result in impaired health, safety, and welfare of tenants and
neighbors of such properties.
   (F)   The implementation of a registration and permitting requirement for
owners and operators of hotels would greatly facilitate the application and
enforcement of city health, building, and safety codes and ordinances, as well
as help create a vibrant and robust environment for the enjoyment of the city's
tourists, visitors, residents, and businesses.
(Ord. 798-C.S., passed 10-1-13)
§ 150.302 APPLICABILITY.
   This subchapter shall be applicable to all hotels and motels within the
city, regardless of their date of construction or initial operation. Existing
non-transient ("residential") hotels and motels shall be subject to this
subchapter unless they:
   (A)   Were initially operated as a non-transient hotel or motel on or before
October 16, 1966 and have been in continuous operation as such since that date;
or
   (B)   Consist of multiple dwelling units and have been legally permitted as
a multi-family dwelling, as defined in EMC §
155.504.
(Ord. 798-C.S., passed 10-1-13; Am. Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 150.303 SEVERABILITY.
    The City Council intends that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses,
and phrases of this chapter are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence,
paragraph, or section of this chapter shall be declared unconstitutional by the
valid judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such
unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses,
sentences, paragraphs, and sections of this chapter.

beginning 200 feet outward from the end of each runway and extended outward,
ending at a point 10,200 feet from the end of the runway on the extended center
line of the runway. In addition, the approach areas of all runways which are
used for instrument operation shall extend outward an additional 40,000 feet.
The approach area requirements for instrument runways shall apply to all
runways which are used for instrument operations and to both ends of such
runways.
   APPROACH AREA SLOPE. For instrument runways the slope of the approach
surface along the runway center line extended is 50:1 for the inner 10,000 foot
section and 40:1 for the outer 40,000 foot section. For all other runways, not
intended for instrument operation, which meet or exceed the minimum runway
length requirements for feeder carrier service, the slope is 40:1. On airports
with shorter runway lengths than those specified for feeder air carrier
service, the slope of the approach surface is 20:1 for all runways.
   APPROACH AREA WIDTH. The approach area is symmetrically located with respect
to the extended runway center line and for all instrument runways has a total
width of 1,000 feet at the end adjacent to the runway. The approach area flares
uniformly to a total width of 4,000 feet at the end of the 10,000-foot section
and to a total width of 16,000 feet at the end of the additional 40,000-foot
section. For all other runways not intended for instrument operation, the
approach area has a total width at the end adjacent of the runway and at the
approach respectively as follows:
      (1)   For express air carrier service and larger airports, 500 feet and
2,500 feet;
      (2)   For trunk line air carrier service airports, 400 feet and 2,400
feet;
      (3)   For feeder air carrier service airports, 300 feet and 2,300 feet;
and,
      (4)   For secondary airports, 250 feet and 2,250 feet.
   APPROACH SURFACES. Inclined planes located directly above the approach area.
The dimensions of the approach shall be measured horizontally.
   CONICAL SURFACE. The conical surface extends upward and outward from the
periphery of the horizontal surface with a slope of 20:1 measured in a vertical
plan passing through the airport reference point. Measuring radially outward,
from the periphery of the horizontal surface, the conical surface extends for a
horizontal distance of 7,000 feet for intercontinental airports and
intercontinental express airports; 5,000 feet for continental, express, trunk
line, and feeder airports; and 3,000 feet for all smaller airports.
   ESTABLISHED ELEVATION OF AN AIRPORT. The elevation of the highest point of
the usable landing area.
   HORIZONTAL SURFACE. The horizontal surface is a plane, circular in shape,
with its height 150 feet above the established airport elevation and having a
radius from the airport reference point as indicated in the following table,
which table also indicates the classification of each airport for the purposes
of this chapter:
      (1)   Intercontinental express airports, 13,000 feet.
      (2)   Intercontinental airports (Arcata Airport), 11,500 feet.
      (3)   Continental airports, 10,000 feet.
      (4)   Express airports, 8,500 feet.
      (5)   Trunk line airports, 7,000 feet.
      (6)   Feeder airports (Rohnerville Airport), 6,000 feet.
      (7)   Secondary airports (Eureka County Airport, Eureka Municipal
Airport, Garberville Airport, Shelter Cove Airport, and Dinsmore Airport),
5,000 feet.
   LANDING AREA. The area of an airport used for landing, taking off, or
taxiing of aircraft, consisting of the areas more particularly described in
other sections of this chapter.
   NONCONFORMING USE. Any structure, tree, or use of land which does not
conform to a regulation prescribed in this chapter on June 21, 1956.
   STRUCTURE. Any object constructed or installed by man, including, but
without limitations, buildings, towers, smokestacks, mill burners, and overhead
transmission lines.
   TRANSITIONAL SURFACES. The transitional surfaces and inclined planes with a
slope of 7:1 measured upward and outward in a vertical plane at right angles to
the center line of the runway. The transitional surfaces, symmetrically located
on either side of the runway, extend upward and outward from a line on either
side of the runway which is parallel to and level with the runway center line.
Such parallel lines are at a horizontal distance from the runway center line
equal to one-half the minimum width of the approach area. Transitional surfaces
extend from the edges of all approach surfaces upward and outward to the
intersection with the horizontal surface or conical surface. The  approach
surfaces for instrument runways projecting through and beyond the limits of the
conical surface have a 7:1 transitional surface extending a distance of 5,000
feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surfaces and at right
angles to the runway center line.
   TREE. Any object of natural growth.
('63 Code, § 10-1.02) (Ord. 2660, passed 6-19-56)
§ 151.03 HEIGHT LIMITS.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be
erected or altered, and no tree shall be maintained in any airport approach
zone, airport turning zone, or airport transition zone to a height which would
project above the approach surface, the horizontal surface, the conical
surface, or the transitional surface.
   (B)   Whenever or wherever any of such surfaces overlap, the most lightly
restrictive requirement shall govern and control; provided, however, the
foregoing descriptions shall not impose upon the city any duty of maintenance
or care.

Penalty, see § 150.999
§ 151.04 USE RESTRICTIONS.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of
land within any airport approach zone, airport turning zone, or airport
transition zone in such manner as to create electrical interference with radio
communications between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers
to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes
of flyers using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport,
or otherwise endanger the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft.
('63 Code, § 10-1.04) (Ord. 2660, passed 6-19-56)
Penalty, see § 150.999
§ 151.05 NONCONFORMING USES.
   The regulations prescribed in §
151.04 of this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering,
or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to such
regulations on June 21, 1956, nor otherwise interfere with the continuance of
any nonconforming use.
('63 Code, § 10-1.05) (Ord. 2660, passed 6-19-56)
§ 151.06 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY.
   The County Division of Aviation is hereby designated the administrative
agency charged with the duty of administering and enforcing the regulations of
this chapter. The duties of the County Division of Aviation shall include that
of hearing and deciding all permits, except as provided in §
151.07 of this chapter, but shall not include any of the powers or duties
delegated to the Council. The County Division of Aviation shall prepare and
make available to the public maps showing the approximate elevation of all
property affected by this chapter in order to aid property owners in complying
with the provisions of this chapter. Copies of such maps shall also be
furnished to the office of the Director of Public Works and to the Planning
Commission for public use.

§ 151.07 VARIANCES.
   Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or
permit the growth of any tree, or use his property in conflict with the
provisions of this chapter may apply to the Planning Commission for a variance
therefrom, and such variance may be granted by the Council following the
receipt of a report of findings by the Planning Commission. Such variance shall
be permitted when a literal application or enforcement of the regulations of
this chapter would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and
the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest, but would do
substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of the provisions of
this chapter; provided, however, any such variance may be subject to such
reasonable conditions and restrictions as the Council may deem necessary.
('63 Code, § 10-1.07) (Ord. 2660, passed 6-19-56)
§ 151.08 PERMITS.
   Before any nonconforming structure may be replaced, substantially altered,
or rebuilt within any airport approach zone, airport turning zone, or airport
transition zone, a permit shall be secured authorizing such replacement or
change. Such permit shall be granted except when the granting thereof would
permit the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a
nonconforming use or structure to be made or become higher or become a greater
hazard to air navigation than existed on the effective date of the applicable
regulation thereunder. In the event of emergencies affecting the public welfare
or safety, or the preservation of property, any nonconforming structure may be
replaced or repaired without first obtaining a permit provided an application
for a permit is filed with the County Division of Aviation within 24 hours
after such department is first opened subsequent to the emergency.

§ 151.09 HAZARD MARKING AND LIGHTING.
   Any permit or variance granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purposes of this chapter
and is reasonable in the circumstances, may be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure in question to install, operate, and maintain thereon
such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence
of an airport hazard. The provisions of this section shall apply only to any
nonconforming structure or tree and to any nonconforming structure or tree
which is replaced, altered, or rebuilt in such a way as to create a greater
hazard than existed before such replacement, alteration, or rebuilding
commenced.

§ 151.10 APPEALS.
   (A)   Any person aggrieved or affected by any decision of the County
Division of Aviation, made in the administration of the provisions of this
chapter, if of the opinion that a decision of the County Division of Aviation
is an improper application of this chapter, shall appeal to the Council prior
to introducing any litigation forming the subject matter of such grievance.
   (B)   Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by
the rules of the Council, by filing with the County Division of Aviation and
with the Council a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The County
Division of Aviation shall forthwith transmit to the Council all papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
   (C)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from unless the Airports Manager of the Aviation Division certifies to
the Council after the notice of appeal has been filed that by reason of the
facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent
peril to life or property. In such event, proceedings shall not be stayed
otherwise than by order of the Council on notice to the County Division of
Aviation and on due cause shown.
   (D)   The Council shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal,
giving public notice and due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the
same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person
or by agent or by attorney.
   (E)   The Council may, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement,
decision, or determination as may seem proper.
   (F)   The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the Council shall
be sufficient to reverse, affirm, or modify any order, requirement, decision,
or determination of the County Division of Aviation, or to decide in favor of
the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this
chapter, or to effect any variation in this chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of California has in Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 65302,
65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the Eureka City Council does hereby adopt the
following floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 767-C.S., passed 4-19-11)
§ 153.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Eureka are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in a loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities also contribute to flood losses.
(Ord. 767-C.S., passed 4-19-11)
§ 153.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied
uniformly throughout the city to all publicly and privately owned land within
flood prone, mudslide (i.e. mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas. These
regulations are designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted
areas caused by flood damage;
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 767-C.S., passed 4-19-11)
§ 153.004 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses and facilities vulnerable to floods, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 767-C.S., passed 4-19-11)
§ 153.005 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   A ZONE. see "Special Flood Hazard Area."
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure that is either:
      (1)   A subordinate structure which use is appropriate, subordinate, and
customarily incidental to that of the main structure or the main use of the
land and which is located on the same site with the main structure or use; or
      (2)   An attached or detached garage or similar covered structure for the
parking of vehicles for residential units; or
      (3)   A small shed or similar structure less than 120 square feet in
size.
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ALLUVIAL FAN. A geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped
deposit of boulders, gravel, or fine sediments that have been eroded from areas
of higher topography, transported by flood flows, and then deposited at lower
elevations, and which are subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows,
debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.
   APEX. A point on an alluvial fan or similar land form below which the flow
path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial
fan flooding can occur.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly
defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized
by ponding or sheet flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. See "Special Flood Hazard Area."
   BASE FLOOD. A flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). BASE FLOOD is
the term used throughout this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1-V30 that indicates the water surface
elevation resulting from a flood that has a 1% or greater chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   BASEMENT. Any area of a building having its floor subgrade - i.e., below
ground level - on all sides.
   BREAKAWAY WALLS. Any type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether
constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable
building material which is not part of the structural support of the building
and which is designed to break away under abnormally high tides or wave action
without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which
they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by flood waters.
A BREAKAWAY WALL shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than
ten and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be
certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following
conditions:
      (1)   Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than
that which would occur during the base flood; and
      (2)   The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural
damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the
event of the base flood.
   BUILDING. See "Structure.”
   COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREA. An area of special flood hazard extending from
offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and
any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic
sources. It is an area subject to high velocity waters, including coastal and
tidal inundation or tsunamis. The area is designated on a Flood Insurance Rate

      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood related erosion.
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). The official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). The official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated
both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable
to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The official report provided by the Federal Insurance
Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source - see “Flooding.”
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The community official designated by title to
administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited
to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of
police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which
provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to

structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing,
see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also
referred to as "Regulatory Floodway."
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. That area of the floodplain on either side of the
"Regulatory Floodway" where encroachment may be permitted.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related to the Variance section of this chapter,
means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the
public. In examining this requirement, the Planning Commission will consider
the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government
responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years.
Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation
are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods,
while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to
all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood
damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware
that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very
high flood insurance rates.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the

to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and
general welfare of its citizenry.
   HARDSHIP. As related to the Variance section of this chapter means the
exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested
variance. The Planning Commission requires that the variance be exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors
likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these
problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even
if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:

Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places.
   LEVEE. A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.

levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including
basement (see "Basement" definition).
      (1)   An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor
that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an
area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor,
provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements,
including, but not limited to:
         (a)   The flood openings standards in §
153.017(C)(3);
         (b)   The anchoring standards in §
153.017(A);
         (c)   The construction materials and methods standards in §
153.017(B); and
         (d)   The standards for utilities in §

which the start of construction commenced on or after June 19, 1986, and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the

1986.
   OBSTRUCTION. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation,
channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel,
refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or
projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.

adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
   REMEDY A VIOLATION. Means to bring the structure or other development into
compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is
not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may
be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from
flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal
financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
   RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, and the like.

as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, AH, V1-V30, VE or V.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the
permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground;
this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.

damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.

permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this
chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance
required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.

ADMINISTRATION
§ 153.013 DESIGNATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The City Manager or his or her designee, is hereby appointed to administer,
implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits
in accord with its provisions.
(Ord. 767-C.S., passed 4-19-11)
§ 153.014 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall
include, but not be limited to the following:
   (A)   Permit review. Review all development permits to determine:
      (1)   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including
determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing
structures;
      (2)   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;
      (3)   The site is reasonably safe from flooding;
      (4)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the city; and
      (5)   All Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are
approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not
be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs). Approved
CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land
preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition.
   (B)   Development of substantial improvement and substantial damage
procedures.
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator, with the concurrence of the Public
Works/Building Safety Departments, shall determine the extent of substantial
damage and/or improvement to an affected structure or building. The city shall
use §§
153.027 and
153.028, the Substantial Improvement/Damage Determination sections of this
chapter and any subsequent FEMA Technical Guides to determine if structural
damage and /or improvements rise to the level of substantial as defined in §
153.005. The city shall, when determining the market value of a structure,
shall utilize the ratio of the estimated cost of restoring the structure to its
condition prior to such damage or partial deconstruction to the estimated cost
of duplicating the entire structure as it existed prior thereto. Estimates for
this purpose shall be made by or shall be reviewed and approved by, the Chief
Building Official or designee.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator shall assure all procedures referenced
in §
153.014 are coordinated with other city departments/divisions and implemented
by city staff.
   (C)   Review, use and development of other base flood data.
      (1)   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance
with §
153.007, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer §§
153.017 through
153.023, Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction.
      (2)   A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods
from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, Managing Floodplain Development in
Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year)
Flood Elevations dated July 1995.
   (D)   Notification of other agencies.
      (1)   Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:
         (a)   Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of
Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;
         (b)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency; and
         (c)   Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
      (2)   Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations:
         (1)   Within six months of information becoming available or project
completion, whichever comes first, the Floodplain Administrator shall submit or
assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA
for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
         (2)   (a)   All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to
the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on
Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow
construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as
specified in the "start of construction" definition.
            (b)   Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of
those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and
floodplain management requirements are based on current data.
         (3)   Changes in corporate boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever
the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and
include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate
limits.
   (E)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:
      (1)   Certification required by §
153.017(C)(1) and §

for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the city's biennial
report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (F)   Map determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact
location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions.
The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
153.016.
   (G)   Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as
specified in §
153.008.

hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
   (B)   Construction materials and methods. All new construction and
substantial improvements of structures, including manufactured homes, shall be
constructed:
      (1)   With flood resistant materials, and utility equipment resistant to
flood damage for areas below the base flood elevation;
      (2)   Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      (3)   With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding; and
      (4)   Within Zones AH or AO, adequate drainage paths shall be constructed
around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (C)   Elevation and floodproofing.

(Ord. 767-C.S., passed 4-19-11)
§ 153.022 FLOODWAYS.
   Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood
waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the
following provisions apply:
   (A)   Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction,
substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be
permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the city.
   (B)   Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city shall prohibit
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and
other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is
provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any
increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (C)   If §
153.022(A) and (B) are satisfied, all new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other
applicable provisions for flood hazard reduction.
(Ord. 767-C.S., passed 4-19-11)
§ 153.023 COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREAS.
   Within coastal high hazard areas, Zones V, V1-30, and VE, as established

153.007, the following standards shall apply:
   (A)   All new residential and nonresidential construction, including
substantial improvement/damage, shall be elevated on adequately anchored
pilings or columns and securely anchored to such pilings or columns so that the
bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor
(excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood
level. The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored
to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind
and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading
values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values
used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards.
   (B)   All new construction and other development shall be located on the
landward side of the reach of mean high tide.
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvement shall have the space
below the lowest floor free of obstructions or constructed with breakaway walls
as defined in §
153.005. Such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and will be
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage.
   (D)   Fill shall not be used for structural support of buildings.
   (E)   Man-made alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood
damage is prohibited.
   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator shall obtain and maintain the following
records:
      (1)   Certification by a registered engineer or architect that a proposed
structure complies with §
153.023(A); and
      (2)   The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the
lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings or
columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether such
structures contain a basement.
(Ord. 767-C.S., passed 4-19-11)
VARIANCE PROCEDURES
§ 153.024 NATURE OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only.
Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk
and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.
   (B)   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a property and are
not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a property with physical
characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter
would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding
property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be
shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land
itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.
   (C)   It is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding.
This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a
structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood
elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The
long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met
if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided
in this chapter are detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met
before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen
out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more
appropriate.
(Ord. 767-C.S., passed 4-19-11)
§ 153.025 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-
half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of the Administration and Provisions for Flood hazard Reduction
sections of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
   (B)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures (as defined in §
153.005) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (C)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
MINIMUM NECESSARY means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the Planning Commission need not grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation
the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the Planning
Commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the
local ordinance.
   (E)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance; and
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the office of the Humboldt County Recorder and shall be
recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected
parcel of land.
   (F)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
(Ord. 767-C.S., passed 4-19-11)
§ 153.026 APPEAL BOARD.
   (A)   Upon reviewing requests for variances, the Planning Commission shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
      (5)   Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.
   (B)   Variances shall only be granted upon a:
      (1)   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary
public expense, create a nuisance (see §
153.005, definition of “public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud and
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
   (C)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement,
and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that the provisions of §
153.026(A) through (D) are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not
create a public nuisance.
   (D)   Upon consideration of the factors of §
153.026 (A) and the purposes of this chapter, the Planning Commission may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.

§ 154.003 CONFORMITY TO GENERAL PLAN, LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM, SPECIFIC PLAN AND
ZONING ORDINANCES.
   (A)   No land shall be subdivided and developed for any purpose which is not
in conformity with the general plan and any specific plan of the city or
specifically authorized by precise zoning of the city. No subdivision approval
shall be given to any project located in the coastal zone which is found to be
in conflict with the certified Local Coastal Program.
   (B)   The type and intensity of land use as shown on the general plan and
coastal land use plan for lands in the coastal zone shall determine the type of
streets, roads, highways, utilities and public services that shall be provided
by the subdivider.
   (C)   For lands within the coastal zone, the subdivider shall obtain a

§ 154.005 MODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Whenever, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the land involved
in any subdivision is of such size or shape, or is subject to such title
limitations of record, or is affected by such topographical location or
conditions, or is to be devoted to such use that it is impossible or
impracticable in the particular case for the subdivider to conform fully to the
regulations contained in this chapter, the Planning Commission may make such

§ 154.040 PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL ACTION.
   (A)   Notice of public hearings.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a valid application, and having received from the
Department of Community Development their report and recommendations for the
proposed tentative subdivision map, the secretary of the Planning Commission
shall set the matter for public hearing.
      (2)   The notice shall be provided as set forth in §§
155.408.080 et seq. of this title.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall approve, conditionally approve or
deny the tentative map and shall report its decision to the City Council and
the subdivider within 50 days after the tentative map has been accepted for
filing.
   (B)   Approval.
      (1)   In approving or conditionally approving the tentative subdivision
map, the Planning Commission shall find that the proposed subdivision, together
with its provisions for its design and improvements, is consistent with
applicable general or specific plans (including the coastal land use plan)
adopted by the city.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may modify or delete any of the conditions
of approval recommended in the Department of Community Development’s report,
except conditions required by city ordinance or by the City Engineer, related
to public health and safety or standards approved by the City Engineer, or add
additional requirements as a condition of its approval.
      (3)   If no action is taken by the Planning Commission within the time
limit as specified, the tentative map as filed shall be deemed to be approved,
insofar as it complies with other applicable provisions of the State
Subdivision Map Act, this chapter or other city ordinances, and it shall be the
duty of this City Clerk to certify the approval.
   (C)   Denial. The tentative subdivision map may be denied by the Planning
Commission on any of the grounds provided by city ordinances or the State
Subdivision Map Act. The Planning Commission shall deny approval of the
tentative map if it makes any of the following findings:
      (1)   That the proposed map is not consistent with applicable general,
coastal, and specific plans.
      (2)   That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not
consistent with applicable general, coastal land use, or specific plans, as
applicable.
      (3)   That the site is not physically suitable for land use for the type
of development.
      (4)   That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed density
of development.
      (5)   That the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are
likely to cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and avoidably
injure fish or wildlife or their habitat.
      (6)   That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements is
likely to cause serious public health problems.
      (7)   That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will
conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or
use of property within the proposed subdivision. In this connection, the
governing body may approve a map if it finds that alternate easements for
access or for use will be provided, and that these will be substantially
equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. This subdivision shall
apply only to easements of record or to easements established by judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction and no authority is hereby granted to a
legislative body to determine that the public at large has acquired easements
for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision.
      (8)   In the coastal zone, that the proposed subdivision results in the
creation of a parcel or parcels totally within an environmentally sensitive
habitat area or flood hazard area as defined in the coastal land use plan.
Parcels created by division shall have sufficient nonsensitive and non-hazard
area to accommodate development allowed in the applicable land use category,
but not allowed in a sensitive habitat or flood hazard area.
   (D)   City Council review.
      (1)   If a tentative map is approved or conditionally approved, the
Department of Community Development shall make a written report to the City
Council. After the 15-day appeal period has expired, the City Council at its
first meeting thereafter, shall consider the recommendation of the Planning
Commission, unless the subdivider consents to a continuance. If the Council
decides to review the map and conditions, it shall conduct a public hearing
after giving notice pursuant to division (A) of this section. In addition,
notice shall be given to the subdivider and the Planning Commission. At that
hearing, the Council may add, modify, or delete conditions when the Council
determines that such changes are necessary to insure that the tentative map
conforms to zoning conditions imposed upon the property, applicable city
ordinances, and of the State Subdivision Map Act. The City Council may deny the
tentative map on any of the grounds contained in division (C) of this section.
If the Council does not act within the time limits set forth in this
subchapter, the tentative map shall be deemed to have been approved or
conditionally approved as set forth in the Planning Commission’s report.
      (2)   For proposed subdivisions in the coastal zone, the City Council
shall provide notice of final city action on a tentative map to the Coastal
Commission, as prescribed in Chapter 156 of this title.
   (E)   Extension of time for Planning Commission or City Council action. The
time limits set forth in this section for acting on the tentative map may be
extended by mutual consent of the subdivider and the Planning Commission or the
City Council.

map on a portion of an approved or conditionally approved tentative map shall
not invalidate any part of the tentative map. Each final map which constitutes
a part, or unit, of the approved tentative map shall have a separate
subdivision number. The subdivision improvement agreement to be executed by the
subdivider shall provide for the construction of such improvements as may be
required to constitute a logical and orderly development of the whole

subchapter are determined to be necessary for the preservation of the public
health, safety and general welfare, and for the promotion of orderly growth and
development.

subdivision development, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed in
accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.

prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for
construction, or work preparatory to construction.

   (A)   The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall
confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance
with the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Section 66474.2 of
the Subdivision Map Act. However, if Section 64674.2 is repealed, the approval
or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right
to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances,
policies, and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is
approved or conditionally approved.
   (B)   Notwithstanding division (A), a permit, approval, extension, or
entitlement may be conditioned or denied if any of the following are
determined:
      (1)   A failure to do so would place the residents of subdivision or the
immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or
safety, or both.
      (2)   The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state
or federal law.
   (C)   The rights required to herein shall expire if a final map or parcel

154.089 of this subchapter. If the final or parcel map is approved, these
rights shall last for the following periods of time:
      (1)   An initial time period of one year beyond the recording of the
final map or parcel map. Where several final maps are recorded on various
phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this one-year
initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that
phase is recorded. All of said final maps or parcel maps must be recorded
within the time period set forth in §
154.089 of this subchapter or the vesting tentative map approval shall expire
for those parcels for which final maps or parcel maps are not timely recorded.
      (2)   The one year initial time period set forth in subsection (C)(1) of
this section shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a
complete application for a grading permit, if one is required, or for any
required design or architectural review, if such processing exceeds 30 days
from the date a complete application is filed.
      (3)   A subdivider may apply to the Planning Commission, in the case of
final maps, or to the Director of Community Development, in the case of parcel
maps, for a one-year extension at any time before the initial time period set
forth in subsection (1) of this division expires. If the extension is denied,
the subdivider may appeal that denial to the City Council within 15 days in
accordance with §§
154.042(B) and
154.067 of this chapter.
      (4)   If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building
permit during the periods of time specified in subdivisions (1) through (3) of
this division, the rights referred to herein shall continue until the
expiration of that permit, or any extension of that permit.
   (D)   Consistent with division (A) of this section, an approved or
conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall not limit the city from
imposing reasonable conditions on subsequent required approvals or permits
necessary for the development.

   (A)   Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision
whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in
existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The city
may deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the
subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the
zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning
ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative
map shall, notwithstanding §
154.090(A) of this subchapter, confer the vested right to proceed with the
development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance
and the map, as approved.

pursuant to the authority granted by the subdivision map act of the state. The
part and recreational facilities for which dedication of land and/or payment of
a fee is required by this subchapter agree in accordance with the recreational
element of the general plan of the city, adopted by the city on September 20,
1977, and any amendments thereto.
   (B)   Requirements. If required as a condition of approval of a final
subdivision map or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in
lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the city, for park or recreational
purposes at the time and according to the standards and formula contained in
this subchapter.
   (C)   General standard. It is hereby found and determined that the public
interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that five acres of
property for each 1,000 persons residing within the city be devoted to local
park and recreational purposes.
   (D)   Standards and formula for dedication of land. Where a park or
recreational facility has been designated in an element of the general plan of
the city, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed
subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the
subdivision, the subdivider, if required shall dedicate land for a local park
sufficient in size and topography to serve the residents of the subdivision.
The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the following
standards and formula:

            1000 Pers.
   (E)   Formula for fees in lieu of land dedication.
      (1)   General formula. If there is no park or recreational facility
designated in the city's general plan to be located in whole or in part within
the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the
residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall, in lieu of dedicating land,
pay a fee equal to the value of the land prescribed for dedication in division
(D) of this section and in an amount determined in accordance with the
provisions of division (F) of this section, such fee to be paid for a local
park which will serve the residents of the area being subdivided.
      (2)   Use of money. The money collected hereunder shall be used only for
the purpose of providing park or recreational facilities reasonably related to
serving the subdivision by way of the purchase of necessary land or, if the
Park and Recreation Commission deems that there is sufficient land available
for the subdivision, for improving of such land for park and recreational
purposes.
   (F)   Amount of fee in lieu of park land dedication.
      (1)   When a fee is required to be paid in lieu of park land dedication,
the amount of such fee shall be based upon the average estimated fair market
value of the land being subdivided.
      (2)   The fair market value shall be as determined by a qualified real
estate appraiser mutually agreed upon by the city and the subdivider, which
appraisal will be considered by the city in determining the fair market value.
All costs required to obtain such appraisal shall be borne by the subdivider.
      (3)   The amount of fee to be paid in lieu of park land dedication shall
be the value of the land which would otherwise be required to be dedicated
pursuant to division (D) of this section.
   (G)   Subdivisions not within general plan. When the proposed subdivision
lies within an area not then within, but to be included within, the city's
general plan, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or
both, in accordance with the adopted park and recreation principles and
standards of the city's general plan and in accordance with the provisions of
this subchapter.
   (H)   Determination of land or fee. Whether the city accepts land dedication
or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of
both, shall be determined by consideration of the following:
      (1)   Recreational element of the city's general plan;
      (2)   Topography, geology, access and location of the land in the
subdivision available for dedication;
      (3)   Size and shape of the subdivision of land available for dedication;

Recreation and Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Commission shall determine,
after a report and recommendation from the Parks and Recreation Staff, pursuant
to division (H) of this section whether land is to be dedicated or in lieu fees
are to be paid by the subdivider or any combination of land and fees.
      (2)   The recommendation by the Parks and Recreation Staff and the action
of the Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Commission shall include the
following:
         (a)   The amount of land required;
         (b)   That a fee be charged in lieu of land;
         (c)   That land and a fee be required;
         (d)   That a stated amount of credit be given for private recreation
facilities or unique natural and special features, and the like;
         (e)   The location of the park land to be dedicated or use of in lieu
fees; or
         (f)   The approximate time when development of the park or recreation
facility shall commence.
      (3)   This action shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission for
concurrence. If concurrence is not obtained, this matter will be forwarded to
the City Council for final determination. In making its determination, the
Council shall be guided by the same standards contained in this subchapter
where applicable.
      (4)   At the time of the filing of the final subdivision map, the
subdivider shall dedicate the land and/or pay the fees as determined by the
city.

principles and standards contained in the above specific plan or the general
plan. The reserved area must be of such size and shape as to permit the balance
of the property within which the reservation is located to develop in an
orderly and efficient manner. The amount of land to be reserved shall not make
development of the remaining land held by the subdivider economically
unfeasible. The reserved area shall conform to the adopted specific plan or the
general plan and shall be in such multiples of streets and parcels as to permit
an efficient division of the reserved area in the event that it is not acquired

   (D)   Payment to subdivider. The purchase price shall be the market value
thereof at the time of the filing of the tentative map plus the taxes against
such reserved area from the tentative map plus the taxes against such reserved
area from the date of the reservation and any other costs incurred by the
subdivider in the maintenance of such reserved area, including interest costs
incurred on any load covering such reserved area.

PARCEL MERGERS
§ 154.190 MERGERS NOT REQUIRED.
   Two or more contiguous parcels or units or land which have been subdivided
under the provisions of this chapter or the State Subdivision Map Act shall not

('63 Code, § 10-4.1201) (Ord. 416-C.S., passed 12-6-84)
§ 154.191 MERGERS REQUIRED.
   (A)   If any of two or more contiguous parcels or units held by the same
owner does not conform to the minimum parcel size requirements of existing
zoning regulations so as not to permit its development, and at least one of the
affected parcels is not developed with a structure other than an accessory
structure for which a building permit was issued or which was built prior to
the time such permits were required by the city, and with respect to any
affected parcel, one or more of the following conditions exist: comprises less

not created in compliance with applicable laws and ordinances in effect at the
time of its creation; does not meet current standards for sewage disposal and
domestic water supply; does not meet slope stability standards; has no legal
access which is adequate for vehicular and safety equipment access and
maneuverability; its development could create health or safety hazards; is
inconsistent with the applicable general plan other than minimum lot size or
density standards; a structure is built on or across a property line; then such
parcels shall be considered as merged for the purpose of this chapter.
   (B)   If the sole reason for merger is that the parcel(s) contain less than
5,000 square feet, then the Planning Commission may consider an exception from
merger for any parcel(s) containing a width of 35 feet or greater in accordance
with provisions included in §
154.040 of this chapter.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 154.205 PROHIBITIONS.
   (A)   No person shall offer to sell or lease, to contract to sell or lease,
to sell or lease or to finance any parcel or parcels of real property or to
commence construction of any building for sale, lease or financing thereon,
except for model homes, or to allow occupancy thereof for which a final map is
required by this chapter, or the State Subdivision Map Act, until such map
thereof, in full compliance with the provisions of this chapter, or the State
Subdivision Map Act has been filed with the County Recorder for record.
   (B)   No person shall sell, lease or finance any parcel or parcels of real
property or commence construction of any buildings for sale, lease or financing
thereon, except for model homes, or allow occupancy thereof for which a parcel
map is required by this chapter or the State Subdivision Map Act, until such
map thereof, in full compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the
State Subdivision Map Act has been filed for record by the recorder.
   (C)   Conveyances of any part of a division of real property for which a
final or parcel map is required by this chapter shall not be made by parcel or
block number, initial or other designation, unless and until such map has been
filed for record with the County Recorder.
   (D)   This section does not apply to any parcel or parcels of a subdivision
offered for sale or lease, contracted for sale or lease, or sold or leased in
compliance with or exempt from any law regulating the design and improvement of
subdivisions in effect at the time the subdivision was established.
('63 Code, § 10-4.1101) (Ord. 416-C.S., passed 12-6-84)
Penalty, see § 150.999
§ 154.206 REMEDIES.
   (A)   Any deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell real property which
has been divided, or which has resulted from a division in violation of the
provisions of this chapter or State Subdivision Map Act is voidable at the sole
option of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, his heirs,
personal representative or trustee in insolvency or bankruptcy within one year
after the date of discovery of the violation, but the deed of conveyance, sale
or contract to sell is binding upon any successor in interest of the grantee,
buyer or person contracting to purchase, other than those above enumerated, and
upon the grantor, vendor or person contracting to sell, or his assignee, heir
or devisee.
   (B)   Any grantee or his successor in interest of real property which has
been divided or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the
provisions of this chapter or the State Subdivision Map Act may, within one
year of the date of discovery of such violation, bring an action in the
Superior Court to recover any damages he has suffered by reason of such
division of property. The action may be brought against the person who divided
the property in violation and against any successors in interest who have
actual or constructive knowledge of such division of property.
   (C)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to the conveyance of
any parcel of real property identified in a certificate of compliance filed
pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code § 66499.35 or identified in a recorded final map or
parcel map, from and after the date of recording. The provisions of this
section shall not limit or affect in any way the rights of a grantee or his
successor in interest under any other provision of law.
   (D)   This section does not bar any legal, equitable or summary remedy to
which the city or other public agency, or any person, firm or corporation may
otherwise be entitled, and the city or other public agency, or such person,
firm or corporation may file a suit in the Superior Court of the county to
restrain or enjoin any attempted or proposed subdivision for sale, lease or
financing in violation of this chapter.
   (E)   The city shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to
develop any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a
division, in violation of the provisions of this chapter or the State
Subdivision Map Act if it finds that development of such real property is
contrary to the public health or the public safety. The authority to deny such
a permit or such approval shall apply whether the applicant therefor was the
owner of the real property at the time of such violation or whether the
applicant therefor is the current owner of the real property with, or without,
actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the
acquisition of his interest in such real property.
   (F)   The city, in issuing a permit or granting approval for the development
of any such real property, may impose those additional conditions as would have
been applicable to the division of the property at the time the current owner
of record acquired the property, and which has been established at such time by
this division or local ordinance enacted pursuant thereto, except that if a
conditional certificate of compliance has been filed for record under the
provisions of this subchapter, only such conditions stipulated shall be
applicable.
('63 Code, § 10-4.1102) (Ord. 416-C.S., passed 12-6-84)
§ 154.207 CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   Any person owning real property within the city may request the
Director of Community Development to determine whether such real property
complies with the provisions of this chapter and the State Subdivision Map Act.
   (B)   Upon making such determination, the Director of Community Development
shall cause a certificate of compliance to be filed for record with the County
Recorder. The certificate of compliance shall identify the real property and
shall state that the division of land complies with applicable provisions of
this code of ordinances and the State Subdivision Map Act.
   (C)   If the Director of Community Development determines that such real
property does not comply with the provisions of this code of ordinances or
State Subdivision Map Act, he may, as a condition to granting a certificate of
compliance, impose such conditions as would have been applicable to the
division of the property at the time the current owner of record acquired the
property, and which had been established at such time by ordinance. Upon making
such a determination and establishing such conditions, the Director of
Community Development shall cause a conditional certificate of compliance to be
filed for record with the County Recorder. Such certificate shall serve as
notice to the property owner who has applied for the certificate pursuant to
this section, a grantee of the property owner, or any subsequent issuance of a
permit or other grant of approval for development of the property. Compliance
with such conditions shall not be required until such time as a permit or other
grant of approval for development of such property is issued.
   (D)   A recorded final map or parcel map shall constitute a certificate of
compliance with respect to the parcels of real property described therein.
   (E)   For the purposes of administration of this section, any parcel that is
shown on the County Assessor's maps prior to March 4, 1972, shall be considered
as a conforming parcel.
   (F)   A fee shall be charged to the applicant for making the determination
and processing the certificate of compliance.
   (G)   In the coastal zone, the applicant shall be required to obtain a
coastal development permit, as prescribed by
Chapter 156 of this title, in addition to any certificate of compliance.
('63 Code, § 10-4.1103) (Ord. 416-C.S., passed 12-6-84)
§ 154.208 CERTIFICATE OF NONCOMPLIANCE.
   Whenever the Director of Community Development has knowledge that real
property has been divided in violation of the provisions of this chapter or the
Subdivision Map Act, the Director of Community Development shall cause to be
filed for record with the County Recorder a notice of intention to record a
notice of violation, describing the real property in detail, naming the owners
thereof, and describing the violation, and stating that an opportunity will be
given to the owner to present evidence. Upon recording a notice of intention to
record a notice of violation, the Director of Community Development shall mail
a copy of such notice to the owner of such real property. The notice shall
specify a time, date, and place at which the owner may present evidence to the
Planning Commission why such notice should not be recorded. If, after the owner
has presented evidence, it is determined that there has been no violation, the
Director of Community Development shall record a release of the notice of
intention to record a notice of violation with the County Recorder. If,
however, after the owner has presented evidence, the Planning Commission
determines that the property has in fact been illegally divided, or if within
60 days of receipt of such copy the owner of such real property fails to inform
the Planning Commission of his objection to recording the notice of violation,
the Director of Community Development shall record the notice of violation with
the County Recorder. The notice of intention to record a notice of violation
and the notice of violation, when recorded, shall be deemed to be constructive
notice of the violation to all successors in interest in such property.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.104 INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS.
§ 155.104.010 TITLE.
   
Chapter 155 of the Municipal Code will be known and cited as the “Eureka Zoning
Code” and referred to in this title as the “Zoning Code.”
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.104.020 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   The Zoning Code takes effect and is in force from and after June 20, 2019.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.104.030 AUTHORITY.
   The Zoning Code is adopted pursuant to the authority in the City Charter,
Cal. Gov’t Code § 65850 and all other relevant laws of the State of California.
Whenever the Zoning Code refers to a section of state law that is later amended
or superseded, the Zoning Code will be deemed amended to refer to the amended
section or the section that most nearly corresponds to the superseded section.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.104.040 PURPOSE OF THE ZONING CODE.
   (A)   General. The purpose of the Zoning Code is to implement the General
Plan and to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
   (B)   Specific. The Zoning Code is intended to:
      (1)   Preserve and enhance Eureka’s unique sense of place, small city
charm, livability and sense of community;
      (2)   Support a pedestrian-friendly built environment, increase
transportation choices and expand opportunities for residents to walk, bike and
take transit to destinations;
      (3)   Maintain and expand the variety of housing types to serve a diverse
population;
      (4)   Encourage and incentivize a diversity of residential, commercial,
industrial and mixed-use developments;
      (5)   Encourage pedestrian-friendly urban development through a
streamlined approval process;
      (6)   Where appropriate, encourage vertical mixed-use development with
upper story residential units above ground floor commercial uses;
      (7)   Protect and enhance the distinctive character of Eureka’s
neighborhoods and commercial districts;
      (8)   Enhance the appearance, economic vitality and livability of
Eureka’s neighborhoods and commercial districts;
      (9)   Encourage active and inviting streetscapes, buildings and public
spaces;
      (10)   Realize the full development potential of Eureka’s industrial and
commercial waterfront areas;
      (11)   Enhance the vitality of Downtown and Old Town as the core of the
community with a diversity of land uses and pedestrian-oriented urban design;
      (12)   Encourage infill development and the reuse of existing structures
to strengthen established neighborhoods;
      (13)   Establish flexible performance-based standards to encourage design
creativity and address unique circumstances;
      (14)   Protect Eureka’s natural beauty and conserve valuable natural
resources; and
      (15)   Enhance the urban/wildland interface zones around the edges of the
city and promote recreation opportunities within these zones.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.104.050 RELATIONSHIP TO THE GENERAL PLAN.
   The Zoning Code implements the General Plan by establishing detailed
regulations for land uses, structures and activities in Eureka. All land uses,
structures and activities in Eureka must be consistent with the General Plan.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.104.060 APPLICABILITY AND JURISDICTION.
   (A)   General. The Zoning Code applies to all lots, land uses, structures
and development in Eureka unless an exemption is specifically provided by the
Zoning Code.
   (B)   Coastal zone. The applicability of the Zoning Code in the coastal zone
is described in §
155.104.070 (Relationship to the Local Coastal Program).
   (C)   Compliance required. All lots, land uses, structures and development
in Eureka, including existing and proposed development, must comply with the
Zoning Code.
   (D)   Approvals required. A land use may be established and a structure may
be constructed, altered or moved only after:
      (1)   All applicable development review processes have been followed;
      (2)   All applicable approvals have been obtained; and
      (3)   All required permits and/or authorizations to proceed have been
issued.
   (E)   Administrative responsibilities. City roles and responsibilities in
the administration of the Zoning Code are as provided in §
155.404 (Administrative Responsibilities).
   (F)   Subdivisions. All subdivisions of land, lot line adjustments, and
other actions under Municipal Code
Ch. 154 (Subdivision Regulations) and the California Subdivision Map Act that
are proposed after June 20, 2019, must comply with the Zoning Code.
   (G)   Governmental activities. The Zoning Code applies to special districts
and state or federal governmental agencies to the extent legally permissible.
The Zoning Code does not apply to public projects of the City of Eureka.
Private projects on leased lands owned by the city are not public projects of
the city.
   (H)   Public utilities. Public utilities are subject to the requirements of
the Zoning Code, except to the extent provided by Cal. Gov’t Code § 53091 and
the California Public Utilities Code.
   (I)   Emergency powers. The City Council may authorize deviations from the
Zoning Code during a local emergency declared in accordance with the California
Emergency Services Act (Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 8550 et seq.), by resolution without
notice or public hearing.
   (J)   Other regulations. Compliance with the Zoning Code does not relieve an
applicant from compliance with other federal, state and city regulations that
also apply to the property.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19; Am. Ord. 916-C.S., passed 7-6-21)
§ 155.104.070 RELATIONSHIP TO THE LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM.
   (A)   Implementation plan separate from Zoning Code. Eureka’s Local Coastal
Program Implementation Plan (“Implementation Plan”) is separate from the Zoning
Code. The Implementation Plan, found in Municipal Code
Ch. 156 (Coastal Zoning), establishes regulations that apply in Eureka’s
coastal zone to implement the Local Coastal Program Land Use Plan in accordance
with the California Coastal Act of 1976. The Implementation Plan contains:
      (1)   Coastal zoning districts with allowed land uses and development
standards that apply to zoning districts within the coastal zone;
      (2)   Additional regulations needed to implement the Land Use Plan; and
      (3)   Procedures for the approval of coastal development permits and
other permits and approvals in the coastal zone.
   (B)   Implementation Plan limited to
Ch. 156. The Implementation Plan is limited exclusively to Municipal Code
Ch. 156. No contents of the Zoning Code, irrespective of its applicability in
the coastal zone, are considered a part of the Implementation Plan.
   (C)   Applicability in coastal zone. The Zoning Code and Implementation Plan
both contain requirements that apply in the coastal zone, as follows.
      (1)   Implementation plan requirements. Implementation Plan requirements
apply fully to all uses, structures and activities in the coastal zone in
accordance with the California Coastal Act. In case of conflict between the
Implementation Plan and the Zoning Code, the Implementation Plan governs.
      (2)   Requirements in both Zoning Code and Implementation Plan. Certain
topics are addressed in both the Zoning Code and the Implementation Plan (e.g.,
parking, signs). For these topics, the Implementation Plan requirements govern
in the coastal zone. All Zoning Code requirements superseded by the
Implementation Plan are identified in the Zoning Code with notes in their
respective sections.
      (3)   Zoning code content not in the Implementation Plan. Zoning Code
requirements that are not specifically addressed in the Implementation Plan
fully apply in the coastal zone. For example, Zoning Code requirements for the
processing of permit applications, which is not addressed in the Implementation
Plan, apply to all development projects. While these Zoning Code requirements
may apply in the coastal zone, they are not considered a part of the
Implementation Plan.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.104.080 NUMBERING AND REFERENCING.
   (A)   The numbering system used in the Zoning Code reflects the numbering
system of other chapters in the Municipal Code.
   (B)   The numbering system and outline levels used in the Zoning Code is as
follows:
   
Chapter 155 - Zoning Code
      Subchapter - Subchapter Title
         Section
155.104 - Section Title

§ 155.104.090 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Conflict with state or federal regulations. Where conflict occurs with
state or federal laws, higher law shall control over lower law unless local
variation is permitted.
   (B)   Conflicts with general plan, specific plans and development
agreements. Where the Zoning Code conflicts with the General Plan, a specific
plan or a development agreement, the General Plan, specific plan or development
agreement will control.
   (C)   Conflict with other city regulations. Where the Zoning Code conflicts
with other ordinances, resolutions or regulations of the City of Eureka, the
more restrictive will control.
   (D)   Conflict with private agreements. It is not the intent of the Zoning
Code to interfere with, abrogate or annul any easement, covenant, deed
restriction or other agreement between private parties. If the Zoning Code
imposes a greater restriction than imposed by a private agreement, the Zoning
Code will control. Private agreements may impose greater restrictions than the
Zoning Code, but the city is not responsible for monitoring or enforcing
private agreements.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.104.100 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Relation to prior zoning ordinance. This Zoning Code supersedes the
prior Zoning Code codified as
Ch. 155 of the Eureka Municipal Code.
   (B)   Violations continue. A violation of the prior Zoning Code continues to
be a violation under this Zoning Code unless the violation is brought into
compliance with this Zoning Code.
   (C)   Pending applications.
      (1)   If the city deems an application complete, but does not take final
action on the application before the effective date of this Zoning Code, the
application remains subject to the Zoning Code in effect when the application
was deemed complete.
      (2)   If the city deems an application withdrawn under §
155.408.070 (Applications Deemed Withdrawn), any re-application is subject to
the requirements of this Zoning Code.
   (D)   Approved projects.
      (1)   Permits and other approvals valid on the effective date of this
Zoning Code remain valid until their expiration date.
      (2)   Projects with valid permits or approvals shall be completed in
compliance with the standards in effect at the time of approval. If the permit
or approval expires, future development must comply with the requirements of
this Zoning Code.
   (E)   Non-conformities. A parcel, land use or structure legally established
prior to June 20, 2019, that does not comply with this Zoning Code is
considered non-conforming and subject to the requirements in §
155.424 (Non-Conformities).
   (F)   Transition to new zoning districts.
      (1)   Upon the effective date of this Zoning Code, land with zoning from
the previous Zoning Code shall be rezoned to one of the zoning districts as
established in §
155.116 (Zoning Districts and Map) and shown on the Zoning Map.
      (2)   A property must comply with the regulations of its zoning district
classification as established in §
155.116 (Zoning Districts and Map) and shown on the Zoning Map.
   (G)   Planned development zoning districts. Requirements and allowances that
applied within a planned development zoning district existing before the
effective date of the Zoning Code remain in full force and effect.
   (H)   Qualifying overlay zoning districts. Limitations and restrictions that
applied within a qualifying overlay zone existing before the effective date of
the Zoning Code remain in full force and effect.
   (I)   References to prior zoning districts.
      (1)   In cases where city ordinances, policies, conditions of approval
and other requirements reference a zoning district classification from the
previous Zoning Code, such references will mean the equivalent zoning district
in this Zoning Code.
      (2)   For requirements based on previous zoning districts with no
equivalent zoning district in this Zoning Code, such references will be
interpreted to best achieve the requirement’s original intent as determined by
the Director.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.104.110 SEVERABILITY.
   If any portion of the Zoning Code is found invalid or unconstitutional by
the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision will not
affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.108 INTERPRETATION.
§ 155.108.010 PURPOSE.
   This §
155.108 establishes rules and procedures for interpreting the Zoning Code to
ensure that it is applied and enforced in a consistent manner.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.108.020 AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Director. The Director has the authority to:
      (1)   Interpret the meaning and applicability of the Zoning Code; and
      (2)   Issue official interpretations of the Zoning Code as provided in §
155.108.030 (Official Interpretations).
   (B)   Department staff. Department staff may apply the rules for
interpreting the Zoning Code established in this §
155.108 when performing duties described in §
155.404.030 (Development Services Department).
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.108.030 OFFICIAL INTERPRETATIONS.
   (A)   Director interpretations. When the Director determines that a
provision in the Zoning Code requires clarification, the Director may issue an
official interpretation. Official interpretations will be in writing and
maintained by the Department for public review.
   (B)   Referrals to Planning Commission. The Director may refer any issue of
interpretation to the Planning Commission for review and final determination.
   (C)   Appeals. Official interpretations of the Zoning Code may be appealed
in accordance with §
155.416 (Appeals and Reviews).
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.108.040 RULES OF INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   Meaning and intent. All language shall be construed according to the
purpose and intent set out in §
155.104.040 (Purpose of the Zoning Code).
   (B)   Minimum requirements. The Zoning Code establishes minimum requirements
to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Where the Zoning Code allows
for city discretion, the city may impose more stringent requirements to achieve
the purpose and intent of the Zoning Code set out in §
155.104.040 (Purpose of the Zoning Code).
   (C)   Harmonious construction. The city intends that all provisions of the
Zoning Code be construed harmoniously. When two or more provisions of the
Zoning Code appear to conflict, the city may construe such provisions to give
effect to both, if possible, by harmonizing them with each other. In cases of
unresolvable conflict, the more restrictive will govern.
   (D)   Headings, tables and figures. In cases where text conflicts with any
heading, table or figure, the text controls.
   (E)   Lists and examples. Lists of items or examples that use terms such as
“including,” “such as” or similar language are intended to provide examples,
not to be exhaustive lists of all possibilities. Unless otherwise specifically
indicated, the word “including” always means “including, but not limited to.”
   (F)   Computation of time. References to “days” are calendar days unless
otherwise stated. When “business days” are referenced, they include only days
when Eureka City Hall is open. The end of a time period is computed by
excluding the first day and including the last day.
   (G)   Rounding of fractional numbers. Unless otherwise stated, a fraction of
one-half or more will be rounded to the next highest whole number and a
fraction of less than one-half will be rounded to the next lowest whole number.
   (H)   References to other regulations, publications and documents. Whenever
reference is made to a law or regulation, it will be construed as a reference
to the most recent edition of such law or regulation, unless specifically
stated.
   (I)   Technical and non-technical terms. Words and phrases will be construed
according to the common and approved usage of the language. Technical words and
phrases with a particular and appropriate meaning in law will be construed and
understood according to such meaning.
   (J)   Public officials and agencies. All public officials, bodies and
agencies to which references are made are those of the City of Eureka, unless
otherwise indicated.
   (K)   Mandatory and discretionary terms. The words “will,” “must,” “shall”
and “is” are always mandatory. The words “should” is encouraged but not
required and “may” is permissive.
   (L)   Conjunctions. Unless the context clearly suggests the contrary,
conjunctions will be interpreted as follows.
      (1)   “And” means that all connected items apply.
      (2)   “And/or” means that the connected items may apply singularly or in
any combination.
      (3)   “Or” means that one or more of the connected items may apply.
      (4)   “Either...or” means that the connected words or provisions shall
apply singularly, but not in combination.
   (M)   Tenses and plurals. Words used in one tense (past, present or future)
include all other tenses, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The
singular includes the plural, and the plural includes the singular.
   (N)   Terms not defined. The Director has the authority to provide a
definition for an undefined term based upon intended meaning of the term.
Director determinations will be in writing and maintained by the Department for
public review.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.108.050 LAND USE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Land use regulation tables. Land use regulation tables in the Zoning
District Standards identify permitted land uses within each zoning district.
Notations within these tables have the following meanings:
      (1)   Permitted uses. A "P" means a use is permitted by right in the
zoning district after obtaining a zoning clearance in accordance with §
155.412.150 (Zoning Clearances).
      (2)   Conditionally permitted uses. A "C" means a use requires approval
of a conditional use permit in accordance with §
155.412.120 (Use Permits).
      (3)   Minor permitted uses. An "M" means a use requires approval of a
minor use permit in accordance with §
155.412.120 (Use Permits).
      (4)   Uses not allowed. A "-" (dash) means a use is not allowed in the
zoning district.
   (B)   Unlisted land uses.
      (1)   A land use not listed in a land use regulation table is not
permitted if the use is listed as an allowed use in one or more other zoning
districts. In such a case, the absence of the use in the land use regulation
table means that the use is prohibited in the zoning district.
      (2)   For a proposed use not listed in any land use regulation table, the
Director may determine that the proposed use is equivalent to a permitted or
conditionally permitted use if all of the following findings can be made:
         (a)   The use is consistent with the goals and policies of the General
Plan;
         (b)   The use will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or
welfare;
         (c)   The use will meet the purpose of the zoning district;
         (d)   The use is similar to other uses allowed in the zoning district;
         (e)   The density or intensity of the use is similar to other uses in
the zoning district; and
         (f)   The use is compatible with permitted and/or conditionally
permitted uses in the zoning district.
      (3)   When the Director determines that a proposed use is equivalent to a
listed use, the proposed use will be treated in the same manner as the listed
use with respect to development standards, permits required and all applicable
requirements of the Zoning Code.
      (4)   Director determinations will be in writing and maintained by the
Department for public review.
      (5)   The Director may refer any equivalent use determination to the
Planning Commission for review and final decision.
      (6)   Equivalent use determinations may be appealed in accordance with §
155.416 (Appeals and Reviews).
   (C)   Types of uses.
      (1)   Primary land uses.
         (a)   A primary land use is the main purpose for which a site is
developed and occupied, including the activities that are conducted on the site
a majority of the hours during which activities occur.
         (b)   Multiple primary land uses may occupy a single site or building.
A land use on a site with multiple uses is considered a separate primary use if
it operates independently from the other uses (e.g., different owner, business
name, services provided) and could continue operations if the other uses were
no longer present on the site.
         (c)   Each primary land use on a site is subject only to its own
permit requirements identified in the land use regulation tables in the Zoning
District Standards subchapter regardless of the permit requirements that apply
to other uses on the site. For example, if one primary land use that requires a
conditional use permit (CUP) occupies the same space in a building as another
primary land use allowed by-right, the land use allowed by-right is not
required to obtain a CUP.
         (d)   Each primary land use on a site is subject only to the standards
and limitations that apply to the individual use. For example, if one primary
use is subject to conditions of approval limiting its hours of operations,
other primary uses on the site would not be subject to those same limitations
unless specifically required as through their conditions of approval for their
individual permits.
      (2)   Secondary uses.
         (a)   A secondary use is a land use specifically identified in §
155.504 (Land Use Classifications) as allowed only when combined with a
permitted primary use. For example, a drive-through facility is a secondary use
allowed only when combined with a permitted primary use (e.g., restaurants,
cafés and beverage sales). A secondary use by its nature cannot exist without
an associated primary use.
         (b)   A secondary use may require different permits from its
associated primary use as identified in the land use regulation tables in the
Zoning District Standards subchapter. For example, a restaurant may be
permitted by-right, but a drive-through facility associated with the restaurant
would require a conditional use permit. A secondary use may be subject to
standards and limitations separate from the requirements that apply to its
associated primary use.
      (3)   Accessory uses.
         (a)   An accessory use is a use that is subordinate to and dependent
on a primary use on the same lot.
         (b)   Accessory uses are subject to the requirements in §
155.304.020 (Accessory Uses).
         (c)   An accessory use that complies with §
155.304.020 (Accessory Uses) is considered a component of its primary use and
may operate by-right without the requirement to obtain additional permits
unless specifically required by the Zoning Code.

§ 155.108.060 ZONING MAP.
   (A)   Uncertain zoning district boundaries. Where zoning district boundaries
on the Zoning Map are uncertain, the following rules apply.
      (1)   Boundaries shown as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways or alleys are construed to follow the centerline.
      (2)   Boundaries shown as approximately following the coastal zone
boundary are construed to follow the coastal zone boundary.
      (3)   Boundaries shown as approximately following platted lot lines are
construed as following the lot lines. If lot lines shift as a result of updated
survey data or lot line adjustment, zoning district boundaries are construed to
follow these shifted lot lines.
      (4)   Boundaries shown as approximately following city limits are
construed as following city limits.
      (5)   Boundaries shown following railroad lines are construed to be
midway between and parallel to the main tracks.
      (6)   If a boundary does not follow a lot line and divides a parcel, the
location of the boundary is determined using the scale on the Zoning Map.
      (7)   Where further uncertainty exists, the Planning Commission shall
determine the exact boundary location considering the general purpose of the
Zoning Code, the purpose of the applicable zoning districts, site conditions of
the subject property and all other relevant information.
   (B)   Split zoning. For parcels containing two or more zoning districts
(“split zoning”), the regulations for each zoning district will apply within
the zoning district boundaries as identified on the Zoning Map.

   (D)   Lots fronting on two parallel streets.
      (1)   For lots fronting on two parallel streets (“through lots”), the
Director will either:
         (a)    Determine that the lot has two fronts; or
         (b)    Determine which street frontage constitutes the rear of the lot
based on the placement and orientation of existing buildings on the lot and on
neighboring properties.
      (2)   An alley is not considered a street when determining whether a lot
qualifies as a through lot. See Figure 112-3.

§ 155.112.050 FLOOR AREA AND FLOOR AREA RATIO.
   (A)   Floor area.
      (1)   Floor area is measured as the total area (as defined below) of all
floors of a building measured from the exterior face of the outside walls.
      (2)   The floor area calculation includes the following:
         (a)   Covered areas used for vehicle parking, including garages,
carports and parking structures, but excluding tuck-under parking (ground-floor
parking areas that are beneath a building and have three or fewer enclosed
walls);
         (b)   Elevator shafts and stairwells;
         (c)   Porches and balconies enclosed on all sides;
         (d)   Mechanical shafts;
         (e)   Mezzanines;

areas that are located at or near street level and are accessible to the
general public, but are not designed or used as sales, display, storage,
service or production areas.
   (B)   Floor area calculation for junior accessory dwelling unit.
      (1)   Floor area for a junior accessory dwelling unit (JADU) created
within the footprint of an existing residential structure is measured as the
total area of all floors of the JADU measured from the interior face of the
outside walls and the common wall or walls between the JADU and the existing
residential structure.
      (2)   Floor area for new residential construction that includes a junior
accessory dwelling unit is measured as the total area (as defined in §

of the outside walls, and the interior face of a common wall or walls between
the JADU and the proposed residence.
   (C)   Floor area ratio. Floor area ratio (FAR) is calculated by dividing the
total floor area on a lot by the lot area. For example, a 10,000 square-foot
lot containing a 5,000 square-foot building would have a FAR of 0.5 (5,000
divided by 10,000). See Figure 112-4.

(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.112.080 DISTANCES.
   (A)    Measurements are shortest distance. When measuring a required
distance, such as the minimum distance between a structure and a lot line, the
measurement is made at the closest or shortest distance between the two
objects.
   (B)   Distances are measured horizontally. When measuring distances for
setbacks and structure dimensions, all distances are measured along a
horizontal plane from the appropriate line, edge of building, structure,
storage area, parking area or other object. Distances are not measured
following the topography or slope of the land.
   (C)   Measurements involving a structure. Measurements involving a structure
are made to the closest support element of the structure. Structures or
portions of structures that are entirely underground are not included in
measuring required distances.
   (D)   Measurements involving a lot. When measuring a required distance from
a lot, the measurement is made from the portion of the lot that is the closest
distance from the point of measurement.
   (E)   Measuring radius. When a specified land use must be located a minimum
distance from another land use, the minimum distance is measured in a straight
line from all points along the lot line of the subject project, in all
directions.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.112.090 SLOPE.
   (A)   Formula. Average ground slope is calculated using the formula:
                        S =  l x L  (100)
                            A
         where:
         S = Average slope (in percent)
         l = Contour interval (in feet)
         L = Total length of all contour lines on the parcel (in feet)
         A = Lot area (in square feet)

§ 155.204 RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
§ 155.204.010 PURPOSE OF RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   General. The purposes of the residential zoning districts are to:
      (1)   Maintain stable neighborhoods offering a range of housing choices
for residents with varied incomes and lifestyle needs;
      (2)   Provide sufficient land in a range of residential densities to
enable citizens from a wide array of economic levels and stages of life to live
in Eureka and to accommodate the existing and future workforce;
      (3)   Accommodate increased development of high-density housing to
balance Eureka’s housing inventory and enhance affordability;
      (4)   Encourage the construction of new high-density multi-family housing
in zoning districts where multi-family housing is allowed;
      (5)   Promote housing in close proximity to parks, schools and public
services;
      (6)   Promote new development that supports a pedestrian-friendly
environment and allows residents to easily walk, bike and take transit to
destinations;
      (7)   Ensure that development protects and enhances the positive
qualities of existing neighborhoods and strengthens Eureka’s unique sense of
place;
      (8)   Encourage the development of vacant lots and the redevelopment of
underutilized properties;
      (9)   Allow improvements to existing homes consistent with the historic
neighborhood character and the need to produce more housing units;
      (10)   Allow for public and quasi-public uses compatible with a
residential setting; and
      (11)   Allow limited neighborhood-serving commercial uses to enhance
residents’ quality-of-life where allowed by the Neighborhood Market (NMO)
Overlay Zone.
   (B)   Specific.
      (1)   Residential Estate (RE). The RE Zoning District provides areas for
low-density single-family detached homes, accessory dwelling units and limited
agricultural uses with a rural character compatible with adjacent agriculture,
timberland and open space uses. Two attached or detached single-family homes
may be allowed on one lot pursuant to Cal. Government Code § 65852.21.
      (2)   Residential Low (R1). The R1 Zoning District contains neighborhoods
of single-family homes and accessory dwelling units in a moderately low-density
setting, located in proximity to parks, schools and public services. Two
attached or detached single-family homes may be allowed on one lot pursuant to
Cal. Government Code § 65852.21.
      (3)   Residential Medium (R2). The R2 Zoning District accommodates a
variety of medium-density housing types close to commercial (mixed-use) areas.
      (4)   Residential High (R3). The R3 Zoning District accommodates high-
density multi-family housing in an urban setting close to employment centers,
mixed-use zoning districts and/or public transportation.
   (C)   Coastal zoning districts.
      (1)   The following residential zoning districts are located exclusively
in Eureka’s coastal zone:
         (a)   Residential Estate - Coastal (RE-CZ);

§ 155.208 MIXED-USE ZONING DISTRICTS.
§ 155.208.010 PURPOSE OF MIXED-USE ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   General. The purposes of the mixed-use zoning districts are to:
      (1)   Protect, enhance and build upon Eureka’s unique identity, historic
character and sense of community;
      (2)   Promote a compact development pattern with high-intensity activity
centers, infill development, adaptive reuse of existing buildings and
redevelopment of vacant lots and underutilized properties;
      (3)   Encourage a mix of commercial, residential, professional office and
civic land uses;
      (4)   Accommodate a broad range of commercial uses to serve the community
and allow properties to quickly respond to evolving market opportunities over
time;
      (5)   Promote a diversity of multi-family housing choices in higher
density mixed-use settings, especially on upper floors;
      (6)   Provide a pedestrian-friendly environment while accommodating the
needs of automobiles where appropriate;
      (7)   Promote transportation alternatives, reduce the reliance on
automobiles and increase opportunities to walk, bike or take transit to
destinations;
      (8)   Foster a diverse and resilient local economy, friendly to new
business investment and the creation and retention of quality jobs;
      (9)   Encourage growth in the city’s tax base to support city services
and infrastructure; and
      (10)   Provide attractive and well-designed streetscapes, buildings,
parking and public spaces.
   (B)   Specific.
      (1)   Downtown (DT). The DT Zoning District maintains, promotes, enhances
and builds upon Eureka’s Downtown as a vibrant center for residents,
businesses, the arts, local/regional visitors and out-of-town tourists.
Vertical mixed-use development with a diversity of uses promote daytime and
evening activity, including residential, cultural, lodging, civic, professional
office, entertainment, retail and other customer-serving and employment-
intensive uses. Multi-story buildings built to lot lines fully utilize
available land and support a high-intensity economic and cultural center for
the surrounding region. Existing buildings are fully utilized with uses that
serve residents, employees, visitors and the broader region. A diversity of
building types and architectural styles, many with active ground-floor uses,
support a vibrant pedestrian environment and active and inviting public spaces.
      (2)   Downtown West (DW). The DW Zoning District is an extension of the
Downtown (DT) Zoning District with a broader range of allowed land uses to
further encourage investment and development and to provide a transition zone
from Broadway to Downtown.
      (3)   Service Commercial (SC). The SC Zoning District is an intensive
commercial district primarily located in or adjacent to highly visible areas,
and provides for local, regional and visitor needs. Development accommodates
vehicles in a manner that supports an attractive streetscape and pedestrian-
friendly environment. The SC Zoning District allows a broad variety and scale
of retail, office, restaurants, lodging, entertainment, outdoor sales, large
product retail sales, storage, warehousing, wholesale and limited residential
uses.
      (4)   Henderson Center (HC). The HC Zoning District is a pedestrian-
oriented limited-scale neighborhood shopping district primarily serving
residents in nearby neighborhoods. Pedestrian-scale buildings with active
street-facing storefronts close to the sidewalk create an active and inviting
public realm. Single-family residential homes converted to retail and office
uses retain their residential character and buffer nearby residences from
higher intensity uses.
      (5)   Neighborhood Commercial (NC). The NC Zoning District provides
places for limited-scale convenience retail, restaurants, offices, professional
services and other customer-serving uses to meet the daily needs of nearby
residents, workers and visitors. The form and intensity of development supports
an active pedestrian environment and is compatible with neighboring residential
properties. Limited residential mixed-use development contributes to
neighborhood vitality and safe and attractive streetscapes.
      (6)   Wabash Avenue (WA). The WA Zoning District provides an area for
limited-scale commercial uses to serve the community in the western half of
Eureka. Over time, existing properties will be modified and redeveloped to
create a more robust neighborhood-oriented and pedestrian-friendly shopping and
professional service-related corridor.
      (7)   Office Residential (OR). The OR Zoning District provides areas for
customer-serving and non-customer-serving professional offices, clinics and
related retail and services, as well as residential uses. The OR District
allows a mix of single-family and multi-family housing, offices, converted
residential buildings and lodging where the intent is to generally retain the
character, scale and form of the residential neighborhood. The OR Zoning
District provides a mix of office and residential uses in an environment with a
different character and lower intensity than the other mixed-use commercial
districts of the city.
      (8)   Hospital Medical (HM). The HM Zoning District provides a
centralized and consolidated regional hub for hospitals, medical offices and
clinics, other health care-related uses and restricted commercial development
that supports these uses.
   (C)   Coastal zoning districts.
      (1)   The following mixed-use zoning districts are located exclusively in
Eureka’s coastal zone:
         (a)   Old Town - Coastal (OT-CZ);
         (b)   Bayfront Commercial - Coastal (BC-CZ);
         (c)   Library District - Coastal (LD-CZ);
         (d)   Marina District - Coastal (MD-CZ);
         (e)   Service Commercial - Coastal (SC-CZ);
         (f)   Gateway North - Coastal (GN-CZ); and
         (g)   Bridge District - Coastal (BD-CZ).
      (2)   Purpose statements, allowed land uses and development standards for
coastal zoning districts are found in Municipal Code
Ch. 156 (Coastal Zoning).

NOTES TO TABLE:
[1] While there is no maximum residential density in the mixed-use zoning districts, the number of
residential units on a lot will be limited by the maximum FAR, maximum building height, required parking,
minimum unit size requirements in the building code and other applicable development standards.
[2] Maximum hospital height: 100 feet.
[3] Only applies to new construction or an increase in footprint of an existing structure for an
accessory dwelling unit.
[4] Maximum 16 feet as measured according to § 155.112.070 (Height), or height of existing or proposed
single- or multi-family residential structure, whichever is higher.
[5] Four feet, or setback of existing residential structure, whichever is less, provided the setbacks as
proposed are sufficient for fire and safety as determined by the Building Official and pursuant to the
California Building or Residential Code.
 
   (B)   Maximum front setbacks. The following applies to new buildings in
zoning districts with a maximum front setback requirement as shown in Table
208-2.
      (1)   Buildings shall be constructed at or within the required maximum
front setback for a minimum of 50% of the lot’s linear street frontage. See
Figure 208-1.
      (2)   The Director may modify or waive this requirement with an
administrative adjustment. To approve the administrative adjustment, the
Director must make the findings in §
155.412.030(F) (Findings for Approval) and the following additional findings:
         (a)   Unique physical conditions on the site require the modified
standard to accommodate a development project consistent with the purpose of
the applicable zoning district; and
         (b)   The project incorporates a front-facing courtyard or privately-
owned public space between the front building wall and front lot line to
provide a pedestrian-oriented environment. See Figure 208-2.

§ 155.208.040 PEDESTRIAN-FOCUSED FRONTAGES.
   (A)   Purpose and applicability. Figure 208-4 shows the location of
pedestrian-focused frontages outside of the coastal zone. The façades of
buildings facing these street frontages are subject to special land use
regulations and development standards to maintain and enhance an active and
engaging pedestrian environment. These standards do not apply to façades that
do not front the street (e.g., multi-story building façades that can be seen
over shorter buildings).
   (B)   Design review required. Any exterior modification to a building façade
that faces a pedestrian-focused frontage requires design review in accordance
with §
155.412.040 (Design Review), unless the Director determines the modification is
so minor in nature that it would not be noticeable by a pedestrian, and the
modification does not result in a decrease in ground-floor storefront
transparency. "Exterior modification" includes the addition of a new sign, but
does not include refacing of an existing sign when there is no change in the
size of the sign, and does not include a new, or refacing of an existing sign
painted directly on the façade. Design review is not required for signs allowed
without permits listed under §
155.340.030.
   (C)   Ground floor ceiling height. A new building with non-residential
ground-floor uses facing the street must provide a minimum floor to ceiling
height of 12 feet on the ground floor.
   (D)   Ground floor residential use limitations.
      (1)   New residential development with less than 66 dwelling units per
acre must be part of a mixed-use project where the residential use is located
above or behind a ground-floor non-residential use facing the street. For
example, on a 6,000 square foot lot, a new residential development with less
than nine units cannot have ground-floor street-facing residential units.
      (2)   For projects with 66 dwelling units per acre or more, ground-floor
residential uses facing the street are permitted. For example, on a 6,000
square foot lot, a new residential development with nine or more units may have
street-facing residential units.
      (3)   For shared living quarters without separate kitchen or bathroom
facilities for each room or unit (e.g., micro/shared housing, non-medical care
housing, or emergency shelters), ground-floor residential uses facing the
street are permitted if the project serves 99 persons or more per acre.
      (4)   When allowed, ground-floor residential uses facing the street are
not subject to the transparency requirement in §
155.208.040(E) (Ground Floor Storefront Transparency).

IMAGES/0-0-0-8821.png]
 
   (E)   Ground floor storefront transparency. Non-residential ground-floor
uses facing the street shall comply with the following transparency
requirement.
      (1)   The ground-floor street-facing building walls of non-residential
uses must provide transparent windows or doors with views into the building for
a minimum of 65% of the building frontage located between three and seven feet
above the sidewalk. See
Figure 208-5.
      (2)   Window and door area must be transparent to allow views into the
building, but may be translucent for privacy purposes, provided that the
windows can be returned to a transparent state.

      (3)   The Director, or Design Review Committee when design review is
required pursuant to §
155.412.040 (Design Review), may allow exceptions to this transparency
requirement with an administrative adjustment. To approve the administrative
adjustment, the Director or Design Review Committee must make the findings in §
155.412.030(F) (Findings for Approval) and the following additional findings:
         (a)   The proposed use has unique operational characteristics that
preclude building openings, such as for a cinema or theater; and
         (b)   Street-facing building walls will exhibit architectural relief
and detail, and will be enhanced with landscaping in such a way as to create
visual interest at the pedestrian level.

§ 155.212 INDUSTRIAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
§ 155.212.010 PURPOSE OF INDUSTRIAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   General. The purposes of the industrial zoning districts are to:
      (1)   Provide land for a broad range of viable industrial, manufacturing
and assembly uses to attract new industries and retain and expand existing
uses;
      (2)   Protect industrially-designated lands from encroachment by
incompatible uses and activities that could conflict with or limit industrial
activities;
      (3)   Accommodate non-conforming industrial uses relocated from other
locations;
      (4)   Encourage the new use and redevelopment of properties that have
been previously used for industrial purposes;
      (5)   Strengthen Eureka’s role as a regional manufacturing and industrial
center;
      (6)   Foster a diverse and resilient local economy, friendly to new
business investment and the creation and retention of quality jobs; and
      (7)   Provide locations for non-coastal related industrial uses outside
of the coastal zone, with access to necessary transportation routes and
infrastructure.
   (B)   Specific.
      (1)   Hinge (HN) Industrial Zoning District. The HN Zoning District
provides an area for low-intensity manufacturing and very limited commercial
uses close to Eureka’s historic Core Area. The primary purpose of the HN Zoning
District is to provide a location for manufacturing uses. The HN Zoning
District secondarily allows upper-floor residential and office uses to increase
housing opportunities and support a dynamic employment area that can evolve and
adapt over time.
      (2)   Light Industrial (LI) Zoning District. The LI Zoning District
provides an area for lower-intensity manufacturing, assembly, wholesaling,
service commercial and other employment-generating uses. The LI Zoning District
accommodates industrial and heavy commercial uses in proximity to residential,
retail and commercial service uses without adverse impacts to these uses.
Existing office uses are permitted.
      (3)   Heavy Industrial (HI) Zoning District. The HI Zoning District
provides an area for intensive manufacturing, assembly, packaging, processing,
wholesaling, warehousing, distribution, research and development and other
employment-generating uses. The HI Zoning District locates industrial uses away
from residential, commercial and visitor serving uses due to the potential for
loud noise, noxious odors and emissions, vibrations and high volumes of truck
traffic.
      (4)   Coastal zoning districts.
         (a)   The following industrial zoning districts are located
exclusively in Eureka’s coastal zone:
            1.   Hinge Industrial - Coastal (HN-CZ);
            2.   Light Industrial - Coastal (LI-CZ);
            3.   Heavy Industrial - Coastal (HI-CZ); and
            4.   Coastal Dependent Industrial (CDI-CZ).
         (b)   Purpose statements, allowed land uses and development standards
for coastal zoning districts are found in Municipal Code Ch. 156 (Coastal
Zoning).

§ 155.212.030 RESIDENTIAL AND OFFICE USES IN INDUSTRIAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Purpose. This section establishes standards for new residential and
office uses in the Hinge (HN) Zoning District to:
      (1)   Protect existing and new manufacturing uses in the industrial
zoning districts;
      (2)   Ensure that manufacturing uses are recognized as the primary
purpose of the industrial zoning districts; and
      (3)   Ensure that residential and office uses can functionally co-exist
in a mixed-use development in the industrial zoning districts.
   (B)   Where allowed. Residential and office uses are allowed in the
industrial zoning districts only as provided in Table 212-1.
   (C)   Nuisance protection for non-residential uses.
      (1)   If a residential or office use (excluding caretaker units) is
established in Hinge (HN) Zoning District, existing non-residential uses in the
HN Zoning District are considered a protected use.
      (2)   A protected use may not be considered a nuisance pursuant to the
Municipal Code if:
         (a)   The use was not a nuisance when it began;
         (b)   The use is conducted and/or maintained in a manner consistent
with proper and accepted customs and standards, as established and followed by
similar uses in Eureka;
         (c)   The use is consistent with the purposes of the applicable zoning
district as described in §
155.212.010 (Purpose of Industrial Zoning Districts); and
         (d)   The use complies with the requirements of all applicable
federal, state and city statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, approvals and
permits.
      (3)   The nuisance protections in this division (C) do not apply where a
nuisance results from the negligent or improper management or operation of a
protected use.
   (D)   Standards for residential and office uses in mixed-use projects. The
following standards apply to new residential and office uses proposed as part
of a mixed-use development project in the Hinge (HN) Zoning District.
      (1)   General standard. The city may approve a new residential or office
use only upon finding that the new use will not interfere with existing or
anticipated future industrial operations within an industrial zoning district.
      (2)   Noise. Proposed new residential and office development must prepare
an assessment of existing and anticipated future noise at the site and
incorporate construction measures as needed to meet the interior noise levels
described in Table N-2 of the Noise Element of the General Plan.
      (3)   Vibration. Proposed new residential and office development must
prepare an assessment of existing and anticipated future vibration on the site
and incorporate construction measures as needed to reduce the effects of
vibration to acceptable levels for the proposed new land use.
      (4)   Odors, dust and fumes. Proposed new residential and office
development must prepare an assessment of existing and anticipated odor/dust/
fumes at the site and incorporate construction measures as needed to reduce the
effects of odor/dust/fumes to acceptable levels for the proposed new land use.

protect agricultural lands, open space and natural habitats with important
economic, cultural and environmental value to Eureka and the broader region.
   (B)   Specific.
      (1)   Agricultural (A). The purpose of the A Zoning District is to
protect and conserve agricultural lands and to support agricultural activities
as an important contributor to the local and regional economy. The A Zoning
District allows the production of crops, livestock grazing, animal and poultry
raising, apiaries, dairies, stables and associated residences and farmworker
housing. The A Zoning District is intended to protect land, including farmed or
grazed wetlands, that is primarily suitable for long-term agricultural and
wildlife habitat uses and to ensure adequate separation from adjacent
development.

protect and restore land-based habitats and natural resources in Eureka. The NR
Zoning District protects land that is primarily suitable for permanent habitat
preservation, compatible resource-related uses, nature study and natural
resource-related recreation. Public access, passive recreation, active
recreation and visitor-related facilities are allowed to the extent such
activities do not negatively impact or degrade natural resources. The NR Zoning
District aims to protect surface water resources, riparian habits, ground water
and water quality, sensitive biological resources and open space.

§ 155.224 OVERLAY ZONES.
§ 155.224.010 PURPOSE OF OVERLAY ZONES.
   (A)   General. An overlay zone is a defined geographic area shown on the
Zoning Map where special requirements or limitations apply, in addition to the
underlying base zoning district requirements.
   (B)   Conflicting requirements. Whenever a requirement of an overlay zone
conflicts with a requirement of the underlying base zoning district, the
overlay zone requirement controls.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.224.020 QUALIFIED OVERLAY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the Qualified (QO) Overlay Zone is to limit
the land uses allowed in a zoning district when applied to a specific property.
The QO Overlay Zone is intended for unique circumstances where use limitations
are necessary to reduce impacts and promote compatibility between neighboring
properties.
   (B)   Allowed restrictions. When the QO overlay is applied to a property,
the ordinance establishing the overlay may:
      (1)   Prohibit land uses that are otherwise allowed in the applicable
base zoning district;
      (2)   Impose more stringent development standards on allowed use; and/or
      (3)   Require a use permit for allowed land uses that are otherwise
permitted by-right.
   (C)   Limitations; general plan compliance. Land use and development
restrictions established by the QO Overlay Zone must be consistent with the
General Plan. For example, the QO Overlay Zone may not prohibit multi-family
dwellings on a site where multi-family housing is expressly allowed by the
applicable General Plan land use designation.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.224.030 NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET OVERLAY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the Neighborhood Market (Nmo) Overlay Zone is

      (1)   Protect the historic character and unique identity of Eureka’s
neighborhoods;
      (2)   Increase opportunities for social interaction and community-
building in neighborhoods;
      (3)   Promote economic vitality by expanding opportunities for locally-
owned businesses;
      (4)   Promote public safety by increasing pedestrian activity in
residential neighborhoods;
      (5)   Increase opportunities for residents of all ages and abilities to
easily access stores and services;
      (6)   Reduce vehicle trips and decrease traffic congestion by increasing
opportunities for residents to walk to destinations; and

155.424.030 (Non-conforming Site Features).
   (C)   Where allowed. Outdoor storage is allowed as a primary use only in
zoning districts identified in the allowed use tables in the Zoning District
Standards subchapter. Outdoor storage is also allowed as an accessory use for
the storage of goods associated with a primary non-residential use in
accordance with §
155.304.020 (Accessory Uses).
   (D)   Screening.
      (1)   Outdoor storage areas must be screened with a minimum six-foot high
solid fence or wall so as not to be visible from any:
         (a)   Public street or highway; or
         (b)   Residential zoning district or use.
      (2)   Screening fences and walls may not exceed the maximum allowed
height identified in Table 320-1 of §
155.320 (Fences and Walls) and may not use prohibited fence materials
identified in Table 320-2.
   (E)   Surfacing.
      (1)    Outdoor storage areas must be surfaced with an all-weather
material (such as asphalt, concrete or comparable surfacing material approved
by the Public Works Director) and graded to provide adequate storm water
drainage.
      (2)   Outdoor storage areas may be surfaced with partially permeable
materials if adequate drainage, erosion and dust control are provided. Unpaved
outdoor storage areas are not subject to the parking lot landscaping
requirements contained in §
155.324.080 (Parking Lot Landscaping).
      (3)   Outdoor storage of hazardous materials requires a roof or awning
over the materials and either a dead-end sump to contain spills or containment
in the form of berms, dikes or curbs. All hazardous materials regulated by the
California Department of Toxic Substances Control must be placed on a surface
as deemed appropriate by the permitting agency. In addition, the surface must
conform to all applicable federal and state air and water quality standards.
   (F)   Shipping containers in industrial zoning districts. Metal shipping
containers (e.g., CONEX boxes) qualify as outdoor storage and are permitted in
all industrial zoning districts. Shipping containers are subject to all of the
outdoor storage standards provided in this subsection.
   (G)   Standards for shipping containers.
      (1)   A metal shipping container must be located at least five feet from
a property line, and shipping containers that are accessory to the main
occupancy use, and are located less than ten feet from the primary structure,
are limited to no more than 10% of the floor area of the primary structure.
      (2)   The size of a shipping container shall not exceed 45 feet in
length, ten feet in height, and the storage area shall not exceed 400 square
feet.
      (3)   When a metal shipping container is located within ten feet of a
property line adjoining an alley, the side of the container parallel to the
alley may not be longer than one-half the length of the alley frontage. For
example, when a shipping container is placed within ten feet of a property line
adjoining an alley on a 50-foot-wide parcel, the side of the shipping container
parallel to the alley may not be more than 25 feet long, or ½ the width of the
alley frontage. See Figure 304-1

IMAGES/0-0-0-8695.jpg]
 
      (4)   When a permanent structure and a proposed metal shipping container
are located within ten feet of a property line adjoining an alley, the side of
the container parallel to the alley may not be longer than one-half the length
of the open alley frontage. Open alley frontage is that portion of the alley
frontage where no permanent structure is located on the site within ten feet of
the property line adjoining the alley. For example, on a 50-foot-wide parcel,
if a 28-foot-wide structure already exists within ten feet of the property line
adjoining an alley, and the metal shipping container is proposed within ten
feet of the alley property, the side of the shipping container parallel to the
alley may not be more than 11 feet long, or ½ the width of the open alley
frontage (50 - 28 = 22/2 = 11 ft). See Figure 304-2

IMAGES/0-0-0-8697.jpg]
 
      (5)   When a proposed metal shipping container is located ten or more
feet from a property line adjoining an alley, the width of the side of the
container facing the alley is limited only by Building and Fire Code standards.
See Figure 304-3

      (6)   When a shipping container is used for the storage of hazardous
materials, quantities of hazardous materials may not exceed those listed in
California Building Code Table 307.1(1), or Table 307.1(2), and must be stored
in compliance with the California Building and Fire Codes.
      (7)   Installation of a metal shipping container may require a Building
Permit as required by the California Building Code.
   (H)   Shipping containers in the SC zoning district. Metal shipping
containers (e.g., CONEX boxes) qualify as outdoor storage and are permitted in
the SC zoning district. Shipping containers are subject to all of the outdoor
storage standards provided in this subsection.
      (1)   Metal shipping containers in the SC zoning district must:
         (a)   Be located behind the primary structure when space permits.
Where it is physically impossible to locate the shipping container behind the
primary structure, the container must be located as close to the rear of the
site as possible. A metal shipping container may not be located within the area
between the front or exterior side property line and the plane of the primary
structure wall.
         (b)   Painted to match or complement the existing primary structure on
the site and must be maintained in good condition and avoid conditions that
contribute to blight, including but not limited to, rust, peeling paint, and
other visible forms of deterioration. Inclusion or installation of public art
on the shipping container is permissible and is not required to match or
complement the existing primary structure.
         (c)   Be located on the ground, and may not be stacked on top of
another shipping container.
      (2)   Section
155.304.110(H) (Shipping Containers in the SC zoning district) is effective
only until October 1, 2031, at which time it will expire and be of no further
effect. Shipping containers existing in the SC zoning district as of the
expiration of this section must either be removed from the site on or before
October 31, 2031, or will continue as a non-conforming use and structure, and
will be subject to the requirements in §
155.424 (Nonconformities).

§ 155.304.140 TREE REMOVAL.
   (A)   Purpose. This division establishes permit requirements to remove
trees. Much of Eureka is forested with stands of redwoods and other trees that
are a distinctive part of the city's history and character, and every effort
should be made to preserve and protect these trees, while protecting the
public's safety and supporting development. When trees pose a hazard or are
located in areas of planned growth, they may need to be removed. These
regulations are intended to:
      (1)   Protect and preserve trees that are important to the character of
the city and its neighborhoods;
      (2)   Protect the public's safety by allowing hazardous tree removal; and
      (3)   Allow for tree removal, or tree mass reduction, as necessary to
allow for residential developments and supporting solar arrays.
   (B)   Tree permit exemptions.
      (1)   By-right tree removals.  
         (a)   Removal, relocation, topping, or any other act that causes the
destruction of a tree or trees not defined as a protected tree in §
155.304.140(D) does not require a tree permit or conditional use permit.
         (b)   The removal, relocation, or any other act that causes the
destruction of any protected tree or trees defined in §
155.304.140(F) from within 15 feet of the footprint of a proposed structure,
and within the boundary of the associated access road, provided the trees are
identified on the project's site plan, is allowed by-right with a zoning
clearance.
      (2)   Hazardous trees.
         (a)   Emergencies. The removal, relocation, topping, or crown
reduction by more than 20% of a hazardous protected tree or trees that would
otherwise require a tree permit is exempt from the provisions of this
subsection only in case of an emergency, where a member of a law enforcement
agency, the Humboldt Bay Fire District, the Public Works Director, or the
Director, based on a report from an arborist or Registered Professional
Forester (RPF), determines a tree is hazardous and presents an immediate danger
of collapse and poses an imminent threat to the public safety or general
welfare. A zoning clearance is required.
         (b)   Reduction of tree mass. When recommended in a report prepared by
an arborist or a RPF, a hazardous protected tree or trees may have its mass
reduced to protect property values and to address safety concerns and does not
require a tree permit. A zoning clearance is required.
         (c)   Dead/Dying trees. The removal of a hazardous protected tree or
trees that would otherwise require a tree permit is exempt from the provisions
of this subsection when a report prepared by an arborist or a RPF determines
the tree is dead, or dying with no hope of recovery, and is a danger to public
safety, general welfare, and/or the health of adjacent trees. A zoning
clearance is required.
      (3)   Solar access. When verified in a report prepared by an arborist or
a RPF, a protected tree or trees that hinder direct sunlight for solar energy
systems may have their mass reduced to provide solar access. A zoning clearance
is required.
   (C)   Tree permit required. A tree permit is required to relocate, remove,
cut down, top, reduce the crown by more than 20%, or undertake any other act
that causes the destruction of a protected tree identified in § 155.304.140(D),
except as provided in division (B) (Tree Permit Exemptions) of this subsection.
Hazardous trees or trees removed for solar access are not counted in the number
of trees removed per division (E) of this subsection.
   (D)   Protected trees. A protected tree includes any of the following:
      (1)   A tree species listed in §
155.304.140(D)(2) with a 24-inch diameter, or a circumference of 75 inches, as

relocated, removed, topped, or crowned by more than 20% every ten years with
the issuance of a tree permit except as allowed by division (B) (Tree Permit
Exemptions) of this subsection.
   (F)   Conditional use permit required. The relocation, removal, topping, or
crowning by more than 20%, of more than five protected tree species within a
ten-year period is considered a timber harvest and requires Planning Commission
approval of a conditional use permit.
   (G)   Review authority.
      (1)   Tree permits. The Director reviews and takes action on tree permit
applications.
      (2)   Conditional use permits. The Planning Commission reviews and takes
action on conditional use permit applications.
   (H)   Findings for approval. To approve a tree permit or a conditional use
permit for tree removal, the review authority must make all the following
findings:
      (1)   Approval of the tree permit will not be detrimental to the public
health, safety or welfare, and approval of the tree permit is consistent with
the General Plan, Zoning Code, and any applicable specific plan or area plan
adopted by the City Council.
      (2)   Measures have been incorporated, if necessary, into the project or
permit to mitigate impacts to remaining trees or to replace the trees removed
in compliance with this division.
      (3)   The removal of a healthy tree cannot be avoided by redesign of the
site plan prior to construction or trimming, thinning, tree surgery, or other
reasonable treatment, as determined by the Director.
      (4)   Adequate provisions for drainage, erosion control, land stability,
windscreen, and buffers along any road and between neighbors have been made
where these problems are anticipated as a result of the removal.
      (5)   Tree(s) to be removed between February 1 and August 15 of each year
have been surveyed by a qualified professional, and a report has been provided
to the city indicating removal of the trees will not impact active nesting or
roosting sites of a listed bird species or bird species of special concern.
   (I)   Conditions of approval. Approval of a tree permit or a conditional use
permit for tree removal must include conditions of approval as necessary to
ensure compliance with this division and all other applicable provisions of the
zoning code. Conditions of approval may include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Requiring removal of invasive or noxious vegetation (e.g. English
ivy) from other trees on the applicant's property;
      (2)   Allowing for the removal of non-native trees adjacent to natural
areas if replaced with an appropriate native tree;
      (3)   Requiring tree replacement(s) for any tree(s) removed through a
tree permit; and
      (4)   Weekday hours of operation.
   (J)   Timing of removal of large-stature trees. A tree with a height of 150
feet or more may require evaluation to determine if active nesting or roosting
sites for listed bird species, or bird species of special concern are occurring
within the subject or immediately adjacent tree(s) if the projected tree
removal dates are between February 1 and August 15 of each year. If such active
nesting or roosting activities are occurring during the projected tree removal
dates, the review authority can deny the request or require further
environmental review.
   (K)   Other approvals. An encroachment permit approved by the Public Works
Department, and approval from CalFire or other state agencies may be required
to remove any tree, including by-right, protected, hazardous, and/or solar
access trees.

   (J)   Rigid window coverings.
      (1)   At least 50% of all windows on the street-facing building wall have
rigid window coverings, such as rigid awnings, shade devices, above-window
cornices or crowns, projecting arches or other window coverings of equivalent
quality. Flexible materials such as fabric and vinyl do not satisfy this
requirement.
      (2)   The rule to measure this architectural feature is provided in
division (B)(1) above.
   (K)   Masonry facade.
      (1)   At least 40% of the street-facing building wall surface area is
covered in masonry such as brick, stone, terrazzo, ceramic tile, or comparable
material. Exposed cinder block does not satisfy this requirement.
      (2)   The rule to measure this architectural feature is provided in
division (B)(1) above.
   (L)   Wood facade.
      (1)   At least 40% of the street-facing building wall surface area is
covered in high-grade wood that is finished with a clear sealer or semi-
transparent stain. Wood may not be painted or finished with an opaque stain.
Faux wood products made from synthetic materials, including vinyl, cellular PVC
and fiber cement do not satisfy this requirement.
      (2)   The rule to measure this architectural feature is provided in
division (B)(1) above.
   (M)   Glass facade.
      (1)   At least 40% of the street-facing building wall surface area is
covered in glass, including window glass.
      (2)   The rule to measure this architectural feature is provided in
division (B)(1) above.
   (N)   Cladding materials facade.
      (1)   At least 40% of the street-facing building wall surface area is

material.
      (2)   The rule to measure this architectural feature is provided in
division (B)(1) above.
   (O)   Living wall.
      (1)   At least 20% of the street-facing building wall surface area is
covered in a directly integrated living wall or building integrated vegetation.
Plans submitted for living walls and building integrated vegetation must
include a long-term maintenance plan that includes documentable evidence of on-
going maintenance and operation strategies to ensure the long-term viability of
the wall. Living walls and building integrated vegetation must include an
integrated water delivery system.
      (2)   The rule to measure this architectural feature is provided in
division (B)(1) above.
   (P)   Combination of materials facade.
      (1)   At least 40% of the street-facing building wall surface area is
covered in a combination of two or more of the following materials: masonry;
stone; high-grade wood; glass; metal/ceramic cladding; or living wall.
Materials used to satisfy this requirement must comply with requirements in
divisions (J) through (N) above (excluding wall area percentage requirements in
these paragraphs).
      (2)   The combination of materials facade option may not be double-
counted with any of the other façade materials options (i.e. masonry facade,
glass facade, cladding facade or living wall) to satisfy the architectural
features requirement. For example, a building wall that is 40% masonry and 10%
wood siding can qualify for combination of materials facade, but cannot
simultaneously qualify for masonry facade. However, a wall that is 20% masonry,
20% living wall and 40% glass may satisfy two architectural features
requirements, with the masonry and living wall satisfying the combination of
materials option and the glass satisfying the glass facade option.
      (3)   The rule to measure this architectural feature is provided in
division (B)(1) above.
   (Q)   Rules for measurement of architectural features. The architectural
features in division (A) above (Options for Architectural Features) are
measured as follows.
      (1)   Percent of linear frontage.
         (a)   Percent of linear frontage is used to measure roof form
variation, roof detail and ornamentation, horizontal articulation, cantilevered
upper story and balconies.
         (b)   Percent of linear frontage is calculated by measuring the total
horizontal length of the frontage of a building’s street-facing wall relative
to the total horizontal length of the architectural feature to be evaluated.
For example, a three-story building with a street-facing wall that is 100 feet
long has a total horizontal length of 100 feet. If that building has a
cantilevered section on the second floor that has a 25-foot horizontal length,
then the cantilevered section constitutes 25% of the street-facing wall’s
linear frontage (25 divided by 100). In this case, the building meets the
criteria for cantilevered upper story. Alternatively, if a two-story building
with a 50-foot total horizontal length had two separate 20-foot long balconies
on the second floor, then 80% of the street-facing wall’s linear frontage
contains balconies (40 divided by 50). In this case, the building exceeds the
criteria for balconies.
      (2)   Percent of all windows.
         (a)   Percent of all windows is used to measure projecting windows,
recessed or protruding windows, window trim and rigid window coverings.
         (b)   Percent of all windows is calculated by counting the total
number of windows on the building’s street-facing wall and then dividing that
number into the architectural feature to be evaluated. For example, a building
wall that contains 100 windows, 75 of which are recessed from the building
wall, has 75% recessed windows. In this case, the building meets the criteria
for recessed windows.
      (3)   Percent of street-facing building wall surface area.
         (a)   Percent of street-facing building wall surface area is used to
measure masonry facade, wood facade, living wall, glass facade, cladding
materials facade and combination of materials facade.
         (b)    Percent of street-facing building wall surface area is the
total area of the building’s street-facing wall relative to the total surface
area of the architectural feature to be evaluated. The building wall area
measurement includes doors, windows and other openings within the wall area.
For example, a building wall that is 100 feet long and 30 feet high has a total
surface area of 3,000 square feet (including the wall’s windows and doors). If
that same wall includes a section of exposed brick that is 50 feet long and 30
feet high, then 50% of the total wall surface area has a masonry facade. The
50% calculation may include windows and doors inset into brick wall material.
In this example, the building meets the criteria for masonry facade. A street-
facing building wall that is at least 80% glass may double-qualify as
satisfying two architectural features. No other materials (such as masonry,
green wall or cladding) may double-qualify as satisfying two architectural
features.

NOTES TO TABLE:
[1] See §
155.504 (Land Use Classifications) for specific land uses included in category.
 
   (B)   Required electric vehicle spaces. See §
155.324.050(C) (Electric Vehicle Charging).
   (C)   Required bicycle parking spaces. See §
155.324.070 (Bicycle Parking).
   (D)   Calculation of required spaces.
      (1)   Floor area. Where a parking requirement is a ratio of parking
spaces to floor area, the floor area is assumed to be gross floor area, unless
otherwise stated. The floor area of a use is calculated as described in §
155.112.050 (Floor Area and Floor Area Ratio).
      (2)   Employees. Where a parking requirement is stated as a ratio of
parking spaces to employees, the number of employees is based on the largest
shift that occurs in a typical week.
      (3)   Seats. Where a parking requirement is stated as a ratio of parking
spaces to seats, each 24 inches of bench-type seating is counted as one seat.
      (4)   Fractional spaces. In determining the number of required parking,
fractions of spaces over one-half will be rounded down to the next whole
number.
   (E)   Unlisted uses. The parking requirement for land uses not listed in
Table 324-1 is determined by the Director based on the requirement for the most
comparable similar use, the particular characteristics of the proposed use and
any other relevant data regarding parking demand.
   (F)   Sites with multiple uses. Where more than one land use is conducted on
a site, the minimum number of required on-site parking spaces is the sum of the
number of parking spaces required for each individual use unless on-site shared
parking is allowed in accordance with §
155.324.040(D) (On-site Shared Parking).

§ 155.324.040 REDUCTIONS AND ALTERNATIVES TO AUTOMOBILE PARKING.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   This section identifies allowed reductions and alternatives to on-
site automobile parking spaces required by §
155.324.030  (Number of On-Site Parking Spaces Required).
      (2)   These reductions are allowed either by-right or require approval of
an administrative adjustment. If the reduction is requested as part of a
project subject to discretionary approval, the request is considered by the
review authority as part of the overall project.
   (B)   Calculation of parking reductions.
      (1)   Available reductions apply only to non-exempt parking spaces as
specified in §
155.324.020 (Applicability).
      (2)   Available reductions are additive (i.e., multiple reductions may be
combined for a single project). Each allowed reduction is calculated using the
number of parking spaces required before any other reduction is applied. For
example, parking for a development requiring 20 parking spaces that qualifies
for a 10% transit proximity reduction (division (C)(1) above) and a 25% low
demand reduction would be reduced by 35% (seven spaces).
   (C)   Available reductions. The following allow for the reduction of
required on-site parking spaces:
      (1)   Transit proximity. For projects in proximity to an active public
transit bus stop, required on-site parking may be reduced as shown in
Table 324-2. Public transit bus stops exclude school bus stops.
 
Table 324-2: Transit Proximity Parking Reduction
Proximity to Bus Stop Allowed Parking Reduction
600 feet              30%
900 feet              20%
1,200 feet            10%
 
      (2)   Bus pass.
         (a)   On-site parking is not required for a multi-family rental unit
within 900 feet of a public transit stop if the lease agreement includes a
complementary bus pass for use by the resident, paid for by the property owner
during the entire duration of the rental.
         (b)   The Department will authorize this reduction only after the
property owner or the property owner's authorized representative has submitted
to the Department a signed agreement in a form approved by the City Attorney
guaranteeing that the complementary bus pass will be provided as required for
the parking reductions.
      (3)   Bicycle facility proximity. Required on-site parking may be reduced
by up to 30% for projects located within 300 feet of an existing designated
Class I or Class II bicycle facility as shown in General Plan Figure M-2.
      (4)   Carpool spaces. For non-residential uses, two automobile parking
spaces may be exchanged for one carpool parking space. The carpool parking
space must be designated as such with signage and/or space markings.
      (5)   Electric vehicle charging stations. Two required parking spaces may
be exchanged for one space served by an electric vehicle charging station. To
receive reduction, electric vehicle charging stations must be in excess of the
minimum number of charging stations required by §
155.324.050(C) (Electric Vehicle Charging).
      (6)   Loss of on-street parking. If providing new on-site parking
requires a new curb cut through an existing sidewalk and thereby eliminates an
on-street parking space, the on-site parking is required only if the new on-
site parking provides at least two more spaces than the number of lost on-
street spaces. For example, if a new parking lot eliminates one on-street
parallel parking space, new off-street parking is required only if it contains
at least three spaces.
      (7)   Required disabled and electric vehicle spaces. Replacement parking
spaces are not required if retrofitting a required accessible parking space or
installing a required electric vehicle charging station eliminates one or more
required parking spaces (e.g., to accommodate accessible loading area).
      (8)   Bicycle and motorcycle spaces.
         (a)   Bicycle or motorcycle parking may replace up to two required
automobile spaces or 10% of the required number of on-site automobile parking
spaces, whichever is less.
         (b)   Each automobile parking space must be replaced by space for at
least six bicycles or four motorcycles. Bicycle parking spaces must comply with
development standards in §
155.324.070 (Bicycle Parking).
         (c)   Bicycle spaces replacing an automobile space must be in addition
to the minimum bicycle parking spaces required by §
155.324.070 (Bicycle Parking).
      (9)   In-lieu fees. Parking requirements may be satisfied through the
payment of in-lieu fees consistent with any in-lieu parking fee program
established by the City Council.
      (10)   On-site shared parking.
         (a)   Shared parking is the practice of allowing land uses with
different peak and off-peak parking demand schedules to share required on-site
parking spaces.
         (b)   Shared parking is allowed with an administrative adjustment for
uses on a single lot, on adjacent lots, and on lots within 100 feet of one
another.
         (c)   An applicant requesting shared parking must submit a parking
demand study justifying the shared parking. The study must be prepared by a
qualified transportation planning consultant or consist of materials that
provide satisfactory evidence as determined by the Director.
         (d)   The total number of parking spaces in a shared parking
arrangement must be equal to or greater than the number of spaces ordinarily
required for any one of the participating uses.
         (e)   To approve an administrative adjustment for shared parking, the
Director must make the findings in §
155.412.030(F) (Findings for Approval).
         (f)   The Director may require that additional documents, covenants,
deed restrictions or other agreements are executed to ensure that:
            1.   The required parking spaces are maintained for the duration of
the uses served; and
            2.   Uses with similar hours and parking requirements as those uses
sharing the parking remain for the life of the building.
      (11)   Off-site parking.
         (a)   Required parking may be provided off-site if the parking is
located no more than 300 feet from the lot serving the use. An administrative
adjustment is required only if parking is to be provided on a non-adjoining
lot.
         (b)   To approve an administrative adjustment for off-site parking at
a non-adjoining lot, the Director must make the findings in §
155.412.030(F) (Findings for Approval) and find that the off-site parking is
located and designed in a manner that will conveniently meet the parking needs
of the use that it serves.
         (c)   Prior to establishing any required parking off-site, a covenant
record ("parking indenture"), approved by the city, must be filed with the
County Recorder guaranteeing that off-site parking will be maintained
exclusively for the use served for the duration of the use.
      (12)   Low demand.
         (a)   The number of required parking spaces may be reduced by up to
25% with an administrative adjustment for uses with unique operating
characteristics that result in a lower parking demand than otherwise would be
required.
         (b)   An applicant requesting reduced parking for a low demand use
must submit evidence to the satisfaction of the Director that the use requires
fewer parking spaces than otherwise required by §
155.324.030 (Number of On-site Parking Spaces Required). Acceptable evidence
may include parking surveys, sales receipts, and examples of comparable uses in
Eureka or similar communities.
         (c)   To approve the administrative adjustment, the Director must make
the findings in §
155.412.030(F) (Findings for Approval) and the following additional findings:
            1.   Evidence submitted by the applicant demonstrates that the use
requires fewer parking spaces required by §
155.324.030 (Number of On-Site Parking Spaces Required) for the use; and
            2.   The use will provide a sufficient amount of on-site parking to
accommodate its expected parking demand.
      (13)   Low impact development.
         (a)   Required parking spaces may be reduced by up to 15%, not to
exceed four spaces, with an administrative adjustment in cases where the
parking requirement conflicts with the city's storm water system (MS4) permit
requirements.
         (b)   To approve the administrative adjustment, the Director must make
the findings in §
155.412.030(F) (Findings for Approval) and find that providing all of the on-
site parking while complying with the city's storm water system (MS4) permit
requirements is not possible due to physical site constraints.
      (14)   Infill incentive permit reductions. Required parking spaces may
also be reduced through an infill incentive permit. See Table 412-2 in §
155.412.060 (Infill Incentive Permits).
   (D)   On-site shared parking.
      (1)   Shared parking is the practice of allowing land uses with different
peak and off-peak parking demand schedules to share required on-site parking
spaces.
      (2)   Shared parking is allowed with an administrative adjustment for
uses on a single lot, on adjacent lots and on lots within 100 feet of one
another.
      (3)   An applicant requesting shared parking must submit a parking demand
study justifying the shared parking. The study must be prepared by a qualified
transportation planning consultant or consist of materials that provide
satisfactory evidence as determined by the Director.
      (4)   The total number of parking spaces in a shared parking arrangement
must be equal to or greater than the number of spaces ordinarily required for
any one of the participating uses.
      (5)   To approve an administrative adjustment for shared parking, the
Director must make the findings in §
155.412.030(F) (Findings for Approval).
      (6)   The Director may require that additional documents, covenants, deed
restrictions or other agreements are executed to ensure that:
         (a)   The required parking spaces are maintained for the duration of
the uses served; and
         (b)   Uses with similar hours and parking requirements as those uses
sharing the parking remain for the life of the building.
   (E)   Off-site parking.
      (1)   Required parking may be provided off-site on a non-adjoining lot
with an administrative adjustment if the parking is located no more than 300
feet from the lot serving the use. Required parking may be provided on an
adjoining lot by-right.
      (2)   To approve an administrative adjustment for off-site parking at a
non-adjoining lot, the Director must make the findings in §
155.412.030(F) (Findings for Approval) and find that the off-site parking is
located and designed in a manner that will conveniently meet the parking needs
of the use that it serves.
      (3)   Prior to establishing the off-site parking, a covenant record
(“parking indenture”), approved by the city, must be filed with the County
Recorder guaranteeing that off-site parking will be maintained exclusively for
the use served for the duration of the use.
      (4)   The number of required parking spaces may be reduced by up to 25%
with an administrative adjustment for uses with unique operating
characteristics that result in a lower parking demand than otherwise would be
required.
      (5)   An applicant requesting reduced parking for a low demand use must
submit evidence to the satisfaction of the Director that the use requires fewer
parking spaces than otherwise required by §
155.324.030 (Number of On-Site Parking Spaces Required). Acceptable evidence
may include parking surveys, sales receipts and examples of comparable uses in
Eureka or similar communities.
      (6)   To approve the administrative adjustment, the Director must make
the findings in §
155.412.030(F) (Findings for Approval) and the following additional findings:
         (a)   Evidence submitted by the applicant demonstrates that the use
requires fewer parking spaces required by §
155.324.030 (Number of On-Site Parking Spaces Required) for the use; and
         (b)   The use will provide a sufficient amount of on-site parking to
accommodate its expected parking demand.
   (F)   Low impact development.
      (1)   Required parking spaces may be reduced by up to 15%, not to exceed
four spaces, with an administrative adjustment in cases where the parking
requirement conflicts with the city’s storm water system (MS4) permit
requirements.
      (2)   To approve the administrative adjustment, the Director must make
the findings in §
155.412.030(F) (Findings for Approval) and find that providing all of the on-
site parking while complying with the city’s storm water system (MS4) permit
requirements is not possible due to physical site constraints.
   (G)   Infill incentive permit reductions. Required parking spaces may also
be reduced through an infill incentive permit. See Table 412-2 in §
155.412.060 (Infill Incentive Permits).

§ 155.324.050 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Availability and use of spaces.
      (1)   Required parking spaces for multi-family and non-residential uses
must be permanently available and maintained to provide parking for the use
they are intended to serve.
      (2)   Required parking spaces for single-family homes may not be removed
unless specifically allowed by the Zoning Code. Immovable equipment, such as
water heaters and washer/dryers, may not be located within a required parking
space.
      (3)   Required parking spaces must be used exclusively for the temporary
parking of vehicles and not for the sale, lease, display, advertising or

§ 155.332 RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION ALTERNATIVES.
§ 155.332.010 PURPOSE.
   This §
155.332 establishes requirements for residential small lot, conservation, and
urban lot split subdivisions to accommodate a diversity of infill housing
types, allow for development on constrained lots and preserve open space and
other natural resources.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19; Am. Ord. 931-C.S., passed 2-15-22)
§ 155.332.020 SMALL LOT SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. This section establishes standards for small lot subdivisions
in the multi-family zoning districts. The intent of these standards is to:
      (1)   Facilitate the development of infill housing on vacant and
underutilized properties;
      (2)   Increase opportunities for fee-simple home ownership in higher
density areas of Eureka;
      (3)   Expand the types of housing available for purchase in Eureka,
including lower-cost housing for first-time homebuyers and seniors looking to
downsize; and
      (4)   Ensure that development on small lot subdivisions is well designed
and minimizes impacts on neighboring properties.
   (B)   Where allowed. Small lot subdivisions are allowed only in the R2 and
R3 Zoning Districts.
   (C)   Optional/not mandatory. Small lot subdivisions are an available
option, not a mandatory requirement. Lots in the R2 and R3 Zoning Districts may
also be subdivided using generally applicable subdivision requirements.
Conventional subdivisions, however, are not eligible for relaxed development
standards in §
155.332.020(E) (Development Standards).
   (D)   Approvals required. Small lot subdivisions require city approval of a
tentative and final or parcel map as required by the California Subdivision Map
Act and Municipal Code
Ch. 154 (Subdivision Regulations). Proposed small lot subdivisions shall be
clearly identified as such on the tentative map.
   (E)   Development standards.
      (1)   Lot area. 
         (a)   The minimum lot area in a small lot subdivision is 2,000 square
feet.
         (b)   The maximum lot area in a small lot subdivision is 4,999 square
feet except an existing primary residence, including accessory structures
located on the same resultant lot as the primary residence, is not limited to
the 4,999 square foot maximum.
      (2)   Minimum setbacks.
         (a)   There are no minimum setbacks from lot lines within a small lot
subdivision that do not abut a lot outside of the small lot subdivision. See
Figure 332-1.
         (b)   Setbacks from lot lines that abut a property outside of the
small lot subdivision are as required by the applicable zoning district.
            Figure 332-1: Small Lot Subdivision Setbacks

IMAGES/0-0-0-7796.png]
 
      (3)   Lot access. Newly created lots must comply with street frontage and
access standards in §
155.308.010(C) (Street Frontage and Access). For lots without direct vehicle
access from a street or alley, utility access easements must be granted to the
city. See Figure 332-2.
      (4)   Parking.
         (a)   On-site parking is required consistent with §
155.324 (Parking); except that, the Director may waive the on-site parking
requirement with an Administrative Adjustment for lots without street or alley
frontage where it is physically impossible for a vehicle to access a lot.
         (b)   To approve the administrative adjustment, the Director must make
the findings in §
155.412.030(F) (Findings for Approval) and the following additional findings:
            1.   It is physically impossible to provide vehicular access to the
lot due to the location of existing structures; or
            2.   Proposed development on the lot cannot be reasonably
reconfigured in any way that would allow for vehicular access to the lot.

      (5)   Other standards. Except for minimum setbacks, small lot
subdivisions are subject to all development standards (e.g., height, FAR, site
coverage) in the applicable zoning district.
   (F)   Subdivision configurations.
      (1)   Minimum requirements. Small lot subdivisions must comply with §
155.308.010 (Lot Standards).
      (2)   Example configurations. Figures 332-3 and 332-4 illustrate example
lot configuration and building placement permitted in small lot subdivisions.

§ 155.332.030 URBAN LOT SPLIT SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. This section allows for subdivision of RE and R1 zoned lots
and development of housing pursuant to Cal. Government Code §§ 65852.21 and
66411.7.
      (1)   Where allowed. Urban lot split subdivisions are permitted on any
parcel zoned RE (Residential Estate) or R1 (Residential Low) provided:
         (a)   The original lot area is at least 2,400 square feet;
         (b)   The lot is not listed on the State or Local Register of Historic
Places or located within a designated historic district;
         (c)   Neither the owner of the parcel being subdivided nor any person
acting in concert with the owner has previously subdivided an adjacent parcel
using an urban lot split subdivision as provided under Cal. Government Code §
66411.7;
         (d)   The parcel has not been established through a prior urban lot
split subdivision; and
         (e)   A maximum of one single-family residence, one JADU and either
one additional single-family residence or one ADU are allowed on a lot that is
subdivided using the authority contained in Cal. Government Code § 66411.7. No
other use types are allowed.
      (2)   Optional/not mandatory. Urban lot split subdivisions are an
available option, not a mandatory requirement. Lots in the RE and R1 zoning
districts may also be subdivided using generally applicable subdivision
requirements. Conventional subdivisions, however, are not eligible for relaxed
development standards in § 155.332.040.D (Development Standards).
      (3)   Approvals required. Urban lot split subdivisions require
ministerial city approval of a parcel map as required by the California
Subdivision Map Act and Municipal Code
Chapter 154 (Subdivision Regulations). Proposed urban lot split subdivisions
must be clearly identified as such on the parcel map.
      (4)   Development standards.
         (a)   Resulting minimum lot area.
            1.   The minimum lot area for a lot resulting from an urban lot
split subdivision is 1,200 square feet; and
            2.   The resulting minimum lot area must be at least 40% of the
original lot area. For example, if the original lot is 5,000 square feet, the
smallest resulting lot must be at least 2,000 square feet, or 40% of the
original lot area. If the original lot is 3,000 square feet, then the smallest
resulting lot must be at least 1,200 square feet.
         (b)   Minimum setbacks and other standards. See Table 204-2.2 for
minimum setback and other development standards for urban lot split
subdivisions.
         (c)   Lot access. Newly created lots must comply with street frontage
and access standards in §
155.308.010(C) (Street Frontage and Access). For lots without direct vehicle
access from a street or alley, utility access easements must be granted to the
city. See Figure 332-2.
         (d)   Parking. On-site parking is not required. If on-site parking is
provided, the parking must be consistent with §
155.324 (Parking), and garages and carports must be setback as provided in
Table 204-2.2.
   (B)   Other requirements.
      (1)   Short-term rental. Rental of any unit created pursuant to an urban
lot split subdivision must be for a term longer than 30 days.

   (B)   Eligibility. Conservation subdivisions are permitted in any
residential zoning district on lots 10,000 square feet or more.
   (C)    Approvals required. Conservation subdivisions require city approval
of a tentative and final or parcel map as required by the California
Subdivision Map Act and Municipal Code
Ch. 154 (Subdivision Regulations). Proposed conservation subdivisions must be
clearly identified as such on the tentative map.
   (D)   Development standards.
      (1)   Lot size.
         (a)   There is no minimum lot size within a conservation subdivision,
provided the overall density of the subdivision does not exceed the maximum
density of the applicable zoning district.
         (b)   Project density is calculated using the number of homes, not the
number of lots, and includes all open space areas. See
Figure 332-5.
      (2)   Setbacks.
         (a)   There are no minimum setbacks from lot lines within a
conservation subdivision that do not abut a property outside of the
conservation subdivision. See
Figure 332-5.
         (b)   The applicable zoning district will govern setbacks from lot
lines that abut a property outside of the conservation subdivision.
      (3)   Height. Buildings within a conservation subdivision may not exceed
a maximum height of 35 feet.
      (4)   Site coverage. There is no maximum site coverage for individual
lots within a conservation subdivision.
      (5)   Floor area ratio. The maximum floor area ratio in a conservation
subdivision is as required by Table 204-2 in §
155.204 (Residential Zoning Districts).
   (E)   Allowed land uses. The applicable zoning district will govern allowed
land uses in a conservation subdivision.
   (F)   Conservation area. Dedicated conservation areas within a conservation
subdivision must be separated from residential parcels and comply with the
following standards:   
      (1)   Open space minimums. A conservation subdivision project must
designate a minimum of 50% of the total project site as permanent open space.
See
Figure 332-5 .
      (2)   Conservation easement required. Designated open space must be
guaranteed in perpetuity using one or more of the following control mechanisms:
         (a)   Dedication of a conservation easement to a public agency or a
public interest land trust;
         (b)   Dedication of land in fee-title to a public agency; or
         (c)   Deed restrictions recorded with the County Recorder.
      (3)   Use of conservation area. Conservation areas will remain as
undeveloped open space in accordance with the following:
         (a)   Development is prohibited within a conservation area, except for
development necessary for natural resource protection and restoration as
determined by the Director;
         (b)   Animal grazing and crop production is allowed in a conservation
area consistent with Municipal Code
Ch. 91 (Animals). Accessory structures serving an agricultural use, such as
pole barns, are allowed;
         (c)   Trees may not be removed within a conservation area, except as
allowed by §
155.304.140 (Tree Removal); and
         (d)   A subdivider or property owner is not required to provide public

§ 155.340.050 RULES OF MEASUREMENT.
   (A)   Calculating sign area.
      (1)   Sign area for digitally-printed signs is measured as the area
within a single rectangle that completely enclose the sign copy and graphics,
as well as any frame, material or color that is an integral part of the display
or used to differentiate the sign’s contents from the background against which
they are placed. See
Figure 340-1.
      (2)   For all signs other than digitally-printed signs, sign area is
measured as the area within up to eight rectangles that completely enclose the
sign copy and graphics. See
Figure 340-2.

IMAGES/0-0-0-7812.png]
 
      (3)    Supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the
display itself is not calculated as sign area.
      (4)   For projecting and other double-faced (back-to-back) signs with
identical faces, only one display face is counted in the sign area measurement
if the distance between each sign face does not exceed 36 inches and the two
faces are parallel with each other.
      (5)   The area of spherical, free-form, sculptural or other non-planar
signs is measured as 50% of the sum of the area enclosed within the four
vertical sides of the smallest four-sided polyhedron that will encompass the
sign structure. See
 Figure 340-3.

IMAGES/0-0-0-7814.png]
 
   (B)   Tenant frontage.
      (1)   General. Tenant frontage is the linear measurement of a tenant's
building wall that abuts and faces a street, a tenant's building wall that
abuts and faces a parking lot, or a tenant's building wall that abuts and faces
a pedestrian walkway or alley. See
Figure 340-4.

IMAGES/0-0-0-8897.png]
 
      (2)   Corner and through lots.
         (a)    Where a tenant occupies a building that fronts on two streets
(on a corner or through lot), allowed sign standards apply independently for
each street frontage unless otherwise indicated in this section. See
Figure 340-5.

IMAGES/0-0-0-7818.png]
 
         (b)    For example, a corner tenant in the DT Zoning District may
install one wall sign on each street frontage. Allowed sign area applies
individually to each frontage and may not be transferred between frontages.
   (C)   Building frontage. Building frontage is measured in the same manner as
tenant frontage, except calculated for the entire building, not individual
tenants. See
Figure 340-6.

   (D)   Detached sign height measurement. The height of a freestanding, pole,
monument or other type of detached sign is measured from the finished grade at
the base of the sign to the top of the sign. See
Figure 340-7.

§ 155.340.060 SIGN PERMITS.
   (A)   Types of sign permits. The Zoning Code establishes three types of sign
permits: administrative sign permits, master sign permits, and creative sign
permits.
      (1)   An administrative sign permit is a ministerial approval by the
Department to confirm that a proposed sign complies with all applicable
standards.
      (2)   A master sign permit is a discretionary permit reviewed by the
Design Review Committee to allow for comprehensive and coordinated signs on
large, complex, non-residential multi-tenant sites and to allow some deviation
from sign standards where appropriate.
      (3)   A creative sign permit is a discretionary permit reviewed by the
Design Review Committee to allow unique, high-quality signs that deviate from
sign standards in this section.
   (B)   Administrative sign permits.
      (1)   When required. All new signs require an administrative sign permit
except for:
         (a)   Signs exempt from permit requirements as identified in §
155.340.030 (Signs Allowed Without Permits);
         (b)   Signs that comply with the requirements of an approved master
sign permit as identified in §
155.340.060(C) (Master Sign Permit); and
         (c)   Signs that comply with the requirements of an approved creative
sign permit as identified in §
155.340.060(D) (Creative Sign Permit).
      (2)   Permit requirements.
         (a)   Administrative sign permit applications must be submitted using
an official Department form accompanied by all fees, information, and materials
required by the Department.
         (b)   Department staff will review the proposed sign to verify
compliance with applicable standards. If the proposed sign complies with all
applicable standards, the Department staff will approve the administrative sign
permit. No public notice or hearing is required.
   (C)   Master sign permit.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the master sign permit is to provide a
coordinated approach to signage for large sites/buildings and non-residential
multi-tenant developments, buildings, or adjacent/adjoining properties/parcels.
      (2)   When allowed. Any site greater than one acre, any site with tenant
spaces above the first floor, or any non-residential development, building, or
property with three or more tenants, may request approval of a master sign
permit.
      (3)   Review authority. The Design Review Committee reviews and takes
action on master sign permit applications.
      (4)   Application submittal and review.
         (a)   Master sign permit applications must be submitted and reviewed
in compliance with §
155.408 (Permit Procedures).
         (b)   Master sign permit applications must be authorized by the
property owner/agent.
      (5)   Master sign program. All master sign permit applications must
include a proposed master sign program that identifies the placement, size,
materials, type, and general design of signs located on a site, including both
existing and proposed signs.
      (6)   Design standards.
         (a)   A master sign program may not allow prohibited signs as
identified in §
155.340.040 (Prohibited Signs) or deviation from digital sign requirements in
Table 340-9 (Digital Signs).
         (b)   A master sign program may allow deviation from the maximum size
of signs through transfers of maximum sign areas in §
155.340.070 (Sign Standards) between tenants on a site. For example, on a site
with ten tenants that each have 20-foot-wide frontages, each tenant would be
allowed 20 square feet of pole signs. Through a standard administrative sign
permit, the area of each sign cannot be transferred from one tenant to another.
However, through Design Review Committee approval of a master sign permit, the
collective total of 200 square feet of sign area for the entire site can be
pooled and then re-allocated between tenants so that one tenant could have 101
square feet and the remaining tenants could each have 11 square feet of sign
area.
         (c)   A master sign program may allow deviation from the total number
of signs permitted per site in §
155.340.070 (Sign Standards). In the example in division (6)(b) above, the site
would be limited to one pole sign 150 square feet or smaller with a standard
administrative sign permit. However, through a master sign permit, the site
could have two or more pole signs totaling 150 square feet of signage if
specifically allowed by the master sign permit approval.
         (d)   Deviation from any other requirement in this section is not
allowed.
      (7)   Public notice and hearing. The Design Review Committee will review
and act on a master sign permit application at a noticed public hearing in
compliance with §
155.408.080 (Notice of Public Hearing) and §
155.408.100 (Public Hearings).
      (8)   Findings for approval. To approve a master sign permit, the Design
Review Committee must make all of the following findings:
         (a)   Allowed signs are consistent with the General Plan, Zoning Code,
and any applicable specific plan or area plan adopted by the City Council;
         (b)   The master sign program features a unified and coordinated
approach to the materials, size, type, placement, and general design of signs
proposed for a project or property;
         (c)   If deviations from sign standards in §
155.340.070 (Sign Standards) are proposed, the deviations are necessary to
accommodate the unique signage needs of the site;
         (d)   Allowed signs comply with all applicable standards in this
section, unless specific deviations are allowed by the master sign program;
         (e)   The allowed signs will not adversely impact the public health,
safety, or general welfare;
         (f)   The allowed sign sizes are proportionate and appropriate to the
building and site where they are located; and
         (g)   The number, placement, design, and material of the allowed signs
are compatible with the architectural design of buildings on the site.
      (9)   Limitations. As a part of the discretionary approval of a master
sign permit, the Design Review Committee may require modifications to the
proposed master sign program including limits on allowed sign types, height,
area, dimensions, placement, materials, and other sign design features, in
addition to the limitations set by the objective standards of the Zoning Code.
      (10)   Effect of master sign program.
         (a)   All tenants and land uses on the site are subject to the
requirements of the approved master sign program.
         (b)   All subsequent signs proposed for a site subject to an approved
master sign program must comply with the standards and specifications included
in the master sign program.
         (c)   Subsequent signs consistent with an approved master sign program
are allowed with an administrative sign permit.
         (d)   Signs inconsistent with an approved master sign program require
either an amendment to the master sign program or modification of the
inconsistent signs.
         (e)   Approval of a master sign program supersede the regulations of
this section. Any aspect of the proposed signs not addressed by the master sign
program must be in compliance with this section.
   (D)   Creative sign permits.
      (1)   Purpose. A creative sign permit allows for creative signs that
deviate from sign standards in this section. Creative sign permits are intended
to:
         (a)   Encourage signs of unique design, and that exhibit a high degree
of thoughtfulness, imagination, inventiveness, and spirit; and
         (b)   Allow for creative signs that deviate from the standards in this
section while minimizing adverse impacts on neighboring properties and the
community at large.
      (2)   When allowed. A creative sign is allowed for any type of sign in
any location in Eureka, except for digital signs, which are allowed only in
locations specified in Table 340-9 (Digital Signs).
      (3)   Review authority. The Design Review Committee reviews and takes
action on creative sign permit applications.
      (4)   Application submittal and review. Creative sign permit applications
must be submitted and reviewed in compliance with §
155.408 (Permit Procedures). To allow the Design Review Committee to understand
the context of proposed creative signs, creative sign permit applications may
identify the placement, size, materials, type, and general design of all
existing and proposed signs located on the same site, including signs not
requiring a creative sign permit. If proposed signs meeting all applicable
standards are considered and approved by the Design Review Committee as part of
a creative sign permit application, the creative sign permit serves as an
equivalent of an administrative sign permit and no separate administrative sign
permit is required.
      (5)   Eligible adjustments. A creative sign permit may allow deviation
from standards in §
155.340.070 (Sign Standards), excluding standards for digital signs (see Table
340-9) and marquee signs (see § 155.340.070(E)(3)). Deviation from any other
requirement in this section is not allowed. One creative sign permit may cover
multiple deviations from standards and multiple signs on the same site.
      (6)   Design features requiring a creative sign permit. The following
sign design features are allowed only with a creative sign permit:
         (a)   Signs which change color at a frequency of more than one color
change per 15 seconds, except for digital signs consistent with Table 340-9
(Digital Signs);
         (b)   Chase lighting; and
         (c)   Neon signs that change color or are animated. Neon signs that do
not change color or utilize animation are allowed without a creative sign
permit.
      (7)   Digitally-printed signs. A digitally-printed sign may constitute no
more than 40% of the total sign area of a sign approved with a creative sign
permit.
      (8)   Public notice and hearing. The Design Review Committee will review
and act on a creative sign permit application at a noticed public hearing in
compliance with § 155.408.080 (Notice of Public Hearing) and §
155.408.100 (Public Hearings).
      (9)   Approval criteria. To approve a creative sign permit, the Design
Review Committee must find that the sign meets all of the general design
criteria and incorporates three or more of the sign features, materials, and
contextual criteria, as provided below.
         (a)   General design. The sign meets all of the following general
design criteria:
            1.   The sign constitutes a substantial aesthetic improvement to
the site and has a positive visual impact on the surrounding area;
            2.   The sign is of unique design, and exhibits a high degree of
thoughtfulness, imagination, inventiveness, and spirit;
            3.   The sign is of a higher creative, artistic, and/or sculptural
nature than the average sign typically found in Eureka; and
            4.   The sign provides strong graphic character through the
imaginative use of graphics, color, texture, quality materials, scale, and
proportion.
         (b)   Sign features, materials, and contextual criteria. The sign
incorporates three or more of the following:
            1.   Materials of a higher quality than typically used for signs in
Eureka (e.g., stone, sculptural steel, sandblasted wood, gold leaf, hand-
painted content with an artistic mural-like component);
            2.   Projecting, recessed, or cut-out text (e.g., push-through
illuminated acrylic letters, routed letters, routed metal);
            3.   Creative and unique use of clearly-visible high-quality
landscaping with an area greater than the minimum required for the sign or
site, whichever is more;
            4.   Creative and unique use of lighting (e.g., chase, neon
lighting, LED faux neon, a well-coordinated combination of at least three
different types of site-appropriate illumination);
            5.   Clearly visible three-dimensionality where a notable
proportion of the structure or form of the sign includes multiple deviations
from a parallel plane (e.g., a sphere, a half-sphere, sculptural elements, a
fully three-dimensional beer mug);
            6.   Sign design successfully emulates the architecture of the
building (e.g., a sign with roof-like covering that matches the general design
of the roof of the building it serves);
            7.   Highly irregular multi-dimensional sign shape (e.g., a sign
that has at least five or more straight sides, a sign that has a few straight
sides and multiple variable rounded sides, a sign with an unusually
disproportionate height-to-width ratio);
            8.   At least 50% of the sign area includes custom artistic
illustrations;
            9.   Sign shape includes inventive representation of the use, name,
or logo of the structure or business (e.g., a fish-shaped sign for a fishing
store);

      (1)   It is the city’s policy to regulate signs in a constitutional
manner that does not favor commercial speech over non- commercial speech, and
is content neutral as to non-commercial messages which are within the
protections of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the corollary
provisions of the California Constitution.
      (2)   Where necessary, the Director will interpret the meaning and
applicability of this section in light of this message neutrality policy. Under
no circumstances will this message neutrality policy be interpreted to allow
off-premises signs. See division (J) below.
   (B)   Message substitution.
      (1)   Subject to the property owner’s consent, a message of any type may
be substituted, in whole or in part, for the message displayed on any legally
established sign without consideration of message content.
      (2)   Message substitutions require a zoning clearance.
      (3)   This message substitution provision does not:
         (a)   Create a right to increase the total amount of signage beyond
that otherwise allowed or existing;
         (b)   Affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device
be properly permitted, when a permit requirement applies;
         (c)   Allow a change in the physical structure of a sign or its
mounting device;
         (d)   Allow the establishment of a prohibited sign as identified in §
155.340.040 (Prohibited Signs); or
         (e)   Nullify or eliminate any contractual obligation through a
development agreement or similar agreement that specifies the allowable content
of a sign.
   (C)   Maximum number of sign types. No more than three different types of
signs are allowed.
   (D)   Changes to sign face. Changes to a sign face that do not structurally
alter or enlarge a legally-established sign do not require an administrative
sign permit but do require a zoning clearance.
   (E)   Maintenance.
      (1)   All signs and supporting hardware, including temporary signs, must
be maintained in a state of good repair at all times.
      (2)   Any repair to a sign must be of equal or better quality of
materials and design as the original sign.
      (3)   A sign that is not properly maintained or is dilapidated will be
deemed a public nuisance, and may be abated in compliance with §
155.428 (Enforcement and Penalties) and Municipal Code §§
10.35 et seq. (Administrative Citations). Examples of dilapidated signs include
the following:
         (a)   Signs with rust covering 25% or more of a pole or other support
structures;
         (b)   Signs with peeling paint visible on 25% or more of the sign or
support structure;
         (c)   Signs and support structures with visible physical damage that
significantly alters the sign’s appearance;
         (d)   Signs with malfunctioning or damaged lighting;
         (e)   Illegible sign copy resulting from damage to the sign;
         (f)   Signs and supporting elements that no longer contain a sign face
or copy. Includes box signs without a slide-in sign copy panel, projecting sign
brackets without an attached sign face and stand-alone poles without an
attached sign face; and
         (g)   Other similar conditions as determined by the Director.
   (F)   Building surface repair. When an existing sign is replaced, removed or
modified, any newly exposed portions of a building surface on which the sign is
or was displayed must be repaired and repainted to restore a uniform appearance
to the surface. Compliance with this requirement includes the removal of any
excess conduit and supports, and the patching or filling of any exposed holes.
   (G)   Materials. Except for interior window signs, all permanent signs must
be constructed of wood, metal, plastic, glass or similar durable and
weatherproof material.
   (H)   Illumination.
      (1)   Signs in non-residential zoning districts may be internally or
externally illuminated, except where specifically prohibited.
      (2)   Signs in residential zoning districts may only be externally
illuminated.
      (3)   Light sources must be steady, stationary and static in color,
except for neon signs and chase lighting when allowed with a creative sign
permit.
      (4)   Lighting may not produce glare that creates a public nuisance or
hazard for motorists or pedestrian.
      (5)   The light source for externally illuminated signs must be
positioned so that light does not shine directly on adjoining properties.
      (6)   Exposed bulbs, with or without chase lighting, are permitted with a
creative sign permit.
      (7)   Design features consisting of neon or other small diameter tubing
illuminated by fluorescing gas is allowed as part of any type of sign.
   (I)   Vertical and horizontal clearance.
      (1)   Signs that project over any public walkway or walk area must have
an overhead clearance of at least eight feet and require an encroachment
permit. See
Figure 340-17.
      (2)   Signs must maintain a minimum two-foot horizontal clearance from a
driveway or street curb. See
Figure 340-15.

   (J)   Detached sign ground support and placement.
      (1)   Ground support. Detached signs must be supported and permanently
placed by embedding, anchoring, or connecting the sign in such a manner as to
incorporate it into the landscape or architectural design scheme.
      (2)   Placement. A detached sign may not occupy an area designated for
parking, loading, walkways, driveways, fire lane, easement, traffic portion of
the right-of-way, vision clearance areas (if greater than 36 inches tall), or
other areas required to remain unobstructed.
   (K)   Off-premises signs.
      (1)   New off-premises signs. New off-premises signs established on or
after June 20, 2019, are prohibited.

§ 155.344 DENSITY BONUS.
§ 155.344.010 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this section is to allow for density bonuses and additional
incentives, consistent with Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 65915 et seq. and the General
Plan Housing Element, and to promote the production of affordable, specialized,
and senior housing. The density bonus ordinance codified in this chapter is
intended to comply with State Density Bonus Law, Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 65915 et
seq.
(Ord. 902-C.S., passed 8-18-20; Am. Ord. 951-C.S., passed 10-17-23)
§ 155.344.020 DEFINITIONS.
   The definitions found in State Density Bonus Law apply to the terms
contained in this subsection.
(Ord. 902-C.S., passed 8-18-20)
§ 155.344.030 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   A housing development as defined in State Density Bonus Law is
eligible for a density bonus and other regulatory incentives that are provided
by State Density Bonus Law when the applicant seeks and agrees to provide low,
very-low, senior or moderate-income housing units or units intended to serve
transitional foster youth, disabled veterans, homeless persons, and lower
income students in the threshold amounts specified in State Density Bonus Law.
(Ord. 902-C.S., passed 8-18-20)
§ 155.344.040 APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All applications. All applications for a density bonus, developer
incentive, waiver or modification of development standards must include the
following reasonable documentation:
      (1)   Density bonus.
         (a)   A summary table showing the maximum number of dwelling units
permitted by the zoning and general plan excluding any density bonus units, the
proposed affordable units by income level, the proposed bonus percentage, the
number of density bonus units proposed, the total number of dwelling units
proposed on the site, and the resulting density in units per acre.
         (b)   A site plan, drawn to scale, showing the number and location of
all proposed units, designating the location of proposed affordable units and
density bonus units.
         (c)   The zoning and general plan designations and assessor's parcel
number(s) of the housing development site.
         (d)   A description of all dwelling units existing on the site in the
five-year period preceding the date of submittal of the application and
identification of any units rented during the five-year period. If dwelling
units on the site are currently rented, income and household size of all
residents of currently occupied units, if known. If any dwelling units on the
site were rented in the five-year period but are not currently rented, the
income and household size of residents occupying dwelling units when the site
contained the maximum number of dwelling units, if known.
         (e)   A description of any recorded covenant, ordinance, or law
applicable to the site that restricted rents to levels affordable to very-low
or lower-income households in the five-year period preceding the date of
submittal of the application.
      (2)   Concession or incentive. For each concession or incentive
requested:
         (a)   The existing development standard and the requested development
standard or regulatory incentive.
         (b)   Except where mixed-use zoning is proposed as a concession or
incentive, documentation to show any requested incentive will result in
identifiable and actual cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs
or rents.
         (c)   If approval of mixed-use zoning is proposed, documentation that
nonresidential land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development, that
the nonresidential land uses are compatible with the housing development and
the existing or planned development in the area where the proposed housing
development will be located, and that mixed-use zoning will provide for
affordable housing costs or rents.
      (3)   Waiver. For each waiver requested:
         (a)   The existing development standard and the requested development
standard.
         (b)   Documentation that the development standard for which a waiver
is requested will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of
a development at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted
by Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915.
      (4)   Parking reduction. A table showing parking required by the zoning
regulations, parking proposed under Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915(p), and reasonable
documentation that the project is eligible for the requested parking reduction.
      (5)   Child care facility. Documentation that all requirements included
in Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915(h) can be met.

this section will be processed pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 65950 et seq.
(Ord. 902-C.S., passed 8-18-20)
§ 155.344.050 BONUS AND INCENTIVE CALCULATION.
   (A)   All calculations are rounded up for any fractional numeric value in
determining the total number of units to be granted, including base density and
bonus density, as well as the resulting number of affordable units needed for a
given density bonus project.
   (B)   Projects qualifying for a density bonus under one or more income
categories, or one or more types of housing (i.e., senior housing or housing
intended to serve transitional foster youth, disabled veterans, homeless
persons, or lower income students), must identify the categories under which
the density bonus would be applied. Density bonuses from more than one category
can be combined up to the maximum allowed under State Density Bonus law.
   (C)   Density bonus units are not included in determining the number of
affordable units required to qualify a project for a density bonus.
   (D)   The applicant may elect to accept a lesser percentage of density bonus
than the housing development is entitled to, or no density bonus, but no
reduction will be permitted in the percentages of required affordable units
contained in Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915(b), (c), and (f). Regardless of the number
of affordable units, no project will be entitled to a density bonus of more
than what is authorized under State Density Bonus Law.
   (E)   The number of incentives an applicant may request is provided by State
Density Bonus Law.
(Ord. 902-C.S., passed 8-18-20)
§ 155.344.060 REVIEW AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Density bonus applications for housing developments requiring
discretionary review will be reviewed and acted upon by the highest review
authority designated by the Zoning Code for any of the applications (e.g., a
project requiring a use permit and applying for a density bonus will have both
applications decided by the Planning Commission).
   (B)   The Director reviews and takes action on density bonus applications
for housing developments requiring only ministerial review (e.g., a density
bonus application for a housing development requiring only a building permit
will be decided by the Director).
(Ord. 902-C.S., passed 8-18-20)
§ 155.344.070 FINDINGS FOR APPROVAL.
   (A)   To approve a density bonus application, the review authority must make
the following written findings, based upon substantial evidence, as applicable:
      (1)   Density bonus.
         (a)   The proposed development provides the affordable units or senior
housing required by State Density Bonus Law to be eligible for the density
bonus and any incentives, parking reduction, or waivers requested, including
the replacement of units rented or formerly rented to low- and very low-income
households as required by Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915(c)(3).
         (b)   The proposed density bonus will result in identifiable and
actual cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in
Cal. Health and Safety Code § 50052.5, or for affordable rents, as defined in
Cal. Health and Safety Code § 50053; or
         (c)   The proposed density bonus will not be contrary to state or
federal law; and
         (d)   The proposed density bonus will not have a specific adverse
impact on public health or safety, or the physical environment, or on any real
property that is listed in the California Register of Historic Resources. For
the purpose of this subsection, specific adverse impact means a significant,
quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified,
written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they
existed on the date the application for the housing development was deemed
complete.
      (2)   Incentive. Any requested incentive will result in identifiable and
actual cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs or rents, except
that, if a mixed-use development is requested, the application must instead
meet all of the requirements of Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915(k)(2).
      (3)   Waiver. The development standard for which a waiver is requested
will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development
at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by Cal. Gov’t
Code § 65915.
      (4)   Parking reduction. The housing development is eligible for any
requested parking reductions under Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915(p).
      (5)   Donation of land. If the density bonus is based entirely, or in
part, on the donation of land, all of the requirements included in Cal. Gov’t
Code § 65915(g) have been met.
      (6)   Child care facility. If the density bonus or incentive is based on
the inclusion of a child care facility, all of the requirements included in
Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915(h) have been met.
      (7)   Condominium conversion. If the density bonus or incentive is based
on the inclusion of affordable units as part of a condominium conversion, all
of the requirements included in Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915.5 have been met.
      (8)   Commercial Development.
         (a)   The city has approved the partnered housing agreement; and
         (b)   The commercial development bonus has been mutually agreed upon
by the city and the commercial developer; and
         (c)   All of the requirements included in Cal. Gov’t Code § 65915.7
have been met.

155.344 conflicts with State Density Bonus Law (Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 65915 et
seq.) or other applicable state law, state law shall supersede this section.
Any ambiguities in this section shall be interpreted to be consistent with
State Density Bonus Law.

NOTES TO TABLE:
[1] The Director may choose to refer the project to the Planning Commission for
review and decision.
[2] The Director may delegate review authority to Department staff on
ministerial permits and approvals.
[3] Applications requiring other discretionary review will be acted upon by the
highest review authority, with appeal rights to the next highest authority,
except that decisions of the City Council are final.
[4] The Historic Preservation Commission conducts Design Review for projects
that alter a designated historic resource as provided in Municipal Code
Chapter 157. If a project subject to Design Review also requires a permit from
the Planning Commission, the Planning Commission conducts Design Review. If the
project both alters a designated historic resource as provided in Municipal
Code
Chapter 157 and requires a permit from the Planning Commission, the Historic
Preservation Commission conducts any design review for the project.
[5] The Planning Commission acts on the permit only after receiving a written
request for a public hearing during the 15-day hearing request period, in
accordance with
155.408.090 (Notice of Pending Action). If no request for a public hearing is
received by the end of the 15-day period, the Director acts on the application,
and the action is final.

§ 155.412.040 DESIGN REVIEW.
   (A)   Purpose. Design review is a discretionary process to ensure that the
street-facing façades of proposed developments exhibit high quality design,
complement neighboring properties, and contribute to Eureka's distinctive
identity and unique sense of place.
   (B)   When required. The following types of projects require design review:
      (1)   Additions adding 30% or more floor area to the total existing floor
area of a building in the residential or mixed-use zoning districts (i.e.,
zoning districts described in §§
155.204 and
155.208);
      (2)   New buildings that are 500 square feet or more in the residential
or mixed-use zoning districts (i.e., zoning districts described in §§
155.204 and
155.208);
      (3)   Any exterior modification to a street-facing building façade
located on a pedestrian-focused frontage (See Figure 208-4 in §
155.208 (Mixed Use Zoning Districts)). "Exterior modification" includes the
addition of a new sign, or the change in the size, shape, or location on the
façade of an existing sign, but does not include refacing an existing sign when
there is no change in the size, shape or location of the sign, and does not
include painting a sign directly on the façade of the structure; and
      (4)   Wireless telecommunication facilities. (See Municipal Code Chapter
159 (Wireless Telecommunications Facilities)).
   (C)   Exemptions. The following projects are exempt from design review:
      (1)   Housing development projects with four or fewer residential units,
including projects with residential units only, and mixed-use developments with
at least two-thirds of the square footage designated for residential use;
      (2)   Transitional, supportive, emergency and farmworker housing;
      (3)   Modifications and additions to existing structures where the
modification or addition is not facing an adjacent public street;
      (4)   Buildings occupied by the following use categories, as identified
in §
155.504 (Land Use Classifications):
         (a)   Agricultural and natural resource uses;
         (b)   Civic and recreation uses; and
         (c)   Infrastructure and utility uses; and
      (5)   Projects or project features to serve a person with disabilities
under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
   (D)   Signs.
      (1)   The Design Review Committee serves as the review authority for
signs that require a master sign permit or creative sign permit. However, these
sign permit applications are not subject to the design review process required
by this section. To approve a sign permit, the Design Review Committee uses
exclusively the review and approval criteria in § 155.340 (Signs). The Design
Review Committee does not consider the design review criteria in §
155.412.040(J) (Design Review Criteria) when acting on a sign permit.
      (2)   The Design Review Committee serves as the review authority for
modification of the size, shape, or location of an existing sign, or the
addition of a new sign, on the façade facing a pedestrian-focused frontage.
Design review is not required for either a new sign or modification of an
existing sign when the sign is painted directly on the façade facing a
pedestrian-focused frontage; however, a sign permit may be required pursuant to
§
155.340 (Signs).
         (a)   To approve modification of the size, shape, or location on the
façade of an existing sign, the Design Review Committee uses exclusively the
design review criteria (§
155.412.040(J)) for surrounding context, architectural style, and visual
interest.
         (b)   For a new sign, the Design Review Committee uses the design
review criteria noted in division (a) above, and the review and approval
criteria in §
155.340 (Signs) to approve both the façade modification and the sign.
   (E)   Review authority.
      (1)   The Design Review Committee conducts design review for all projects
except as follows:
         (a)   If the project also requires review by the Historic Preservation
Commission (HPC) as provided in Municipal Code
Chapter 157 (Historic Preservation), the HPC conducts design review;
         (b)   If the project also requires a permit from the Planning
Commission, the Planning Commission conducts design review, unless design
review is to be conducted by the Historic Preservation Commission in accordance
with division (a) above; or
         (c)   If the project also requires City Council approval, the City
Council conducts design review, unless design review is to be conducted by the
Historic Preservation Commission in accordance with division (a) above.
      (2)   When the Planning Commission or City Council conducts design
review, the Department may request informal input from individual Design Review
Committee members prior to Planning Commission or City Council action on the
project. The Design Review Committee does not hold a formal meeting on the
proposed project prior to Planning Commission or City Council review.
   (F)   Application submittal and review. Design review applications must be
submitted and reviewed in compliance with §
155.408 (Permit Procedures).
   (G)   Consistency. A project must be consistent, as determined by the
Director, with the General Plan, any applicable specific plan or area plan, and
applicable objective design policies and regulations adopted by the City
Council, prior to being scheduled for design review.
   (H)   Public notice and hearing. The review authority must review and act on
a design review application at a noticed public hearing in compliance with §
155.408.100 (Public Hearings).
   (I)   Scope of design review.
      (1)   When acting on a design review application, the review authority
must consider only those project features directly related to the design
criteria described in §
155.412.040(J) (Design Review Criteria).
      (2)   The review authority may not consider exterior building colors or
other color choices included as part of a proposed project.
      (3)   When conducting design review, the review authority may not require
a modification to a project feature that complies with mandatory development
standards in the Zoning Code. For example, if a project complies with the
minimum setback requirement, the review authority may not require an increased
setback as a condition of design review approval. Design review is intended to
address only aesthetic considerations not otherwise regulated by the Zoning
Code.
      (4)   Design review may not require project changes to improve the
economic viability of a business as perceived by the review authority.
   (J)   Design review criteria. To approve a design review application, the
Review Authority must find that the proposed project complies with all of the
following design review criteria to the extent they apply.
      (1)   Surrounding context. The overall project and associated buildings
enhance the design quality of the area where they are located, and enhance
Eureka's unique character and distinctive sense of place. New buildings may
"fit in" with traditional architecture that complements the surrounding context
or "stand out" with a contemporary and contrasting style. All buildings must
minimize adverse impacts on neighboring properties when possible.
      (2)   Pedestrian environment. Buildings incorporate design features that
support an active public realm and an inviting pedestrian environment.
      (3)   Architectural style. Buildings demonstrate a coherent and
successfully executed architectural style. Building architecture may be
traditional or modern. Buildings are not required to conform to any dominant
architectural style or local vernacular. Creative architectural and artistic
expression is encouraged.
      (4)   Articulation and visual interest. Building façades are distinctive,
create visual interest, and relate to the human scale through vertical and
horizontal articulation, varied building planes, distinctive building elements,
and/or noticeable architectural details. Building elements such as roofs,
doors, windows, and porches are part of an integrated design and relate to the
human scale. Architectural details such as articulation, trim, eaves, window
boxes, and brackets contribute to the visual interest of the building.
      (5)   Materials. Building façades feature high-quality materials that are
appropriate to the architectural style, enhance building articulation, and are
compatible with surrounding development.
      (6)   Safety. The project promotes public safety and minimizes
opportunities for crime through design features such as property access
controls (e.g., placement of entrances, fences), increased visibility, and
features that promote a sense of ownership of outdoor space.
      (7)   Landscaping. Landscaping features low-water-use plants appropriate
for the local climate, contains native plants in compliance with §
155.328.050(D) (Native Plants), and does not include any invasive species that
would be harmful to native plants and habitat, in compliance with §
155.328.050(E) (Invasive Plants).
   (K)   Findings. To approve a design review application, the review authority
must make all of the following findings:
      (1)   The proposed development will not be detrimental to public health,
safety, or welfare or materially injurious to the properties or improvements in
the vicinity.
      (2)   The proposed project complies with all applicable design review
criteria in §
155.412.040(J) (Design Review Criteria).
   (L)   Building permits.
      (1)   For projects subject to design review, the Building Department may
not accept a building permit application until after design review approval.
      (2)   The Building Department may issue a certificate of occupancy or
other final building permit sign-off only after the Department has physically
inspected the project site and verified that the as-built project conforms with
design review approved plans and conditions of approval.

§ 155.412.060 INFILL INCENTIVE PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose. An infill incentive permit allows deviations from development
standards for projects that provide community benefits and/or public amenities.
Infill incentive permits are discretionary actions intended to encourage high-
quality infill development and/or the adaptive reuse of properties suitable for
redevelopment.
   (B)   Where allowed. An infill incentive permit is available for projects in
the residential, mixed-use and industrial zoning districts.
   (C)   Types of infill incentive permits. The Zoning Code establishes two
types of infill incentive permits: minor infill incentive permits and major
infill incentive permits.
   (D)   Review authority.
      (1)   Minor infill incentive permits. The Director reviews and takes
action on minor infill incentive permit applications. The Director may refer
any application to the Planning Commission for public hearing and decision.
      (2)   Major infill incentive permits. The Planning Commission reviews and
takes action on major infill incentive permit applications.
   (E)   Required benefits. The review authority may approve an infill
incentive permit for projects that provide at least two of the following
community benefits:
      (1)   Architectural features. The project incorporates four of the
architectural features described in §
155.312.050 (Architectural Features);
      (2)   Vertical mixed-use. The project creates two or more new upper-story
residential units as a part of a vertical mixed-use development within 900 feet
of a public transit bus stop where the average interval of time between buses
is 90 minutes or less (90-minute headways) during weekday daytime hours. Mixed-
use development must be permitted in the applicable zoning district to qualify
as a benefit;
      (3)   Historic preservation. The project renovates a designated historic
resource in compliance with
Ch. 157 (Historic Preservation);
      (4)   Environmental remediation. The project remediates contaminated soil
or water;
      (5)   Green building. The project will be a LEED-certified green
building;
      (6)   Blight/nuisance abatement. The project eliminates blight, a public
nuisance or a public health or safety hazard;
      (7)   Child care. The project includes an on-site childcare facility;
      (8)   Supportive housing. The project provides supportive housing as
defined in Cal. Gov’t Code § 65582;
      (9)   Electric vehicle charging stations. The project provides an
electrical vehicle charging station for 50% of the parking spaces required to
serve a residential unit and/or for at least 25% of the parking spaces required
for a non-residential use;
      (10)   Materials and building elements. The project incorporates exterior
materials or building elements of a higher quality than conventional
construction. Examples include:
         (a)   Siding. All exterior walls are sided with wood shake, ornamental
metal, tile, brick, stone or stained wood;
         (b)   Doors and windows. All doors and windows are solid wood and/or
feature shutters, stained glass or true divided muntins;
         (c)   Roofing materials. All roof surfaces feature wood shingle or
shake, standing seam metal, clay or concrete tile, slate shingles or a green/
living roof; and
         (d)   Fixtures. High grade fixtures on all building walls visible from
a public street or sidewalk that add significantly to the architectural
character of the building such as light fixtures, door hinges and handles,
decorative hanging sign or awning brackets.
      (11)   Community amenities. The project creates or preserves a cultural,
recreational, employment, or other amenity that adds significantly to the
quality of life of the neighborhood or the community. The community amenity
must be an allowed use in the applicable zoning district to qualify as a
benefit.
   (F)   Incentives.
      (1)   Available incentives. An infill incentive permit may allow
deviations to development standards as shown in
Table 412-2.

[3] Minimum lot area of 6,000 square feet required for increased density.
 
      (2)   Number of incentives. The maximum number of standards which may be
modified through an infill incentive permit is as follows:
         (a)   Minor infill incentive permits: one deviation to development
standards as shown in
Table 412-1; and
         (b)   Major infill incentive permit: two deviations to development
standards as shown in
Table 412-2.
   (G)   Increased density requirements. To be eligible for increased
residential density as provided in
Table 412-2, a project must meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Adjacency to high volume streets. The project is on a lot within
250 feet from a street designated as a major arterial, minor arterial or a
major collector in the General Plan Figure M-1 Circulation Diagram;
      (2)   Factors supporting higher density. The lot containing the project
satisfies one or more of the following requirements:
         (a)   Any portion of the lot is within 900 feet of a community park as
defined in the General Plan;
         (b)   Any portion of the lot is within 600 feet of a bus stop;
         (c)   Any portion of the lot is within 600 feet of a school;
         (d)   Any portion of the lot is within 900 feet of a mixed-use zoning
district or a residential zoning district with a higher allowed density;
         (e)   The lot has been unimproved (containing no buildings) for ten
years or longer; and/or
         (f)   The Neighborhood Market (NMO) Overlay Zone applies to the lot.
      (3)   Reduced unit size and affordability. The project satisfies one or
more of the following requirements:
         (a)   All of the additional units allowed through the increased
density are 500 square feet or less;
         (b)   For market-rate projects where the majority of units are not
income-restricted, a minimum of one unit or 10% of units (whichever is more)
are deed restricted to households earning 50% or less of the Humboldt County
median income; and/or
         (c)   For affordable housing projects where all units are income-
restricted, a minimum of one unit or 60% of units (whichever is more) are deed
restricted to households earning 50% or less of the Humboldt County median
income.
   (H)   Application submittal and review. Infill incentive permit applications
must be submitted and reviewed in compliance with §
155.408 (Permit Procedures).
   (I)   Public notice and hearing.
      (1)   Minor infill incentive permits. Public notice of the Director's
pending action on a minor infill incentive permit application will be provided

review authority must make all of the following findings:
      (1)   The proposed project substantially advances General Plan objectives
to prioritize development of vacant and underutilized infill properties and/or
revitalize existing properties;
      (2)   The community benefits provided by the project are of a sufficient
value to justify the deviations to development standards allowed by the permit;
      (3)   The adjustment will not deprive neighboring property owners of the
reasonable economic use and enjoyment of their property; and
      (4)   The adjustment will not be materially detrimental to the public
health, safety or welfare.

§ 155.412.070 MINOR MODIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. A minor modification allows for small deviations from
development standards to accommodate projects that are compatible with and
appropriate for the area where they are located.
   (B)   When allowed.
      (1)   Permitted modifications.
         (a)   The Director may approve a minor modification to allow deviation
from a physical development standard that applies to the subject property.
Examples of physical development standards include lot area, site coverage,
building height, setbacks, fence and wall height, floor area ratio (FAR) and
on-site parking space dimensions.
         (b)   The maximum deviation allowed with a minor modification is 10%
of the standard; except that, fence and wall height deviation may be increased
by up to 20% with a minor modification.
      (2)   Calculating allowed deviations. The maximum deviation allowed with
a minor modification is calculated as 10% of the amount, distance or area
required by the standard. For example, if the maximum permitted height is 30
feet, up to three additional feet (10% of 30 feet) may be allowed with a minor
modification.
      (3)   Modifications not allowed. A minor modification may not be granted
to allow deviation from:
         (a)   The General Plan;
         (b)   Increased residential density;
         (c)   Required parking spaces; and
         (d)   Design standards with no quantified standard (e.g., building
entries facing the street).
   (C)   Review authority. The Director reviews and takes action on minor
modification applications.
   (D)   Applications. An application is not required for a minor modification.
Department staff will review the project information submitted for a building
permit or other required city approvals when acting on the zoning clearance or
discretionary approval.
   (E)   Public notice and hearing. None required.
   (F)   Findings for approval. To approve a minor modification application,
the Director must make all of the following findings:
      (1)   The modification will be compatible with adjacent structures and
uses and is consistent with the character of the neighborhood or district where
it is located;
      (2)   The modification is consistent with the purpose of the zoning
district, the General Plan, and any applicable specific plan or area plan
adopted by the City Council;
      (3)   The adjustment will not deprive neighboring property owners of the
reasonable economic use and/or enjoyment of their property; and
      (4)   The adjustment will not be materially detrimental to the public
health, safety or welfare.
   (G)   Effect of decision. A Director decision on a minor modification is
based on the merits of an individual application. Approval of a minor
modification does not establish a precedent for future similar applications.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19)
§ 155.412.080 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. This section establishes a procedure for requesting
reasonable accommodation in land use, zoning and building regulations to
provide persons with disabilities equal access to housing consistent with the
Federal Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq.) and the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act (Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 12955 et seq.). A reasonable
accommodation is typically a ministerial adjustment to physical design
standards to accommodate the placement of wheelchair ramps or other exterior
modifications to a dwelling in response to the needs of a disabled resident.
   (B)   When allowed.
      (1)   Eligible applicants. A request for reasonable accommodation may be
made by any person with a disability, their representative or any entity, when
the application of the Zoning Code or other land use or building regulation,
policy or practice acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities.
      (2)   Definition. A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY is a person who has a
physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more
major life activities, anyone who is regarded as having this type of impairment
or anyone who has a record of this type of impairment.
      (3)   Eligible request. A request for reasonable accommodation may
include a request for a modification or exception to the rules, standards and
practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing-related
facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers.
   (C)   Review authority. The Director takes action on all reasonable

§ 155.412.120 USE PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose. Use permits are required for land uses that are generally
appropriate within a zoning district, but where the potential impacts of the
use on a site and its surroundings must be evaluated, and where conditions of
approval may be needed. Use permits are discretionary actions that enable the
city to ensure that a proposed use is consistent with the General Plan and will
not create negative impacts to adjacent properties or the general public.
   (B)   Types of use permits. The Zoning Code establishes two types of use
permits: minor use permits and conditional use permits.
   (C)   Review authority.
      (1)   Minor use permits. The Director reviews and takes action on minor
use permit applications. The Director may refer any application to the Planning
Commission for public hearing and decision.
      (2)   Conditional use permits. The Planning Commission reviews and takes
action on conditional use permit applications.
   (D)   When required. Land uses that require a use permit are shown in the
land use regulation tables for each zoning district found in the Zoning
Districts subchapter.
   (E)   Public notice and hearing.
      (1)   Minor use permits. Notice of the Director's pending action on a
minor use permit application must be provided in compliance with §
155.408.090 (Notice of Pending Action). The Planning Commission will hold a
public hearing only after receiving a written request for a public hearing.
      (2)   Conditional use permits. The Planning Commission must review and
act on a conditional use permit application at a noticed public hearing in
compliance with §
155.408.100 (Public Hearings).
   (F)   Findings for approval. To approve a use permit, the review authority
must make all of the following findings:
      (1)   The proposed use is consistent with the General Plan, Zoning Code
and any applicable specific plan or area plan adopted by the City Council;
      (2)   The site is suitable for the size, design and operating
characteristics of the proposed use;
      (3)   The proposed use will be compatible with existing and planned land
uses in the vicinity of the property;
      (4)   The proposed use will not be detrimental to the public health,
safety and welfare; and
      (5)   The proposed use is properly located within the city and adequately
served by existing or planned services and infrastructure.
   (G)   Permits to run with the land. See §
155.420.120 (Permits to Run with the Land).
   (H)   Expiration of use permits. See §

§ 155.412.140 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Purpose. A variance is a discretionary approval that allows for
deviation from physical development standards in the Zoning Code. The city may
grant a variance only when the strict application of development standards
creates a unique hardship due to unusual circumstances associated with the
property.
   (B)   When allowed.
      (1)   Allowable variances. The city may grant a variance to allow for
deviation from any physical development standard that applies to the subject
property. Examples of physical development standards include height, setbacks,
open space, floor area ratio (FAR), and off-street parking requirements.
      (2)   Variances not allowed. A variance may not be granted to:
         (a)   Permit a use other than a use permitted in the zoning district
as specified in Part 2 (Zoning District Standards);
         (b)   Allow deviation from a requirement of the General Plan (e.g.,
maximum residential density in zoning district); and
         (c)   Allow deviations to Zoning Code standards to reduce construction
costs.
   (C)   Types of variances. The Zoning Code establishes two types of
variances: major variances and minor variances.
      (1)   Minor variance. A minor variance allows a deviation from a standard
by 20% or less.
      (2)   Major variances. A major variance allows a deviation from a
standard by more than 20%.
   (D)   Calculating deviations. A deviation allowed with a variance is
calculated as a percentage of the distance or area required by the standard.
For example, if the minimum required setback is 20 feet, the setback may be
reduced by four feet to 16 feet (a four-foot reduction is 20% of 20 feet). The
same setback may be reduced to any distance less than 16 feet with a major
variance.
   (E)   Review authority.
      (1)   Minor variance. The Director reviews and takes action on minor
variance applications. The Director may refer any application to the Planning
Commission for public hearing and decision.
      (2)   Major variances. The Planning Commission reviews and takes action
on major variance applications.
   (F)   Application submittal and review. Variance applications must be
submitted and reviewed in compliance with §
155.408 (Permit Requirements).
   (G)   Public notice and hearing.
      (1)   Minor variance. Public notice of the Director's pending action on a
minor variance permit application will be provided in compliance with §
155.408.090 (Notice of Pending Action). The Planning Commission will hold a
public hearing only after receiving a written request for a public hearing.
      (2)   Major variance. The Planning Commission must review and act on a
major variance application at a noticed public hearing in compliance with §
155.408.100 (Public Hearings).
   (H)   Findings for approval. To approve a variance, the review authority
must make all of the following findings:
      (1)   There are unique circumstances applicable to the subject property,
including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, that do not
generally apply to other properties in the vicinity or in the same zoning
district as the subject property;
      (2)   The strict application of the Zoning Code regulation would deprive
the subject property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity or
in the same zoning district as the subject property;
      (3)   The variance will not be materially detrimental to the public
health, safety, or welfare, or be injurious to the property or improvements in
the vicinity or in the same zoning district as the subject property; and
      (4)   The variance does not constitute a grant of special privilege
inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity or in
the same zoning district as the subject property.
   (I)   Precedent. The approval of a variance does not set a precedent for the
granting of any future variance. Each application must be considered only on
its individual merits.

§ 155.412.150 ZONING CLEARANCES.
   (A)   Purpose. A zoning clearance is a ministerial process to confirm that a
proposed structure or land use complies with the Zoning Code.
   (B)   When required. A zoning clearance is required before:
      (1)   An applicant establishes a land use permitted by right in the
zoning district;
      (2)   The city issues a new or modified business license; or
      (3)   The city issues a building permit, grading permit, or other
construction-related permit to:
         (a)   Establish a new structure or use;
         (b)   Move or reconstruct an existing structure;
         (c)   Modify an existing structure to accommodate a change in use; or
         (d)   Enlarge or expand an existing structure.
   (C)   Relationship to discretionary permits. When a project requires a
discretionary action, a discretionary approval serves as the equivalent of a
zoning clearance.
   (D)   Relationship to other ministerial approvals. When a project requires
another ministerial approval in addition to a zoning clearance (e.g., a
building permit approval), the ministerial approval serves as the equivalent of
a zoning clearance.
   (E)   Applicant requests. A property or business owner may request a zoning
clearance to provide documentation that an existing structure or use complies
with the Zoning Code.
   (F)   Review authority. A zoning clearance is approved by Department staff.
Controversial and complex projects will be referred to the Director for review
and approval.
   (G)   Applications. An application is not required for a zoning clearance,
unless the zoning clearance is the only city approval required for a project.
Department staff will review the project information submitted for a building
permit or other required city approvals when acting on the zoning clearance.
   (H)   Review and action.
      (1)   Department staff will review the project information to verify
compliance with the Zoning Code. If the project complies with all applicable
requirements, the Department staff must approve the zoning clearance.
      (2)   Zoning clearance approval may be in the form of a stamp, signature,
or other official notation on approved plans, a letter to the applicant, or
other similar certification or form.

§ 155.420.090 PERMIT/APPROVAL EXPIRATION.
   (A)   General. As provided in this division, permits and other approvals
listed in §
155.412 (Specific Permits and Approvals) automatically expire without further
action by the city unless:
      (1)   An extension of time is approved under §
155.420.100 (Extension of Time); or
      (2)   An alternative timeframe is established by the review authority in
accordance with §
155.420.100 (Extension of Time).
   (B)   Time limits.
      (1)   Permits and other approvals listed in §
155.412 (Specific Permits and Approvals) expire two years after approval if not
exercised. A permit/approval is exercised when:
         (a)   A building permit is issued and construction has commenced and
is diligently pursued to completion;
         (b)   A certificate of occupancy is issued; or
         (c)   The land use is established.
      (2)   After a permit/approval is exercised, the permit/approval expires
if, prior to occupancy, construction stops for three years.
   (C)   Discontinued uses.
      (1)   Approved use permits that have been vested pursuant to division (B)
above do not expire and remain in effect indefinitely unless the city revokes
the permit as provided in §
155.428.080 (Permit Revocation).
      (2)   If a land use authorized by a use permit ceases operations for any
period of time, the use permit remains valid and the land use may be re-
established without the need for a new use permit. A re-established use must
comply with all conditions of approval attached to the original permit.
      (3)   If a legally established land use without a required use permit
ceases operations for any period of time, the land use may be re-established
only after obtaining city approval of the required use permit.
   (D)   Effect of expiration.
      (1)   An expired permit/approval is void and of no further force and
effect. An applicant retains no rights previously granted under an expired
permit/approval.
      (2)   To establish a use or structure allowed by an expired permit/
approval, an applicant must apply for and receive city approval of a new
permit/approval.

expire under §
155.420.090 (Permit/Approval Expiration) in accordance with this division.
      (2)   An applicant may request two types of extensions:
         (a)   A one-year extension approved by the Director; and/or
         (b)   A two-year extension approved by the original review authority.
   (B)   All extension requests. All extension requests must comply with the
following:
      (1)   The applicant must submit to the Department a written extension
request no later than ten days before the permit/approval expiration date. The
request must be accompanied by all fees, information, and materials required by
the Department.
      (2)   Filing a written extension request suspends the expiration until
the review authority acts on the request. Building, grading, or other
construction-related permits associated with the permit/approval may not be

§ 155.424 NON-CONFORMITIES.
§ 155.424.010 PURPOSE.
   Except as otherwise provided herein, this section establishes regulations
for non-conformities, including, but not limited to site features, buildings,
signs, uses, and lots that were legally established prior to the adoption of
the current Zoning Code, but are prohibited, regulated, or restricted
differently under the current Code. These regulations are intended to:
   (A)   Recognize that some non-conforming uses and structures may contribute
in a positive manner to Eureka's unique sense of place and quality of life;
   (B)   Allow for the continued operation of non-conforming uses that are
compatible with neighboring properties;
   (C)   Allow for the continued use of, and improvement to, some non-
conforming structures;
   (D)   Require non-conforming site features to be brought into conformance
with the Zoning Code when reasonable to do so; and
   (E)   Allow for the development and use of legal non-conforming lots.
(Ord. 885-C.S., passed 5-21-19; Am. Ord. 916-C.S., passed 7-6-21; Am. Ord. 951-
C.S., passed 10-17-23)
§ 155.424.020 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Legal non-conformities only. This section applies to legally
established site features, buildings, uses, signs, and lots that do not conform
to the regulations of the zoning district in which they are located.
   (B)   Not applicable to violations.
      (1)   This section does not apply to non-conformities established in
violation of the Zoning Code, or the regulation in effect at the time the non-
conformity was established.
      (2)   A non-conformity that was illegally established is considered a
violation of the Zoning Code subject to §
155.428 (Enforcement and Penalties).
   (C)   Accessory dwelling units. An application for an accessory dwelling
unit shall not be denied because of non-conforming conditions that do not
present a threat to public health and safety and are not affected by the
construction of the accessory dwelling unit.
   (D)   Burden of proof.
      (1)   Any person asserting a right to a non-conformity has the burden of
proof to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Director, that the non-
conformity was legally established. The Director is not responsible to prove
the absence of a legal non-conformity.
      (2)   The Director's decision on the legal status of a non-conformity may
be appealed in accordance with §
155.416 (Appeals and Reviews).

§ 155.424.030 NON-CONFORMING SITE FEATURES.
   (A)   Applicability. This division applies to existing physical improvements
on a developed lot that do not conform to the Zoning Code, excluding buildings
and signs. See §
155.424.040 (Non-conforming Buildings) for rules that apply to houses, garages,
and other buildings on a lot, and §
155.424.050 (Non-conforming Signs) for rules that apply to signs.
   (B)   Required compliance. Unless excluded by division (D) below
(Exceptions), or the exemptions listed in each code section referenced below,
if a development project requires a building permit where the total
construction value is $55,000 or more, and/or requires a use permit, the
following non-conforming site features must be brought into compliance with the
Zoning Code:
      (1)   Landscaping. Landscaping required by §
155.328.040 (Required Landscape Areas) and §
155.328.050 (General Landscape Requirements);
      (2)   Parking lot landscaping. Parking lot landscaping required by §
155.324.080 (Parking Lot Landscaping) to the extent possible given the
configuration of existing development and physical site constraints. For
example, if the existing parking lot configuration and striping pattern can
only accommodate a two-foot perimeter buffer instead of the required four-foot
buffer, the two-foot buffer is allowed;
      (3)   Parking lot paving/striping. Parking lot paving and striping, as
required by city specifications, when parking lot is not paved or striped;
      (4)   Outdoor lighting. Outdoor lighting required by §
155.308.050 (Outdoor Lighting);
      (5)   Outdoor storage. Outdoor storage as required by §
155.304.110 (Outdoor Storage);
      (6)   Vision clearance area. Any site feature that conflicts with §

required by §
155.308.070 (Solid Waste/Recyclable Material Storage);
      (8)   Screening. Screening for adjacent residential zoning districts
required by §
155.308.060 (Screening for Residential Zoning Districts);
      (9)   Short-term bicycle parking. Short-term bicycle parking as required
by §
155.324.070 (Bicycle Parking); and
      (10)   Non-conforming signs. Non-conforming signs as required by §
155.424.050 (Non-conforming Signs).
   (C)   Annual adjustment. The $55,000 project valuation threshold in division
(B) above (Required Compliance) will be increased for inflation by 3% annually,
using 2023 as the base year.
   (D)   Exceptions.
      (1)   Construction project exceptions. The following development projects
are not subject to division (B) above (Required Compliance), and do not trigger
the need to bring non-conforming site features into compliance:
         (a)   Accessory dwelling units. This section does not apply to
applications for new construction, creation, or modification of an accessory
dwelling unit.
         (b)   Reroof. This section does not apply to applications for
residential or commercial reroof permits.
         (c)   Solar systems. This section does not apply to applications for
solar systems.
         (d)   ADA accessibility. This section does not apply to applications
for ADA accessibility additions or upgrades, when the project only consists of
the accessibility additions or upgrades. For example, installation of an
accessible ramp for a commercial office would not be subject to this section. A
tenant improvement for a commercial office which includes the addition of an
accessible ramp would be subject to this section.
         (e)   Electric vehicle charging stations. This section does not apply
to applications for electric vehicle (EV) charging station permits, when the
project only consists of the EV station addition or upgrade, and any associated
striping of the lot. For example, installation of an EV charging station at a
multi-family apartment would not be subject to this section. A remodel of an
apartment building which includes the addition of an EV charging station would
be subject to this section.
      (2)   Site feature exceptions. The following non-conforming site features
may continue and are not subject to division (B) above (Required Compliance):
         (a)   Fences and walls (§
155.320);
         (b)   Number of required on-site parking spaces (§
155.324.030);
         (c)   Long term bicycle parking (§
155.324.070);
         (d)   Parking design and development standards (§
155.324.060); and
         (e)   Other site features not specifically identified in division (B)
above (Required Compliance).
   (E)   Repairs and modifications.
      (1)   If a non-conforming site feature identified in division (B) above
(Required Compliance) is repaired or modified, the site feature must be brought
into compliance with the Zoning Code.
      (2)   A non-conforming site feature identified in division (D)(2) above
(Site Feature Exceptions) may be repaired or modified if the project does not
increase or exacerbate the non-conforming aspect of the site feature. For
example, a fence that exceeds the maximum height allowed by §
155.320 (Fences and Walls) may be repaired or replaced if the fence height is
not increased.
      (3)   A project that increases or exacerbates the non-conforming aspect
of any non-conforming site feature is subject to the permit requirements for
variances and minor modifications in §
155.412 (Specific Permits and Approvals). For example, increasing the height of
a nonconforming fence that exceeds the maximum height allowed by §
155.320 (Fences and Walls) requires a minor modification or variance. See §
155.412 (Specific Permits and Approvals); calculation of the percent deviation
for purposes of qualifying for a minor modification is based on the proposed
incremental increase in non-conformity.

§ 155.424.040 NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Applicability. This division applies to non-conforming houses,
garages, and other buildings as defined in §
155.508 (Defined Terms). See §
155.424.030 (Non-conforming Site Features) for rules that apply to other types
of non-conforming structures.
   (B)   Permitted modifications.
      (1)   A non-conforming building may be repaired, modified, or enlarged if
the project does not increase or exacerbate the non-conforming aspect of the
building. For example, a remodel of a home that exceeds the height standard but
that doesn't increase the home's height is allowed with a zoning clearance; no
other department permits are required.
      (2)   Unless otherwise allowed by this section, a project that increases
or exacerbates the non-conforming aspect of a building requires either a minor
modification or variance depending on the nature of the modification. For
example, a remodel that increases the height of a home exceeding the maximum
building height standard requires a minor modification or variance. See §
155.412 (Specific Permits and Approvals); calculation of the percent deviation
for purposes of qualifying for a minor modification is based on the proposed
incremental increase in non-conformity. For example, if a maximum permitted
height is 30 feet, and a non-conforming building is 35 feet tall, up to three
additional feet (10% of 30 feet) may be allowed with a minor modification,
allowing the building height to be increased to 38 feet.
   (C)   Expansions of use. An increase in floor area occupied by a permitted
use in a non-conforming building is allowed subject to the limitations in
division (B) above (Permitted Modifications).
   (D)   Established side setbacks for building additions. See §
155.204.030(G) (Established Side Setbacks for Building Additions).
   (E)   Demolition and reconstruction.
      (1)   Reconstruction defined. "Reconstructed" or "reconstruction" means
rebuilding a damaged or destroyed building in a manner similar but not
identical to the original structure. A reconstructed building generally
recreates the original building footprint, mass, and height, but may deviate
from design details such as architectural design and the arrangement of doors,
windows, and rooflines.
      (2)   Demolition.
         (a)   If a non-conforming building, or a portion of a non-conforming
building is demolished, whether as a result of involuntary damage or
destruction, or voluntary demolition, the building may be reconstructed as
shown in
Table 424-1.
 
Table 424-1: Permits Required to Reconstruct Demolished Non-conforming
Buildings
Linear Footage of the Interior and Exterior Building Walls Permit Required
Demolished or Removed
Less than 50%                                              By-right
50% or more                                                MUP
Note:
Removal of roof, foundation, or exterior sheathing is not included in
demolition calculation. Interior wall coverings (such as sheet rock) are
not considered walls.
 
         (b)   For reconstruction requiring a minor use permit, the Director
may attach conditions of approval as necessary to protect public health, safety
and welfare, including requirements to reduce or eliminate previously existing
non-conformities.
      (3)   No new or increased non-conformities. Reconstruction of damaged,
destroyed or voluntarily demolished buildings may not increase or exacerbate
previously existing non-conformities or create new non-conformities.
      (4)   Design review. Design review is required for 50% or more
reconstruction of a building under the same circumstances as is required for a
new building pursuant to §
155.412.040(B) (When Required) and §
155.412.040(C) (Exemptions).
      (5)   Design standards. Reconstructed non-residential, mixed-use, and
multi-family buildings must comply with the design standards in §
155.208.040 (Pedestrian-Focused Street Frontages), and §
155.312 (Design Standards), as applicable.
      (6)   Property line trespass. A reconstructed building may not trespass
across a property line and may not extend over or be located within the public
right-of-way.
      (7)   Timing of construction. The construction of the replacement
building must begin within two years of the date the structure was damaged or
destroyed.
      (8)   Buildings not reconstructed. If a damaged or destroyed non-
conforming building is replaced with a new building that does not meet the
definition of reconstruction, the new building must comply with all standards
of the applicable zoning district or obtain a variance (§
155.412.140) or minor modification (§
155.412.070) depending on the nature of the deviations from applicable
standards.
   (F)   Relocated buildings. A non-conforming building that is moved to a new
location must conform to all standards of the applicable zoning district.

   (A)   Applicability. This division applies to signs as defined in §
155.508 (Defined Terms) that are non-conforming.
   (B)   Continuation. Except as otherwise required by this division, a non-
conforming sign may continue its use as a sign if it was legally established in
compliance with all applicable regulations in effect at the time the sign was
installed. It is the applicant's responsibility to demonstrate that the sign
was legally established.
   (C)   Allowed changes.
      (1)   Changes to sign copy/face and repainting of non-conforming signs is
permitted as long as there is no alteration to the physical structure or
support elements of the sign.
      (2)   Routine repairs and maintenance may be performed on a non-
conforming sign. Routine repair and maintenance does not include 50% or more
replacement of the physical structure, or expansion or enlargement of the
physical structure or sign.
      (3)   A non-conforming sign that sustains less than 50% damage to its
structure may be repaired to its original pre-damaged condition, provided that
such repair is completed within 180 days after the date of the damage. The
replacement of 50% or more of the sign's structure is not repair and
maintenance but instead constitutes a replacement structure requiring
compliance with current permitting and development standards.
   (D)   Required compliance.
      (1)   Sign installed on or after January 1, 2000. A non-conforming sign
installed on or after January 1, 2000 must be removed or brought into
compliance with this section when:
         (a)   The sign is damaged or requires maintenance and the cost of
repair exceeds 50% of the replacement value;
         (b)   The sign is relocated to a different lot or building; or
         (c)   The Director determines the sign has become a public nuisance or
hazard due to inadequate maintenance or dilapidation in accordance with §
155.340.080(E) (Maintenance).
      (2)   Sign installed before January 1, 2000. A non-conforming sign
installed before January 1, 2000 must be removed or brought into compliance
with this section when:
         (a)   The sign is associated with a development project requiring a
building permit where the total construction value is $55,000 or more. The
$55,000 project valuation threshold will be increased for inflation by 3%
annually, using 2023 as the base year;
         (b)   A new use requiring a use permit occupies the tenant space
served by the sign;
         (c)   The sign is located on a remodeled building façade;
         (d)   The building containing the use advertised by the sign is
enlarged by 10% or more;
         (e)   The sign is damaged or requires maintenance and the cost of
repair exceeds 50% of the replacement value;
         (f)   The sign is relocated to a different lot or building; or
         (g)   The Director determines the sign has become a public nuisance or
hazard due to inadequate maintenance or dilapidation in accordance with §
155.340.080(E) (Maintenance).
   (E)   Digital signs. Non-conforming digital signs must comply with the
design, message, and brightness standards in
Table 340-9 in

   (A)   Continuation allowed. A non-conforming use may continue subject to the
requirements of this section.
   (B)   Intensification of use. A minor use permit is required to increase the
floor or site area occupied by a non-conforming use and/or intensify the
operation of a non-conforming use in any way.
   (C)   Change in ownership, tenancy, or management. A change in ownership,
tenancy, or management of a non-conforming use does not affect its legal non-
conforming status.
   (D)   Uses without required permits. A legally established use that is
allowed in a zoning district but which lacks a required permit (e.g.,
conditional use permit) is considered a non-conforming use until the use
receives the permit(s) required by the Zoning Code.
   (E)   Expiration of legal non-conforming status. A legally established non-
conforming use that ceases to operate for a period of six consecutive months or
more is no longer considered legal non-conforming and the use may not be re-
established. A use ceases to operate when a site is vacant or when a use is
non-operational for any reason other than a natural disaster or illness/death
of an owner/immediate family member.

alteration or enlargement of a structure, there shall be provided off-street
parking facilities for automobiles in accord with the schedule of off-street
parking space requirements prescribed in § 155.117 of this subchapter. For the
purposes of this section, the terms MAJOR ALTERATION or ENLARGEMENT shall mean
a change of use or an addition which would increase the number of parking
spaces required by not less than 10% of the total number required. The number
of parking spaces provided for a major alteration or enlargement of a site or
structure shall be in addition to the number existing prior to the alteration
or enlargement unless the preexisting number is greater than the number
prescribed in § 155.117 of this subchapter, in which instance the number in
excess of the prescribed minimum shall be counted in calculating the number
provided to serve the major alteration or enlargement.
   (B)   If, in the application of the requirements of this subchapter, a
fractional number is obtained, one parking space shall be provided for a
fraction of one-half or more, and no parking space shall be required for a
fraction of less than one-half.
   (C)   For a use not specified in § 155.117 of this subchapter, the same
number of off-street parking spaces shall be provided as is required for the
most similar specified use as determined by the Director of Community
Development.
   (D)   The facilities required by these requirements represent the minimum
that will be required by the various land use types. It shall be the
responsibility of the developer, owner or operator of any specific use to
provide adequate off-street parking even though such parking is in excess of
the minimum requirements set forth in these requirements.

excess of the prescribed minimum shall be counted in calculating the number
provided to serve the major alteration or enlargement.
   (B)   Off-street loading berths in addition to those prescribed in the
schedule of off-street loading berth requirements shall be provided if the
Director of Community Development finds that such additional berths are
necessary to ensure that trucks will not be loaded, unloaded, or stored on
public streets. A finding shall be based on an investigation of the anticipated
frequency of truck pickups and deliveries and of the truck storage requirements
of the use for which the off-street loading berths are required.

§ 155.162 ILLUMINATION; MOVEMENT.
   (A)   Illuminated signs.
      (1)   Any illuminated sign shall substantially comply with the average
light levels recommended by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North
America (IESNA):
 
Light colors Dark surroundings   20 footcandles
Dark colors  Dark surroundings   50 footcandles
Light colors Bright surroundings 50 footcandles
Dark colors  Bright surroundings 100 footcandles
 
      (2)   Whenever illumination is in issue, the Director of Community
Development may require submission for his review a computer lighting study by
the manufacturer of all lamps used in the particular lighting application. The
Director of Community Development may require that lamps in use produce average
light levels which, in the opinion of the Director, substantially comply with
the standards of the IESNA stated above, or as may be amended from time to time
to reflect changes in the state of the art of illumination as approved by the
IESNA.
      (3)   All indirectly illuminated light levels shall be measured in
footcandles according to the standards of the IESNA as illuminance falling on
the sign face and not as reflectance off the sign face. A sign owner must
produce the requested computer lighting study within 30 days. If the study is
not produced, the city may contract for the performance of a lighting study to
establish the levels of illuminance falling on the particular sign face in
issue and bill the sign or property owner (as appropriate) for the cost of the
lighting study.
   (B)   Sign illumination shall be maintained constant in intensity, color,
and pattern at all times when the sign is lighted. No sign illumination shall
be of such brightness as to create annoying or hazardous glare or an annoying
halo effect.
   (C)   No movement, or apparent movement of, or in, a sign shall be
permitted. A time or temperature sign, barber pole, or a theater canopy sign
consistent with other regulations of this subchapter shall be permitted.
   (D)   Whenever the Director of Community Development may reasonably find
that a particular lighting application is not in substantial compliance with
the recommended light levels established by the IESNA as stated herein, then
the Director of Community Development may proceed to abate the condition as a
nuisance in accordance with the provisions of § 150.041(A)(4) of this title.
   (E)   Electronic message centers.
      (1)   Electronic message centers (EMC) shall comply with the brightness
criteria based on the International Sign Association (ISA) Electronic Message
Display Brightness Guide.
      (2)   EMC illumination shall be limited to the difference between off and
solid-message measurements using the EMC Measurement Criteria, and shall not
exceed 0.3 footcandles at night.
         (a)   The illuminance of an EMC shall be measured with an illuminance
meter set to measure footcandles accurate to at least two decimals.
         (b)   Illuminance shall be measured with the EMC off, and again with
the EMC displaying a white image for a full color-capable EMC, or a solid
message for a single-color EMC.
         (c)   All measurements shall be taken perpendicular to the face of the
EMC at the distance determined by the total square footage of the EMC as set
forth in the Sign Area Versus Measurement Distance table.
      (3)   All permitted EMCs shall be equipped with a sensor or other device
that automatically determines the ambient illumination and programmed to
automatically dim according to ambient light conditions, or that can be
adjusted to comply with the 0.3 footcandle measurements.
      (4)   The image on electronic message centers shall not change.

   (A)   No structure, the use of which is nonconforming, and no nonconforming
sign shall be moved, altered, or enlarged unless required by law or unless the
moving, alteration, or enlargement will result in the elimination of the
nonconformity, except that a structure housing a nonconforming residential use
in an A, R, OR, HM, C, ML, NR or S District may be altered or enlarged,
provided that the number of dwelling units is not increased.
   (B)   No structure partially occupied by a nonconforming use shall be moved,
altered, or enlarged in such a way as to permit the enlargement of the space
occupied by the nonconforming use, except as permitted in this section.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A) of this section, no nonconforming
use shall be enlarged or extended in such a way as to occupy any part of the
structure or site or another structure or site which it did not occupy on

caused it to become a nonconforming use, or in such a way as to displace any
conforming use occupying a structure or site, except as permitted in this
section.
   (D)   Except as provided in division (H) of this section, no nonconforming
structure shall be altered or reconstructed so as to increase the discrepancy
between existing conditions and the standards for front yard, side yards, rear
yard, height of structures, distances between structures, courts, or usable
open space prescribed in the regulations for the district in which the
structure is located. No nonconforming structure shall be moved or enlarged
unless the new location or enlargement shall conform to the standards for front

   (A)   Whenever a structure which does not comply with the standards for
front yard, side yards, rear yard, height of structures, distances between
structures, courts, or usable open space prescribed in the regulations for the
district in which the structure is located, or the use of which does not
conform with the regulations for the district in which it is located, is
destroyed by fire or other calamity, by act of God, or by the public enemy to
the extent of 50% or less, the structure may be restored and the nonconforming
use may be resumed provided restoration is started within one year and
diligently pursued to completion.
   (B)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, whenever a
structure which does not comply with the standards for front yard, side yards,
rear yard, height of structures, distances between structures, courts, or
usable open space prescribed in the regulations for the district in which it is
located, or the use of which does not conform with the regulations for the
district in which it is located, is destroyed by fire or other calamity, by act
of God, or by the public enemy to an extent greater than 50% or is voluntarily
razed or is required by law to be razed, the structure shall not be restored
except in full conformity with the regulations for the district in which it is

Development shall determine that the structure will be suitable for occupancy
by a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
   (C)   The extent of damage or partial destruction shall be based upon the
ratio of the estimated cost of restoring the structure to its condition prior
to such damage or partial destruction to the estimated cost of duplicating the
entire structure as it existed prior thereto. Estimates for this purpose shall
be made by, or shall be reviewed and approved by, the Director of Public Works.
   (D)   This section shall not apply to historic structures, as defined in
this subchapter.
   (E)   Previously existing structures on properties that are listed on the
Local Register of Historic Places may be reconstructed on their previously
existing footprint provided:
      (1)   Proof of the previous existence of the structure, and the location
on the property is provided to the satisfaction of the Community Development
Department. Proof shall include, but not be limited to, Sanborn maps, personal
photographs, old plans, historical photographs, Assessor's records, witness
marks, or foundations;
      (2)   The Building Code can allow the proposed reconstruction;
      (3)   The use complies with the existing underlying zoning and
development standards, excluding setbacks; and
      (4)   Reconstruction shall comply with the current Building Code in
effect at the time of application for reconstruction.

DETERMINATION AS TO USES NOT LISTED
§ 155.265 PURPOSE AND INITIATION.
   In order to ensure that the zoning regulations will permit all similar uses
in each district, the Planning Commission, upon its own initiative or upon
written request, shall determine whether a use not specifically listed as a
permitted use or a conditional use in an F, A, OR, HM, C, or M District shall
be deemed a permitted use or a conditional use in one or more districts on the
basis of similarity to uses specifically listed. The procedures of this
subchapter shall not be substituted for the amendment procedure as a means of
adding new uses to the lists of permitted uses and conditional uses but shall
be followed to determine whether the characteristics of a particular use not
listed are sufficiently similar to a listed use to justify a finding that the
use should be deemed a permitted use or a conditional use in one or more
districts.
('63 Code, § 10-5.2301) (Ord. 80-C.S., passed 10-16-66)
§ 155.266 APPLICATIONS.
   Applications for determinations that specific uses should be included as
permitted uses or conditional uses in an F, A, OR, HM, C, or M District shall
be made in writing to the Director of Community Development and shall include a
detailed description of the proposed use and such other information as may be
required by the Director of Community Development to facilitate the
determination.

§ 155.267 INVESTIGATIONS AND REPORTS.
   The Director of Community Development shall make such investigations of the
application as he deems necessary to compare the nature and characteristics of
the proposed use with those of the uses specifically listed in this chapter and
shall prepare a report thereon which shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission to aid the Commission in making its determination of the
classification of the proposed use.

CONDITIONAL USES
§ 155.280 PURPOSES AND AUTHORIZATION.
   In order to give the district use regulations the flexibility necessary to
achieve the objectives of this chapter, in certain districts conditional uses
shall be permitted subject to the granting of a use permit. Because of their
unusual characteristics, conditional uses require special consideration so that
they may be located properly with respect to the objectives of the zoning
regulations and with respect to their effects on surrounding properties. In
order to achieve these purposes, the Planning Commission is empowered to grant
and deny applications for use permits for such conditional uses in such
districts as are prescribed in the district regulations and to impose
reasonable conditions upon the granting of use permits, subject to the right of
appeal to the Council or to review by the Council.
('63 Code, § 10-5.2401) (Ord. 80-C.S., passed 10-16-66)

street parking and off-street loading facilities, landscaped areas, fences and
walls; and,
      (3)   The Director of Community Development may require additional
information, plans, and drawings if they are necessary to enable the Planning
Commission to determine whether the proposed use will comply with all the
applicable provisions of this chapter. The Director may authorize omission of
any or all of the plans and drawings required by this section if they are not
necessary.
   (C)   Fees. The application shall be accompanied by a fee established by

VARIANCES
§ 155.310 PURPOSES AND AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   A variance is a waiver or modification of certain requirements
prescribed in this chapter. The variance process provides for modifications of
zoning requirements when the strict application of a given set of requirements
will result in a practical difficulty or unnecessary physical hardship.
   (B)   The Planning Commission and the Director of Community Development is
empowered to grant variances in order to prevent or lessen such practical
difficulties and unnecessary physical hardships inconsistent with the
objectives of this chapter as would result from a strict or literal
interpretation and enforcement of certain of the regulations. A practical
difficulty or unnecessary physical hardship may result from the size, shape, or
dimensions of a site or the location of existing structures thereon, from
geographic, topographic, or other physical conditions on the site or in the
immediate vicinity, or from population densities, street locations, or traffic
conditions in the immediate vicinity. Cost to the applicant of strict or
literal compliance with a regulation shall not be the sole reason for granting
a variance.
   (C)   The power to grant variances shall not extend to use regulations.
Variances which request approval to locate a use in a zoning district in which
it is not allowed are specifically prohibited.
   (D)   The Director of Community Development shall have the following
variance granting authority:
      (1)   Authority to grant 100% variances on all fences, walls, hedges,
screening, landscaping, site area, width, frontage, and signs.
      (2)   Authority to grant 50% variances with regard to front, side, and
rear yards; basic floor area; height of structures; distance between
structures; courts; usable open space; and off-street parking and loading
facilities. No public hearing shall be required on variances approved by the
Director of Community Development. The Director may, at his or her discretion,
schedule for hearing by the Planning Commission any application for a variance
under his or her authority.

this subchapter, the application shall be accompanied by an accurate scale
drawing of the site and the surrounding area for a distance of at least 100
feet from each boundary of the site, showing the existing locations of streets
and property lines.
      (3)   The Director of Community Development may require additional
information, plans, and drawings if they are necessary to enable a
determination as to whether the circumstances prescribed for the granting of a
variance exist. The Director may authorize omission of any or all of the plans
and drawings required by this action if they are not necessary.
   (C)   Fees. The application shall be accompanied by a fee established by
resolution of the Council to cover the cost of handling the application as

   The Planning Commission or Director of Community Development may grant a
variance to a regulation prescribed by this chapter with respect to fences,
walls, hedges, screening or landscaping; site area; height of structures; or
distances between structures, courts or usable open space as the variance was
applied for, or in modified form, if on the basis of the application and the
evidence submitted, the Commission or the Director of Community Development
makes findings of fact that establish the following:
   (A)   That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety, or welfare or materially injurious to properties or
improvements in the vicinity; and,
   (B)   That the granting of the variance will not constitute a grant of
special privilege inconsistent with the limitations on other properties
classified in the same zoning district, and one of the following findings:
      (1)   That the strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the
specified regulation would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary
physical hardship inconsistent with the objectives of this chapter;
      (2)   That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the
property that do not apply generally to other properties classified in the same
zoning district; or,
      (3)   That the strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the
specified regulation would deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by the
owners of other properties classified in the same zoning district.
   (C)   In the coastal zone granting of variances is consistent with and
implements the certified local coastal program, and that the granting of such
variances does not reduce or in any way adversely affect the requirements to
protect coastal resources as specified in the zones included in this chapter,
and that the variance implements the purposes of the zones adopted in
implementation of the local coastal program.

the Commission or Director of Community Development makes findings of fact that
establish that the circumstances prescribed in § 155.316 of this subchapter
and, for signs in the coastal zone, those in § 155.156 of this chapter apply
and the following circumstances also apply:
      (1)   That the granting of the variance will not detract from the
attractiveness or orderliness of the city's appearance;
      (2)   That the granting of the variance will not introduce an
inharmonious visual element into the district in which the sign would be
located; and,

Director of Community Development makes findings of fact that establish that
the circumstances prescribed in §
155.316 of this subchapter apply and the following circumstances also apply:
      (1)   That neither present nor anticipated future traffic volumes
generated by the use of the site or the uses of sites in the vicinity
reasonably require strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the
specified regulation;
      (2)   That the granting of the variance will not result in the parking or
loading of vehicles on public streets in such a manner as to interfere with the
free flow of traffic on streets; and,

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as “the Zoning Regulations of
the City for the Coastal Zone.”
('63 Code, § 10-5.2901) (Ord. 417-C.S., passed 12-6-84)
§ 156.002 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSES.
   The purposes of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect, maintain, and where feasible, enhance and restore the overall
quality of the coastal zone environment and its natural and human-created
resources.
   (B)   Assure orderly, balanced utilization and conservation of coastal zone
resources, taking into account the social and economic needs of the people of
this city, the region, state, and nation.
   (C)   Maximize public access to and along the Humboldt Bay shoreline, and
maximize public recreational opportunities in the coastal zone, consistent with
sound resource conservation principles and constitutionally protected rights of
private property owners.
   (D)   Assure priority for coastal-dependent and coastal-related development
over other developments on the shoreline.
   (E)   Provide a definite plan for development so as to guide the future
growth of the city within the coastal zone.
   (F)   Protect the social and economic character and stability of
residential, commercial, agricultural and industrial areas within the city.
('63 Code, § 10-5.2902) (Ord. 417-C.S., passed 12-6-84)
§ 156.003 NATURE OF COASTAL ZONING REGULATIONS.
   This chapter shall consist of two land use and zoning maps. Map 1 depicts
that part of the city's coastal zone west and south from the easternmost point
of Daby Island to the southerly city limits. Map 2 depicts that part of the
city's coastal zone east, southeast, and northeast from Daby Island to the
northeasterly city limits at Indianola. The zoning maps designate specific
districts and establish a set of regulations to control the uses of land and
water within the city's coastal zone; the density of population; the bulk,
locations, and uses of structures; the areas and dimensions of sites; the
appearance of certain uses, structures, and signs; the provision of usable open
space, including public access, screening, and landscaping; off-street parking
and loading facilities; and the location of signs. The zoning maps shall be
maintained in the Department of Community Development and be available for
public inspection and use at the public counter of the Department during normal
business hours.
('63 Code, § 10-5.2903) (Ord. 417-C.S., passed 12-6-84)
§ 156.004 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements. No provision of this chapter
is intended to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any provision
of this code; provided, however, where the provisions of this chapter impose a
greater restriction on the use of land or structures, or the height or bulk of
structures, or require greater open spaces about structures, or greater areas
or dimensions of sites, or impose a greater restriction on the location, size,
illumination, or subject matter of signs than is imposed or required by other
provisions of this code, the provisions of this chapter shall control. If any
conflict occurs between one or more provisions of this chapter, such conflict
shall be resolved in a manner which on balance is the most protective of
significant coastal resources. If any provision of this chapter conflicts with
any provision of any regulation contained in any previously adopted ordinance
of the city, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter are not intended to abrogate, annul,
impair, or interfere with any deed restriction, covenant, easement, or other
agreement between parties; provided, however, where the provisions of this
chapter impose a greater restriction on the use of land or structures, or the
height or bulk of structures, or require greater open spaces about structures,
or greater areas or dimensions of sites than is imposed or required by deed
restriction, covenant, easement, or other agreement, the provisions of this
chapter shall control.
('63 Code, § 10-5.2904) (Ord. 417-C.S., passed 12-6-84)

suitable for ornamenting the site. The landscaped area provided for an
expansion of a use in an OR District shall be in addition to landscaped area
existing prior to the expansion unless the pre-existing area exceeds the
required minimum, in which instance it shall be counted in calculating the
total area required. Landscaping required by §
156.040(D) of this title shall be counted in calculating the total area
required.
   (G)   Screening and landscaping materials and maintenance. Screening shall
consist of a solid wall or fence, vine-covered fence, or compact evergreen
hedge. Hedge materials used as screening shall be not less than three feet in
height when planted, and shall not be permitted to exceed the maximum specified
height by more than 1½ feet. Where buffers of trees are required, they shall
have a mature height of not more than 40 feet and shall be planted not more

COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
§ 156.050 APPLICATION.
   The following development standards shall apply to all development proposed
within the coastal zone.
('63 Code, § 10-5.2940) (Ord. 417-C.S., passed 12-6-84)
§ 156.051 PUBLIC ACCESS STANDARDS.
   (A)   Access protection and enhancement. The city, through the non-profit
organization created by Implementing Action 3 of Chapter 3 of the Local Coastal
Program Land Use Plan, shall protect and enhance the public's right of access
to and along the shoreline by:
      (1)   Utilizing the non-profit organization to accept offers of
dedication that will increase opportunities for public access and recreation
consistent with the Local Coastal Program and the availability of necessary
non-profit organization staff and funding to improve and maintain accessways
and assume liability for them;
      (2)   Actively seeking other public, community non-profit, or private
agencies to accept offers of dedications and having them assume liability and
maintenance responsibilities; and
      (3)   Allowing only such development as will not interfere with the
public's right of access to the sea, where such right was acquired through use
or legislative authorization, including, but not limited to, the use of dry
sand and rocky coastal beaches or shoreline to the first line of terrestrial
vegetation.
   (B)   Vertical access easement. For new development between the first public
road and the sea, a vertical access easement to the mean high tide line shall
be granted unless:
      (1)   Another more suitable public access corridor is available or
proposed by the Local Coastal Program within 500 feet of the site;
      (2)   Access at the site would be inconsistent with other Local Coastal
Program policies, including existing, expanded, or new coastal dependent
industry, agricultural operations, or the protection of fragile coastal
resources; or,
      (3)   Access at the site is inconsistent with public safety or military
security needs. Consistent with Coastal Act Section 30212(b), the term “new
development” does not include replacement of any structure pursuant to Section
30610(g); the demolition and reconstruction of any single-family residence,
provided it is sited in the same location and does not exceed the former
structure by more than 10% in floor area, height, or bulk; improvements to any
structure which do not change its intensity of use, nor increase its height,
bulk, or floor area by more than 10%, do not block or impede public access, and
which do not result in a seaward encroachment by the structure; and any repair
or maintenance activity for which the Coastal Commission has determined,
pursuant to Coastal Act Section 30610, that a coastal development permit will
be required unless the Commission determines or has determined that such
activity will have an adverse impact on lateral public access along the beach.
   (C)   Lateral access easement. For new development between the first public
road and the sea, a lateral access easement along the shoreline shall be
required unless:
      (1)   Lateral access at the site would be inconsistent with other Local
Coastal Program policies, including existing, expanded, or new coastal
dependent industry, agricultural operations, or the protection of fragile
natural resources; or,
      (2)   Access is inconsistent with public safety or military security
needs. The term “new development” shall be defined for purposes of this section
in the same manner as it is defined in Local Coastal Program Policy 3.2 of the
Local Coastal Program Land Use Plan.
   (D)   Access standards.
      (1)   The access standards and recommendations contained in the State
Coastal Conservancy/Coastal Commission “Report on Coastal Access” (Revised,
August, 1980) shall constitute the criteria for improvement, maintenance, and
management of accessways and supporting facilities proposed in the Local
Coastal Program.
      (2)   Measures for guaranteeing public access.
         (a)   Legal instruments required. Prior to issuance of a coastal
development permit where a public accessway is required in this Local Coastal
Program, each applicant shall record one of the following legal documents as
specified in the conditions of approval:
            1.   Irrevocable offer of dedication. The applicant shall submit a
preliminary title report and record an irrevocable offer to dedicate the access
easement or the fee interest in the accessway, as described in the permit
conditions, free of prior liens or encumbrances, except for tax liens. This
offer can be accepted within 21 years by the nonprofit agency set forth in
Implementation Action 3 of Chapter 3 of the Land Use Plan, or another
appropriate agency. Until this offer is accepted or until the landowner allows,
the public has no right to use the accessway.
            2.   Outright grant of fee interest or easement. If the project if
important in and of itself for public access needs, the size and scope of the
proposed development is such that an out-right interest is appropriate, or
there is an accepting agency available to accept the easement, as in
subdivision map approvals, a grant of an easement or fee interest can be
required prior to issuance of the permit. Until such a grant is accepted by the
nonprofit agency set forth in Implementation Action 3 of Chapter 3 of the Land
Use Plan, any other public agency or private nonprofit organization which
agrees to accept the grant, or until the land-owner allows, the public has no
right to use the accessway.
         (b)   Required information. As a condition of the issuance of a
permit, title information and all necessary subordination agreements shall be
required. Title insurance may also be required when extensive easements are
being granted. The amount of the title insurance shall be estimated on the
basis of what it would cost to acquire an equivalent area for recreational use
elsewhere in the vicinity.
         (c)   Procedures.
            1.   Copies of the documents to be recorded by the applicant, (for
example, title report and permit) shall be forwarded to the City Attorney for
review prior to recordation.
            2.   The City Attorney and the accepting agency may make minor
revisions to the documents, such as corrections in the legal description and
minor revisions to the location and use of the accessways in order to open them
for public use and to assure that the public right of access along dry sandy
beaches, blufftop parcels, or vertical accessways is protected and capable of
being implemented.
   (E)   Public access support facilities. As indicated in the policies of
Chapter 3 of the Local Coastal Program Land Use Plan and the Local Coastal
Program access maps in Chapter 15 of the Land Use Plan, public access support
facilities shall be distributed throughout the city coastal zone. Off-street
parking shall be provided in the waterfront area; however, it shall not be
located immediately adjacent to the shoreline, unless there is no feasible
alternative.
   (F)   Access for handicapped. Public access to the waterfront, including
support facilities, shall, to the maximum extent feasible, provide for access
by handicapped persons.
('63 Code, § 10-5.2941) (Ord. 417-C.S., passed 12-6-84; Am. Ord. 519-C.S.,
passed 8-26-90)
Penalty, see § 150.999
§ 156.052 ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Mitigation. Channelizations or other substantial alterations that
could significantly disrupt the habitat values of rivers and streams shall
incorporate the best mitigation measures feasible, and be limited to necessary
water supply projects, flood control projects where no other method for
protecting existing structures in the flood plain is feasible and where such
protection is necessary for public safety or to protect existing development,
or developments where the primary function is the improvement of fish and
wildlife habitat.
   (B)   Permitted shoreline construction. Revetments, breakwaters, groins,
harbor channels, seawalls, cliff retaining walls, and other such construction
that alters natural shoreline processes shall be permitted when required to
serve coastal-dependent uses or to protect existing structures or public
beaches in danger from erosion and when designed to eliminate or mitigate
adverse impacts on local shoreline sand supply. Existing marine structures
causing water stagnation contributing to pollution problems and fish kills
should be phased out or upgraded where feasible.
   (C)   Environmentally sensitive habitat areas.
      (1)   Environmentally sensitive habitat areas within the city's coastal
zone shall include:
         (a)   Rivers, creeks, sloughs, gulches and associated riparian
habitats, including Eureka Slough, Fay Slough, Cut-Off Slough, Freshwater
Slough, Cooper Slough, Second Sloughs, Third Slough, and Elk River.
         (b)   Wetlands and estuaries, including that portion of Humboldt Bay
within the city's jurisdiction, riparian areas, and vegetated dunes.
         (c)   Indian Island, Daby Island, and Woodley Island wildlife area.
         (d)   Other habitat areas, such as rookeries, and rare or endangered
species on state or federal lists.
         (e)   Grazed or farmed wetlands.
      (2)   These areas are generally portrayed on the resources maps, where
they are designated as wetlands or other natural resources.
   (D)   Protection of environmentally sensitive habitat areas. Environmentally
sensitive habitat areas shall be protected against any significant disruption
of habitat values, and only uses dependent on such resources, including
restoration and enhancement projects, shall be allowed within such areas.
Development in areas adjacent to environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall
be sited and designed to prevent impacts which would significantly degrade such
areas, and shall be compatible with the continuance of such habitat areas.
   (E)   Development in or near natural resource areas. Prior to the approval
of a development permit, all developments on lots or parcels shown on the land
use plan and/or resource maps with a natural resource designation or within 250
feet of such designation, or development affecting an environmentally sensitive
habitat area, shall be found to be in conformity with the applicable habitat
protection policies of the Local Coastal Program. All development plans and
grading plans shall show the precise location of the habitat(s) potentially
affected by the proposed project and the manner in which they will be
protected, enhanced, or restored. Projects which could adversely impact an
environmentally sensitive habitat area may be subject to a site inspection by a
qualified biologist to be selected jointly by the city and the applicant. Where
mitigation, restoration, or enhancement activities are required to be performed
pursuant to other applicable portions of this Local Coastal Program, they shall
be required to be performed on city-owned lands on the Elk River Spit or on
other available and suitable mitigation, restoration, or enhancement sites.
   (F)   Diking, filling, or dredging. The diking, filling or dredging of open
coastal waters, wetlands, or estuaries shall be permitted only where all of the
following exist:
      (1)   The diking, filling or dredging is for a permitted use in that
resource area as provided in Land Use Plan Policies 5.12 through 5.16;
      (2)   There is no feasible, less environmentally damaging alternative;
      (3)   Feasible mitigation measures have been provided to minimize adverse
environmental effects, consistent with Land Use Plan Policy 5.10; and,
      (4)   The functional capacity of the resources area is maintained or
enhanced, consistent with Land Use Plan Policy 5.10.
   (G)   Dredging and spoils disposal. Dredging and spoils disposal shall be
carried out to avoid significant disruption to marine and wildlife habitats and
water circulation. Dredge spoils suitable for beach replenishment should be
transported for such purposes to appropriate beaches or into suitable longshore
current systems.
   (H)   Wetland or estuary development.
      (1)   Diking, filling or dredging of a wetland or estuary shall maintain
or enhance its functional capacity.
      (2)   Functional capacity, the ability of the wetland or estuary to be
self-sustaining and to maintain natural species diversity. In order to
establish that the functional capacity is being maintained, all of the
following must be demonstrated:
         (a)   That presently occurring plant and animal populations in the
ecosystem will not be altered in a manner that would impair the long-term
stability of the ecosystem, such as, natural species diversity, abundance and
composition are essentially unchanged as a result of the project;
         (b)   That a species that is rare or endangered will not be
significantly adversely affected;
         (c)   That a species or habitat essential to the natural biological
functioning of the wetland or estuary will not be significantly adversely
affected;
         (d)   That consumptive (such as, fishing, aquaculture and hunting) or
nonconsumptive (such as, water quality and research opportunity) values of the
wetland or estuaries ecosystem will not be significantly reduced.
   (I)   Conditions.
      (1)   Dredging, when consistent with these provisions and where necessary
for the maintenance of the tidal flow and continued viability of the wetland
habitat or for flood control purposes, shall be subject to the following
conditions:
         (a)   Dredging shall be prohibited in breeding and nursery areas and
during periods of fish migration and spawning.
         (b)   Dredging shall be limited to the smallest area feasible.
         (c)   Designs for dredging and excavation projects shall include
protective measures such as silt curtains, weirs, and the like, to protect
water quality in adjacent areas during construction by preventing the discharge
of refuse, petroleum spills, and unnecessary dispersal of silt materials.
      (2)   Diking or filling of a wetland shall at a minimum, require the
following mitigation, restoration, or enhancement measures:
         (a)   A detailed restoration or enhancement plan shall be required for
each specific restoration or enhancement site prior to commencement of any
development that is permitted as part of such a restoration or enhancement
project. The restoration or enhancement plans shall include provisions for
purchase, if required, and restoration or enhancement, as determined in
consultation with the Department of Fish and Game, Coastal Commission, and
Coastal Conservancy, of an equivalent area of equal or greater productivity,
and dedication of the land to a public agency or other method which permanently
restricts the use of the site to habitat and open space purposes. The
restoration or enhancement site shall be purchased or otherwise made available
prior to any diking or filling activity.
         (b)   Equivalent areas shall be opened to tidal action or other
sources of surface water shall be provided. This provision applies to diked or
filled areas which themselves are not environmentally sensitive habitat areas,
but would become so if they were opened to tidal action or provided with other
sources of surface water. All of the provisions for restoration, purchase (if
necessary), and dedication contained in subsection (a) of this division, shall
apply to any program or activity performed pursuant to this section.
         (c)   Mitigation or restoration activities shall, to the maximum
extent feasible, be of the same type as the wetland to be filled (such as,
freshwater marsh for freshwater marsh, saltwater marsh for saltwater marsh, and
the like).
         (d)   An applicant who is required to participate in a restoration or
mitigation program may avail himself or herself of restoration or enhancement
sites on city-owned lands on the Elk River Spit, consistent with all other
applicable policies of Land Use Plan Chapter 5 and this chapter, and at a cost
not to exceed $0.25 for each square foot of affected marsh or other wetland.
         (e)   For permissible wetland restoration projects identified in Land
Use Plan Policy 5.12(b), any coastal development permit issued for one or a
combination of projects shall be part of one or more wetland restoration
programs consistent with all other applicable provisions of this Local Coastal
Program. Such wetlands restoration or enhancement program(s) shall be prepared
and implemented in consultation with the Department of Fish and Game, Coastal
Commission, and Coastal Conservancy. Preparation of the program(s) shall occur
prior to commencement of any development governed by this subdivision; however,
implementation of the program(s) may occur concurrently with or subsequently to
any approved development. If an in-lieu fee is required to be paid by the
applicant, it shall not exceed $0.25 for each square foot of affected marsh of
other wetland, except as provided in permit CP-10-80. For the area south of
Hilfiker Lane identified in LUP Policy 5.12(b), the restoration program may, at
any one time, include one or more of the affected properties, provided that
when an application for development pursuant to this subdivision is made, the
affected property shall participate in the wetlands restoration program.

Permitted uses and development in grazed or farmed wetlands shall be limited to
the following:
      (1)   Agricultural operations limited to apiaries, field and truck crops,
livestock raising, greenhouses (provided they are not located on slab
foundations and crops are grown in the existing soils on site), and orchards.
      (2)   Farm-related structures (including barns, sheds, and farmer-
occupied housing) necessary for the performance of agricultural operations.
Such structures may be located on an existing farmed wetland parcel only if no
alternative upland location is available for such purpose and the structures
are sited and designed to minimize adverse environmental effects on the farmed
wetland. No more than one permanent residential structure per parcel shall be
allowed.
      (3)   Restoration projects.

100 feet, unless the applicant for the development demonstrates on the basis of
information, the type and size of the proposed development, and/or proposed
mitigation (such as planting of vegetation) that will achieve the purposes of
the buffer, that a smaller buffer will protect the resources of the habitat
area. For a wetland, the buffer should be measured from the landward edge of
the wetland. For a stream or river, the buffer should be measured landward from
the landward edge of riparian vegetation or from the top edge of the bank (such
as, in channelized streams). Maps and supplemental information submitted as
part of the application should be used to specifically determine these
boundaries.
   (P)   Barriers. To protect wetlands against physical intrusion, wetland
buffer areas shall incorporate attractively designed and strategically located
barriers and informational signs.
   (Q)   Uses adjacent to gulches. All coastal zone land use activities
adjacent to gulches shall be carried out in a manner which avoids vegetative
removal below the break in slope, (usually those areas with a slope of 20% or
greater) and which does not alter natural landforms and drainage patterns.
   (R)   Disagreement over boundary.
      (1)   Where there is a disagreement over the boundary, location, or

   (F)   Conditional uses. A planned unit development shall include only uses
permitted, either as permitted uses or conditional uses, in the zoning district
with which the PD District is combined, provided that any use permitted in an
RS or RM District as a permitted use or as a conditional use, or any
combination of such uses, may be included in a planned unit development located
in an R District.
('63 Code, § 10-5.29195)
   (G)   Status of approved plans for planned unit developments. The approved
site plan for a planned unit development shall govern all development on the
site. If approval is granted for subsequent division of the Planned Unit
Development District into two or more parcels, the approved plan shall govern
the development of each of the separate parcels.
('63 Code, § 10-5.29196)

      (1)   Site plan review. In order to preserve and enhance the city's site,
to prevent the clearing of property and destruction of trees, shrubs, or other
significant natural vegetation inconsistent with the provisions of this Local
Coastal Program, to prevent excessive grading of hillsides and the creation of
drainage hazards or the diversion of water from identified wetlands, to ensure
that structures are properly related to their sites and to surrounding sites,
structures, and nearby traffic circulation, and that parking areas, walkways,
and landscaping are arranged to accomplish the objectives of this chapter and
Chapter 155 of this title, site plans for certain permitted uses and structures
shall be subject to site plan review by the Design Review Committee. The ugly,
the inharmonious, the monotonous, and the hazardous shall be barred, but
originality and creativity in site planning shall not be suppressed.
      (2)   Architectural review. In order to prevent the erection of
structures or signs that would be inharmonious with their surroundings or would
have an adverse effect on the value of property or improvements in the
vicinity, uses and structures and certain signs in the AR and PD Districts and
conditional uses in all districts shall be subject to architectural review by
the Design Review Committee. The ugly, the inharmonious, the monotonous, and
the hazardous shall be barred, but originality in architecture, site planning,
and landscape and graphic design shall not be suppressed. Review shall include
exterior design, materials, textures, and colors but shall not consider
elements of the design that do not affect exterior appearance. In reviewing
proposals for development in AR Districts that have an established historical
character, the Design Review Committee shall recommend disapproval of drawings
for a structure or a sign that would be inharmonious with surrounding
development, but the Committee shall not require that new structures duplicate
a historic architectural style as a condition of approval.

judgment, to judge the effects of a proposed development on the community, who
shall be appointed by the Mayor with confirmation by the Council for a term
ending on January 1 of each year. If the membership of the Committee does not
include an architect, the Committee shall by unanimous agreement invite an
architect, who may not be a resident of the city, to serve in an advisory
capacity. In the event the Committee is required to review drawings for a
project in which one of its members or its advisors has a business or
professional interest, it shall seek the advice of a disinterested architect.
      (2)   The Design Review Committee shall hold two regular meetings each
month at a time to be designated by the Committee, except that a meeting may be

§ 156.113 EXHAUSTION OF LOCAL APPEALS.
   (A)   (1)   An appellant shall be deemed to have exhausted local appeals for
purposes of filing an appeal under the Commission's regulations and be an
aggrieved person where the appellant has pursued his appeal to the local
appellate body as required by the city appeal procedures; except that
exhaustion of all local appeals shall not be required if any of the following
occur:
         (a)   The city required an appellant to appeal to more local appellate
bodies for permits in the coastal zone, in the implementation section of the
Local Coastal Program;
         (b)   An appellant was denied the right of the initial local appeal by
a local ordinance which restricts the class of persons who may appeal a local
decision;

notice and hearing procedures for the development did not comply with the
provisions of this chapter;
         (d)   The city charges an appeal fee for the filing or processing of
appeals.
      (2)   Where the local government would ordinarily require an appeal fee
for the processing of appeals within the appealable areas of the coastal zone,
the city may elect to waive the appeal fee and apply to the Commission for a
reimbursement of that fee through an SB 90 claim or similar reimbursement
process.
   (B)   Where a project is appealed by any two members of the Commission,
there shall be no requirement of exhaustion of local appeals. Provided,
however, that notice of Commission appeals shall be transmitted to the local
appellate body (which considers appeals from the local body that rendered the
final decision) and the appeal to the Commission shall be suspended pending a
decision on the merits by that local appellate body. If the decision of the
local appellate body modifies or reverses the previous decision, the
Commissioners shall be required to file a new appeal from that decision.

of Community Development. If the Director of Community Development determines
that the proposed amendment is immaterial, as described above, notice of such a
determination shall be sent to the Executive Director of the Coastal
Commission, to each property owner and occupant of property within 100 feet of
the property and to all other parties that the Director of Community
Development has reason to know who may be interested in the application. If no

has occurred and that the extension would not be detrimental to the purpose of
this chapter. Notice of the requested extension shall be given to any person
determined by the Director of Community Development to have been aggrieved at
the original hearing. Any persons aggrieved by the Director of Community
Development's decision on an extension request may appeal that decision to the

§ 157.006 STANDARDS FOR ALTERATIONS AND DEMOLITIONS.
   (A)   No structure on a designated property shall be demolished unless the
city shall make one of the following three findings, following notice to the
extent required by §
157.005 and hearing(s) pursuant to this chapter.
      (1)   The designated structure is unsafe or a hazard to the public as a
result of an unforeseen event such as a fire or earthquake. Said demolition
shall only be undertaken if in accordance with City of Eureka Municipal Code,
Volume 2,
Chapter 150: Building Regulations, and Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 5028;
      (2)   Taking into account the potential value to the owner of the
property of all available city and other accommodations and incentives
including transferable development rights, zoning ordinance modifications,
alternative building code standards or provisions, loans, grants,
reimbursements and tax reductions, one or more of the following circumstances
exist;
         (a)   The current or most recent use of the property is not permitted
under the current planning code (except as a nonconforming use) and adaptive
reuse is not economically feasible;
         (b)   The adverse impact on the owner of the property is unreasonably
large in comparison to the public benefit from denying demolition;
         (c)    The demolition would further a substantial community interest
or result in a net community benefit;
         (d)   Denying permission to demolish would result in a taking or would
violate state or federal law.
      (3)   Demolition must be allowed pursuant to the State Housing Law (Cal.
Health and Safety Code §§ 17900 et seq.) or other applicable state or federal
law.
   (B)   Conditions may be imposed on demolition to the extent authorized by
any other applicable law or this chapter, including without limitation the
following:
      (1)   Documentation may be required of any structure to be demolished
and/or for the property;
      (2)   Historic Preservation Commission Review and Historic Preservation
Commission approval may be required for any subsequent development at the
property;
      (3)   Demolition may be delayed for up to 90 days to allow time to
identify a prospective buyer for the property, to identify a third party
interested in relocating the affected structure or to allow the city to
determine whether to begin eminent domain procedures, and for up to an
additional 90 days to allow completion of the purchase or relocation or
commencement of a judicial condemnation action if, within the initial 90 days a
buyer or third party is identified or the city determines to begin eminent
domain procedures. In the case of purchase or relocation by a third party,
demolition may be denied where a third party willing and able to purchase the
property or relocate the structure within the time established by this
subdivision is identified and makes a bona fide offer to purchase the property
or structure at fair market value, as determined by appraisal.
      (4)   With respect to demolition of a structure on a district property,
the city shall take into account the importance of an affected structure to the
integrity of the district, and may: limit the size of new development to that
of the existing structure; require that the scale of new development be
harmonious with other structures which contribute to the district’s character;
require retention or reconstruction of one or more facades; and/or require that
any replacement structure be of like kind or quality to the demolished
structure and contribute to the integrity of the preservation district.
   (C)   No structure on a designated property shall be altered unless the
alteration is approved by the city, following notice to the extent required by
§
157.005 and hearing(s) pursuant to this chapter. The Commission may adopt
guidelines for alterations and review of alteration applications, applicable
specifically to designated properties and/or district properties. Except to the
extent such guidelines provide differently, a proposed alteration shall be
considered in light of its effect on the existing character of the affected
structure as it relates to the streetscape.
   (D)   No zoning permit for a use or for a structure or sign or exterior
alteration, enlargement or major remodeling of an existing use, structure or
sign on a designated property that is subject to design review as prescribed in
Chapter 155 of the Eureka Municipal Code, shall be issued until the design has
been approved. Design review for projects subject to this chapter that have the
potential to permanently affect the historic integrity or character of the
property pursuant to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards shall be
approved by the Commission. Design review for projects not subject to this
chapter and that will not permanently affect the historic integrity or
character of the property shall be approved by the Design Review Committee.
