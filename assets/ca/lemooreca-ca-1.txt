hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection,
subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof irrespective of the

lowest responsible bids, the city shall give preference to the local vendor
having a fixed business location and a valid business license within the city

being equal except price, an allowance adjustment of up to five percent (5%) of

location and a valid business license within the city limits and such local
vendor may be determined the lowest bidder and the city may award the contract
to such local vendor. (Ord. 2016-05, 6-21-2016)

   In case such a determination is made, the Collector shall give a notice of
the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the
United States Post Office in Lemoore, California, postage prepaid, addressed to
the person so assessed at his last known address. Such person may, within ten
(10) days after the mailing or serving of such notice, make application in
writing to the Collector for hearing on the amount of license tax. If such
application is made, or if application is not made within the time prescribed,
the Collector must cause the matter to be set for hearing within fifteen (15)

with the Collector of the City the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00) as a guarantee
that he will in good faith be permanently located in the City in such business
for the period of four (4) months, and in default of which condition will
forfeit to the City the said deposit. In case said person shall in good faith
permanently engage in such business for a period of four (4) months after the
giving of such deposit, said deposit shall be first applied against any license
fees found to be due, and the balance shall be refunded to the depositor. (1975
Code §5-1.10)
   B.   Financial Statement; Determination of License Tax:
      1.   Upon a person making application for the first license to be issued
for a newly established business, in all cases where the amount of license tax
to be paid is based upon gross receipts, or is graduated according to some
other sliding scale, such persons shall furnish to the Collector for his
guidance in ascertaining the amount of license tax to be paid by the applicant,
a written statement upon a form provided by the Collector, signed by the
applicant and certified under penalty of perjury to be true and correct,
setting forth such information as may be therein required and as may be
necessary to properly determine the amount of the license tax to be paid by the
applicant. (Ord. 9116, 12-17-91)
      2.   If the amount of the license tax to be paid by such applicant is
based upon the amount of his gross receipts, he shall estimate the amount of
his gross receipts for the period to be covered by the license for the purpose
of determining the license bracket which will be applicable to him for the
period to be covered by the license to be issued. Such estimate, if accepted by
the Collector as reasonable, shall be used in determining the amount of the
license tax to be paid by the applicant; provided, however, that the amount of
the license tax so determined shall be tentative only and such person shall,
within thirty one (31) days after the expiration of the period for which such
license was issued, furnish the Collector with a certified sworn statement upon
a form furnished by the Collector containing the data required to show the
licensing bracket properly applicable to such person during the period of such
license and the license tax for such period shall be finally ascertained and
paid in the manner provided by this Chapter, after deducting from the payment
found to be due the amount paid at the time such first license was issued. The
Collector shall not issue to any such person another license for the same or
any other business until such person shall have furnished to him the written
statement and paid the license tax as herein required.
      3.   If the amount of the license tax to be paid by such applicant is
graduated according to some sliding scale other than gross receipts, the
applicant shall furnish to the Collector for his guidance in ascertaining the
amount of license tax to be paid by the applicant, a certified or sworn
statement upon a form provided by the Collector, setting forth such information
as may be therein required and as may be necessary properly to determine the
amount of license tax to be paid by the applicant and which statement shall
show among other things, the number of vehicles or tonnage thereof, the number
of seats, chairs, rooms, tables or other units used or involved in such
person's business as of the time of filing such application. Such person shall
thereupon pay the required license tax in advance, computed in accordance with
the information contained in such statement.
      4.   In all cases the applicant shall, upon filing his application, pay
the prescribed license fee in advance; provided, that in the case of annual
licenses, only the initial fee shall be prorated as follows:
         a.   If application is made during the quarter beginning January 1,
one hundred percent (100%) of such fee shall be paid;
         b.   If application is made during the quarter beginning April 1,
seventy five percent (75%) of said fee shall be paid;
         c.   If application is made during the quarter beginning July 1, fifty
percent (50%) of said fee shall be paid;
         d.   If application is made during the quarter beginning October 1,
twenty five percent (25%) of said minimum shall be paid. (1975 Code §5-1.11)
3-1-13: CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION:
Information furnished or secured pursuant to this Chapter, the disclosure of

limitations contained in part 1.5 of division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code;
   C.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and provides
a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of

requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the California State sales and use taxes;

manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of part

record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this

provided, that if the City shall not have contracted with the State Board of

and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first
calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the
first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of this Article.

not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of

or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be
exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain
subject to tax by the State under the provisions of part 1 of division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code, or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales,
storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not
be subject to tax by the State under the said provisions of that Code; the

CITY OF LEMOORE. (Ord. 8404, 6-19-1984)
3-3B-2: DEFINITIONS:
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this
section shall govern the construction of this article.
HOTEL: Any recreational vehicle park, any structure, or any portion of any
structure which is occupied, or intended or designed for occupancy, by
transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes and shall include any

house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club,
mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure, or
portion thereof.
OCCUPANCY: The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any
room, or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes.
OPERATOR: The person who is the proprietor of the hotel, whether in the
capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any
other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing
agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall
also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this article and shall have the
same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of
this article by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both.
PERSON: Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social
club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust,
business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination
acting as a unit.
RENT: The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of
space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor
or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits, property and services of
any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.
TAX ADMINISTRATOR: The finance director of the city, to be charged with the
administration of the transient occupancy tax.
TRANSIENT: Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by
reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a
period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of
calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall
be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired
unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant
providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is
a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent
to the effective date hereof may be considered. (Ord. 8404, 6-19-1984; amd. per
letter dated 12-1-1997; Ord. 2004-2, 7-20-2004)
3-3B-3: TAX IMPOSED:
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient shall be subject to

operator. Such tax shall constitute a debt owed by the transient to the city,
which debt shall be extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the
city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time
the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of
the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon
the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax
is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the finance director may require that
such tax shall be paid directly to the finance director.
The rate to be charged by the city for transient occupancy within the city
shall be established by resolution of the city council after a duly noticed
public hearing regarding the establishment of said rate. (Ord. 8404, 6-19-1984)

section except upon a claim therefor made at the time the rent is collected and

   This transient occupancy registration certificate signifies that the person
named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient
Occupancy Tax Ordinance registering with the Finance Director for the purpose
of collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting such
tax to the Finance Director. This certificate shall not authorize any person to
conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful
manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local
applicable laws, including, but not limited to, those requiring a permit from
any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does
not constitute a permit;
and
   E.   Such additional information as may be required by the finance director.
   Such privilege of registration after September 1, 1984, shall not relieve
any person from the obligation of the collection and payment of the tax after
September 1, 1984, regardless of registration. (Ord. 8404, 6-19-1984)
3-3B-6: COLLECTION, REPORTING AND REMITTANCE OF TAX:
   A.   Collection Of Tax: Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by the
provisions of this article to the same extent and at the same time as the rent
is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated
from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt
for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state
in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax, or any part
thereof, will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be
added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the
manner provided in this article.
   B.   Reporting And Remitting: Each operator shall, on or before the last day
of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of
any shorter reporting period which may be established by the finance director,
make a return to the finance director on forms provided by him/her of the total
rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient
occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax
collected shall be remitted to the finance director. The finance director may
establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it
necessary in order to ensure collection of the tax, and he may require further
information in the return. Returns and payments shall be due immediately upon
cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant
to the provisions of this article shall be held in trust for the account of the
city until payment thereof is made to the finance director.
   If a remittance to cover a payment required by the provisions of this
article to be made to the finance director on or before a specified date is
sent through the United States mail, properly addressed, with postage prepaid,
it shall be deemed to have been received by the finance director on the date
shown by the post office cancellation mark stamped upon the envelope containing
the remittance or on the date it was mailed if proof satisfactory to the
finance director established that the mailing occurred on an earlier date.
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as constituting payment of any
remittance required unless such remittance is actually received by the finance
director.
   C.   Failure To Collect And Report Tax; Estimates: If the operator shall
fail or refuse to collect such tax, or any portion thereof, required by the
provisions of this article, the finance director shall proceed in such manner
as he/she may deem best to obtain the facts and information on which to base
his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the finance director shall procure such
facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment
of any such tax imposed by the provisions of this article and payable by any
operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report
and remittance, the finance director shall proceed to determine and assess
against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by the
provisions of this article. In the event such determination is made, the
finance director shall give notice of the amount so assessed by serving it
personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such
operator may, within ten (10) days after the service or mailing of such notice,
make an application in writing to the finance director for a hearing on the
amount assessed. If an application by the operator for a hearing is not made
within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined
by the finance director shall become final and conclusive and immediately due
and payable. If such an application is made, the finance director shall give
not less than five (5) days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this
subsection to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such
notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax,
interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer
evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties shall not be so fixed.
After such hearing, the finance director shall determine the proper tax to be
remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the operator in the manner
prescribed in this subsection of such determination and the amount of such tax,
interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable
fifteen (15) days after the service or mailing of such notice unless an appeal
is filed as provided in section
3-3B-8 of this article.
   D.   Failure To Remit Tax; Penalties And Interest:
      1.   Original Delinquency: Any operator who shall fail to remit any tax
imposed by the provisions of this article within the time required shall pay a
penalty in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the tax in addition to the amount
of the tax.
      2.   Continued Delinquency: Any operator who shall fail to remit any
delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the
date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second
delinquency penalty in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the tax in addition
to the amount of the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed.
      3.   Fraud: If the finance director shall determine that the nonpayment
of any remittance due pursuant to the provisions of this article is due to
fraud, a penalty in the amount of twenty five percent (25%) of the amount of
the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties set forth in
subsections D1 and D2 of this section.
      4.   Interest: In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who
shall fail to remit any tax imposed by the provisions of this article shall pay
interest at the rate of one-half of one percent (0.5%) per month or fraction
thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on
which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.
      5.   Penalties And Interest Merged With Tax: Every penalty imposed, and
such interest as accrues pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, shall
become a part of the tax required to be paid by the provisions of this article.
(Ord. 8404, 6-19-1984)
3-3B-7: DEFICIENCY DETERMINATIONS:
If the finance director is not satisfied with a return filed by an operator or
the amount of the tax required to be paid to the city pursuant to a return, he
may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of the
facts contained in the return or upon the basis of any information within his
possession, or that may come into his possession. One or more deficiency
determinations may be made of the amount due for any period. The finance
director shall give to the operator written notice of his determination in the
same manner as provided in subsection
3-3B-6C of this article. The operator shall be entitled to apply for a hearing
on the amount assessed to him pursuant to the procedure set forth in said
subsection
3-3B-6C of this article and shall thereafter be entitled to appeal to the
council in accordance with the provisions of section
3-3B-8 of this article. The penalties and interest provided in subsection
3-3B-6D of this article shall be applicable to the amount of deficiency
established pursuant to the provisions of this section. (Ord. 8404, 6-19-1984)
3-3B-8: APPEALS:
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the finance director with respect to
the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen (15)
days after the service or mailing of the determination of the tax due. The
council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk
shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of
address. The decision of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be
served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed in this article for the
service of a notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately
due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 8404, 6-19-1984)
3-3B-9: TAX REFUNDS:

or paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by
the city pursuant to the provisions of this article, such amount may be
refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this section, provided a claim
in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon
which the claim is found, is filed with the finance director within three (3)
years after the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the
finance director.
   B.   Any operator may claim a refund or take as a credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the finance director that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient; provided, however, neither a refund nor a credit
shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been
refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the
transient to the operator.
   C.   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, paid more than once
or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim
in the manner provided in subsection A of this section but only when the tax
was paid by the transient directly to the finance director, or when the
transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction
of the finance director that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund
from the operator who collected the tax.
   D.   No refund shall be paid pursuant to the provisions of this section
unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto. (Ord. 8404, 6-19-1984)
3-3B-10: RECORDS KEPT:

be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for
the collection of and payment to the city, which records the finance director
shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. (Ord. 8404, 6-19-1984)
3-3B-11: DISPOSITION OF REVENUE:

interest and penalties collected for delinquencies, shall be deposited in the
general fund and shall be used for the purposes for which such funds may be

Any tax required to be paid by any transient pursuant to the provisions of this
article shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax

debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city
pursuant to the provisions of this article shall be liable to an action brought
in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount 1 . (Ord. 8404, 6-19-

the tax or penalty has been paid or a tax clearance certificate from the city
stating that no tax or penalty is due. If the selling operator does not present

This article is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes, and

accomplish those purposes:
   A.   To impose a retail transactions and use tax to be applied throughout
the entire territory of the City to the fullest extent permitted by law and in
accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, which authorizes the City to adopt
this article which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on
the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for
that purpose.
   B.   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates
provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of
California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the
requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code.
   C.   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax
and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the
California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in a manner that adapts
itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation
from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the
California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in administering and
collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes.
   D.   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes,
and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons
subject to taxation under the provisions of this article. (Ord. 2024-05, 11-5-
2024)
3-3C-4: CONTRACT WITH STATE:
Prior to the operative date, the City shall contract with the California
Department of Tax and Fee Administration to perform all functions incident to

receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are
subject to the State sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which
delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in
the State or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which
the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and

and Fee Administration. (Ord. 2024-05, 11-5-2024)

of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby adopted and made a

of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; or
         b.   Impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or
other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to

protect the use of public streets and facilities, including, without
limitation, the following conditions and requirements:
      1.   The police chief may, upon reasonable cause, require any taxicab

permittee is not self-employed. Notice shall be deemed effective upon
depositing said notice in the U.S. mail, first class postage prepaid, addressed
to the permittee and permittee's employer, if applicable, at the last address
on record with the police chief. Failure to take the test within the time
specified shall result in automatic suspension of the permittee's taxicab
driver's permit and shall be grounds for revocation of the permit.
      2.   The applicant's photograph shall be permanently attached to the
taxicab driver's permit. The taxicab driver's permit shall be posted in a place

alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 percent.
         b.   Procedures shall be substantially as in part 40 (commencing with
section 40.1) of title 49 of the code of federal regulations, except that the
driver shall show a valid California driver's license at the time and place of
testing, and except as provided otherwise in this section.
         c.   A test in one jurisdiction shall be accepted as meeting the same
requirement in any other jurisdiction. Any negative test result shall be
accepted for one year as meeting a requirement for periodic permit renewal
testing or any other periodic testing in that jurisdiction or any other
jurisdiction, if the driver has not tested positive subsequent to a negative
result. However, an earlier negative result shall not be accepted as meeting
the preemployment testing requirement for any subsequent employment, or any
testing requirements under the program other than periodic testing.
         d.   In the case of a self-employed independent driver, the test
results shall be reported directly to the city, which shall notify the taxicab
leasing company of record, if any, of positive results. In all other cases, the
results shall be reported directly to the employing transportation operator,
who shall be required to notify the city of positive results.
         e.   All test results are confidential and shall not be released
without the consent of the driver, except as authorized or required by law.
         f.   Self-employed independent drivers shall be responsible for
compliance with, and shall pay all costs of, this program with regard to
themselves. Employing transportation operators shall be responsible for
compliance with, and shall pay all costs of, this program with respect to their
employees and potential employees, except that an operator may require
employees who test positive to pay the costs of rehabilitation and of return to
duty and follow up testing.

give the driver a list of entities certified pursuant to part 382 (commencing
with section 382.101) of title 49 of the code of federal regulations that the
city knows offer tests in or near the jurisdiction.
      5.   No evidence derived from a positive test result pursuant to the
program shall be admissible in a criminal prosecution concerning unlawful
possession, sale, or distribution of controlled substances.
   E.   For purposes of this section, "employment" includes self-employment as
an independent driver. (Ord. 2008-05, 7-1-2008)

The City Council does find that there exists and has existed an increasing
trend towards display of adult materials at grocery stores, convenient stores,
drug stores, video stores and other retail outlets within the City. This
Council recognizes that businesses which sell sexually orientated materials
often use objectionable sales and marketing methods which when concentrated can
have a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. It is recognized that many
persons are offended by the public display of certain sexual material. Further,
adult material is often displayed within the open view of children of tender
years and is easily accessible to them. The City Council finds that this
material is adverse to the public peace, morals and the protection of young
children under the age of eighteen (18) years. The Council further finds that
it is in the best interest of the public safety, welfare and convenience of the
City to regulate the display of adult material and to adopt the following
regulations, pursuant to Penal Code section 313.1(d), so that adverse impacts
upon young children are kept to a minimum. (Ord. 9509, 12-5-1995)

Chapter, "adult material" includes but is not limited to:

area or buttocks of either males or females, except those of infants;
   C.   The display or depiction of any of the acts or conduct listed in Penal
Code section 313(c)(1).
This definition of "adult material" does not apply to material contained in any
scientific or photography publication which devotes at least fifty percent
(50%) of the lineage of each edition to articles and advertisements dealing
with the subjects of science or the art of photography. Nor does this
definition apply to any news periodical which reports or describes current
events and which, from time to time, publish photographs or depictions of nude
or semi-nude persons when describing current events.

of patrons, invitees or visitors to the premises where such material is
located, or is visible from any public street, thoroughfare, sidewalk or
pedestrian way, or other residential or business premises. The prohibitions of

3-9-4: VIOLATION AND PENALTIES:
Any person, whether as principal, agent, employee or otherwise, violating or
causing the violation of any of the provisions of this Chapter shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor, punishable as prescribed in this Code. Any violation of this
Chapter constitutes a separate offense for each and every day during which such
violation is continued, as provided in this Code. (Ord. 9509, 12-5-1995)
3-9-5: PUBLIC NUISANCE:
In addition to the criminal penalty provisions provided by this Code, violation
of any section or sections of this Chapter is declared to be a public nuisance
and may be abated as such by the City. (Ord. 9509, 12-5-1995)

4-1-5: USE OF CITY REFUSE COLLECTION SERVICE:
It is hereby found and determined that the periodic collection of refuse from
all places and premises in the city is necessary, and such owner, tenant,
lessee or other occupants or persons in possession, charge or control of any
place in or from which refuse is created, accumulated or produced are liable
for and shall pay the refuse collection fees established by the city council of
the city.
Refuse collection service is provided by the city, and it shall be mandatory
for all owners, tenants, lessees or other occupants or persons in possession,
charge or control of places and premises in the city in or from which refuse is
created, accumulated or produced to use the city's collection service;
provided, however, that there may be joint or multiple use of refuse
containers, subject to securing a permit therefor from the director of public
works and pursuant to rules and regulations therefor established by the
director of public works. (Ord. 8402, 3-2-1984)
4-1-6: REFUSE COLLECTION FEES:
   A.   Fees Established: The fees to be charged by the City for refuse
collection service within the City shall be established by resolution of the
City Council after a duly noticed public hearing regarding the establishment of
said fees.
   B.   Payment Of Fees; Delinquencies:
      1.   Billing: All refuse charges shall be collected together with, and
not separately from, the charges for any utility service rendered by the City,
and all charges shall be billed upon the same bill and collected as one item.
All utility service charges shall be payable upon presentation date at the
Office of the City Water Collector in the City Hall and shall be delinquent on
the twenty fifth day of the calendar month following the date of presentment.
      2.   Liability: The owner or owners of any parcel of real property,
together with any and all occupants of such real property, shall be jointly
liable for all charges incurred by reason of the use of said waste and refuse
pick-up service by any and all occupants of such real property.
      3.   Discontinued: In the event a utility bill is not paid on or before
the tenth day after the bill becomes delinquent, the refuse service shall be
discontinued. On the eleventh day after the bill becomes delinquent the fees of
twenty five dollars ($25.00), in addition to the amount of the utility bill,
shall be charged.
      4.   Restoring: If refuse service has been discontinued for failure to
pay a utility bill as set forth in subsection B3 of this section, the entire
amount of the refuse bill and all fines and penalties provided below shall be
paid in full before refuse service is restored.
         a.   A fee of twenty five dollars ($25.00) shall be charged on all
returned items (to include online payments) in payment of utility charges.
      5.   Disputed Bills: Should the amount of any bill for service be
questioned, the customer should promptly request an explanation. If the
explanation is not satisfactory or is not understood, the customer must pay the
bill under protest to avoid discontinuance of service. Protests will be
addressed to the Director of Finance, must be in writing, and must state the
reasons why the charges are believed to be incorrect. The Director of Finance
will analyze the facts of the case and is authorized to make such adjustments
in the charges as may be necessary to effect an equitable settlement. Failure
of a customer to pay under protest after initial explanation is offered will
result in discontinuance of service without further notice if bill is not paid
by the delinquency date.
      6.   Collections: Accounts shall be subject to collection of any
delinquent fees and charges in the following manner:
         a.   At the time the fees become delinquent and until such time they
are fully paid, the delinquent account balance, including late charges, shall
constitute an unrecorded lien against the property and, as such, may be
identified during a title search. For commercial businesses, delinquent account
balances, including late charges, may be considered an unrecorded lien against
the business name and/or owner of the business.
         b.   Once a year there may be prepared a report of delinquent fees
including late charges. The City Council shall fix a time, date and place for
hearing the report and receive any objections or protests thereto.
         c.   The City Council shall cause notice of hearing to be mailed to
the landowners listed on the report not less than fifteen (15) days prior to
the date of the hearing.
         d.   At the hearing, the City Council shall hear any objections or
protests of landowners liable to be assessed for delinquent fees including late
charges and administrative fees, as set by resolution of the City Council. The
City Council may make revisions or corrections to the report as it deems just,
after which, by resolution, the report shall be confirmed.
         e.   The delinquent fees set forth in the report as confirmed shall
constitute special assessments against the respective parcels of land and are a
lien on the property for the amount of such delinquent fees, including late
charges. A certified copy of the resolution confirming the assessments shall be
filed with the County Recorder and the County Auditor- Controller/Tax Collector
for the amounts of the assessments against the respective parcels as they
appear on the current assessment roll. The lien created attaches upon filing.
The assessments shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as
other Property Taxes and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same
procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for such taxes. All laws
applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of Property Taxes shall be
applicable to such assessments. However, if, for the first year for which the
charges are prescribed, the property served by the City has been transferred or
conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, and attached thereon, prior to the
date on which the first installment of County taxes would become delinquent,
the charge will not result in a lien against the real property, but shall
become transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.
         f.   In addition to, or alternatively to, imposing a lien, the City
may file an action for the collection of any amounts due and unpaid against the
owner, tenant, lessee or other occupants or persons in possession, charge or
control of any place in or from which refuse is created, accumulated or
produced. In any such action, the delinquent balances may also be processed
through a collection agency.
   C.   Application Of Funds Received: Any payment received for City utility
charges in an amount less than the total charge billed shall be treated as a
partial payment for each such charge and the amount received allocated to the
separate departments in the same ratio as each such charge bears to the whole
of the bill.
   D.   Vacant Premises; Refunds: Whenever the premises for which collection
and disposal service is provided is vacant or unused for a period of thirty
(30) days or more, the person to whom the collection charge is made may secure
a rebate of his refuse collection service charges for said period of vacancy by
presenting to the Director of Public Works an affidavit setting forth all the
facts of the vacancy under penalty of perjury. If satisfied with the truth of
the statements of vacancy, the Director of Public Works shall approve said
claim and the Finance Department shall make the appropriate refund of such
charges. No charge shall be made for newly constructed premises until the same
is occupied; provided, however, that a person shall be conclusively presumed to
be using refuse collection and disposal service when the premises is connected
to the City water or sewer system. (Ord. 2018-07, 9-18-2018)

dollars ($50) to one hundred dollars ($100) per violation.
      2.   For a second violation, the amount of the base penalty shall be one
hundred dollars ($100) to two hundred dollars ($200) per violation.
      2.   For a third or subsequent violation, the amount of the base penalty
shall be two hundred and fifty dollars ($250) to five hundred dollars ($500)
per violation.
   F.   Factors Considered in Determining Penalty Amount: The following factors
shall be used to determine the amount of the penalty for each violation within
the appropriate penalty amount range:
      1.   The nature, circumstances, and severity of the violation(s).
      2.   The violator's ability to pay.
      3.   The willfulness of the violator's misconduct.
      4.   Whether the violator took measures to avoid or mitigate violations
of this chapter.
      5.   Evidence of any economic benefit resulting from the violation(s).

   H.   Appeals Process: Persons receiving an administrative citation
containing a penalty for an uncorrected violation may request a hearing to
appeal the citation. A hearing will be held only if it is requested within the
time prescribed and consistent with Jurisdiction's procedures in the
Jurisdiction's codes for appeals of administrative citations. Evidence may be
presented at the hearing. The Jurisdiction will appoint a hearing officer who
shall conduct the hearing and issue a final written order.
   I.   Education Period for Non-Compliance: Beginning January 1, 2022 and
through December 31, 2023, Jurisdiction will conduct Inspections, Remote
Monitoring, Route Reviews or waste evaluations, and Compliance Reviews,
depending upon the type of regulated entity, to determine compliance, and if
Jurisdiction determines that Organic Waste Generator, Self-Hauler, hauler, Tier
One Commercial Edible Food Generator, Food Recovery Organization, Food Recovery
Service, or other entity is not in compliance, it shall provide educational
materials to the entity describing its obligations under this article and a
notice that compliance is required by January 1, 2022, and that violations may
be subject to administrative civil penalties starting on January 1, 2024.

4-2-1: NOXIOUS WEEDS AND PLANTS PROHIBITED:
No owner of any lot, place or area within the City, or agent of such owners,
shall permit on such lot, place or area, or upon any sidewalk or street

unhealthful growths, or other noxious matter that may be growing, lying or
located thereon.
4-2-2: NUISANCE DECLARED BY RESOLUTION:
   A.   The City Council may declare by resolution as public nuisances, and
abate:
      1.   All weeds growing upon the streets, sidewalks or private property in
the City.
      2.   All rubbish, refuse and dirt upon parkways, sidewalks or private
property in the City.
   B.   The resolution shall:
      1.   Refer to the street by its commonly known name.
      2.   Describe the property upon which or in front of which the nuisance
exists by giving its lot and block number according to the official or City
assessment map.
   C.   Any number of streets, sidewalks or parcels or private property may be
included in one resolution.
4-2-3: WEEDS DEFINED:
Weeds, as used in this Chapter, includes any of the following:
   A.   Weeds which bear seeds of a downy or wingy nature.
   B.   Sagebrush, chaparral and any other brush or weeds which attain such
large growth as to become, when dry, a fire menace to adjacent improved
property.
   C.   Weeds which are otherwise noxious or dangerous.
   D.   Poison oak and poison ivy when the conditions of growth are such as to
constitute a menace to the public health.
   E.   Dry grass, stubble, brush, litter or other flammable material which
endangers the public safety by creating a fire hazard.
4-2-4: ABATEMENT OF SEASONAL AND RECURRENT NUISANCES; NOTICE:
   A.   At the time it adopts the resolution as provided for or by Section
4-2-2, the City Council may also find and declare that weeds on specified
parcels of property are seasonal and recurrent nuisances.
   B.   Such seasonal and recurrent nuisances shall be abated in accordance
with the provisions of this Chapter; provided, that upon the second and any
subsequent occurrences of such nuisance on the same parcel or parcels within
the same calendar year, no further hearings need be held and it shall be
sufficient to mail a post card notice to the owners of the property as they and
their addresses appear upon the current assessment roll.
   C.   The notice shall refer to and describe the property and shall state
that noxious or dangerous weeds of a seasonal and recurrent nature are growing
on or in front of the property, and that the same constitute a public nuisance
which must be abated by the removal of said noxious or dangerous weeds, and
that otherwise they will be removed and the nuisance will be abated by the City
authorities, in which case the cost of such removal shall be assessed upon the
parcel and lands from which or in front of which such weeds are removed and
that, upon confirmation, such cost will constitute a lien upon such parcel or
lands until paid.
   D.   The notice required above shall, in addition to containing all other
required matters, state that the efficient and economical control of such
seasonal and recurrent nuisance requires preventive chemical control of such
weeds, weed seeds, and weed seedlings and that the City may require preventive
chemical control of such nuisance.
   E.   In the event the City is once required to abate such nuisance, the City
may, in addition, before and during the next following germinating season of

4-2-6: NOTICE FORM:
The notice described in Section
4-2-5 shall be in substantially the following form:
   NOTICE TO DESTROY WEEDS AND REMOVE RUBBISH, REFUSE AND DIRT
   Notice is hereby given that on the          day of                 , 19    ,
the City Council of the City of Lemoore passed a resolution declaring that
noxious or dangerous weeds are growing upon or in front of the property on this
street, and that rubbish, refuse, and dirt are upon or in front of property on
this street, and more particularly described in the resolution, and that they
constitute a public nuisance which must be abated by the removal of the weeds,
rubbish, refuse and dirt. Otherwise they will be removed and the nuisance
abated by the City and the cost of removal assessed upon the land from or in
front of which the weeds, rubbish, refuse and dirt are removed and will
constitute a lien upon such land until paid. Reference is hereby made to the
resolution for further particulars. A copy of said resolution is on file in the
office of the City Clerk.
   All property owners having any objections to the proposed removal of the
weeds, rubbish, refuse and dirt are hereby notified to attend a meeting of the
City Council of the City of Lemoore to be held                      of 19    ,
when their objections will be heard and given due consideration.
4-2-7: WRITTEN NOTICE OF ABATEMENT:
   A.   As an alternative to posting notice of the resolution and notice of the
meeting when objections will be heard, the City Council may direct the City
Clerk to mail written notice of the proposed abatement to all persons owning
property described in the resolution. The City Clerk shall cause such written
notice to be mailed to each person to whom such described property is assessed
in the last equalized assessment roll available on the date the resolution was
adopted by the City Council.
   B.    The County Assessor, at the request of the City Clerk, shall, within
ten (10) days thereafter, mail to the City Clerk a list of the names and
addresses of all of the persons owning property described in the resolution.
The address of the owners shown on the assessment roll shall be conclusively
deemed to be the proper address for the purpose of mailing such notice. The
City shall reimburse the County for the actual cost of furnishing such list and
the cost shall be a part of the costs of abatement.
   C.    The notices mailed by the City Clerk shall be mailed at least five (5)
days prior to the time for hearing objections by the City Council, and said
notices shall be substantially in the form provided by Section
4-2-6 except that notices shall be signed by the City Clerk.
4-2-8: HEARING ON OBJECTIONS:
   A.    At the time stated in the notices, the City Council shall hear and
consider all objections to the proposed removal of weeds, rubbish, refuse and
dirt. It may continue the hearing from time to time.
   B.    By motion or resolution at the conclusion of the hearing, the City
Council shall allow or overrule any objections. Upon the passage of the motion
or on adoption of the resolution, the City Council acquires jurisdiction to
proceed and perform the work of removal.
   C.    The decision of the City Council is final.
4-2-9: ABATEMENT BY SUPERINTENDENT:
   A.    If objections have not been made or after the City Council has
disposed of those made, it shall order the Superintendent to abate the nuisance
by having the weeds, rubbish, refuse and dirt removed. The order shall be made
by motion or resolution.
   B.    The Superintendent may enter upon private property to abate the
nuisance.
   C.    Before the Superintendent arrives, any property owner may remove the
weeds, rubbish, refuse and dirt at his own expense. Nevertheless, in any case
in which an order to abate is issued, the City Council, by motion or
resolution, may further order that a special assessment and lien be imposed
pursuant to subsection
4-2-12A. In that case, the assessment and lien shall be limited to the costs
incurred by the City in enforcing abatement upon the parcels, including
investigation, boundary determination, measurement, clerical and other related
costs.
4-2-10: ACCOUNTING OF ABATEMENT COST, REPORT:
   A.    The Superintendent shall keep an account of the costs of abatement in
front of or on each separate parcel of land where the work is done by him. He
shall submit to the City Council for confirmation an itemized written report
showing such cost.
   B.    A copy of the report shall be posted for at least three (3) days prior
to its submission to the City Council on or near the location for the posting
of the agenda for any meeting of the Council, with a notice of the time of
submission of the report to the Council.
   C.    At the time fixed for receiving and considering the report, the City
Council shall hear the report with any objections of the property owners liable
to be assessed for the abatement. It may modify the report if it is deemed
necessary. The City Council shall then confirm the report by motion or
resolution.
4-2-11: ABATEMENT BY CONTRACTOR:
Abatement of the nuisance may, in the discretion of the City Council, be
performed by contract awarded by the City Council on the basis of competitive
bids let to the lowest responsible bidder pursuant to the Government Code of
the State of California. In such event, the contractor shall keep the account
and submit the itemized written report for such separate parcel of land.
4-2-12: ASSESSMENT AND LIEN FOR ABATEMENT COSTS:
   A.    The cost of abatement in front of or upon each parcel of land and the
costs incurred by the City in enforcing abatement upon the parcels, including
investigations, boundary determination, measurement, clerical and other related
costs, constitutes a special assessment against that parcel. After the
assessment is made and confirmed, a lien attaches on the parcel upon
recordation of the order confirming the assessment in the office of the County
Recorder of Kings County, except that if any real property to which such lien
would attach has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for
value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrance for value has been created and
attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of such
taxes as imposed by subsection B would become delinquent, then the lien which
would otherwise be imposed by this Section shall not attach to such real
property and the costs of abatement and the costs of enforcing abatement, as
confirmed, relating to such property shall be transferred to the unsecured roll
for collection.
   B.    Except as provided in subsection A, after confirmation of the report,
a copy shall be delivered to the County Assessor and the Tax Collector, who
shall add the amount of the assessment to the next regular tax bill levied
against the parcel.
   C.    Except as provided in subsection A, if the County Assessor and the Tax
Collector assess property and collect taxes for the City, a certified copy of
the report shall be filed with the County Auditor on or before August 10 of
each year. The descriptions of the parcels reported shall be those used for the
same parcels on the County Assessor's map books for the current year.
   D.    The County Auditor shall enter each assessment on the County tax roll
opposite the parcel of land.
   E.    The lien of said assessment shall have the priority of the taxes with
which it is collected.
4-2-13: COLLECTION OF ASSESSMENT COSTS:
   A.    The amount of the assessment shall be collected at the time and in the
manner of other assessments and taxes. If delinquent, the amounts shall be
subject to the same penalties and procedure of foreclosure and sale provided
for ordinary assessments and taxes.
   B.    As an alternative method, the County Tax Collector, in his discretion,
may collect the assessments without reference to the general taxes by issuing
separate bills and receipts for the assessments.
   C.    The Superintendent may receive the amount due on the abatement cost
and issue receipts at any time after the confirmation of the report and until
ten (10) days before a copy is given to the County Assessor and Tax Collector,
or where a certified copy is filed with the County Auditor, until August 1
following the confirmation of the report.
4-2-14: REFUND OF ASSESSMENT COSTS IN ERROR:
The City Council may order refunded all or part of an assessment paid pursuant
to this Chapter if it finds that all or part of the assessment has been
erroneously levied. An assessment or part thereof shall not be refunded unless
a claim is filed with the Clerk of the City Council on or before November 1
after the assessment lien became due and payable. The claim shall be verified
by the person who paid the assessment, or his guardian, executor or
administrator. (Ord. 8901, 2-7-89)

4-4-3: FINDINGS:
The city council finds and determines as follows:
   A.   The city has a history and reputation for well kept properties, and
property values and general welfare of the community are founded, in part, upon
the appearance and maintenance of private property;
   B.   Owners, person responsible for the property, and occupants of some
properties within the city have permitted visual blight, including, but not
limited to, deteriorated buildings, the accumulation of overgrown, rank and
noxious vegetation and the accumulation of broken or discarded personal
property in front yards;
   C.   The existence of such conditions as described in this chapter is
injurious and inimical to the public health, safety and welfare of city
residents and contributes to the deterioration of residential, commercial and
industrial areas;
   D.   Abatement of these conditions is in the best interest of the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the city because maximum use and
enjoyment of properties in close proximity to one another depends upon a
minimum standard of sightliness and the use and enjoyment of the property. The
beneficial effects of maintaining a minimum standard of sightliness and the use
and enjoyment for properties in the city include, but are not limited to,
appreciation of property values, physical improvements of residential,
commercial and industrial zones, attraction of capital investors to
residential, commercial and industrial zones, increase in commercial trade and
industrial productivity and increase in the tax base of the city;
   E.   The abatement of such conditions will improve the general welfare,
health, safety, and image of the city;
   F.   The abatement procedures set forth in this chapter are reasonable and
afford due process to all affected persons;
   G.   The uses and abuses of property, as described in this chapter,
reasonably relate to the proper exercise of police power to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the public. (Ord. 2015-01, 3-17-2015)
4-4-4: PROPERTY STANDARDS:
Unless expressly allowed by the zoning regulations, it is unlawful for any
landowner or person leasing, occupying or having charge or possession of any
real property in the city to keep, maintain, deposit or perform on such
property any of the following and existence of any of the following is hereby

   B.   Overgrown, dead, diseased, decaying or hazardous trees, shrubs, ground

   F.   Buildings that are boarded up, partially destroyed, not properly
secured or partially constructed or incomplete after the building permit

diminution in the enjoyment, use or property values of such adjacent or nearby
properties.

storage requirements of Title 6, Chapter 8.
   I.   Accumulate, store, abandon, dismantle, repair or otherwise locate
inoperative trailer, camper, boat or other watercraft, motor vehicle or parts
thereof on private property for a period in excess of fourteen (14) consecutive
days, unless stored within an entirely enclosed garage or screened by a minimum
six foot (6') high solid fence.
   J.   City provided refuse containers or other receptacles stored in front of
the front elevation of the building structure (front yard), unless screened;

   P.   Buildings in disrepair with wall cracks in excess of one-fourth inch
(1/4") width, leaking roofs, defective electric wiring or otherwise not in
compliance with building codes to the extent it presents a dangerous situation

property is in violation of this chapter and subject to its penalties and
remedies.
   R.   Any person responsible for property who permits property to be a
chronic nuisance property shall be in violation of this chapter and subject to
its penalties and remedies.

Alternatively, when the chief of police, or designee, receives documentation

activities giving rise to the violations; and
The chief of police, or designee, shall serve or cause to be served such
warning upon the person responsible in accordance with the procedures set forth
above.
   B.   Notice To City Council: In the event the violation is not ceased or
abated within the specified time, the chief of police, or designee, shall place
the matter on the city council's agenda for the next regular meeting.
   C.   Abatement Hearing: The city council at its next regular meeting may

warning within the time prescribed, the chief of police, or designee, shall
issue a notice declaring the property to be a chronic nuisance property and

concerning abatement is reached, the matter shall be forwarded to the city
attorney for enforcement action. Provided, that in the event the chief of

charge a lien against the property that is the subject of the enforcement
activity.
   B.    Except as provided in subsection G of this section, the amount of the
proposed lien shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as
property taxes are collected. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and
enforcement of ad valorem taxes shall be applicable to the proposed lien,
except that if any real property to which the lien would attach has been
transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a
bona fide encumbrance for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to
the date on which the first installment of taxes would become delinquent, then
the lien that would otherwise be imposed by this section shall not attach to
real property and the costs of enforcement relating to the property shall be
transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.
   C.    The amount of any fee, cost, or charge shall not exceed the actual
cost incurred performing the inspections and enforcement activity, including
permit fees, fines, late charges, and interest.

or inspection activity regarding a violation in which the violation was evident
on the plans that received a building permit.

in plain language of the proposed lien, a description of the basis for the

this subsection to an administrative hearing officer designated by the city
manager. The administrative hearing officer shall make a written recommendation
to the city council which shall include factual findings based on evidence
introduced at the hearing. The city council may adopt the recommendation
without further notice of hearing, or may set the matter for a de novo hearing
before the city council. Notice in writing of the de novo hearing shall be
provided to the property owner at least ten (10) days in advance of the
scheduled hearing.
   G.    If the city council determines that the lien authorized pursuant to
subsection A of this section shall become a lien, the body may also cause a
notice of lien to be recorded. This lien shall attach upon recordation in the
office of the county recorder and shall have the same force, priority, and
effect as a judgment lien, not a tax lien. The notice shall, at a minimum,
identify the record owner or possessor of the property, set forth the last
known address of the record owner or possessor, set forth the date upon which
the lien was created against the property, and include a description of the
real property subject to the lien and the amount of the lien. (Ord. 2015-01, 3-

Government Code sections 51030 through 51034 provide authority for the
legislative bodies of California cities to license and regulate the business of
massage. In enacting this chapter, the city council recognizes that massage is
a viable professional field offering the public valuable health and therapeutic
services. However, there are known instances, both within and outside the city,
where the practice of massage and the operation of massage establishments have
been associated with unlawful activity and pose a threat to the quality of life
in the community. It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare by adopting regulations to prevent blighting
conditions and deter criminal activity that could occur from the practice of
massage and the operation of massage establishments. It is not the intent of
this chapter to punish legitimate massage practitioners and establishments.

by the City Council if requested by the business owner.
      19.   Shipments Of Supplies And Transportation Of Product: The following
rules apply to deliveries, shipments and transportation:
         a.   Shipments of supplies to the premises shall only occur as

markings indicating that deliveries are being made to a commercial cannabis
operation.
         b.   The transportation of cannabis samples and/or products to and
from the premises shall be in unmarked vehicles with no indication that the
vehicles are transporting cannabis samples and/or products. The responsible
party shall stagger transportation times, vary routes from the facility, and
take other security measures as requested by the Police Chief.
      20.   Premises Maintenance: The business owner, operator, and all
responsible parties shall continually maintain the premises and its
infrastructure so that it is visually attractive and not dangerous to the
health, safety, and general welfare of employees, patrons, surrounding
properties, and the general public. The premises or commercial cannabis
operation shall not be maintained in a manner that causes a public or private
nuisance.
      21.   Location Of Uses: Except for deliveries as defined in section
4-8-2 of this chapter, the commercial cannabis operation permitted by this

permit. Other than for deliveries as defined in this chapter, commercial
cannabis operations shall not operate at any location other than as stated in

fees that apply to City of Lemoore dispensaries, of whatever kind, that are
legally effective at the time of the delivery. The taxes and fees shall be
remitted within thirty (30) days of the transaction. A failure to timely remit
the fees and taxes shall be a separate violation from the unlawful delivery of
cannabis into the City.
   F.   Project Development Agreement:
      1.   Purpose: The purposes of a Project Development Agreement are as
follows: a) to allow the City Council to select the desired business owner and
operator to ensure that the business owner and operator will conform to
community norms; b) to determine the precise type of commercial cannabis
operation and whether the operation will be limited to medicinal cannabis; c)
to allow the precise project details, including building design and elevations,
to be negotiated with the City to ensure compatibility with the surrounding
area; and d) to guarantee that the City will receive the revenue raising fee
set forth in this chapter.
      2.   Form: The Project Development Agreement shall be in a form approved
by the City Attorney. Depending on the relationship between the premises owner
and business owner, the City Council may require that the commercial cannabis
operator be selected through an RFP process or by negotiation. City staff shall
develop guidelines for the selection of an operator and a checklist for the
terms to be included in the Project Development Agreement. Those documents
shall be made available to the public.
      3.   Approval: The Project Development Agreement shall be negotiated at
the staff level and processed concurrently with the regulatory permit, as
further set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 2019-03, 7-2-2019; amd. Ord. 2020-08,

at the discretion of the City Council in conjunction with a Project Development
Agreement with the applicant. No regulatory permit will be considered by the

permit the same reasons that are grounds for denial of a conditional use
permit. The City Council will also consider the prior cannabis business
history, both within and outside of California, and criminal background of the
applicant. No regulatory permit shall be issued if the applicant cannot
demonstrate that it can fully comply with this chapter.

the date of the application; or convicted of a crime involving the illegal use,
possession, transportation, distribution or similar activities related to
controlled substances, as defined in the Federal Controlled Substances Act,
with the exception of marijuana related offenses for which the conviction
occurred prior to passage of the California Compassionate Use Act. A conviction
would include a plea or verdict of guilty or a conviction following a plea of
nolo contendere (i.e. "no contest").
      4.   The applicant has engaged in misconduct related to the
qualifications, functions or duties of a permittee.
      5.   The applicant has committed any act, which, if done by a permittee,
would be grounds for suspension or revocation of a permit.

where applicable, resulting in disturbances, vandalism, or crowd control
problems occurring inside of or outside the premises, traffic control problems,
or obstruction of the operation of another business.
         f.   A failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the
regulatory permit.
         g.   Any act which would be considered grounds for denial of the

operation, or in the case of an employee permit, the employee is convicted of a
public offense in any court for the violation of any law which relates to the
permit.
      2.   The Police Chief determines that immediate suspension is necessary
to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. The Police
Chief shall articulate the grounds for the immediate suspension in writing and
the suspension shall only be for as long as necessary to address the
circumstances which led to the immediate suspension.
   K.   Effect Of Denial Or Revocation: When the City Council shall have denied
a regulatory permit or revoked a regulatory permit, or the Police Chief shall
have denied or revoked an employee permit, no new application for a regulatory

that it is approving this chapter allowing commercial cannabis operations to
operate in the City with the express understanding that the business (exclusive
of cannabis special events and smoking lounges) will pay the revenue raising
fee to the City as set forth herein, and that without the revenue raising fee,
the City Council would not have adopted this chapter allowing commercial
cannabis operations to operate in the City. By opening a commercial cannabis
operation in the City, the premises owner, business owner, operator, and all
responsible parties agree that, if the revenue raising fee is challenged by any
one of them or a third party and set aside, the business must cease operation.
      2.   Amount Of Fee And Terms Of Payment: The revenue raising fee shall be
an annual fee for all commercial cannabis operations (exclusive of cannabis
special events and smoking lounges) in the City and will be set forth as a
condition of the Project Development Agreement. The revenue raising fee shall
be payable in advance, in not less than quarterly installments, with the first
quarterly payment due prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. The
first payment shall not be prorated, and in no event shall the first payment be
less that the equivalent of one full quarterly payment. All quarterly payments
shall be received by the City before the end of the quarter. The revenue
raising fee shall be as follows:
         a.   Non-Dispensary Commercial Cannabis Operations:
            (1)   Manufacturing: Fifteen dollars ($15.00) a square foot of the
commercial cannabis operation, with a minimum fee of forty five thousand
dollars ($45,000.00).
            (2)   Cultivation (excluding nurseries): Six dollars ($6.00) a
cubic foot of the cultivation.
            (3)   Nurseries: Two dollars ($2.00) per square foot of the
cultivation.
            (4)   Other non-dispensary commercial cannabis operations: Ten
dollars ($10.00) per square foot for the first three thousand (3,000) square
feet of the commercial cannabis operation, eight dollars ($8.00) a square foot
for additional square footage in the amount of three thousand one (3,001)
square feet to five thousand (5,000) square feet, and six dollars ($6.00) a
square foot for any additional square footage over five thousand (5,000) square
feet.
         b.   Dispensaries: Five percent (5%) of gross sales revenues.
         c.   Multiple Cannabis Operations: If more than one commercial
cannabis operation operates on the premises, whether within a single building
or multiple buildings, each regulatory permit holder shall be responsible for
paying the revenue raising fee.
      3.   Alternative Voter-Approved Tax: If the voters of the City approve a
tax on the applicable commercial cannabis operations, the business owner shall
pay that tax in lieu of the revenue raising fee that the tax is designed to
replace.
      4.   Other Taxes: In addition to any other business or license fees
required under this chapter, the business owner or State-licensed cannabis
permittee shall be responsible for collecting and remitting any and all taxes,
whatever their nature, that are legally in effect at the time of the sale or
transfer of cannabis or cannabis products. (Ord. 2019-03, 7-2-2019)
4-8-10: VIOLATION AND PENALTY:
The following remedies shall apply for violations of this chapter:
   A.   Criminal Enforcement: Violations for conduct that is not otherwise
considered lawful under State law, shall be considered misdemeanors and are
punishable by the maximum penalty of six (6) months' imprisonment in the County
Jail or a fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), as well as the
administrative penalties as set forth below. Each and every day, or portion
thereof, that a violation exists is a separate offense.
Should a court of competent jurisdiction subsequently determine that the
criminal penalty provision renders this chapter unlawful, the City intends that
the misdemeanor provision be severable from the remaining penalty provisions
and the City will only pursue non-criminal remedies for violations of this
chapter.
   B.   Administrative Enforcement: The City may also pursue all applicable
civil and administrative remedies, including but not limited to injunctive
relief and administrative citations.
   C.   Nuisance: Any use or condition caused or permitted to exist in
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter shall be and is hereby
declared a public nuisance and may be summarily abated by the City pursuant to
this Code.
   D.   Civil Penalties: Any person who violates the provisions of this chapter
may be subject to an administrative fine of up to one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each violation and for each day the violation continues to
persist.
   E.   Nonexclusive Remedies: All remedies set forth in this section are not
exclusive and the exercise of any remedy does not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy that may now or subsequently exist in law or in equity or by
statute or otherwise. (Ord. 2019-03, 7-2-2019)

determined to exist whereby a noise disturbance caused by an animal affects
only one individual. Any noise caused by an animal which is audible
continuously for ten (10) minutes, or intermittently for thirty (30) minutes,
shall be prima facie evidence of such annoyance or discomfort. Factors which
can be used to evaluate excessive animal noise include, but are not limited to:

it furthers blight, encourages acts of vandalism, depreciates the value of
surrounding properties, and is inconsistent with the City's property
maintenance goals and aesthetic standards.

quickly removed, other properties soon become the target of graffiti. The
existence of graffiti tends to begin community discontent and contempt for the

it furthers blight, encourages acts of vandalism, depreciates the value of
surrounding properties, and is inconsistent with the City's property
maintenance goals and aesthetic standards.

quickly removed, other properties soon become the target of graffiti. The

In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority
granted by the State of California under section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to
remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof
as public nuisances, the City Council hereby makes the following findings and
declarations:
The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative
vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property not including highways
is hereby found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private
property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create
fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the
health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and
to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the
presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or part
thereof on private or public property not including highways, except as
expressly hereinafter permitted, is hereby declared to constitute a public
nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this
Chapter. (1975 Code §9-17.01)
6-5-2: DEFINITIONS:
As used in this Chapter, the following words and terms shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this Section:
HIGHWAY: A way or place of whatever nature, publicly maintained and open to the
use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel. Highway includes street.
PUBLIC PROPERTY: Does not include "highway".
VEHICLE: A device by which any person or property may be propelled, moved or
drawn upon a highway, except a device moved by human power or used exclusively
upon stationary rails or tracks. (1975 Code §9-17.01)
6-5-3: ABANDONED, INOPERABLE VEHICLES PROHIBITED:
It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor for any person to abandon, park, store
or leave or permit the abandonment, parking, storing or leaving of any licensed
or unlicensed vehicle or part thereof which is in an abandoned, wrecked,
dismantled or inoperative condition upon any private property or public
property not including highways within the City for a period in excess of
thirty (30) days unless such vehicle or part thereof is completely enclosed
within a building in a lawful manner where it is not plainly visible from the
street or other public or private property, or unless such vehicle is stored or
parked in a lawful manner on private property in connection with the business
of a licensed dismantler, licensed vehicle dealer or a junkyard. (1975 Code §9-
17.15)
It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor for any person to fail or refuse to
remove an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or part thereof
or refuse to abate such nuisance when ordered to do so in accordance with the
abatement provisions of this Chapter or State law where such State law is
applicable. (1975 Code §9-17.16)
6-5-4: ABATEMENT PROCEDURE:
   A.   Public Hearing: A public hearing shall be held on the question of
abatement and removal of the vehicle or part thereof as an abandoned, wrecked,
dismantled or inoperative vehicle and the assessment of the administrative
costs and the cost of removal of the vehicle or part thereof against the
property on which it is located. (1975 Code §9-17.07)
      1.   Applicability: The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to: a)
a vehicle or part thereof that is completely enclosed within a building in a
lawful manner where it is not visible from the street or other public or
private property, or b) a vehicle or part thereof that is stored or parked in a
lawful manner on private property in connection with the business of a licensed
dismantler, licensed vehicle dealer, or a junkyard. The exception provided by
this subsection A1 shall not, however, authorize the maintenance of a public or
private nuisance as defined under provisions of law other than chapter 10 of
division 11 of the Vehicle Code.
      2.   Notice: Not less than a ten (10) day notice of intention to abate
and remove the vehicle or part thereof as a public nuisance shall be issued by
the Chief of Police or his or her designee, unless the property owner and the
owner of the vehicle have signed releases authorizing removal and waiving
further interest in the vehicle or part thereof. However, the notice of
intention is not required for removal of a vehicle or part thereof that is
inoperable due to the absence of a motor, transmission, or wheels and incapable
of being towed, is valued at less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) by a
person specified in section 22855 of the Vehicle Code, and is determined by the
local agency to be a public nuisance presenting an immediate threat to public
health or safety, provided that the property owner has signed a release
authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the vehicle or part
thereof. Prior to final disposition under section 22662 of the Vehicle Code of
such a low-valued vehicle or part for which evidence of registration was
recovered pursuant to subsection C3 of this Section, the Chief of Police or his
or her designee shall provide notice to the registered and legal owners of
intent to dispose of the vehicle or part, and if the vehicle or part is not
claimed and removed within twelve (12) days after the notice is mailed, from a
location specified in section 22662 of the Vehicle Code, final disposition may
proceed. This subsection A2 applies only to inoperable vehicles located upon a
parcel that is: a) zoned for agricultural use, or b) not improved with a
residential structure containing one or more dwelling units.
      3.   Hearing Rights: The ten (10) day notice of intention to abate and
remove a vehicle or part thereof, when required by this subsection A, shall
contain a statement of the hearing rights of the owner of the property on which
the vehicle is located and of the owner of the vehicle. The statement shall
include notice to the property owner that he or she may appear in person at a
hearing or may submit a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the
presence of the vehicle on the land, with his or her reasons for such denial,
in lieu of appearing. The notice of intention to abate shall be mailed, by
registered or certified mail, to the owner of the land as shown on the last
equalized assessment roll and to the last registered and legal owners of record
unless the vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not
available to determine ownership.
      4.   Public Hearing: A public hearing shall be held before the Chief of
Police or his or her designee upon request for such a hearing by the owner of
the vehicle or the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located. This
request shall be made to the Chief of Police within ten (10) days after the
mailing of notice of intention to abate and remove the vehicle or at the time
of signing a release pursuant to subsection A2 of this Section. If the owner of
the land on which the vehicle is located submits a sworn written statement
denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his or her land
within that time period, this statement shall be construed as a request for
hearing that does not require the presence of the owner submitting the request.
If the request is not received within that period, the Chief of Police or his
or her designee shall have the authority to remove the vehicle.
      5.   Vehicle Reconstruction: After a vehicle has been removed, it shall
not be reconstructed or made operable, unless it is a vehicle that qualifies
for either horseless carriage license plates or historical vehicle license
plates, pursuant to section 5004 of the Vehicle Code, in which case the vehicle
may be reconstructed or made operable.
      6.   Responsibility: The owner of the land on which the vehicle is
located may appear in person at the hearing or present a sworn written
statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land,
with his or her reasons for the denial. If it is determined at the hearing that
the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the landowner and
that he or she has not subsequently acquiesced to its presence, then the City
shall not assess costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the
property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect
those costs from the owner.
      7.   Conduct Of Hearings: Except as provided in subsection B of this
Section, all hearings under this Chapter shall be held before the Chief of
Police or his or her designee, who shall hear all facts and testimony he or she
deems pertinent. Said facts and testimony may include testimony on the
condition of the vehicle or part thereof and the circumstances concerning its
location on the said private property or public property. The hearing officer
shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence. (Ord. 9609, 12-3-1996)
      8.   Decisions: The hearing officer may impose such conditions and take

CHAPTER 3
STREET NAMING AND HOUSE NUMBERING
SECTION:
7-3-1: Purpose
7-3-2: Roadway Naming
7-3-3: House And Building Numbering
7-3-1: PURPOSE:
This chapter establishes regulations for and the process of naming streets
within the city of Lemoore. It also establishes the process for assigning house
numbers to individual homes and other buildings. By adopting these standards
and policies, the city establishes uniform practices for the naming of streets
in order to avoid potential conflicting names or misunderstandings and to
promote the public welfare and general convenience of the community. (Ord.
2012-01, 4-17-2012)
7-3-2: ROADWAY NAMING:
Street names within a proposed subdivision shall comply with the following
standards:
   A.   General Naming Standards:
      1.   Street names shall be such that they do not duplicate or confuse
with any other street names in Lemoore and its vicinity (e.g., the sphere of
influence, Lemoore Naval Air Station). Examples of such duplication are
"Washington Street" and "Washington Avenue".
      2.   Street names that sound very similar shall be avoided. This is to
limit diction problems when people are reporting under stress. Examples of such
confusing names are "Beach" and "Peach", or "Pinewood" and "Pinwood".
      3.   A street that is proposed to be extended without any significant
change in direction, either now or in the future, shall have the same name as
the existing street.
      4.   A new street that is aligned to an existing street but otherwise is
not intended to be connected to the existing street, either now or in the
future, will have a different name. This is to make it convenient for strangers
to town to locate addresses and prevent unnecessary delay in response time in
emergency situations.
      5.   The street name will not change if a street changes direction by
curving gradually over a sufficient distance.
      6.   The streets shall not be named after people's first names and shall
have not more than two (2) words. Exceptions may be granted in a case where the
street name is to honor a person of national, state, or local importance (e.g.,
Martin Luther King Avenue, George Washington Street).
      7.   Except for county avenues, the street names shall not be numerals.
      8.   When an existing street name consists of a fractional number (e.g.,
181/2 Avenue, 183/4 Avenue, and 191/2 Avenue), those may be changed to new
names upon annexation.
      9.   The combined number of letters in a street name (excluding the
suffix) shall not exceed fifteen (15).
   B.   Suffixes:
      1.   Street suffixes in any subdivision or development may be:
         a.   The same for all streets;
         b.   The same for all streets except cul-de-sac streets;
         c.   North-south streets as "avenue" and east-west streets as
"streets";
         d.   Curvilinear streets as "drive" or "trail"; or
         e.   Short streets (less than 500 feet) as "way".
      2.   The name of cul-de-sac streets shall be different from the main
street from which it originates. The suffix of cul-de-sac streets shall be as
follows:
         a.   "Court" if it is generally east of the street it originates from;
         b.   "Circle" if it is generally west of the street it originates
from;
         c.   "Lane" if it is generally north of the street it originates from;
         d.   "Place" if it is generally south of the street it originates
from.
      3.   Where a cul-de-sac street crosses another street, the portion of the
cul-de-sac street on either side of the other street will have the same name
except for the suffix.

thereof, in the manner hereinabove provided for the giving of the notice to
provide the required underground facilities, of the time and place that the
Council will pass upon such report and will hear protests against such
assessment. Such notice shall also set forth the amount of the proposed
assessment.
      4.   Upon the date and hour set for the hearing of protests, the Council
shall hear and consider the report and all protests, if there be any, and then
proceed to affirm, modify or reject the assessment.
      5.   If any assessment is not paid within five (5) days after its
confirmation by the Council, the amount of the assessment shall become a lien
upon the property against which the assessment is made by the Director of
Public Works, and the Director of Public Works is directed to turn over to the
Assessor and Tax Collector a notice of lien on each of said properties on which
the assessment has not been paid, and said Assessor and Tax Collector shall add
the amount of said assessment to the next regular bill for taxes levied against
the premises upon which said assessment was not paid. Said assessment shall be
due and payable at the same time as said property taxes are due and payable,
and if not paid when due and payable, shall bear interest at the rate of six

7-7A-4: AUTHORITY TO TURN ON AND SHUT OFF WATER:
No one except the City Water Collector or a regularly authorized officer of the
Water Department shall turn the water off or on at any premises. (Ord. 8205,
10-5-1982)
7-7A-5: APPLICATION FOR WATER SERVICE:
In every case in which any property owner or his agent desires a connection to
be made to the water mains of the City, an application must be made to the
Utility Billing Department. Applications from public agencies, landowners,
developers, or commercial businesses for water service outside the City
boundaries shall be evaluated and approved consistent with subsections
7-7C-2B and C of this chapter.
Each applicant for water service may be required to establish credit before
service will be initiated. Credit will be deemed established if the applicant
meets any or all conditions established by City Council resolution.
   A.   If a deposit is made or required to establish credit, it shall be paid
to the Utility Billing Department, which will deposit it into a special, non-
interest-bearing account dedicated exclusively for such purposes. In the event
the service account becomes delinquent or when service is terminated, the
deposit will be applied to the customer's unpaid bill(s). If the deposit
exceeds the amount of the bill(s), the excess amount will be refunded to the
customer. The deposit shall be refunded to a customer who has paid all bills
for water service without delinquency for the prior twelve (12) consecutive
months. If the City draws against the deposit to cover delinquent payments, the
City may require the customer to restore the deposit to its original amount as
a condition of providing ongoing water service.
   B.   The Water Division shall furnish temporary service, if feasible, to any
applicant on the following conditions:
      1.   Applicant will be required to pay the estimated cost of installing
and removing the facilities necessary to furnish service in advance; and
      2.   Applicant will be required to establish credit in the manner set
forth in subsection A of this section.
   C.   Before any such application for water service is granted, the Utility
Billing Department shall confirm that applicant has paid any delinquent utility
services account with the City in the name of the applicant, the applicant's
spouse, any co-resident, business firm or association with which the applicant
is or has been associated in such a way as to benefit directly from the City's
utility service. If it is discovered later that any customer had an outstanding
delinquent account with the City for utility services at the time of the
application in the name of the applicant, the applicant's spouse, any co-
resident, business firm or association with which the applicant is or has been
associated in such a way as to benefit directly from the City's utility
service, then the outstanding balance of any such account shall be added on to
the balance of the customer's new account. (Ord. 2018-07, 9-18-2018)
7-7A-5.5: WATER METERS; NEW SERVICE:
As a condition of new water service, a suitable water meter to measure the
water service shall be installed on the water service facilities in accordance
with chapter 8 (commencing with section 500) of the California Water Code. The
cost of installation of the meter shall be paid by the water user, and the City
does hereby impose the cost of the installation of the meter in the amounts set
forth in resolution 8808 (adopted May 17, 1988, and as amended, from time to
time, thereafter). The provisions of this section shall be construed consistent
with the provisions of section 110 of the Water Code and chapter 8 of division
1 of the Water Code.
   A.   New applicants for domestic service, which is defined as an existing
non-metered service, may select to maintain the unmetered service and to pay
the established unmetered flat rate. Once an applicant or customer has elected
either a flat or metered rate, it shall be billed for its service under the
selected rate schedule while it remains a customer. All new connections to the
water system shall be metered with a meter of at least one inch (1") in size
and installation of such meters shall be at the sole cost and expense of the
applicant.
      1.   Should a customer remodel, modify, change or alter its premises and
the cost of such remodeling, modification, change or alteration exceeds five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00), the customer shall be required to install a water
meter to measure water use at the customer's premises. The customer shall pay
the total cost of the purchase and installation of the meter, including,
without limitation, the cost of the meter-box.
      2.   Should any Federal, State or local law, regulation or ordinance
mandate the installation of water meters for any type of water use, including,
without limitation, the installation of water meters on currently unmetered
service connections, then on the date any such Federal, State or local law,
regulation or ordinance is passed, adopted or enacted, the installation of the
required water meters shall be at the sole cost and expense of the owner of the
real property upon which the meter is to be installed.
      3.   If a customer's premises are demolished, destroyed or removed from
the real property upon which they are located, reconnection to the water system
shall require a meter and all costs shall be borne by the customer.
      4.   Installation of all new water services, including, without
limitation, water meters, shall be performed by contractors and/or
subcontractors who are duly licensed by the California State Licensing Board.
All methods, materials, work procedures, and workmanship shall conform to City
standards and must be approved by the City's Utilities Director or their
designee.
      5.   Customers who install meters shall only install City- approved
meters, automated meter reading devices, and meter boxes. Determination of
whether a turbine or compound meter is required shall be made by the Utilities
Director or their designee. All meters, automated meter reading devices, and
meter boxes installed to the City's satisfaction shall become and remain the
sole property of the City and shall be serviced and maintained by the City.
      6.   Approved backflow devices that are required to be installed by the
Utilities Director or their designee are required to be tested annually and
repaired by a certified tester approved by the Utilities Director or their
designee, so they remain in good working order at the sole expense of the
customer. If the customer fails to have the backflow device tested or repaired
in the timeframes provided in the service notice from the Water Division, the
City reserves the right (but shall not be required) to test and/or repair the
device at the sole cost of the customer and to charge the customer for costs
incurred and administrative and inspection fees established by a separate City
Council resolution.
      7.   Subsections A1 through A6 of this section shall also apply to any
customer premises located outside of the City limits, but within a County area
receiving water service from the City.
   B.   Applicants for commercial service or industrial service shall be served
under metered rates. (Ord. 2018-07, 9-18-2018)
7-7A-6: WATER TAPS:
All taps to water mains shall be made by the Water Superintendent. No person
shall make any tap or in any other way tamper or meddle with any of the
property of the City waterworks without the written permission to do so by
order of the City Council or the Water Superintendent. (Ord. 8205, 10-5-1982)
7-7A-7: STOPCOCKS:
There shall be a stopcock in every connection at a point designated by the
Water Superintendent. Said stopcock and the box containing the same shall be
for the exclusive use of the City and shall be under its exclusive control. The
City shall not be responsible for damages to any building or its contents from
any break beyond the service box; and the water consumers are hereby required
for their own protection to provide at their own expense another stopcock to be
placed at the first suitable joint beyond the stop or service of the City.
(Ord. 8205, 10-5-1982)
7-7A-8: PROHIBITED ACTS AND CONDITIONS:
   A.   Use Of Water To Other Property: No consumer of water from the City or
any other person shall under any circumstances furnish any water from his
service to any person or upon any lot or property for which the prescribed rate
is not being paid.
   B.   Obstructing Water System: No person shall place on or about any hydrant
or stopcock connecting with the pipes of the waterworks of the City any
building materials or other obstruction which will prevent free access to the
same. (Ord. 8205, 10-5-1982)
7-7A-9: SHUTTING OFF WATER:
   A.   Repairs And Extensions: The City reserves the right to shut off the
water at any time for the purpose of making repairs or extensions to the system
or any other purpose and assumes no responsibility for any damage resulting
from the water being turned off.
   B.   Fires: When an alarm of fire is turned in, the water consumers on the
City mains must immediately turn off all taps, faucets or any means of letting
water run, which may at the time be open, and the water is not to be turned on
again until such fire is known to be extinguished.
   C.   Delinquencies And Non-Payment: The City reserves the right to shut off
the water at any time service charges become delinquent as described in this
article. (Ord. 2018-07, 9-18-2018)
7-7A-10: WATER SERVICE RATES AND CHARGES:
   A.   Powers Of The City Council: The City Council may, by resolution,
further define any of the uses classified herein, resolve any uncertainties
regarding the proper rate under specified conditions, and establish rates for
any use not herein specifically enumerated.
   B.   Rates Established: The monthly rates to be collected by the City for
water supplied from its waterworks to consumers shall be established by
resolution of the City Council in accordance with City ordinance 8205 and the
provisions of Government Code section 54354.5 as they may be amended from time
to time. The City Council in establishing rates may require that services to
premises located outside the City be billed at rates one and one-half (11/2)
times the calculated meter rate for metered services and one and one-half (11/
2) times the established flat rate for metered services. No water service shall
be furnished to any customer free of charge.
   C.   Payment Of Water Rates And Charges: All water charges shall be
collected together with, and not separately from, the charges for any other
utility service rendered by the City, and all charges shall be billed upon the
same bill and collected as one item. All utility service charges shall be
payable upon presentation date at the Office of the Finance Department and
shall be delinquent on the twenty fifth (25th) day of the subsequent calendar
month following the date of presentment.
      1.   The owner or owners of any parcel of real property together with any
and all occupants of such real property shall be jointly liable for all charges
incurred by reason of the use of said water service by any and all occupants of
such real property.
      2.   A fee of twenty five dollars ($25.00) shall be charged on all
returned payments of utility charges.
   D.   Disputed Bills: Should the amount of any bill for service be
questioned, the customer should promptly request an explanation. If the
explanation is not satisfactory or is not understood, the customer must pay the
bill under protest to avoid discontinuance of service. Protests will be
addressed to the Assistant City Manager/Administrative Services Director, must
be in writing, and must state the reasons why the charges are believed to be
incorrect. The Assistant City Manager/Administrative Services Director will
analyze the facts of the case and is authorized to make such adjustments in the
charges as may be necessary to effect an equitable settlement. Failure of a
customer to pay under protest after initial explanation is offered will result
in discontinuance of service without further notice if bill is not paid by the
delinquency date.
   E.   Delinquencies: The City Council may, by resolution, provide for a basic
penalty for nonpayment of the charges within the time and in the manner
prescribed by it. Imposition of said basic penalty shall be in accordance with
the provisions of Government Code section 54348, as amended from time to time.
The City Council also may, by resolution, provide for the imposition of a fee
to pay the costs associated with notices provided pursuant to this section.
      In the event any customer fails to pay the water service charges,
connection fees, or other required charges and fees identified in this section,
and such charges or fees become delinquent pursuant to subsection C of this
section, the City may assess a basic penalty for late payment in the amount of
thirty dollars ($30.00) which amount shall be added to the delinquent charges
and fees, and the Assistant City Manager/Administrative Services Director shall
collect the basic penalty along with the delinquent charges and fees.
      1.   Discontinuance Of Service Of Non-Residential Customers For
Nonpayment: In the event any non-residential customer fails to pay any charges
or fees described in this chapter, including any penalty or interest, by four
o’clock (4:00) P.M. on the due date shown on the City-issued delinquency
notice, the City, in addition to all other remedies it may have, may
discontinue furnishing water service and all other services identified on the
applicable utility bill and shall not resume service until all outstanding
charges and fees, together with any penalties, interest, service charges and/or
connection fees necessitated by the resumption of water service, have been paid
in full. Prior to discontinuing all services identified on the applicable City
utility bill, the City shall send a written delinquency notice to the non-
residential customer advising that all utilities identified on the bill will be
discontinued if payment of the total amount identified in said written notice
is not paid within ten (10) days after the date of the written notice.
      2.   Discontinuance Of Service For Residential Customers For Nonpayment:
In the event any residential customer fails to pay any charges or fees
described in this chapter, including any penalty or interest, then in addition
to all other remedies it may have, the City may discontinue residential water
service to that residential customer in accordance with the City’s Policy on
Discontinuance of Residential Water Service, as the same may be amended from
time to time by the City Council. If the City discontinues water services of a
residential customer for nonpayment, it shall provide the residential customer
with information on how to restore residential water service. Unless otherwise
provided City’s Policy on Discontinuance of Residential Water Service, service
shall not resume until all outstanding charges and fees, together with any
penalties, interest, service charges and/or connection fees necessitated by the
resumption of water service, have been paid in full.
      3.   Reconnections Of Service: Reconnections will only be processed
Monday through Friday from eight o’clock (8:00) A.M. to twelve o’clock (12:00)
noon and one o’clock (1:00) P.M. to four o’clock (4:00) P.M., and will not be
processed on City-observed holidays. Reconnection of service by unauthorized
individuals will result in additional charges established by separate Council
resolution and the incident will be reported to the proper authorities. Any
check not honored by a financial institution that is used to make payment on a
customer’s utility account will result in additional fees established by
separate Council resolution and will be a basis for the disconnection of
service.
      4.   Court Action: In addition to discontinuing all utilities identified
on the applicable City utility bill, the City may file a civil action against
the customer for the collection of any amounts due and unpaid. Such remedy
shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy provided in this
chapter or by law. In any such action, the delinquent balances may also be
processed through a collection agency.
      5.   Notice Of Liens: In the event a customer fails to pay in full all
charges, fees or penalties identified in this chapter within ninety (90) days
of the date of any City utility bill, the City shall notify the owner of the
real property receiving the water service, in writing, of such delinquency and
that the delinquency shall be collected pursuant to the provisions of
subsection E6 of this section.
      6.   Collection Through Tax Roll: In the alternative to filing a civil
action against the customer, the City Council, pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the California Health and Safety Code, may elect to have all
delinquent charges, fees and penalties collected on the tax roll in the same
manner, at the same time and by the same persons together with and not
separately from general taxes. Such delinquent charges, fees and penalties
shall thereafter constitute a lien against the lot or parcel of land against
which the charges have been imposed.
      7.   Recording Of Lien: In addition to or in lieu of collecting
delinquent fees through the tax roll, the City may, in accordance with
California Health and Safety Code section 5473.11, as may be amended, record a
lien against the real property for which fees are delinquent.
      8.   Restoration Of Service: The discontinued utility services shall not
be restored until all charges, fees and penalties, including without
limitation, all expenses of removal, discontinuance, disconnection, restoration
and reconnection have been paid. If water service has been discontinued for
failure to pay a utility bill as set forth in subsection E1 or E2 of this
section, the entire amount of the water bill and all fines and penalties
provided hereunder shall be paid in full before water service is restored:
         a.   Service Restoration of water, twenty five dollars ($25.00);
         b.   In addition to any other fees or charges provided in this
section, any customer requesting a turn-on of water on any Saturday, Sunday,
legal holiday or before the hour of eight o'clock (8:00) A.M. or after the hour
of three thirty o'clock (3:30) P.M. of any day shall pay an additional charge
of one hundred twenty dollars ($120.00) for such turn-on.
         c.   Customers who have their water turned off due to nonpayment on a
regularly scheduled water turn-off day will be charged a same day turn-on fee
of sixty dollars ($60.00) to have their water turned on that day. No additional
charge will be assessed to the customer for next day turn-on.
      If water service has been discontinued for a residential customer
pursuant to subsection E2 of this section, and the residential customer is able
to demonstrate to the City that the household income is below two hundred
percent (200%) of the federal poverty line, fees for restoration of service and
interest charges, if applicable, shall be: (i) fifty dollars ($50.00), but not
to exceed the actual cost of reconnection, for reconnection during normal
operating hours; and (ii) one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00), but not to
exceed the actual cost of reconnection, for reconnection during nonoperational
hours; provided that such reconnection fees shall be subject to an annual
adjustment for changes in the Consumer Price Index as set forth in the City’s
Policy on Discontinuance of Residential Water Service.
      9.   Dangerous Or Unsafe Equipment: The City may discontinue water
service without notice to the customer when the apparatus, appliances or
equipment using water, in the sole opinion of the City, is found to be
dangerous or unsafe. The City shall promptly notify the customer of the reasons
for the discontinuance and the corrective action to be taken by the customer
before service can be restored.
      10.   Detrimental Or Injurious To Water Service To Others: The City may
discontinue service without notice to any customer when the use of water
thereon by the apparatus, appliances, equipment or otherwise is found by the
City in its sole discretion, to be detrimental or injurious to water service
furnished to other customers. The City shall promptly notify the customer of
the reasons for the discontinuance and the corrective action to be taken by the
customer before service can be restored.
      11.   Fraudulent Or Unauthorized Use: The City may discontinue water
service without notice to any customer when it is determined by the City, in
its sole discretion, that the customer has obtained water service by fraudulent
means or has diverted the water service for unauthorized use. The City shall
not restore service until the customer has complied with all the City's rules
and regulations, and the City has been reimbursed for the full amount of the
service rendered and the actual cost to the Water Division incurred by reason
of such fraudulent or unauthorized use.
   F.   Collections: Accounts shall be subject to collection of any delinquent
fees and charges in the following manner:
      1.   At the time the fees become delinquent and until such time they are
fully paid, the delinquent account balance, including late charges, shall
constitute an unrecorded lien against the property and, as such, may be
identified during a title search. For commercial businesses, delinquent account
balances, including late charges, may be considered an unrecorded lien against
the business name and/or owner of the business.
      2.   Once a year there may be prepared a report of delinquent fees,
including late charges. The City Council shall fix a time, date and place for
hearing the report and receive any objections or protests thereto.
      3.   The City Council shall cause notice of hearing to be mailed to the
landowners listed on the report not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the
date of the hearing.
      4.   At the hearing, the City Council shall hear any objections or
protests of landowners liable to be assessed for delinquent fees, including
late charges and administrative fees, as set by resolution of the City Council.
The City Council may make revisions or corrections to the report as it deems
just, after which, by resolution, the report shall be confirmed.
      5.   The delinquent fees set forth in the report as confirmed shall
constitute special assessments against the respective parcels of land and are a
lien on the property for the amount of such delinquent fees, including late
charges. A certified copy of the resolution confirming the assessments shall be
filed with the County Recorder and the County Auditor- Controller/Tax Collector
for the amounts of the respective assessments against the respective parcels as
they appear on the current assessment roll. The lien created attaches upon
filing. The assessments shall be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as other Property Taxes and shall be subject to the same penalties and
the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for such taxes.
All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of Property Taxes
shall be applicable to such assessments. However, if, for the first year for
which the charges are prescribed, the property served by the City has been
transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, and attached
thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of County taxes would
become delinquent, the charge will not result in a lien against the real
property, but shall become transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.
   G.   Vacant Premises; Responsibility For Rates And Charges: A customer may
have his or her water service discontinued by giving notice to the Water
Division not less than two (2) days before the effective date of the
discontinuance. Such customer shall be required to pay all water charges until
the effective date identified in such notice. When such notice is not given,
the customer shall be required to pay for water service until two (2) business
days after the Water Division has knowledge that the customer vacated the
premises or otherwise has discontinued water service.
   H.   Disposition Of Funds: The funds received from the collection of the
water service charges or rentals hereinabove set forth shall be deposited with
the City Treasurer and shall be accounted for and be known as the "Water Fund"
and when appropriated by the City Council shall be available for the payment of
interest or principal on any and all bonds issued and outstanding or which may
be issued for water pumping, storage and delivery facilities and to retire such
bonds when they mature and for the payment of cost and expenses of acquisition,
construction, operation, maintenance and repair of the City water system and
the extensions and improvements thereto.

the amount received allocated to the separate departments in the same ratio as
each such charge bears to the whole of the bill. (Ord. 2018-07, 9-18-2018; amd.
Ord. 2020-03, 4-7-2020)
7-7A-11: CROSS-CONNECTIONS:
7-7A-11-1: GENERAL POLICY:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section
7-7A-11 is:
      1.   To protect the public potable water supply of the City from the
possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within its customers'
internal distribution system(s) or its customers' private water system(s) such
contaminants or pollutants which could backflow or back- siphon into the public
water supply system; and
      2.   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between its customers' in- plant potable
water system(s) and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures and industrial
piping systems; and
      3.   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing system of cross-
connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
   B.   Responsibility: The Director of Public Works shall be responsible for
the protection of the public potable water distribution system from
contamination or pollution due to the backflow or back-siphonage of
contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the
judgment of said Director, an approved backflow prevention device is required,
at the City's water service connection to any customer's premises, for the
safety of the water system, the Director or his designated agent shall give
notice in writing to said customer to install such an approved backflow
prevention device at each service connection to his premises. The customer
shall immediately install such approved device or devices at his own expense;
and failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install said
device or devices immediately shall constitute a ground for discontinuing water
service to the premises until such device or devices have been properly
installed. (Ord. 8801, 1-19-1988)
7-7A-11-2: DEFINITIONS:
AIR-GAP: The unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between
the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing
fixture or other device and the flood level rim of said vessel. An approved
air-gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe, measured
vertically, above the top of the rim of the vessel, and in no case less than
one inch (1"). When an air- gap is used at the service connection to prevent
the contamination or pollution of the City's potable water system, an emergency
bypass shall be installed around the air-gap system and an approved reduced
pressure principle device shall be installed in the bypass system.
APPROVED: Accepted by the Director as meeting an applicable specification
stated or cited in this section
7-7A-11 or as suitable for the proposed use.
AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY: Any water supply on or available to the premises other
than the City's approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary waters
may include water from another public potable water supply or any natural
source(s) such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, etc., or "used waters"
or "industrial fluids". These waters may be polluted or contaminated, or they
may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the
City does not have sanitary control.
BACK-SIPHONAGE: The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into
the distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any source other
than its intended sources caused by the sudden reduction of pressure in the
potable water supply system.
BACKFLOW: The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances under
pressure into the distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any
source or sources other than its intended source.
BACKFLOW PREVENTER: A device or means designed to prevent backflow or back-
siphonage.
CONTAMINATION: An impairment of the quality of the potable water by sewage,
industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials to a degree
which creates an actual hazard to the public health through poisoning or
through the spread of disease.
CROSS-CONNECTION: Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures
between two (2) otherwise separate piping systems, one of which contains
potable water and the other nonpotable water or industrial fluids of
questionable safety, through which, or because of which, backflow or back-
siphonage may occur into the potable water system. A water service connection
between a public potable water distribution system and a customer's water
distribution system which is cross-connected to a contaminated fixture,
industrial fluid system or with a potentially contaminated supply or auxiliary
water system constitutes one type of cross-connection. Other types of cross-
connections include connectors such as swing connections, removable sections,
four-way plug valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or change-over
devices, sliding multiport tube, solid connections, etc.
CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL BY CONTAINMENT: The installation of an approved
backflow prevention device at the water service connection to any customer's
premises where it is physically and economically infeasible to find and
permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross-connections
within the customer's water system; or, it shall mean the installation of an
approved backflow prevention device on the service line leading to and
supplying a portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or
potential cross-connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or
controlled at the point of cross-connections.
CROSS-CONNECTIONS, CONTROLLED: A connection between a potable water system and
a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention device properly
installed that will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the
degree of hazard.
DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS: The Director of Public Works, hereafter called
Director, in charge of the Water Department of the City, is invested with the
authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross-
connection control program and for enforcement of the provisions of this
Section
7-7A-11.
DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY: An assembly of two (2) independently operating
approved check valves with tightly closing shut-off valves on each side of the
check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of each check
valve. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications
and approval of a recognized and City-approved testing agency for backflow
prevention devices. To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible
for in-line maintenance and testing.
HAZARD, DEGREE OF:
   Hazard, Health: Any condition, device or practice in the water supply system
and its operation which could create, or, in the judgment of the Director, may
create a danger to the health and well-being of the water consumer. An example
of a health hazard is a structural defect, including cross- connections, in a
water supply.
   Hazard, Plumbing: A plumbing-type cross-connection in a consumer's potable
water system that has not been properly protected by a vacuum breaker, air-gap
separation or backflow prevention device. Unprotected plumbing type cross-
connections are considered to be a health hazard.
   Hazard, Pollutional: An actual or potential threat to the physical
properties of the water system or to the potability of the public or the
consumer's potable water system but which would constitute a nuisance or be
aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its
appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health.
   Hazard, System: An actual or potential threat of severe damage to the
physical properties of the City's potable water system or the consumer's
potable water system or of a pollution or contamination which would have a
protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.
INDUSTRIAL FLUIDS SYSTEM: Any system containing a fluid or solution which may
be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or
concentration such as would constitute a health, system, pollutional or
plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water supply. This may include,
but not be limited to: polluted or contaminated waters; all types of process
waters and "used waters" originating from the public potable water system which
may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid form; plating
acids and alkalies, circulated cooling waters connected to an open cooling
tower and/or cooling towers that are chemically or biologically treated or
stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters such as from
wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or
systems, etc.; oils, gases, glycerine, paraffins, caustic and acid solutions
and other liquid and gaseous fluids used in industrial or other purposes or for
firefighting purposes.
POLLUTION: The presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic, or
biological) in water which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a
hazard or impair the usefulness or quality of the water to a degree which does
not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely and
unreasonably affect such waters for domestic use.
REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE DEVICE: An assembly of two (2) independently
operating approved check valves with an automatically operating differential
relief valve between the two (2) check valves, tightly closing shut-off valves
on either side of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the
testing of the check and relief valves. The entire assembly shall meet the
design and performance specifications and approval of a recognized and City-
approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies. The device shall
operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two (2) check valves
at a level less than the pressure on the City water supply side of the device.
At cessation of normal flow the pressure between the check valves shall be less
than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the
differential relief valve shall operate to maintain this reduced pressure by
discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two (2) pounds per
square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere. To be
approved, these devices must be readily accessible for in-line maintenance and
testing and be installed in a location where no part of the device will be
submerged.
WATER, NONPOTABLE: Water which is not safe for human consumption or which is of
questionable potability.
WATER, POTABLE: Any water which, according to recognized standards, is safe for
human consumption.
WATER, SERVICE CONNECTIONS: The terminal end of a service connection from the
City's potable water system; i.e., where the City loses jurisdiction and
sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's
water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection,
then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the meter. There
should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or
backflow prevention device located at the point of delivery to the customer's
water system. Service connection shall also include water service connection
from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water service
connections from the public potable water system.
WATER, USED: Any water supplied by the City from the potable water system to a
consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and
is no longer under the sanitary control of the City.
7-7A-11-3: REQUIREMENTS, WATER SYSTEM:
   A.   The water system shall be considered as made up of two (2) parts: The
City system and the customer system.
   B.   The City system shall consist of the source facilities and the
distribution system, and shall include all those facilities of the water system
under the complete control of the City up to the point where the customer's
system begins.
   C.   The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in
the production, treatment, storage and delivery of water to the distribution
system.
   D.   The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for
the delivery of water from the source to the customer's system.
   E.   The customer's system shall include those parts of the facilities
beyond the termination of the City distribution system which are utilized in
conveying City delivered domestic water to the point of use.
7-7A-11-4: INSTALLATION OF WATER SERVICE CONNECTION, MAINTENANCE:
No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained
unless the water supply is protected as required by State laws and regulations
and this Chapter. Service water to any premises shall be discontinued if a
prevention device required by this Chapter is not installed, tested and
maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention device has been
removed, by-passed, or if an unprotected cross-connection exists on the
premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are
corrected.
7-7A-11-5: INSPECTION OF CUSTOMER'S SYSTEM:
The customer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to
authorized representatives of the Public Works Water Division to determine
whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including
violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known,
the Director shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by
providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has
corrected the condition(s) in conformance with State and City statutes relating
to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
7-7A-11-6: BACKFLOW DEVICES:
An approved backflow prevention device shall also be installed on each service
line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately
inside the building being served; but in all cases, before the first branch
line leading off the service line whenever the following conditions exist:
   A.   In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not
or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not
acceptable as an additional source by the Director, the City water system shall
be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow
prevention device in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard.
   B.   In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other
objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or
potential hazard to the City water system, the City system shall be protected
against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device
in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the
handling of process waters and waters originating from the City system which
have been subject to deterioration in quality.
   C.   In the case of premises having (1) internal cross- connections that
cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or (2) intricate plumbing and
piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not
readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or
impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross- connections exist, the
City water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by
installing a backflow prevention device in the service line.
7-7A-11-7: PROTECTIVE DEVICES, DEGREE OF HAZARD:
The type of protective device required under subsections
7-7A-11-6A, B and C shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as
follows:
   A.   In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as
stated in subsection
7-7A-11-6A of this Section
7-7A-11 and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the City water
system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation and an approved
reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device.
   B.   In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that
would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the City
water system, the City water system shall be protected by an approved double
check valve assembly.
   C.   In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to
health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential
hazard to the City water system, the City water system shall be protected by an
approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention device. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist
include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical
manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants.
   D.   In the case of any premises where there are "uncontrolled" cross-
connections, either actual or potential, the City water system shall be
protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention device at the service connection.
   E.   In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or
other prohibitions or restrictions it is impossible or impractical to make a
complete in-plant cross- connection survey, the City water system shall be
protected against backflow or back-siphonage from the premises by the
installation of a backflow prevention device in the service line. In this case,
maximum protection will be required; that is, an approved air-gap separation or
an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be
installed in each service to the premises.
7-7A-11-8: APPROVAL OF DIRECTOR:
Any backflow prevention device required herein shall be of model and size
approved by the Director. The term "approved backflow prevention device" shall
mean a device that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards

Backflow preventers which may be subjected to back pressure or back-siphonage
that have been fully tested and have been granted a certificate of approval by
said qualified laboratory and are listed on the laboratory's current list of
"Approved Devices" may be used without further test or qualifications.
7-7A-11-9: INSPECTION AND TESTS:
It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where backflow
prevention devices are installed to have certified inspections and operational
tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the Director deems
the hazard to be great enough, he may require certified inspections at more
frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the
water user and shall be performed by the device manufacturer's representative,
by Public Works Water Division personnel or by a certified tester approved by
the Director. It shall be the duty of the Director to see that these timely
tests are made. The customer-user shall notify the Director in advance when the
tests are to be undertaken so that he or his representative may witness the
tests if so desired. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at
the expense of the customer-user whenever said devices are found to be
defective. Records of such tests, repairs and overhauls shall be kept and made
available to the Director.
7-7A-11-10: PRESENTLY INSTALLED DEVICES:
All presently installed backflow devices which do not meet the requirements of
this Section
7-7A-11 but were approved devices for the purpose described herein at the time
of installation and which have been properly maintained shall, except for the
inspection and maintenance requirements under Section
7-7A-11-9, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the
Director is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the City system.
Whenever the existing device is moved from the present location or requires
more than minimum maintenance or when the Director finds that the maintenance
constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by a backflow
prevention device meeting the requirements of this Section
7-7A-11. (Ord. 8801, 1-19-88)

7-7B-6: PAYMENT OF CHARGES; DELINQUENCIES:
   A.   Payment Of Sewer Charges: All sewer charges shall be collected together
with and not separately from the charges for any other utility service rendered
by the City, and all charges shall be billed upon the same bill and collected
as one item. All utility service charges shall be payable upon presentation
date at the Office of the City Water Collector in the City Hall and shall be
delinquent on the first day of the calendar month following the date of
presentment.
   B.   Disputed Bills: Should the amount of any bill for service be
questioned, the customer should promptly request an explanation. If the
explanation is not satisfactory or is not understood, the customer must pay the
bill under protest to avoid discontinuance of service. Protests will be
addressed to the Director of Finance, must be in writing, and must state the
reasons why the charges are believed to be incorrect. The Director of Finance
will analyze the facts of the case and is authorized to make such adjustments
in the charges as may be necessary to effect an equitable settlement. Failure
of a customer to pay under protest after initial explanation is offered will
result in discontinuance of service without further notice if bill is not paid
by the delinquency date.
   C.   Delinquency Penalties And Charges: In the event a utility bill is not
paid on or before the tenth day after the bill becomes delinquent, on the
eleventh day, the following fees, in addition to the amount of the utility
bill, shall be charged:
      1.   For the first such delinquency in a twelve (12) month period, five
dollars ($5.00);
      2.   For the second such delinquency in a twelve (12) month period,
fifteen dollars ($15.00); and
      3.   For the third such delinquency in a twelve (12) month period, twenty
five dollars ($25.00), plus a deposit as required by subsection
7-7B-3B of this article.
      4.   A fee of twenty five dollars ($25.00) shall be charged on all
returned checks in payment of utility charges.
   D.   Delinquencies: Accounts shall be subject to collection of any
delinquent fees and charges in the following manner:
      1.   At the time the fees become delinquent and until such time they are
fully paid, the delinquent account balance, including late charges, shall
constitute an unrecorded lien against the property and, as such, may be
identified during a title search. For commercial businesses, delinquent account
balances, including late charges, may be considered an unrecorded lien against
the business name and/or owner of the business.
      2.   Once a year there may be prepared a report of delinquent fees
including late charges. The City Council shall fix a time, date and place for
hearing the report and receive any objections or protests thereto.

landowners listed on the report not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the
date of the hearing.
      4.   At the hearing, the City Council shall hear any objections or
protests of landowners liable to be assessed for delinquent fees including late
charges and administrative fees, as set by resolution of the City Council. The
City Council may make revisions or corrections to the report as it deems just,
after which, by resolution, the report shall be confirmed.
      5.   The delinquent fees set forth in the report as confirmed shall
constitute special assessments against the respective parcels of land and are a
lien on the property for the amount of such delinquent fees, including late
charges. A certified copy of the resolution confirming the assessments shall be
filed with the County Recorder and the County Auditor-Controller/Tax Collector
for the amounts of the respective assessments against the respective parcels as
they appear on the current assessment roll. The lien created attaches upon
filing. The assessments shall be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as other Property Taxes and shall be subject to the same penalties and
the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for such taxes.
All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of Property Taxes
shall be applicable to such assessments. However, if, for the first year for
which the charges are prescribed, the property served by the City has been
transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, and attached
thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of County taxes would
become delinquent, the charge will not result in a lien against the real
property, but shall become transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.
   E.   Debt Due To The City: Such delinquent accounts, unpaid deposits and
penalties thereon shall constitute a debt due to the City for which the City
may bring suit in any competent Civil Court against the person or persons who
occupied or, in the case of unoccupied property, who owned the property when
the service was rendered or the deposit became due or against any person
guaranteeing payment of bills, or against any or all of said persons, for the
collection of the amount of the deposit or the collection of delinquent charges
or accounts and all penalties thereon. (Ord. 2018-07, 9-18-2018)
7-7B-7: DISPOSITION OF FUNDS:

and all bonds issued and outstanding or which may be issued for sanitary and
sewage facilities and to retire such bonds when they mature, and for the
payment of cost and expenses of acquisition, construction, operation,
maintenance and repair of the City sewage system and the sewer pumping,
treatment and disposal works and extensions and improvements thereto.
Any payment received for City utility charges in an amount less than the total
charge billed shall be treated as a partial payment for each such charge and
the amount received allocated to the separate departments in the same ratio as
each such charge bears to the whole of the bill. (Ord. 8109, 8-18-1981)
7-7B-8: VACANT PREMISES:
Whenever any single-family dwelling is vacant or unused for a period of thirty
(30) days or more, the person to whom the sewer rental is charged may secure a
rebate of his sewer service charges for said period of thirty (30) days or more

      2.   Listed in
Table C2 are certain pollutants which, when discharged to the POTW, must be
reported to the City as a condition of compliance with the users discharge
permit. Maximum concentration limits for these pollutants have not been
determined for general application. The Manager will determine and implement
such limits as he may find necessary to insure compliance with the City's
discharge permit issued by the Regional Water Quality Control Board or to
insure that the discharge from the POTW complies with the City-Westlake Farms
contract for final disposal or to meet more stringent requirements issued by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency regarding new source
discharges.

Limitations and prohibitions on wastewater strength contained in this Article,
including those of the preceding Tables C1 and C2, may be supplemented with
more stringent limitations and prohibitions pursuant to subsection
7-7D-8E and the provisions of subsection
7-7D-8E shall, in such cases, be controlling. The City may provide the more
stringent limitations and prohibitions as follows:
         a.   If the City determines that the limitations and prohibitions in
this Article may not be sufficient to protect the operation of the district's
treatment works; or
         b.   If the City determines that the limitations and prohibitions in
this Article may not be sufficient to enable the City's treatment works to
comply with water quality standards or effluent limitations specified in the
City's California Regional Water Quality Control Board waste discharge
requirements, or to meet the requirements of the City-Westlake Farms agreement
for the final disposal of the discharge from the POTW.
      3.   Federal Limitations: Any user who does not comply with the Federal
pretreatment standards as required by section 307 (b) and (c) of the Act and
any applicable regulations thereunder, including those called for by 403 CFR
403.0, violates this Article. The more stringent of the standards will apply
whenever local, State and Federal standards overlap. Violation and prosecution
under this Article does not preclude violation and prosecution by other
affected Federal, State or local agencies in accordance with applicable law.
   D.   Limitations on Point of Discharge: No person shall discharge any
substances directly into a manhole or other opening in a community sewer other
than through an approved building sewer unless, upon written application by the
user and payment of the applicable user charges and fees, the City issues a
permit for such direct discharges.
   E.   Excessive Discharge Rate: No person shall discharge or cause or allow
to be discharged or deposited into the wastewater system any wastewater flowing
at an excessive rate of flow defined as:
      1.   Hydraulic: That average rate of flow during any fifteen (15)
consecutive minutes which shall be greater than five (5) times the average
daily rate of flow, or a monthly flow volume greater than that specified by
connection permit shall be considered excessive.
      2.   Loadings: Those concentrations of pollutants such as toxics, grease
and oil, and other constituents, which in a grab sample are greater by a factor
of five (5) than the average twenty four (24) hour concentration allowed in the
industrial waste permit or a mass emission greater than that specified by
connection permit shall be considered excessive.
      3.   BOD5 and Suspended Solids: Those concentrations of biochemical
oxygen demand and suspended solids which, in a composite sample taken at
intervals of fifteen (15) minutes over a period of four (4) hours, are greater
by a factor of five (5) than the average twenty four (24) hour concentration
allowed in the industrial waste permit or a mass emission greater than that
specified by connection permit shall be considered excessive.
   F.   Holding Tank Waste: A user proposing to discharge holding tank waste
into a community sewer must secure a permit. Unless allowed by the City under
the terms and conditions of the permit, a separate permit must be secured for
each separate discharge. This permit will state the specific location of
discharge, the time of day the discharge is to occur, the volume of the
discharge, and the wastewater constituents and characteristics. If a permit is
granted for discharge of such waste into a community sewer, the user shall pay
the applicable user charges and fees and shall meet such other conditions as
required by the City.
   G.   Infectious Wastes:
      1.   Infectious wastes from hospitals, clinics and mortuaries may be
disposed of to the sanitary sewer system subject to the following limitations
and requirements:
         a.   The material shall be ground by an approved grinder so that the
material shall pass a three-eighths inch (3/8") screen opening.
         b.   The materials must not violate any other requirements of these
rules and regulations or applicable State and/or Federal statutes, laws, and
rules and regulations.
         c.   All paper and plastic items must be excluded before grinding
organic kitchen wastes from hospital food preparations prior to discharge into
the sanitary sewer system.
      2.   The following shall not be discharged to the sanitary sewer system
by any means:
         a.   Hypodermic needles, syringes and associated articles following
their use in hospitals, out-patient clinics, medical and dental offices, etc.
         b.   Portions of the human anatomy, pathologic specimens.
         c.   Wastes excluded by other provisions of this Article except as
specifically permitted in this Section.
      3.   All hospitals within the limits of the City desiring to dispose of a
ground "infectious waste" by discharge into facilities of the City shall first
have a valid discharge permit. All applicants for such permits shall fill out
completely the application form, pay the appropriate fee, receive a copy of the
City's regulations governing discharge of ground hospital wastes, and shall
agree in writing to abide by the regulations. The discharge permit shall be
valid for one year from date of issuance.
      4.   Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the Health Officer of the County to define wastes as being infectious.
   H.   Special Agreements: Nothing in this Section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any user
of the wastewater treatment system whereby wastewater of unusual strength or
character is accepted into the system and specially treated, subject to any
payments or user charges as may be applicable. Any such special agreement must
be approved by the City Council.
   I.   Nonindustrial Users: Hospitals, clinics, schools, commercial
facilities, public agency facilities and any other class of discharger may be
classified as industrial facilities for purposes of applying this Article. The
applicability may be extended to residential users at the sole discretion of
the City in special instances.
7-7D-6: CONTROL OF PROHIBITED WASTES:
   A.   Regulatory Actions: Unless otherwise provided in a special agreement as
described in subsection
7-7D-5H or the discharge permit as described in subsection
7-7D-8A, if wastewaters containing any substance described in Section
7-7D-5 are discharged or proposed to be discharged into the sewer system of the
City or to any sewer system tributary thereto, the Manager and the City
Attorney may take any action necessary to:
      1.   Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater.
      2.   Require a user to demonstrate that in-plant modifications will
reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity with this
Article.
      3.   Require pretreatment, including storage facilities, or flow
equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable characteristics
or substances so that the discharge will not violate these rules and
regulations.
      4.   Require the person proposing, making, causing or allowing the
discharge to pay any additional cost or expense incurred by the City for
handling and treating excess loads imposed on the treatment system.
      5.   Take such other remedial action as may be deemed to be desirable or
necessary to achieve the purpose of this Article.
   B.   Submission of Plans: Where pretreatment or equalization of wastewater
flows prior to discharge into any part of the wastewater treatment system is
required, detailed plans, specifications and other pertinent data or
information relating to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall
first be submitted to the City for review and approval in writing. Such written
approval shall not exempt the discharge of such facilities from compliance with
any applicable code, ordinance, rule, regulation or order of any governmental
authority. Any subsequent alterations or additions to such pretreatment or
flow- control facilities shall not be made without due notice to and prior
approval of the City.
   C.   Pretreatment: Users shall make wastewater acceptable under the
limitations established herein before discharging to the community sewer. Any
facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City
shall be designed, purchased, installed, maintained in good working order, and
operated so as to ensure continuous compliance with applicable requirements by
the user at user's own cost and expense. Intermittent operation of pretreatment
facilities during discharge to the POTW is prohibited without written
permission from the Manager.
      1.   Interceptors: Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided
when, in the opinion of the Manager, they are necessary for the proper handling
of the liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable
wastes, sand and other harmful ingredients. All interceptors shall be of a
capacity sufficient to provide the appropriate quality of effluent, and shall
be in an easily accessible location for purposes of cleaning and inspection.
      2.   Commercial Garbage Grinders: No owner of a commercial garbage
grinder shall maintain or operate or permit to be maintained or operated any
such grinder which may discharge any waters, wastes or other substances into
the City sewer without first providing, at such person's expense, such
preliminary treatment as may be necessary to reduce the suspended solids, daily
flow or objectionable characteristics or constituents to within the maximum
limits contained in Section
7-7D-5.
      3.   Water Softening Units: In order to minimize salts discharged into
the system, water softening units must be well operated and maintained in
strict accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
   D.   Admission to Property: Whenever it shall be necessary for the purposes
of enforcing this Article, the Manager, upon the presentation of credentials,
may enter upon any property or premises at reasonable times for the purpose of:
      Copying or inspecting any records required to be kept under the
provisions of this Article; or
      Inspecting any monitoring equipment or pretreatment facility or discharge
producing process; or
      Sampling any discharge of wastewater to the treatment works.
      1.   Emergency Admission to Property: The Manager may enter upon the
property at any hour under emergency circumstances. In the event of such
emergency entry, the Manager shall make every effort to immediately notify the
user's designated agent. The granting of consent to admission of the Manager to
the user's property is a condition of use of the City's wastewater system.
   E.   Protection from Discharges Above Permitted Levels:
      1.   Accidental Discharges: Each industrial user shall provide protection
from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by
this Article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the industrial user's own cost
and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the City for review, and shall be
approved in writing by the Manager before construction of the facility. Review
and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the
industrial user from the responsibility to modify his facility as necessary to
meet the requirements of this Article.
      2.   Reporting of Accidental Discharge: If, for any reason, a user does
not comply with or will be unable to comply with any prohibition or limitation
in this Article, the user responsible for such noncompliance shall immediately
notify the City so that corrective action may be taken to protect the treatment
system. In addition, a written report addressed to the City detailing the
characteristics of the discharge and corrective action taken to prevent future
violative discharges, shall be filed by the responsible industrial user within
five (5) days of the occurrence of the noncomplying discharge.
Such notification will not relieve users of liability for any expense, loss or
damage to the sewer system, treatment plant or treatment process, or for any
fines imposed on the City on account thereof under section 13350 of the
California Water Code.
      3.   Penalty for Discharges Above Permitted Levels: All costs incurred by
the City due to discharges by a user beyond the limits stated in its discharge
permit, either in quantity or in constituent make up, whether accidental or
deliberate, shall be reimbursed by the user to the City within fifteen (15)
days after presentation of an invoice setting forth the City's costs. Costs
included in such invoice may include, but shall not be limited to, wages,
benefits, consultants' fees, attorneys' fees, testing, materials, equipment and
incidentals required to successfully treat the excess discharge, as well as any
fines or penalties levied or assessed on the City as a result of such
discharges.
   F.   Preventive Measures: Any direct or indirect connection or entry point
for nonconforming or otherwise deleterious wastes to the user's plumbing or
drainage system shall be eliminated. Where such action is impractical or
unreasonable, the user shall appropriately label such entry points to warn
against discharge of such waste in violation of this Article.
7-7D-7: INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER MONITORING AND REPORTING:
   A.   Discharge Reports:
      1.   Every significant industrial user shall file a periodic discharge
report on forms provided by the City at such intervals as are designated by the
Manager. The Manager may require any other users discharging or proposing to
discharge into the treatment system to file such periodic reports.
      2.   The discharge report shall include, but, at the discretion of the
Manager, shall not be limited to, nature of process, volume, rates of flow,
mass emission rate, production quantities, hours of discharge operation,
concentrations of controlled pollutants or other information which relates to
the generation of waste. Such reports may also include the chemical
constituents and quantity of liquid materials stored on site even though such
materials are not normally discharged. In addition to discharge reports, the
Manager may require information in the form of industrial discharge permit
applications, self-monitoring reports and other reporting requirements as
stipulated in 40 CFR 403.12.
   B.   Records and Monitoring:
      1.   All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge
wastewaters to the wastewater treatment system shall maintain such records of
production and related factors, effluent flows and pollutant amounts or
concentrations as in the opinions of the Manager may be required to demonstrate
compliance with the requirements of this Article and any applicable State or
Federal pretreatment standards or requirements.
      2.   Such records shall be made available for inspection and copying upon
request by the Manager. All such records relating to compliance with
pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the United
States Environmental Protection Agency upon demand. A summary of such data
indicating the industrial user's compliance with this Article shall be prepared
according to subsection
7-7D-8E and submitted to the City.
      3.   The owner or operator of any premises or facility discharging
industrial wastes into the system shall install and maintain in proper working
order, at his own cost and expense, suitable monitoring equipment on each
connection discharging industrial wastes to facilitate the accurate
observation, sampling and measurement of such wastes.
      4.   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the City may allow such
facility to be constructed in the public street, provided there would be no
significant interference with other public uses of the area.
      5.   When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the
Manager may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each
user. When there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the Manager
may require that separate monitoring facilities by installed for each separate
discharge.
      6.   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the City requirements and
all applicable construction standards and specifications.
      7.   If the monitoring facility is inside the user's fence, there shall
be accommodations to allow access for City personnel, such as a gate secured
with a City lock. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole to
allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for analysis. The manhole,
sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   C.   Confidential Information: Wastewater quantity and characteristics will
not be recognized as confidential information. However, information accepted by
the City as confidential in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 2
entitled, "Confidentiality of Business Information", shall not be transmitted
to any governmental agency or to the general public by the City until and
unless prior and adequate notification is given to the user; provided, however,
that such portions of the information shall be available for use by the State
or any regulatory agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the user concerned.
   D.   Inspection, Sampling and Analysis; General: The City may inspect the
facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this Article is
being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of
premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the City or its
representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purpose of inspection or sampling or in the performance of any
of their duties. The City shall have the right to set up on the user's property
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling or metering operations and
every effort will be made so that such devices and operations do not interfere
with the normal business operations of the discharger. Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with their security personnel so that, upon presentation of
suitable identification, representatives of the City will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
      1.   Compliance Determination: Compliance determinations with respect to
Section
7-7D-5 prohibitions and limitations may be made on the basis of either
instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater. Composite
samples may be taken over a twenty four (24) hour period, or over a longer or
shorter time span, as determined necessary by the Manager to meet the needs of
specific circumstances.
      2.   Analysis of Industrial Wastewaters: Laboratory analysis of
industrial wastewater samples shall be performed in accordance with the current
edition of "Standard Methods", "Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and
Waste" published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or the
"Annual Book of Standards, Part 23, Water, Atmospheric Analysis" published by
the American Society for Testing and Materials. Analysis of those pollutants
not covered by these publications shall be performed in accordance with
procedures established by the State Department of Health.
      3.   Sampling Frequency: Sampling of industrial wastewater for the
purpose of compliance determination with respect to Section
7-7D-5 prohibitions and limitations will be done at random intervals as the
Manager may determine necessary to the program goals.

7-7E-2: WATER EFFICIENT LANDSCAPE ORDINANCE ADOPTED:
This section should be known as "an ordinance of the City of Lemoore adopting
the California model water efficient landscape ordinance, California Code of
Regulations, title 23, division 2, chapter 2.7" and any amendments thereto by
reference. (Ord. 2015-06, 7-7-2015)
7-7E-3: FINDINGS OF NECESSITY:
It is necessary to minimize the potential for water shortage through the
practice of water conservation pursuant to the provisions of California Water
Code section 375 et seq. It is further necessary to reduce the potential effect
of a water shortage on the residents, businesses and visitors of Lemoore and to
adopt provisions that will significantly reduce the inefficient consumption of
water, thereby extending the available water resources necessary for the
domestic, sanitation, and fire protection of the community to the greatest
extent possible. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the City from also
declaring a water emergency pursuant to California Water Code section 350, if
circumstances warrant such a declaration. (Ord. 2015-06, 7-7-2015)
7-7E-4: WATER CUSTOMER:
"Water customer", for the purposes of this chapter, shall mean any person,
partnership, business, corporation, special district, public agency, or
association or legal entity to which the City of Lemoore (City) supplies water
or "user" of water supplied by the City. (Ord. 2015-06, 7-7-2015)
7-7E-5: APPLICATION:
This article shall be applicable to all water customers. (Ord. 2015-06, 7-7-
2015)
7-7E-6: EXCEPTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS:
   A.   Exceptions: The City Manager or his or her designee shall grant an
exception from the requirements of this chapter for any of the following
reasons:
      1.   Water use is necessary to public health and safety or for essential
government services; or
      2.   Recycled water is being used; or
      3.   Water use is necessary due to the medical needs of the water
customer; or
      4.   An alternative water source/supply is available for use.
   B.   Exemptions: The City Council may grant an exemption to the requirements
of this chapter, with or without conditions, if it determines that a water
customer would otherwise experience extreme financial hardship that cannot be
mitigated. The City Council shall review any requests for an exemption from
compliance with this chapter. A written request for an exemption must be
submitted to the City Clerk a minimum of two (2) weeks prior to the regularly
scheduled Council meeting at which the exemption is to be considered. If
appropriate, the City Council may require the customer granted an exemption to
reduce water use by other appropriate alternative methods. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Code, there shall be no right to further administrative
review or appeal of the determination of exemption of the City Council. The
City Council may establish an "exemption processing fee" by resolution. (Ord.
2015-06, 7-7-2015)
7-7E-7: AUTHORIZATION:

made by the City Manager, or based upon any reduction in water supply or
delivery that the City Council determines in its sole discretion necessitates
water conservation pursuant to this chapter. The City Council may determine and
order water prohibitions and restrictions as outlined herein in the following
levels:
   Voluntary compliance
   Level I conservation measures
   Level II conservation measures
   Level III conservation measures
(Ord. 2015-06, 7-7-2015)
7-7E-8: VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE:
At this level of the conservation plan, the goal is to inform the public of the
pressing need to conserve water. This can be done through information and
education measures, which can directly affect water use habits of the city's
customer base. While education alone may not produce sustained water savings
like other measures, it can enhance the effectiveness of other measures. Water
bill inserts, pamphlets upon request, partnering with local schools to
encourage water conservation practices, creating workshops for local plumbers,
plumbing fixture suppliers, and builders or landscape and irrigation service
providers are all examples of education and information measures the city can
implement.
The goal of this measure is to have residents and businesses voluntarily comply
with best practice water conservation measures, with the goal of reducing
average water consumption by twenty percent (20%). Water tanks and wells will
be monitored by the water department.
Additionally, landscape watering for municipal parks will be reduced from six
(6) to four (4) days or less per week. (Ord. 2015-06, 7-7-2015)
7-7E-9: LEVEL I CONSERVATION MEASURES:
When pumping water levels drop twenty percent (20%) below the baseline
measurement, the following restrictions shall apply in addition to or supersede
the standard water conservation measures listed in section

watering would only be authorized before ten o'clock (10:00) A.M. and after
seven o'clock (7:00) P.M. on designated days.
   B.   Hotels, restaurants, and bars shall only provide drinking water to
customers upon request.
   C.   No water customer shall permit water to leak on his or her premises.
Such leak shall be repaired in a timely manner after written notification by
the city, but in no case in excess of seventy two (72) hours after
notification.
   D.   Reduce landscape watering for municipal parks to two (2) days or less
per week. (Ord. 2015-06, 7-7-2015)
7-7E-10: LEVEL II CONSERVATION MEASURES:
The following restrictions shall be applicable during a high water conservation
alert as declared by the city council and whenever a recommendation has been
made by the city manager in conjunction with the chief plant operator of the
water treatment plant based upon a significant reduction or interruption in
water supply or delivery that necessitates increased water conservation
efforts:
   A.   All prohibitions and restrictions in level I (section
7-7E-9 of this article) shall be in effect.
   B.   Reduce the number of days for landscape watering to one day per week,
depending upon the type of irrigation and the address. The city would be
divided into three (3) sections: one section would be all of the area on the
east side of Lemoore Avenue, another section would be the area north of
Cinnamon Drive from 191/2 Avenue to Lemoore Avenue and the third section would
be the area south of Cinnamon Drive to the west city limits. Watering between
the hours of ten o'clock (10:00) A.M. and seven o'clock (7:00) P.M. is still
prohibited.
   C.   The washing of personal vehicles is restricted to once per week, only
on permitted watering days, and only with the use of the required quick acting
positive shutoff nozzle.
   D.   Hotels are encouraged to implement laundry conservation measures by
encouraging patrons to reuse linens and towels.
   E.   Landscape watering for municipal parks is restricted to one day per
week and restrictions shall be implemented on golf course watering. (Ord. 2015-
06, 7-7-2015)
7-7E-11: LEVEL III CONSERVATION MEASURES:
In the event of a major earthquake, large scale fire, or other so called "act
of nature" which has or could have serious impacts on the city's total
available water storage or delivery capacity, whether storage capacities have
been reduced or not, or in the case of an unanticipated significant reduction
in city water supply, a severe water conservation alert shall be declared by
the city council.
   A.   All previous restrictions noted above in level I and level II shall be
in effect.
   B.   Irrigation of landscapes is prohibited between the hours of eight
o'clock (8:00) A.M. and eight o'clock (8:00) P.M.
   C.   Landscape watering for municipal parks shall be limited to one day per
week.
   D.   Swimming pool refilling or new construction swimming pool filling is
not authorized.
   E.   The city shall discontinue washing city vehicles or equipment except

be unreasonably withheld, provided the proposed assignee or transferee has
established the information specified in subsection C of this Section. Such
consent shall not be required for: 1) assignments or transfers between or among
wholly-owned subsidiaries of the grantee or affiliates of the grantee which are
controlled or wholly owned by the same parent, or 2) assignments in trust,

within a reasonable period of time, in accordance with applicable law. For any
sublease, assignment, lease, sale or other transfer described in this

relation to its power of eminent domain over the grantee's franchise and
property.
   B.   Except as otherwise provided in the franchise agreement, neither the
granting of any franchise nor any provisions thereof or of this Chapter shall
constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power
by the Grantor.
   C.   No right or power in, or duty retained by or imposed upon, the Grantor,
or any commission, officer, employee, department or board of the Grantor, shall

grantee.
   D.   The Grantor shall have the right to inspect all construction or
installation or other physical work performed by the grantee in connection with
the franchise and to make such tests as the Grantor shall find necessary to
ensure compliance with the terms of the franchise and other pertinent
provisions of law, so long as the inspection and testing does not unreasonably
interfere with the grantee's operations.
   E.   Consistent with applicable law, at the expiration of the term or any
renewal term or extension for which the franchise is granted, or upon its
lawful revocation, expiration, or termination, the Grantor shall have the right
to require the grantee to remove, at the grantee's expense, all portions of the
system and any other property used or useful in the system from all streets,
public property and other public areas and ways within the franchise area
within a reasonable period of time not to exceed three hundred sixty (360) days
after the effective date of the revocation, expiration or termination, unless
the Council grants a longer period. In the event of such removal, the grantee

property and other public areas and ways from which any portion of the system
or such other property has been removed to a condition satisfactory to the

authority, and any such grantee records kept at another place shall, upon
reasonable notice, be made available at the grantee's premises within Kings
County for the Grantor's inspection or copying, so long as the inspection does
not unreasonably interfere with the grantee's operations, and provided further
that the Grantor may copy the grantee's confidential trade secrets or
proprietary information only when it is essential, in the Grantor's sole
discretion, to its regulatory function. The Grantor shall pay all reasonable
costs for copying any relevant information needed. The Grantor shall maintain
as confidential and shall not disclose any such information which the grantee
has identified in writing as proprietary, to the extent permitted by law.
   H.   The Grantor shall have the right to amend any or all portions of this
Chapter: 1) as necessary or appropriate to preserve public health or safety, or
2) for any other reason so long as such amendment does not increase the
material burden nor diminish the rights of the grantee. (Ord. 9501, 5-2-1995)

adopted by the Council pursuant to subsection
7-8-4B.
   A.   The Grantor may grant a franchise to any person who offers to provide a
cable system under and pursuant to this Chapter.
   B.   Consistent with applicable law, no provision of this Chapter shall
require the granting of a franchise when, in the sole opinion of the Grantor,
it is in the public interest not to do so.
   C.   The purpose of a franchise and franchise agreement shall be to identify
and authorize its specific grantee and to identify and specify those terms,
conditions, definitions, itemizations, specifications and other particulars of
the agreement between the Grantor and the grantee which it represents. In so
doing, a franchise or franchise agreement may clarify, extend and interpret the
provisions of this Chapter. Where a franchise or franchise agreement and this
Chapter conflict, both shall be liberally interpreted to achieve a common
meaning or requirement. In the event this is not possible within reasonable
limits, the terms of this Chapter shall prevail.
   D.   The award of a franchise authorizing the use of streets, public
property or public areas or ways for private purposes shall be deemed
consideration by the grantee in the form of agreement to provide the system and
cable service offered in accordance with the provisions hereof and of the
franchise agreement.
   E.   Neither this Chapter nor a franchise granted under it shall relieve a
grantee of any requirement of the Grantor or of any ordinance, rule, regulation
or specifications of the Grantor now or hereafter in effect, including, but not
limited to, the payment of all normal permit and inspection fees, so long as
the ordinance, rules, regulations or specifications do not materially conflict
with or alter the express terms of this Chapter, the franchise and the
franchise agreement.
   F.   No privilege shall be granted or conferred by a franchise except those
specifically prescribed herein or in the franchise agreement.
   G.   Any person who provides a system or cable service as defined herein
shall be deemed a grantee and shall not do so except in accordance with a
franchise granted hereunder. If such grantee uses distribution channels
furnished by a telephone company or other public utility, the grantee shall
nevertheless be required to comply with all of the provisions of this Chapter.

established in the franchise agreement as permitted by applicable law, and the
grantee shall comply with such standards in the operation of the cable system.

discretion of the grantee, except as may be provided otherwise in the franchise

   D.   At such time as it is allowable by law, the Grantor may by resolution
require the grantee to add a fee, separate and apart from the franchise fee
established in the franchise agreement, to its monthly rates for basic cable
service for the purpose of providing operational support for PEG access
programming. The Grantor may set this fee in an amount consistent with the
City's public access needs and section 76.925 of the FCC Regulations. The
grantee shall be given thirty (30) days' advance written notice prior to the
introduction of the resolution and shall have the right to appear before the
Council on the matter. The grantee may petition the Grantor for reduction or
elimination of this PEG access programming operational support fee if the
grantee establishes that it is suffering a competitive disadvantage or undue
financial burden. (Ord. 9501, 5-2-1995)
7-8-20: FRANCHISE FEE:
   A.   Beginning with the effective date of the franchise, the grantee shall
pay to the Grantor the franchise fee set forth in the franchise agreement, or
in the absence thereof, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law.
   B.   Payments due to the Grantor under this provision shall be computed
quarterly for the preceding calendar quarter, and shall be said within thirty
(30) days of the close of each calendar quarter. The payment shall be
accompanied by a report showing the basis for the computation and such other
relevant facts as may be required by the Grantor to determine the accuracy of
the payment.
   C.   No acceptance of any payment by the Grantor shall be construed as a
release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the Grantor may have for
further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this Chapter or for
the performance of any other obligation of the grantee. All amounts paid shall
be subject to audit and recomputation by the Grantor as subject to conditions
specified in the franchise agreement.
   D.   In the event that any payment or recomputed amount under this Section
is not made on or before the due date, the grantee shall pay as additional
compensation to the Grantor:

of delinquent payment. (Ord. 9501, 5-2-1995)
7-8-21: BOND; LETTER OF CREDIT:
   A.   The grantee shall, at all times during the term of the franchise and
any renewal thereof, maintain in effect and keep on file with the Grantor a
bond running to the Grantor in the amount established in the franchise
agreement with sureties and other terms to be approved by the Grantor. The bond
shall provide that it will not be canceled or materially altered without at
least thirty (30) days' prior notice to the Grantor. The bond shall be
available to the Grantor to satisfy any amount due the Grantor from the grantee
which arises in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Chapter, the
franchise or the franchise agreement. The Grantor shall have the right to
suspend the franchise during any period that the grantee fails to maintain the
bond in full force and effect and to invoke any other remedies, including the
assessment of monetary damages under Section
7-8-38 of this Chapter.
   B.   At the option of the Grantor, the grantee may be required in the
franchise agreement to post an irrevocable letter of credit in lieu of the
bond. Such letter of credit must be issued by a bank or other credit agency and
on such other terms approved by the Grantor, in the amount specified in the
franchise agreement. The letter of credit shall incorporate wording approved by
the Grantor so that the Grantor is able to draw such sums from time to time as
the Grantor may find necessary to satisfy any defaults of the grantee or to
meet any payments due the Grantor under or in connection with this Chapter, the
franchise or the franchise agreement upon ten (10) days' written notice. The
letter of credit shall further provide for sixty (60) days' written notice by
certified mail by its issuer to the Grantor of any pending expiration or
cancellation, or other language acceptable to the Grantor. The notice shall
without further cause constitute a reason for the Grantor to withdraw the full
sum under the letter of credit to be held in the accounts of the Grantor until
such letter of credit is reestablished to the satisfaction of the Grantor. The
grantee shall pay all fees or other charges required to keep such letter of
credit in full force and effect at all times during the term of the franchise
agreement and any renewal thereof. Within thirty (30) days after any withdrawal
by the Grantor under the letter of credit, the grantee shall restore the letter
of credit to its original amount. Except as expressly provided otherwise in
this subsection B, provisions in this Section applicable to a bond shall also
apply to a letter of credit.
   C.   Nothing in this Section or in any bond or letter of credit accepted by
the Grantor hereunder, nor any amounts recovered by the Grantor under such bond
letter of credit, shall excuse faithful and full performance by the grantee of
all obligations under this Chapter, the franchise and the franchise agreement
or impair any other rights or remedies of the Grantor. (Ord. 9501, 5-2-1995)
7-8-22: CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS:

   B.   The grantee shall adhere to all building and zoning requirements
currently or hereafter in effect and shall obtain all required permits. The

property (including streets and public property), in such a manner as to cause
no unreasonable interference with the use of such property by any person. The
grantee shall provide at least forty eight (48) hours' notice to all affected
property owners and the Grantor prior to installing any facilities of the
system upon easements located on private property. The Grantor shall not modify
its construction requirements subsequent to the completion of construction so
as to require reconstruction or retrofit unless the public health and safety so
require.
   C.   Cable and related facilities shall be installed underground at the
grantee's cost where all existing utilities are already underground. Previously
installed aerial cable and related facilities shall be installed underground at
the grantee's pro rata cost in concert with other utilities when all such other
utilities convert their facilities in the same area from aerial to underground.
   D.   Any and all streets, public property and other public areas and ways
disturbed or damaged by the grantee or its contractors during the term of the
franchise shall be restored within the time limits specified by the Grantor, at

the disturbance or damage unless otherwise authorized in writing by the
Grantor.

cable system shall comply with the National Electrical Safety Code to the
extent that such code is consistent with local law affecting the construction,

requirements of the National Electrical Safety Code or any other applicable
Federal, State or local law, regulation or standard.
   G.   Upon order by the Grantor, the grantee shall relocate its facilities at
the grantee's sole expense in order to accommodate the widening, relocation,
change of grade or any other work or improvement of a public street or right of
way. Nothing in a franchise shall prevent the Grantor from constructing,
repairing or altering any public work. If any property of the grantee
interferes with the construction, maintenance or repair of any public
improvement, all such property shall be removed or replaced in such manner as
directed by the Grantor so that the same shall not interfere with the public
work. Such removal or replacement shall be at the sole expense of the grantee.
   H.   In the event it is necessary to temporarily move or remove any property
of the grantee at the Grantor's direction for a public purpose in order
lawfully to move a large object, vehicle, building or other structure, the
grantee shall move, upon reasonable notice and at its sole expense, its
property as may be required by the Grantor to facilitate such movements. No
such movement shall be deemed a taking of the grantee's property. Nothing
herein shall limit the right of the grantee to seek reimbursement from any
person other than Grantor.
   I.   In the event it is necessary temporarily to move or remove any of the
grantee's property in order for any person other than the Grantor lawfully and
for a nonpublic purpose to move a large object, vehicle, building or other
structure over the streets of the Grantor, upon thirty (30) days' prior notice
by the person to the grantee, the grantee shall move at the expense of the
person requesting the temporary removal such of the grantee's facilities as may
be required to facilitate such movement.
   J.   The grantee shall at all times take reasonable precautions, including
without limitation all precautions required by applicable Federal, State or
local laws or regulations, for preventing failures and accidents which are
likely to cause damage or injury to the public, to employees of the Grantor or
the grantee, or to public or private property.
   K.   All lines, equipment, and facilities within the service area shall at
all times be kept and maintained in a safe and suitable condition, in good
order and repair, and in full compliance with all applicable Federal, State and
local laws and regulations. In the event that the grantee's facilities create
an unsafe condition, the grantee shall upon notice correct such unsafe
condition. The Grantor shall be the sole judge of an unsafe condition.
   L.   In all cases other than those specified in subsections G, H, I, J or K
of this Section, the grantee shall be eligible for relocation compensation to
the same extent as the Grantor compensates any utility companies.
   M.   Upon the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee to cause any
construction, repair or other work necessary to comply with the terms of this
Chapter, the franchise agreement or any other requirement of the Grantor, the
Grantor may, but shall not be required to, cause such work to be completed in
whole or in part. The Grantor shall give the grantee reasonable notice of its

8-1C-4: PERMIT PROCESS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING SYSTEMS:
Consistent with Government Code Section 65850.7, the Building Official shall
implement an expedited, streamlined permitting process for electric vehicle
charging stations, and adopt a checklist of all requirements with which
electric vehicle charging stations shall comply with in order to be eligible
for expedited review. The expedited, streamlined permitting process and
checklist may refer to the recommendations contained in the most current
version of the "Plug-In Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Permitting Checklist"
of the "Zero-Emission Vehicles in California: Community Readiness Guidebook" as
published by the Governor's Office of Planning and Research. The City's/
County's adopted checklist shall be published on the City's/County's website.
   A.   Permit Application Processing:
      1.   Prior to submitting an application for processing, the applicant
shall verify that the installation of an electric vehicle charging station will
not have specific, adverse impact to public health and safety and building
occupants. Verification by the applicant includes but is not limited to:
electrical system capacity and loads; electrical system wiring, bonding and
overcurrent protection; building infrastructure affected by charging station
equipment and associated conduits; areas of charging station equipment and
vehicle parking.
      2.   A permit application that satisfies the information requirements in
the City's/County's adopted checklist shall be deemed complete and be promptly
processed. Upon confirmation by the Building Official that the permit
application and supporting documents meets the requirements of the City/County
adopted checklist and is consistent with all applicable laws and health and
safety standards, the Building Official shall, consistent with Government Code
Section 65850.7, approve the application and issue all necessary permits. Such
approval does not authorize an applicant to energize or utilize the electric
vehicle charging station until approval is granted by the City/County. If the
Building Official determines that the permit application is incomplete, he or
she shall issue a written correction notice to the applicant, detailing all
deficiencies in the application and any additional information required to be
eligible for expedited permit issuance.
      3.   Consistent with Government Code Section 65850.7, the Building
Official shall allow for electronic submittal of permit applications covered by
this section and associated supporting documentation. In accepting such permit
applications, the Building Official shall also accept electronic signatures on
all forms, applications, and other documentation in lieu of a wet signature by
any applicant.
   B.   Technical Review:
      1.   It is the intent of this section to encourage the installation of
electric vehicle charging stations by removing obstacles to permitting for
charging stations so long as the action does not supersede the Building
Official's authority to address higher priority life-safety situations. If the
Building Official makes a finding based on substantial evidence that the
electric vehicle charging station could have a specific adverse impact upon the
public health or safety, as defined in this Chapter, the City/County may
require the applicant to apply for a use permit.
      2.   In the technical review of a charging station, consistent with
Government Code Section 65850.7, the Building Official shall not condition the
approval for any electric vehicle charging station permit on the approval of
such a system by an association, as that term is defined by Civil Code Section
4080.
   C.   Electric Vehicle Charging Station Installation Requirements:
      1.   Electric vehicle charging station equipment shall meet the
requirements of the California Electrical Code, the Society of Automotive
Engineers, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, and accredited
testing laboratories such as Underwriters Laboratories, and rules of the Public
Utilities Commission or a Municipal Electric Utility Company regarding safety
and reliability.
      2.   Installation of electric vehicle charging stations and associated
wiring, bonding, disconnecting means and overcurrent protective devices shall
meet the requirements of Article 625 and all applicable provisions of the
California Electrical Code.
      3.   Installation of electric vehicle charging stations shall be
incorporated into the load calculations of all new or existing electrical
services and shall meet the requirements of the California Electrical Code.
Electric vehicle charging equipment shall be considered a continuous load.
      4.   Anchorage of either floor-mounted or wall-mounted electric vehicle
charging stations shall meet the requirements of the California Building or
Residential Code as applicable per occupancy, and the provisions of the
manufacturer's installation instructions. Mounting of charging stations shall
not adversely affect building elements. (Ord. 2023-01, 2-21-2023)

accepted in lieu of the payment of fees.
   B.   Exemptions from Drainage Fees:
      1.   Except in conjunction with a division of land, drainage fees shall
not be payable on account of any improvement or development work which consists
solely of the construction, erection or installation of:
         a.   Fences, pole lines, underground conduits or pipelines or similar
developments which, as determined by the Director, do not materially impair the
permeability of the natural surface of the parcel of land; or
         b.   The replacement or repair of existing concrete curbs, gutters,
sidewalks, driveway approaches, paving or other street improvements within any
street or alley.
      2.   No drainage fee shall be payable on account of any development or
improvement consisting solely of additions to, alterations of or reconstruction
of any residential building or structure unless the covered area by the
cumulation of additions made after the effective date hereof equals or exceeds
an increase of twenty percent (20%) of the covered area as it existed on the
effective date hereof.
      3.   No drainage fee shall be payable on account of any development or
improvement consisting solely of additions to, alterations of or reconstruction
of any existing building or structure, other than residential covered by
paragraph 2 hereinabove, unless the additions or alterations are such that,
under the applicable provisions of the Building Code 1 , the entire building or
structure must be made to conform to the requirements for new buildings or
structures or unless the area covered by the cumulation of additions made
subsequent to the effective date hereof equals or exceeds an increase of twenty
five percent (25%) of the covered area as it existed on the effective date
hereof.
   C.   Deferrals:
      1.   Payment of the drainage fee on a parcel zoned for industrial
development otherwise due under this Chapter may be deferred at the request of
the owner; provided the Director determines that planned drainage facilities
designed to serve the parcel of land are not immediately available and cannot
be made available within a reasonable period of time.
      2.   Any deferment authorized by the provisions of paragraph 1 of this
subsection shall be allowed only if all the owners of the parcel enter into a
written agreement which shall provide that:
         a.   The fee shall be paid to the City at the time an owner is issued
a building permit for any construction or improvement on the property.
         b.   At the time of payment of the deferred fee, the fee shall be
reduced by a credit which shall be an amount equal to the actual cash
expenditures incurred by the owner for the construction of any temporary
drainage facilities required by the Director as part of the initial development
to serve the property until such time as planned drainage facilities become
available; provided, that the temporary drainage facilities are useful in or
will become a part of the permanent Master Plan drainage facilities.
         c.   The agreement creates a valid lien upon such parcel to the extent
of the fee (such lien may be subordinated at the discretion of the Director,
and the form and substance of the agreement, procedures, documents, covenants,
etc., necessary to place the agreement and lien into effect shall all be
determined by the Director, subject to the approval of the City Attorney).
         d.   The owner of such parcel agrees to pay all court costs and
attorney's fees and waives any and all defenses, legal or equitable, if an
action at law or foreclosure suit is brought to enforce payment of the fee or
recovery of the fee through the lien.
   D.   Full Payment of Fee: When the drainage fee applicable to any parcel of
land shall have been fully paid pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter, or
shall have been assessed against it by the levying of an assessment therefor in
a special assessment proceeding, no further drainage fees shall be payable with
respect to such parcel; provided, however, if after such full payment, the use
of such parcel of land shall be changed to a use which, under the then current
fee schedule, requires a higher local drainage fee than the use upon the basis
of which such payment was previously made, then such parcel of land shall be
subject to the payment of an additional fee, which shall be the fee applicable
to such parcel of land in its changed use under the fee schedule in effect at
the time the additional fee is payable, less the total of any fees previously
paid.

8-4-4: SCHEDULE AND COMPUTATION OF DRAINAGE FEES:
   A.   Schedule of Drainage Fees: Concurrently with the adoption of the
Drainage Master Plan, an interim plan or any amendment thereto, the Council
shall fix, by resolution, a schedule of per gross acre fees calculated to raise
the sum of money necessary to pay the estimated costs of the planned drainage
facilities as set forth in the Drainage Master Plan. Such schedule shall be
conditioned and based on the following findings by the Council:
      1.   The planned drainage facilities are in conformity with the City
General Plan, and Drainage Master Plan;
      2.   The development or improvement of property within the Master Plan
area will require the construction or acquisition of the planned drainage
facilities described in the Drainage Master Plan;
      3.   The fees are fairly apportioned within the drainage area either on
the basis of benefits conferred on property proposed for subdivision or on the
need for such facilities created by the proposed subdivision and development of
other property within such area;
      4.   Planned drainage facilities, which facilities are in addition to any
existing drainage facilities serving such local drainage area at the time of
the adoption of the Drainage Master Plan, are necessary to complete the
Drainage Master Plan for the City;
      5.   The fee apportioned to any property proposed for subdivision within
such drainage area does not exceed the pro rata share of the amount of the
total actual or estimated costs of all facilities within such area which would
be assessable on such property if such costs were apportioned uniformly on a
per-acre basis; and
      6.   The drainage facilities planned are in addition to existing
facilities serving the drainage area at the time of the adoption of the
Drainage Master Plan for the area.
   B.   Computation of Drainage Fee; Credits:
      1.   In the computation of the drainage fee payable because of the
division, development or improvement of any parcel of land, a credit for
drainage fees or other charges for drainage previously paid, or drainage
facilities installed with respect to such parcel shall be allowed, but only as
set forth in this Chapter. Credits for actual cash expenditures for the
construction of drainage facilities constructed and still in existence and use
in any street, alley or public easement and not constructed by special
assessment proceedings shall be allowed, subject to the following conditions
and limitations:
         a.   The facilities considered for such credits shall have been
constructed in conformance with the standards of the City in effect when such
facilities were constructed;
         b.   The Director shall certify that such facilities are in conformity
with, or compatible for use in connection with, the planned drainage facilities
installed or to be installed in the drainage area pursuant to the Drainage
Master Plan;
         c.   The credit allowed shall not exceed the depreciated value of such
facilities as determined by the Director by applying estimates of construction
costs prevailing at the time the credit is allowed (i.e., replacement cost new
less depreciation);
         d.   The facilities shall have been constructed and paid for with
respect to the parcel of land for which credit is claimed. If the facilities
were constructed for the benefit of other parcels of land in addition to the
parcel for which credit is claimed, the Council may, in the absence of
agreement of the owners of the respective parcels as to the apportionment of
the cost, estimate the total cost of such facilities at the time of
construction and apportion the total credit allowable for such facilities among
the several parcels by such method as it shall, in its sole discretion, deem
equitable. Proof to the satisfaction of the Council shall be made by the person
claiming credit hereunder of the amount of any actual cash expenditure on the
facilities for which credit is claimed.
      2.   Credits for assessments previously levied for planned drainage
facilities by any statutory special assessment proceedings shall be allowed
subject to the following conditions and limitations:
         a.   Such facilities shall have been constructed in conformance with
the standards of the City in effect when such facilities were constructed.
         b.   The credit allowed shall not exceed the depreciated value of such
facilities as determined by the Director by applying estimates of construction
costs prevailing at the time the credit is allowed (i.e., replacement cost new
less depreciation). If one assessment was levied for drainage facilities and
other improvements in the same proceeding, the Director shall determine from
the engineer's report in the assessment proceedings, if available, otherwise on
cost estimates applied by the Director, the proportion of the assessment
attributable to such facilities and the amount so determined by him shall be
the credit allowed.
         c.   The Director shall certify that such facilities are in conformity
with, or compatible for use in connection with, the planned drainage facilities
installed or to be installed in the drainage area pursuant to the Drainage
Master Plan.
         d.   The facilities shall have been constructed and paid for with
respect to the parcel of land for which credit is claimed. If the facilities
were constructed for the benefit of other parcels of land in addition to the
parcel for which credit is claimed, the Council may, in the absence of
agreement of the owners of the respective parcels as to the apportionment of
the cost, estimate the total cost of such facilities at the time of
construction and apportion the total credit allowable for such facilities among
the several parcels by such method as it shall, in its sole discretion, deem
equitable. Proof to the satisfaction of the Council shall be made by the person
claiming credit hereunder of the amount of any actual cash expenditure on the
facilities for which credit is claimed.
      3.   If a drainage fee was paid on all or a portion of the parcel of land
under the provisions of subsection
8-4-3B2 of this Chapter which is a part of a division of land, and an
additional drainage fee is payable under any provision of this Chapter, a
credit shall be allowed equal to the amount included in the fee paid under the
provisions of this Section for the gross acreage of such parcel or portion.
8-4-5: DISPOSITION OF FUNDS:
Fees collected pursuant to this Chapter shall be deposited in the Planned Local
Drainage Facilities Fund. The Council may appropriate monies from the Fund for
the construction or reimbursement of construction of the planned drainage
facilities or to reimburse the General Fund or other City funds or to pay debt
incurred for the costs of engineering and administrative services incident to
the creation of the Master Plan and the design and construction of planned
drainage facilities.
8-4-6: UNLAWFUL DEVELOPMENT OR IMPROVEMENT:
No person shall construct, erect or install, or cause or permit to be
constructed, erected or installed, any development or make any improvement on
any parcel of land on which the drainage fee required by the provisions of this
Chapter has not been fully paid. Violation of this Section is hereby declared
to be a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as provided in Section
1-4-1 of this Code.
8-4-7: EFFECT ON BUILDING AND DEVELOPMENT PERMITS:
No building permit or other permit for any development shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of this Title unless the drainage fee required by this
Chapter has been fully paid.

to dedicate land or pay a fee in lieu thereof pursuant to sections 65970
through 65981 of the Government Code of the State of California and this
Chapter, the governing board of a school district which operates an elementary
or high school shall make the written findings, supported by clear and

State of California and notify the City Council of its findings. The notice to
the City Council shall contain all of the following:
      1.   The findings required by section 65791 of the Government Code of the
State of California.
      2.   A summary of the evidence upon which the findings are based.
      3.   The reasonable methods of mitigating conditions of overcrowding
which have been considered by the school district and any determination made
concerning them by the district.
      4.   The precise geographic boundaries of the overcrowded attendance area
or areas.
      5.   Sufficient evidence on the interim classroom and related facilities
needed by the school district and the costs of providing the same so that the
City Council can set the fees to be charged to the developer or the applicant
for the building permit.
      6.   A statement that in consideration of the City concurring in the
finding of overcrowding the governing board of the school district covenants
and agrees at its sole cost and expense to defend and hold harmless the City
from all liability, claims, charges, expenses, costs and litigation of
whatsoever kind arising out of this Chapter, its sufficiency, legality, related
findings, fees schedule, implementation, operation, enforcement, collection or
otherwise.

subsection
8-5-4B of this Chapter, from time to time the Council shall determine the fees
payable by a developer by resolution. Thereafter, the Council shall not approve
an ordinance rezoning property to a residential use, nor shall the City Council
or Planning Commission grant a discretionary permit for residential purposes,
nor shall the Planning Commission or City Council approve a tentative
subdivision or parcel map for residential purposes, nor shall the City Building
Inspector issue a building permit for residential purposes within such area
without said decision-making body imposing the fee determined by the Council,
as a condition of approval.
      2.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, the City
Council may find that there are specific overriding fiscal, economic, social or

City and justify issuing such an approval without requiring the payment of fees
or, may require the dedication of land in subdivisions containing more than
fifty (50) parcels.
      3.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, a builder of a
residential development may exercise the option of providing interim facilities

but not limited to, an agreement where temporary-use buildings will be leased
to the school district or temporary-use buildings owned by the school district
will be used.
   B.   Amount of Fee or Land Dedication: The fees payable, or dedication of
land in lieu thereof, by a developer to a school district shall be determined
by resolution of the City Council at or after the time that the Council concurs
in the findings of the school district pursuant to subsection
8-5-4B of this Chapter. No dedication of land may be required in subdivisions
containing fifty (50) parcels or less. (Ord. 8411, eff. 1-3-85)

governing board of any school district within the City exercises its powers
pursuant to Government Code section 53080 and levies a fee, charge, dedication
or other form of requirement against any development project, as defined in
Government Code section 65928, then the provisions of this Chapter, including
any fees imposed pursuant hereto, shall not apply and only the fee, charge,
dedication or other requirement imposed by the governing board of the school
district shall apply.
   B.   If the governing board of any school district within the City levies a
fee, charge, dedication or other form of requirement against any development
project within the City, pursuant to the authority conferred by Government Code
section 53080, no building permit for said development project shall be
authorized or issued by the City except after receipt of written certification
by the appropriate school district of compliance or payment by the said
development project of the fees, charges or dedications levied by the governing
board of the school district.
   C.   Any development project, as herein defined, for which a final map was
approved and construction had commenced on or before September 1, 1986, is
subject only to the fees, charges or dedications imposed pursuant to this
Chapter. (Ord. 8615, 12-2-86)
8-5-7: BUILDING PERMITS; COMPLIANCE WITH PROVISIONS:
When the City Council has determined pursuant to subsection
8-5-5A of this Chapter that the developer shall dedicate real property, pay
fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, a copy of the determination of
the Council shall be sent to the City Building Inspector. The City Building
Inspector shall not issue any building permit for construction of a mobile park
or residence, nor any permit to relocate a residence, nor any permit to move in
a mobilehome pursuant to provisions of this Code, which is subject to said
determination by the Council unless he receives proper verification that the
required dedication of land and/or payment of fees to the school district has
been made. The developer may pay said fees directly to the school district or,
at his option, may pay said fees to the City Building Inspector who shall cause
the fee to be forwarded to the school district as soon as is practicable but in
no event more than forty five (45) days after receipt. It shall be the school
district's responsibility to promptly report in writing to the City Building
Inspector the receipt of fees collected that are imposed pursuant to this
Chapter and receipt of the required dedication of land, if any.
8-5-8: LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF SCHOOL DISTRICT:
   A.   Liability: Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter to the contrary, no
fee or dedication of land may be imposed hereunder unless and until the City

that it shall at its sole cost and expense defend, represent, pay and indemnify
the City from and for any claim, demand and/or litigation in any way arising
out of or relating to this Chapter, its enforcement and operation, the
establishment, the amount of and/or collection of fees established hereunder or
herefor.
   B.   Responsibility: It shall be the responsibility of the school district,
at its sole cost and expense, to appear and testify at any hearing, including
any appeal, relating to the imposition of fees or dedication of land.
8-5-9: EXEMPTIONS FROM PROVISIONS:
This Chapter shall not apply to the following types of projects:
   A.   Senior citizen housing approved, financed and/or subsidized by the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, and residential

recordable written agreement with the affected school district that the
developer will dedicate land or pay fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of
both, when and if such restrictions cease during a period the school district
has overcrowded conditions within the attendance area in which the development
is located.
   B.   Conversion of existing apartment buildings to condominiums or a
community apartment project, except where such apartment buildings were
restricted to "adults only" and said restrictions are removed when conversion

      1.   Application Completeness With Notification: Within 30 days of

determine whether or not the application is complete. The planning director
shall notify the applicant of the determination either that:
         a.   All the submittal requirements have been satisfied and the
application has been accepted as complete; or
         b.   Specific information is still necessary to complete the

areas in which the submitted plans are not in compliance with city standards
and requirements.
      2.   Application Completeness Without Notification: If the written

development permit, the application shall be deemed complete for purposes of
this chapter.
      3.   Resubmittal: Upon receipt and resubmittal of any incomplete

shall determine the completeness of the application. Application completeness
shall be determined and noticed as specified in subsection B1 of this section.
      4.   Incomplete Application: If additional information or submittals are
required and the application is not made complete within six (6) months of the
completeness determination letter, the application shall be deemed by the city

Unexpended fees, as determined by the city, will be returned to the applicant.
If the applicant subsequently wishes to pursue the project, a new application,
including fees, plans, exhibits, and other materials, must then be filed in
compliance with this chapter.
      5.   Right To Appeal: The applicant may appeal the determination in
accordance with subsection E, “Appeals”, of this section.

to or after it is deemed complete, the planning director shall forward copies
of the application to affected agencies within five (5) days asking them to
provide their input or comments within 15 working days.
      2.   Environmental Review: After determination of a complete application,
the project shall be reviewed as required by the California environmental
quality act (CEQA) to determine whether the project is exempt from the

declaration or mitigated negative declaration may be issued, or whether an
environmental impact report (EIR) shall be required.
      3.   Application Review: The planning director, in conjunction with the

review will include any required environmental review as required by CEQA.
Pursuant to section 66452.1 of the subdivision map act, and unless extended by
mutual consent of the subdivider and the city, the designated approving
authority shall make a decision on the tentative map within 50 days of adopting
or certifying the environmental determination for the project.

the time the report is due.
      5.   Report Distribution: Each staff report shall be furnished to the
applicant and property owner at the same time as it is provided to the
designated approving authority prior to consideration of the requested
approval. In the case of a proposed conversion of residential real property to
a condominium project, community apartment project, or stock cooperative
project, pursuant to section 66452.3 of the subdivision map act, the report
shall also be provided to the tenants of the subject property at least three

certificates of compliance, consistent with the requirements of section
66499.35 of the subdivision map act.
   B.   Applicability: A certificate of compliance is a document, recorded by
the county recorder, which acknowledges that a parcel or lot of real property
(hereinafter parcel) is considered by the city to be a legal parcel or lot of
record. Any person owning real property, or a purchaser of the property in a
contract of sale of the property, may request a certificate of compliance from
the city.
   C.   Application: A certificate of compliance application shall be made on a
form provided by the planning department and submitted to the department. The
form shall be accompanied by an application deposit or fee as established by
resolution of the city council. The application shall also include a chain of
title, consisting of copies of deeds beginning before the division of the
property and running through to the time of application for the certificate of
compliance, unless the parcel(s) in question was created through a recorded
subdivision map.
   D.   City Review And Action: The application for certificate of compliance
shall be reviewed and acted upon as provided below.
      1.   Planning Director Review: The planning director, in consultation
with the city engineer, shall review the request and make a determination on
the application as follows:

complies with the subdivision map act and this chapter, the planning director
shall cause a certificate of compliance to the filed for record with the county
recorder. The form of the certificate shall be as described below.
         b.   If the planning director determines that the parcel(s) does not
comply with the provisions of the subdivision map act or this chapter, the
planning director shall issue a conditional certificate of compliance. The city
may, as a condition to granting a conditional certificate of compliance, impose
any conditions that would have been applicable to the division of the property
at the time the applicant acquired their interest in the property and that had
been established at that time by the subdivision map act and this chapter. Upon
making a determination and establishing conditions, the planning director shall
file a conditional certificate of compliance for record with the county
recorder. The certificate shall serve as notice to the property owner who has
applied for the certificate, a grantee of the property owner, or any subsequent
transferee to assignee of the property, that the fulfillment and implementation
of the conditions shall be required prior to subsequent issuance of a permit or
other grant of approval for development of the property. Compliance with the
conditions shall not be required until the time that a permit or other grant of
approval for development of the property is issued by the City.
      2.   Form Of Certificate: The certificate of compliance shall identify
the property, shall state that the division complies with the provisions of the
subdivision map act and this chapter, and shall include all information
required under section 66499.35 of the subdivision map act.
      3.   Effective Date: A certificate of compliance shall not become final
until the document has been recorded by the county recorder.
      4.   Recorded Final Map Or Parcel Map: A recorded final map or parcel map
shall constitute a certificate of compliance with respect to the parcels of
real property described in the final or parcel map. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012;

ARTICLE C. DIVISION OF LAND; REQUIRED MAPS
SECTION:
8-7C-1: Purpose
8-7C-2: Required Maps
8-7C-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this article is to establish the types of maps that are required
for the division of land in the city. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7C-2: REQUIRED MAPS:
   A.   General Requirements: Generally, the division of land creating five (5)
or more parcels requires the preparation and approval of a tentative map
(referred to as a tentative subdivision map) and the subsequent preparation,
approval, and recordation of a final map as described in this chapter. Those
specific types of land division requiring a tentative subdivision map and final
map are described in subsection B of this section.
When the division of land does not require the preparation of a tentative
subdivision map and a subsequent final map pursuant to section 66426 of the
subdivision map act, a parcel map shall instead be required (e.g., the creation
of 4 or fewer parcels). The process for preparation, approval, and recordation
of parcel map shall be as described in this chapter. In certain circumstances,
as provided in subsection C of this section, a tentative parcel map shall be
prepared and approved prior to the parcel map. Additionally, and separate from
the tentative parcel map process and as provided under section 66428(b) of the
subdivision map act, the requirement for a parcel map may be waived by the city
pursuant to the provisions of section
8-7G-12, "Waiver Of Parcel Map", of this chapter.
Lastly, there are, as provided in the subdivision map act, a class of
subdivisions that are exempt entirely from the requirements of a tentative map,
final map, or parcel map. Those classes of subdivisions are described in
subsection D of this section.
   B.   Divisions Of Land Requiring A Tentative Subdivision Map And Final Map
And Exemptions Thereto: As provided in section 66426 of the subdivision map
act, a tentative subdivision map and a final map shall be required for all
divisions of land where the land will be divided into five (5) or more parcels,
five (5) or more condominiums, a community apartment project containing five
(5) or more parcels, or for the conversion of a dwelling to a stock cooperative
containing five (5) or more dwelling units except where:
      1.   The land before division contains less than five (5) acres, each
parcel created by the division abuts upon a maintained public street or highway
and no dedications or improvements are required by the legislative body; or
      2.   Each parcel created by the division has a gross area of twenty (20)
acres or more and has an approved access to a maintained public street or
highway; or
      3.   The land consists of a parcel or parcels of land having approved
access to a public street or highway which comprises part of a tract of land
zoned for industrial or commercial development, and which has the approval of
the governing body as to street alignments and widths; or
      4.   Each parcel created by the division has a gross area of not less
than forty (40) acres or is not less than one-quarter of a one-quarter section;
or
      5.   The land being subdivided is solely for the creation of an
environmental subdivision pursuant to section 66418.2 of the subdivision map
act.

subsection B of this section shall require the preparation of a parcel map.
This specifically includes the division of land into four (4) or fewer parcels
and those divisions of land described in subsections B1 through B5 of this
section. Generally, only a parcel map shall be required and the preparation of
a tentative parcel map shall be prepared at the option of the subdivider
(section 66428(c) of the subdivision map act); however, if the proposed
division of land meets any of the following qualifications, a tentative parcel
map shall also be prepared and approved prior to the preparation, approval, and
recordation of the final parcel map. This section shall not limit the
subdivider, upon their own decision, to elect to submit for a tentative parcel
map prior to a parcel map where a tentative parcel map is not required by this
chapter.
      1.   The proposed subdivision is greater than twenty (20) acres.
      2.   The proposed subdivision involves the relocation or abandonment of
existing easements or rights of way held by the city or another public agency.
      3.   The parcel map, as presented, cannot be approved by the city for
recording without the imposition of conditions of approval to ensure
consistency with the general plan, this code, the city's improvement standards,
or address other issues of public safety.
   D.   Projects Exempt From Map Requirements: As provided by state law, the
following divisions of land are specifically exempt from the requirements of a
tentative map, final map, or parcel map:
      1.   Lot line adjustments between four (4) or fewer existing adjoining
parcels and where a greater number of parcels than originally existed is not
being created. The lot line adjustment shall be reflected in a recorded deed.
No record of survey shall be required unless otherwise required by section 8762
of the Business And Professions Code. The procedure for a lot line adjustment
shall be as provided in article D, "Lot Line Adjustments", of this chapter.

policy necessitates a parcel map.
      4.   Any other actions specifically excluded from section 66412 et seq.,
of the subdivision map act. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)

8-7F-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this article is to establish the city's regulations, standards,
and procedures for consideration of tentative subdivision map and tentative
parcel map application. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7F-2: TENTATIVE MAP REQUIRED:
For every subdivision for which a tentative map is required pursuant to article
C, "Division Of Land; Required Maps", of this chapter (e.g., tentative
subdivision map, tentative parcel map), the subdivider shall file with the city
a tentative map prepared in accordance with the provisions of this article.
(Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7F-3: PRELIMINARY DESIGN EVALUATION:
Prior to submitting a tentative map application, the subdivider may schedule a
preapplication meeting with the planning director, or his or her designated
representative, with any applicable fees, to discuss the proposed subdivision.
At the preapplication meeting, the subdivider shall have an opportunity to
discuss physical conditions, facts, and policies affecting the proposed
subdivision. The subdivider may also present for review a preliminary map
showing approximate lot lines, proposed street alignments, or other features of
the proposed subdivision. The planning director or representative shall inform
the subdivider of the city's policies, general plan, zoning, fees, and
infrastructure and development standards that may pertain to the proposed
subdivision and may make recommendations concerning modifying improvements and/
or design of the proposed division of land. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7F-4: TENTATIVE MAP APPLICATION:
   A.   Application Components: A subdivider seeking approval of a tentative
subdivision map or tentative parcel map (as required by this chapter) shall
file an application for tentative map approval consistent with the requirements
of this chapter. The application shall consist of the following components:
      1.   A completed application form, of which the blank form shall be
provided by the planning department.
      2.   One (1) copy of the tentative map, consistent with the requirements
of this section.
      3.   A filing fee as established by resolution of the city council.
      4.   A preliminary title report, showing the legal owners at the time of
the filing of the tentative map and prepared not more than 90 days prior to the
submittal of the application.
      5.   All items referenced within the preliminary title report shall be
submitted for review (i.e., deeds, easements, and record maps) when submitting
application.
      6.   The following drawings, statements, and other data, and as many
additional copies thereof as may be required, shall be filed on or with the
tentative map:
         a.   A vicinity or key map of appropriate scale and covering
sufficient adjoining territory so as to clearly indicate nearby street
patterns, major access streets, property lines, other adjacent properties in
the subdivider’s ownership, and other significant features which will have a
bearing upon the proposed subdivision and its location and relationship to
surrounding areas.
         b.   A statement of existing and proposed zoning and existing and
proposed uses of the property with the approximate areas of the proposed uses
by type and the total area of the subdivision.
         c.   A soils report and map, when specifically requested by the city
due to questionable site specific soil conditions. A preliminary soils report,
prepared by a civil or geotechnical engineer registered in the state and based
on adequate test borings or excavations. At least three (3) test borings shall
be done for subdivisions of up to three (3) acres, and thereafter at least one
test boring shall be done for each additional three (3) acres or fraction
thereof. If the preliminary soils report indicates the presence of critically
expansive soils, or other soil problems which, if not corrected, could lead to
structural defects, the soils report accompanying the final subdivision map
shall contain an investigation of each lot within the subdivision. If the
preliminary soils report indicates the presence of rocks or liquids containing
deleterious chemicals which, if not corrected, could cause construction
materials to corrode or deteriorate, a soils investigation of each potentially
affected lot in the subdivision may be required. The city engineer may require
additional information or reject the report if he determines it to be
incomplete, inaccurate, or unsatisfactory. Percolation test(s) shall be
conducted for each lot on which a private sewer system is proposed. A soils map
showing lots and location of test bores and percolation tests shall be
submitted with the soils report. The soils report shall include recommendation
by the civil engineer on any corrective action(s) likely to prevent structural
damage to each structure proposed to be constructed in the area where soil
problem exists.
         d.   A preliminary grading plan. Submission of the preliminary grading
plan may be waived by the city engineer when he or she determines that the
submission of said plan is not required for proper grading, flood hazard
mitigation, and erosion control of the proposed subdivision.
         e.   All other data required as a prerequisite to approval of the
tentative map, including plans, reports, fees, or other requirement.
   B.   Preparation And Form Of Tentative Map:
      1.   The tentative map shall be clearly and legibly drawn and shall be
drawn to scale by or under the direction of a licensed land surveyor and/or
registered civil engineer authorized to practice land surveying. The scale of

8-7F-5: TENTATIVE MAP PROCESS AND PROCEDURES:
   A.   General Application Review And Processing: The designated approving
authority shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the tentative map
within fifty (50) days of the date of certification of the EIR, adoption of a
negative declaration, or a determination that the project is exempt from the
requirements of CEQA. The planning director shall thereafter report the
decision of the approving authority to the subdivider. Pursuant to section
66412.3 of the subdivision map act, in reaching a decision upon the tentative
map, the approving authority shall consider the effect of that decision on the
housing needs of the region and balance these needs against the public service
needs of its residents and available fiscal and environmental resources. Except
as provided otherwise by the subdivision map act, failure to act within the
above specified time limits shall be deemed or considered approval of the
tentative map.
   B.   Approval And Application Of Conditions: The tentative map may be
approved or conditionally approved by the approving authority if it finds that
the proposed subdivision, together with the provisions for its design and
improvement, is consistent with the general plan, any applicable specific plan,
and all applicable provisions of this chapter. The approving authority may
require that, as a condition of approval, the subdivider pay all required
development impact fees at the rate for such fees in effect at the time such
fees would normally be levied (e.g., building permit issuance). The approving
authority may modify or delete any of the conditions of approval recommended in
the planning director’s report. The approving authority may add additional
requirements as a condition of its approval.
   C.   Findings For Denial: Except as otherwise required by state or federal
law, the approving authority shall deny approval of the tentative map if it
makes any of the following findings:
      1.   That the proposed map, together with the provisions for its design
and improvement, is inconsistent with the general plan or any applicable
specific plan, or other applicable provisions of this code.
      2.   That the site is not physically suitable for the type of
development.
      3.   That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed density of
development.
      4.   That the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are
likely to cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and avoidably
injure fish or wildlife or their habitat. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
designated approving authority may approve such a tentative map if any
environmental impact report was prepared with respect to the project and a
finding was made pursuant to section 21081(c) of CEQA that specific economic,
social, or other considerations make infeasible the mitigation measures or
project alternatives identified in the environmental impact report.
      5.   That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements are
likely to cause serious public health problems.
      6.   That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will
conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or
use of, property within the proposed subdivision. In this connection, the
designated approving authority may approve a map if it finds that alternate
easements, for access or for use, will be provided, and that these will be
substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. This
subsection shall apply only to easements of record or to easements established
by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and no authority is granted
to the planning commission to determine that the public at large has acquired
easements for access through or use of property within the proposed
subdivision.
      7.   Subject to section 66474.4 of the subdivision map act, that the land
is subject to a contract entered into pursuant to the California land
conservation act of 1965 (commencing with section 51200 of the Government Code)
and that the resulting parcels following a subdivision of the land would be too
small to sustain their agricultural use.
   D.   Appeal: The decision of the designated approving authority may be
appealed as provided in subsection
8-7B-4E, “Appeals”, of this chapter. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7F-6: WITHDRAWAL OF TENTATIVE MAP:
Requests for withdrawal of any application for tentative map shall be submitted
to the planning director in writing unless made at a public hearing on the
tentative map. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7F-7: RESUBMITTAL OF APPLICATION:
No application for a tentative map approval shall be accepted, nor any hearings
held thereon, for an application for the same or substantially same tentative
map that has been previously denied until a period of one year has elapsed from
the date of the final denial of the application by the body having final
jurisdiction of the matter. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7F-8: TENTATIVE MAP REVISION OR AMENDMENT:
   A.   Revisions Or Amendments Generally: Unless deemed by the city engineer
to be in substantial compliance with the approved tentative map, any request to
revise or amend an approved or conditionally approved tentative map shall be
deemed an application for a new tentative map. Such new tentative map shall be
processed in conformance with the requirements of this chapter in effect at the
time such revised map is filed, including any changes in street standards which
have become effective since the original tentative map was filed. The approval
or conditional approval of any revised tentative map shall void all prior
approved tentative maps.
   B.   Amendment Of Conditions Of Approval: A subdivider may apply for a
revision or amendment to the conditions of approval for a conditionally
approved tentative map, provided there is no proposed change to the layout or
design of the subdivision or modifications in the proposed lot sizes.
Modification of the conditions on a conditionally approved tentative map shall
not extend the time limits imposed by this chapter or the subdivision map act.
(Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7F-9: EXPIRATION OF TENTATIVE MAP APPROVAL:
   A.   Initial Life: Except as provided in section
8-7F-10, "Time Extension", of this article, the approval or conditional
approval of a tentative map shall expire twenty four (24) months after the date
of approval by the designated approving authority. This twenty four (24) month
period shall be referred to as the "initial life".
   B.   Effect Of Expiration: Expiration of an approved or conditionally
approved tentative map (including any extensions) shall terminate all
proceedings, and no final map of all or any portion of real property included
within the tentative map shall be filed without first processing a new
tentative map application. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7F-10: TIME EXTENSION:
The initial life of an approved or conditionally approved tentative map may be
extended in any of the following ways, or as otherwise provided by the
subdivision map act:
   A.   Discretionary Extension: Prior to the expiration of an approved or
conditionally approved tentative map, the subdivider may file a written
application for an extension of the expiration date. The process for
submission, review, and consideration of the request for extension shall be as
follows:
      1.   The application shall be filed with the planning director. The
application shall include the following information:
         a.   A completed application form, of which the blank form shall be
provided by the planning department;
         b.   Tentative map number and county tract number of the subject
subdivision and/or other unique information used to reference the approved
tentative map;
         c.   Requested period of extension;
         d.   Reasons for seeking extension including facts showing why the
requirements for recording a final map cannot be completed within the period
provided;
         e.   A description of all efforts made to date to record the final map
and the current status of the project; and
         f.   A description of what remains to be done to record the final map
and what steps the subdivider proposes to complete the required subdivision
improvements.
      2.   Upon receipt of this application, the approval of the tentative map
shall automatically be extended for sixty (60) days or until the application
for the extension is approved or denied, whichever occurs first.
      3.   The designated approving authority for requests for extension of a
tentative map shall be the planning commission. In accordance with the
subdivision map act and case law, the designated approving authority may not
impose additional conditions on the tentative map as part of the approval of a
discretionary extension. However, the designated approving authority may add or
amend conditions based on any changed circumstances or new city policies with
the consent of the applicant.
      4.   The process for review and processing the request for extension
shall be the same as provided in section
8-7F-5, "Tentative Map Process And Procedures", of this article.
      5.   The tentative map may be extended for a period or periods not
exceeding a total of six (6) years as provided in section 66452.6 of the
subdivision map act.
      6.   The designated approving authority shall deny the request for
extension if the approving authority makes a finding that the granting of the
extension will create a negative impact to the public health, safety, or
welfare.
      7.   If the designated approving authority denies a subdivider's
application for an extension, the subdivider may appeal the decision within 15
days in accordance with the provisions of subsection
8-7B-4E, "Appeals", of this chapter.
   B.   Filing Of Multiple (Phased) Final Maps: If multiple final maps are to
be filed for the subdivision pursuant to the subdivision map act, and if the
subdivider is required to spend more than $236,790.00 or any greater amount
pursuant to section 66452.6 of the subdivision map act, to construct, improve,
or finance (e.g., payment of impact fees) the construction of public
improvements that are located outside the property boundaries of the tentative
map, excluding improvements of public rights of way which abut the property to
be subdivided and which are reasonably related to the development of the
property, each filing of a final map shall extend the expiration of the
approved or conditionally approved tentative map by 48 months from the date of
its expiration, or the date of the previously filed (recorded) final map,
whichever is later but in no event more than 10 years from such approval or
conditional approval.
      As provided in section 66452.6(a)(3), “public improvement” shall include
traffic controls, streets, roads, highways, freeways, bridges, overcrossings,
street interchanges, flood control or storm drain facilities, sewer facilities,
water facilities, and lighting facilities. Examples include, but are not
limited to, roadway improvement projects that are conditioned as part of
project approval but do not occur within the boundaries or along the perimeter
of the project.
   C.   Development Agreement: In accordance with section 66452.6(a)(1) of the
subdivision map act, a tentative map on a property subject to a statutory
development agreement between the city and the subdivider (or any successor in
interest) may extend the life of the tentative map for a period of time as
specified in the development agreement, which period shall not exceed the term
of the development agreement itself.
   D.   Development Moratorium: In accordance with section 66452.6(b)(1) of the
subdivision map act, the initial life of an approved or conditionally approved
tentative map shall not include any time during which a development moratorium,
imposed after approval or conditional approval of the tentative map, is in
effect. However, the length of the moratorium will not exceed five (5) years.
   E.   Litigation: In accordance with section 66452.6(c) of the subdivision
map act, upon approval by the city, a pending lawsuit involving the approval or
conditional approval of a tentative map shall stay the life of a tentative map
for up to five (5) years. The subdivider may submit an application to the city
requesting the stay. The procedures for considering and taking action upon the
request for the stay shall be as provided in subsection A, “Discretionary
Extension”, of this section. The city shall take action on the request to deny
the stay within forty (40) days of receipt of the subdivider’s application. The
city shall not impose conditions upon the approval of a request for stay.
   F.   Special Legislative Extensions: On occasion, the California legislature
has adopted statutory extensions to tentative maps. Examples include, but are
not limited to, the following specific references. Any additional extensions
that are adopted by the legislature in the future are hereby incorporated into
this code by reference. The city shall honor any applicable extension provided
by the legislature.

8-7G-7: CITY ENGINEER'S REVIEW:
Upon submittal of the final map or parcel map and accompanying documents,
offers of dedication, offers of deed, offers of easement, fees, and materials
for filing, the city engineer shall cause the same to be examined, and if found
to be in substantial conformity with the approved tentative map and all
amendments, conditions, modifications, and provisions made or required by the
designated approving authority, and if found to be complete, technically
correct, in conformity with improvement plans and specifications, and in
compliance with the requirements of these regulations, planned street lines,
and other applicable specific plans and ordinance, shall forward the same to
the planning director for review and further action.
Should the map or other accompanying documents, fees, or materials be found to
be incomplete or incorrect in any respect, the subdivider shall be advised in
writing, by mail, of the changes or additions that must be made before the map
may be certified. If the defect is the result of a technical and inadvertent
error which, in the opinion of the city engineer, does not materially affect
the validity of the map, the city engineer may waive the defect and forward to
the city council.
The city engineer may recommend against approval of the recording a portion of
a final map or parcel map when, in the process of checking the final map or
parcel map, he determines that said portion does not by itself provide adequate
or satisfactory access, design, or improvements and therefore does not conform
to the design and improvement of the subdivision as indicated by the approved
tentative map, if applicable. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7G-8: PLANNING DIRECTOR'S REVIEW:
The planning director shall review the final map or parcel map to determine its
compliance with the approved tentative map and the conditions of approval
imposed by the designated approving authority. If the director determines that
the final map or parcel map is in compliance with the approved tentative map,
that all conditions of approval have been met or performed, and that the final
map or parcel map has been recommended for approval by the city engineer, the
director shall present it to the council with his or her recommendation. If a
subdivision improvement agreement is proposed, it shall be presented to the
council in the same meeting as the final map or parcel map. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-
17-2012)
8-7G-9: APPROVAL OF FINAL MAP OR PARCEL MAP, EXECUTION OF SUBDIVISION
AGREEMENT, AND ACCEPTANCE OF DEDICATION:
   A.   Generally: The city engineer shall execute the city engineer’s
certificate on the final map or parcel map before forwarding to the city
council for their acceptance.
      The city council shall consider the final map or parcel map and any
associated offers of dedication, deed, and easement at the meeting at which it
receives the final map or parcel map or at its next regular meeting after the
meeting at which it receives the final map or parcel map. The city council
shall review the final map or parcel map and approve it if it conforms to the
approved or conditionally approved tentative map and if all requirements and
conditions imposed on the subdivision pursuant to this chapter or the
subdivision map act have been met or performed. If the final map or parcel map
does not conform, the city council shall disapprove the map. The city council
shall also accept, accept subject to improvement, or reject any or all offers
of dedication in conformance with the approvals for the tentative map and the
provisions of this chapter and the subdivision map act.
      If improvements required under the terms of this chapter or as a
condition of approval have not been completed, the city council shall provide
for such improvements by approving a subdivision improvement agreement. No
final map or parcel map shall be certified until the required improvements have
been installed or agreed to be installed in accordance with article M,
“Improvements”, of this chapter and appropriate surety has been provided to the
satisfaction of the city. The city manager is authorized to execute subdivision
improvement agreements, as permitted by section 66462(d) of the subdivision map
act, in accordance with the city’s standard subdivision agreement.
      No public hearing shall be required, and no public notice shall be
required for review, consideration, and action by the city council on a final
map or parcel map, offers of dedication, deed, and easement, or improvement
agreement.
      As permitted by section 66458(d) of the subdivision map act, the city may
accept, accept subject to improvement, or reject dedications and offers of
dedications that are made by a statement on the map.
   B.   Determinations For Condominium Conversions: No final map or final
parcel map for a condominium conversion shall be approved unless all the
following determinations are made:
      1.   Each existing tenant has received notification of intent to convert,
pursuant to subsection
8-7F-4D of this chapter and section 66452.9 of the subdivision map act, at
least sixty (60) days prior to the filing of the tentative map or tentative
parcel map.
      2.   Each existing tenant and each person applying for rental of a unit
in the project has, or will have, received all applicable notices and rights
required by chapter 2 or 3 of the subdivision map act.
      3.   Each tenant has, or will have, received ten (10) days’ written
notice that an application for a public report will be, or has been, submitted
to the California department of real estate and that such report will be
available on request.
      4.   Each tenant of the proposed condominium conversion has been, or will
be, given written notification within ten (10) days of approval of a final map.
      5.   Each tenant has been, or will be, given at least one hundred eighty
(180) days written notice of intention to convert before tenancy is terminated
due to the conversion or proposed conversion.
      6.   Each tenant has been, or will be, given notice of an exclusive
right, pursuant to section 66427.1(d) of the subdivision map act, to contract
for the purchase of such tenant’s unit on the same terms and conditions that
the unit will be initially offered to the general public or terms more
favorable to the tenant. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012; amd. Ord. 2023-11, 9-19-
2023)
8-7G-10: MULTIPLE FINAL MAPS OR PARCEL MAPS:
Multiple final maps or parcel maps relating to an approved or conditionally
approved tentative map may be filed prior to the expiration of the tentative
map if: a) the subdivider, at the time the tentative map is filed, informs the
planning director of the subdivider's intention to file multiple final maps or
parcel maps on such tentative map, or b) after filing of the tentative map, the
city and the subdivider concur in the filing of multiple final maps or parcel
maps. In providing such notice, the subdivider shall not be required to define
the number or configuration of the proposed multiple final maps or parcel maps.
The filing of a final map or parcel map on a portion of an approved or
conditionally approved tentative map shall not invalidate any part of such
tentative map. Each final map or parcel map which constitutes a part, or unit,
of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map shall have a separate
subdivision phase number. Unless specific timing thresholds are set forth in
the conditions of approval, the city engineer and planning director shall
determine the improvements required and conditions that must be satisfied in
conjunction with a given final map or parcel map phase to ensure a logical and
orderly development of the whole subdivision. The subdivision improvement
agreement executed by the subdivider for that map phase shall provide for the
design and construction of all such required improvements. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-
2012)
8-7G-11: SEPARATE DEDICATIONS:
When completed outside of a dedication on a map, dedications may be required to
be made by separate instrument with fees paid to cover the cost of processing.
After receiving the instrument of dedication and accompanying title report, the
city engineer shall approve or disapprove the instrument of dedication as to
its suitability for recordation, specifically including a cover sheet, legal
description, and map in eight and one-half inch by eleven inch (81/2" x 11")
format. After approving an offer to dedicate, the city engineer shall notify
the planning director to request original signed and notarized document(s) with
the applicant’s land surveyor’s or registered civil engineer’s original seal.
Offer of dedication shall be brought to the city council for consideration of
acceptance or acknowledgment for later acceptance. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012;
amd. Ord. 2023-11, 9-19-2023)
8-7G-12: WAIVER OF PARCEL MAP:
Where a parcel map is required by the subdivision map act or this chapter, but
the subdivider seeks to waive this requirement, the following procedures shall
apply:
   A.   Waiver Of Parcel Maps Generally: The planning director shall be the
designated approving authority for the waiver of the requirements for the
recordation of a parcel map. Such a waiver may be provided in any case when the
land being divided consists of a lot or parcels shown on a recorded parcel map
or final subdivision map and the full street improvements have been constructed
or monumentation is evident, or where each of the lots has a gross acreage of
forty (40) acres or more or each of which is a quarter-quarter section or
larger. The designated approving authority may grant the waiver and will issue
a certificate of compliance if:
      1.   The subdivider files an application with the planning director,
including any fees required, verifying the existence of monumentation in the
installation of street improvements;
      2.   The application contains a legal description for each of the lots to
be created; and
      3.   The designated approving authority finds that the proposed division
of land complies with requirements as to area, improvement and design,
floodwater drainage control, appropriate improved public roads, sanitary
disposal facilities, water supply availability, environmental protection, and
other requirements of this title.
   B.   Waiver Of Parcel Maps For Condominiums:
      1.   The planning director may waive the requirements for a final parcel
map imposed by the subdivision map act for the construction of a condominium
project on a single lawful parcel.
      2.   The procedure for determining whether such a waiver for a
condominium is appropriate shall be initiated by an application for waiver
filed with the planning director.
      3.   The application shall contain a legal description for the single
lawful parcel and a description of the proposed condominium project.
      4.   The designated approving authority shall make a determination on the
waiver request after review and recommendation by the public works director and
city engineer.
      5.   If an application for waiver on a residential condominium project is
filed contemporaneously with an application to adopt or amend a specific plan,
then the application for waiver shall be first considered by the planning
commission at a public hearing. After this hearing, the planning commission
shall provide a written recommendation to the city council, which shall make
the final determination on the application.
      6.   No applications for a waiver of the requirement for a tentative or
parcel map for the construction of a condominium project on a single lawful
parcel shall be granted unless it is found that the proposed division of land
complies with the requirements of the subdivision map act and this code as to
area, improvement and design, floodwater drainage control, appropriate improved
public roads, sanitary disposal facilities, water supply availability,
environmental protection, and other requirements of the subdivision map act and
this code. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)

8-7H-5: Development Rights Upon Approval
8-7H-6: Filing And Processing Of Final Vesting Map
8-7H-7: Administration Of Vested Rights
8-7H-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this article is to establish the procedures for the submission,
review, and action by the city of vesting tentative maps. These provisions
supplement the standard of the subdivision map act. The intent of vesting
tentative maps is to provide greater protection earlier in the development
process by “locking in place” the ordinances, policies, and standards of the
city at the time the application is deemed complete. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012;
amd. Ord. 2023-11, 9-19-2023)
8-7H-2: RIGHT TO FILE A VESTING TENTATIVE MAP:
Whenever a provision of the subdivision map act or this chapter requires the
filing of a tentative map (e.g., a tentative subdivision map, tentative parcel
map), a vesting tentative map may instead be filed. Such vesting tentative map
shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article. If a subdivider
does not seek the rights conferred by the vesting tentative map statute, the
filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval
for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to
construction. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7H-3: APPLICATION FOR VESTING TENTATIVE MAP:
This section describes the required content and process for filing a vesting
tentative map.
   A.   Form And Content Consistent With Tentative Map Requirement: A vesting
tentative map shall be filed in the same form and have the same content as
required by this chapter for tentative maps. The application shall be filed in
the same manner as tentative maps.
   B.   Titled Vesting Tentative Map: At the time a vesting tentative map is
filed, it shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words "Vesting
Tentative Map".
   C.   Additional Submittal Requirements: At the time a vesting tentative

(e.g., electrical, gas, and roads);
      2.   Plans for all site development, including, but not limited to,
grading, drainage facilities, and miscellaneous structures, prepared by a
registered civil engineer in accordance with city standards and approved by the
city engineer;
      3.   Geological studies in such form as acceptable to the city engineer
and the building official, which shall include detailed soils reports, seismic
analysis, bank stabilization, and other factors pertinent to the particular
site location;
      4.   Specific information on the uses to which the proposed buildings
will be put;
      5.   The height, size, and location of all buildings, building setbacks,
number of stories, and driveway locations;
      6.   Architectural plans satisfactory for review by the city, including
site plans, floor plans, exterior elevations, and other information necessary
for building permit plan checks;
      7.   Landscape plans, including planting and irrigation details, and

      10.   Flood control information and statements showing compliance with
flood hazard regulations; and
      11.   Such other exhibits, studies, and information that fully depict
features of the development which the developer desires review for the purpose
of approval concurrently with the vesting tentative map.
The city may request, and the applicant shall promptly furnish, information as
may reasonably be necessary to enable the city to evaluate the vesting effect
that would follow from approval of the map.
   D.   Other Land Use Permits: If other discretionary land use approvals are
required in connection with development under the vesting tentative map, the
subdivider shall obtain such approval prior to, or process them concurrently
with, the filing of the vesting tentative map. For purposes of this section,
"discretionary land use approvals" shall include, but not be limited to,
general plan amendments, zone district amendments, conditional use permits, and
variances. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7H-4: PROCESSING AND APPROVING AUTHORITY:
The processing of a vesting tentative map shall be the same as provided in this
chapter for tentative maps. The designated approving authority for vesting
tentative maps shall be the planning commission. Review and action on a vesting
tentative map shall be limited to those ordinances, policies, and standards in
effect at the date the city has determined the application to be complete.
(Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7H-5: DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS UPON APPROVAL:
   A.   Generally: The approval of a vesting tentative map by the city shall
confer a vested right to apply for permits needed to proceed with development
and have the city exercise its discretion to approve, disapprove, or approve
such permits with conditions, on the basis of ordinances, policies, and
standards in effect at the time the application was determined to be complete
pursuant to section 65943 of the Government Code.
   B.   Disclaimers:
      1.   This article does not enlarge, diminish, or alter the power of the
city to deny approval of the requested project or any part thereof, or to
impose conditions on the approval of a project.
      2.   Nothing in this article removes, diminishes, or affects the
obligation of any subdivider or local agency to comply with the conditions and
requirements of any state or federal laws, regulations, or policies.
      3.   In the event that section 66474.2 of the subdivision map act is
repealed, any subsequent approvals of vested maps shall confer a vested right
to proceed with development in substantial compliance with ordinances,
policies, and standards in effect at the time the vesting map is approved or
conditionally approved, rather than at the time the application was determined
to be complete.
      4.   Notwithstanding this article, the city may condition or deny a
permit, extension, or entitlement, including, but not limited to, final maps
and building permits, if it determines any of the following:
         a.   A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision
or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health
or safety, or both;
         b.   The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state
or federal law. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012; amd. Ord. 2023-11, 9-19-2023)
8-7H-6: FILING AND PROCESSING OF FINAL VESTING MAP:
A final vesting map shall be filed and processed in the same manner, form, and
content, and shall be subject to the same fees prescribed for final maps and
parcel maps as required by this chapter. The "initial life" for vesting
tentative maps shall be the same as for tentative maps as provided in this
chapter, and the life of a vesting tentative map may be extended as provided by
this chapter. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7H-7: ADMINISTRATION OF VESTED RIGHTS:
   A.   Concurrent Approvals: Approval of a vesting tentative map applies only
to actions considered and approved by the designated approving authority. If
the vesting tentative map was approved with conditions, the approval is subject
to those conditions. If related applications for discretionary permits were
approved in conjunction with the vesting tentative map, the approvals are
subject to applicable ordinances, policies, and standards granting those
entitlements, including any conditions thereof.
   B.   Initial Life Of Vested Rights: The rights conferred by a vesting
tentative map as provided by this article shall last for an initial period of
one year after recording of the final map. This period may be extended as
provided below.
   C.   Extension Of Vested Rights Through Recording Of A Final Map: Where
several final maps or final parcel maps are recorded on various phases of a
project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period
shall begin for each phase when the final map or final parcel map for that
phase is recorded. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a
project covered by a single vesting tentative map, the initial vesting period

8-7N-10: Off Site Dedication
8-7N-1: PURPOSE:
This article is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by section 66477 of
the subdivision map act. The park and recreational facilities for which
dedication of land and/or payment of fee is required shall be in accordance
with the parks, schools, and community facilities element of the general plan.
Land dedication under this article shall conform to the city general plan, to
any adopted specific plan, and to the applicable provisions of section 66477 of
the subdivision map act. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-7N-2: REQUIREMENTS AND EXEMPTIONS:
   A.   Park Land Required: As a condition of approval of a final map or parcel
map, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at
the option of the city, for park or recreational purposes at the time and
according to the standards and formula contained in this article.
This requirement for land dedication and/or in-lieu fee shall be separate from
any park impact fee established by resolution of the city council to address
improvements to existing parks and construction of new parks as is necessary to
support the increase in population provided through new development.
   B.   Exemptions: The provisions of this article shall not apply to
subdivisions:
      1.   Not used for residential purposes, provided, however, that a
condition shall be placed on the approval of such subdivision that if a
building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or
structure on one or more of the parcels within four (4) years of the filing of
the map, the owner of each such parcel shall be required to pay an in-lieu fee
pursuant to this article, calculated as of the date the building permit is
issued, as a condition to the issuance of a building permit; a note to this
effect shall be placed on the final map.
      2.   To permit separate ownership of two (2) or more existing residential
dwelling units when all such units are more than five (5) years old, and no new
units are added. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012; amd. Ord. 2023-11, 9-19-2023)
8-7N-3: STANDARDS AND FORMULAS FOR DEDICATION OF PARK LAND:
   A.   Dedication Standards: It is found and determined that the public
interest, convenience, health, welfare, and safety require that no less than
six (6) acres of property for each 1,000 persons residing within the city be
devoted to local recreation and park purposes. This standard shall be broken
down as follows:
      1.   New Development Park Land: A standard of five (5) acres per each
1,000 persons for landscaped open spaces, parks, trail systems, and/or special
community service facilities in new residential developments; and
      2.   Citywide Park Land: A standard of one acre per each 1,000 persons,
to be met with an impact fee, for city owned and operated parks and special
recreation areas that serve all residents.
   B.   When Park Land Dedication Is Required: Where a recreational or park
facility has been designated in the general plan or a specific plan, and is to
be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the
immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider
shall dedicate land for a local recreation or park facility sufficient in size
and topography to serve the residents of the subdivision.
   C.   Calculation Of Required Park Land Dedication For New Development:
      1.   The amount of land to be dedicated shall be determined according to
the formula D x F = A in which:
         D = the number of dwelling units
         F = a “factor” herein described
         A = the buildable acres to be dedicated
      2.   A “buildable acre” is a typical acre of the subdivision, with a
slope less than ten percent (10%), and located in other than an area on which
building is excluded because of flooding, public rights of way, easements, or
other restrictions.
      3.   The factors below are constants that, when multiplied by the number
of dwelling units permitted in the subject area, will produce five (5) acres of
new development park land per 1,000 population:
         FS = .0160 relating to single-family dwelling units
         FT = .0148 relating to two-family dwelling units
         FM = .0127 relating to multiple-family dwelling units
         Fmh = .0174 relating to mobilehome dwelling units
      4.   The factors in subsection C3 of this section shall be updated from
time to time with the latest data available from the United States census which
has a low margin of error. As of the 2000 census, this information was
available from tables H032 (tenure by units in structure) and H033 (total
population in occupied housing units by tenure by units in structure) of
summary file 3.
      The factors shall be calculated based upon the following equation:
 
5 acres                  = Park factor
(1,000 ÷ Household Size)
 
   The household size shall be determined based upon the total population in
each dwelling category (table H033) divided by the total number of occupied
units in that dwelling category (table H032).
   Note that the census uses a greater range of unit types than that used in
this article.
Table 8-7N-3-C-1 of this section describes how the census unit types are
converted into the four (4) unit types used in this article.

      20 to 49
      50 or more
      Mobilehome       Mobilehome dwelling
      Boat, RV, van,   Not used
 
   D.   Determination Of The Number Of Dwelling Units On Multi-Family Parcels:
Unless the subdivider enters into an agreement with the city for a lower
density, the number of dwelling units on multi- family parcels shall be based
on the maximum development potential allowed by right based upon the general
plan land use map and the gross acreage of the parcel.
   E.   Required Improvements On Dedicated Land: The subdivider shall provide
all of the following prior to the city accepting the park land dedication:
      1.   Provide full street improvements, including, but not limited to,
curbs, gutters, street paving, traffic control devices, streetlights, and
sidewalks, to land which is dedicated pursuant to this article;
      2.   Provide improved surface drainage through the site; and
      3.   Provide other improvements which the designated approving authority
determines to be essential to the acceptance of the land for recreational
purposes. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012; amd. Ord. 2023-11, 9-19-2023)
8-7N-4: FEES IN LIEU OF NEW DEVELOPMENT PARK LAND DEDICATION:
   A.   Ability To Pay Fee: A new development may pay a fee in lieu of
dedicating land for park land if:
      1.   There is no park or recreational facility designated in the city’s
general plan to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision
to serve the needs of the residents of the subdivision, and/or where the
designed approving authority requires the payment of in-lieu fees; or
      2.   The proposed subdivision contains 50 parcels or less.
   B.   Formula For Fees: When a fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication,
the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value as described
below, plus 48 percent for off-site improvements such as utility line
extensions, curb, gutter, and pavement, and streetlights.
      For purposes of calculating the in-lieu fee under this section, the fair
market value shall be determined in the following manner:
      1.   The subdivider shall request that an appraisal be prepared pursuant
to the procedures set forth below and shall pay the in-lieu fee based upon the
fair market value established in that appraisal.
      2.   Upon request of the subdivider, the city shall cause an appraisal to
be made. The appraisal shall be made at the subdivider’s expense, payable to
the city in advance, by a person on the city’s list of approved appraisers, who
will be qualified as a certified general real estate appraiser by the
California office of real estate appraisers and shall meet the standards
specified in the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice. The
appraiser shall appraise the property at its unencumbered (free and clear)
value, as if at the approved tentative map stage of development and as if any
assessments or other encumbrances to which the property is subject had been
paid off in full prior to the date of appraisal. Factors to be considered
during the evaluation shall include the following:
         a.   Conditions of the tentative map;
         b.   The general plan;
         c.   Zoning and density;
         d.   Property location;
         e.   Off-site improvements facilitating use of the property;
         f.   Site characteristics of the property;
         g.   Existing public improvements.
   The appraisal shall value the property as of a date no earlier than 90 days
prior to the recording of the final map, or the payment of the fee, whichever
occurs later. The appraisal shall clearly state the fair market value of the
property.
   C.   Use Of Fees: Fees collected pursuant to this section shall be used and
expended solely for the acquisition, improvement, and expansion of the public
parks, playgrounds, and recreational facilities reasonably related to serve the
needs of the residents of the proposed subdivision. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012;
amd. Ord. 2023-11, 9-19-2023)
8-7N-5: FEES FOR CITYWIDE PARK LAND:
The city has, through its general plan, established a goal of providing one
acre for each 1,000 persons for city owned and operated parks and special
recreation areas that serve all residents. This requirement shall be satisfied
through the payment of a fee in lieu of any dedication requirement. The fee
shall be as established by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-
2012; amd. Ord. 2023-11, 9-19-2023)
8-7N-6: TIME SCHEDULE FOR USE OF LAND AND FEES:
Any fee collected under this article shall be committed within five (5) years
after the payment of such fees or the issuance of building permits on one-half
(1/2) of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. If such
fees are not committed, they shall be distributed and paid to the then record
owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot
bears to the total area of all lots within the subdivision. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-
17-2012)
8-7N-7: CREDIT FOR PRIVATE OPEN SPACE:
The city may grant credits for privately owned and maintained open space or
local recreation facilities, or both, in planned developments as defined in
section 11003 of the Business And Professions Code, condominiums as defined in
section 783 of the Civil Code, and other common interest developments, as
provided in this section.
   A.   Amount Of Credit: Credit shall not exceed 25% of the total required

subdivision, and shall be deducted from the dedication or fees, or both,
otherwise required.
   B.   Qualifying Credits: The city allows all of the following land or
facilities as private open space credit, provided such land or facilities are
held in a recorded easement by the city:
      1.   “Open spaces”, which are generally defined as parks, extensive areas
with tree coverage, when such areas are extensive and have natural features
worthy of scenic preservation, golf courses, or open areas on the site in
excess of 20,000 square feet;
      2.   “Court areas”, which are generally defined as tennis courts,
badminton courts, shuffleboard courts, or similar hard surfaced areas

including pedestrian walkways separated from public roads, planting strips,
improved access or right of way in excess of requirements, and similar type
open space or recreational facilities which, in the sole judgment of the city,
qualifies for a credit.
   C.   Procedure For Allowing Credit: Credit under this section may be allowed
at the discretion of the designated approving authority for the subdivision at
the time of tentative map approval if it can be shown that the allowance of the
credit is consistent with the policies of the general plan. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-
17-2012; amd. Ord. 2023-11, 9-19-2023)
8-7N-8: SALE OF DEDICATED LAND:
If, during the period between dedication of land for park purposes and the
commencement of first stage development, circumstances arise that indicate that
another site would be more suitable for park or recreational purposes serving
the subdivision, by mutual agreement of the subdivider or owner and the city

for public parks and recreation facilities or in-lieu payment shall be required
on a proportional share of the area subject to the phased map versus the
overall approved project. The planning director shall, at the time of filing of
each phased map, recalculate the amount of land required to be dedicated in
accordance with this article, based on the land area and units included in the
proposed final map or parcel map. Nothing in this section shall preclude the
subdivider from satisfying the requirements of this article as part of the
first phased map. However, in no instance shall the dedication accepted by the
city or in-lieu fees collected by the city for the subdivision be less than the
proportional requirement that has been recorded. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)

CHAPTER 8
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
SECTION:
8-8-1: Purpose And Intent
8-8-2: Definitions
8-8-3: Administration
8-8-4: General Provisions
8-8-5: Development Permit
8-8-6: Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction
8-8-7: Variance Procedure
8-8-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied
uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land
within flood prone areas. These regulations are designed to:
      1.   Protect human life and health;
      2.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      3.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      4.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      5.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains; electric, telephone, and sewer lines; and streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
      6.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted
areas caused by flood damage;
      7.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
      8.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   B.   The city's intent in adopting this chapter is to provide floodplain
management regulations, as authorized under Government Code sections 65302,
65560, and 65800, for the purposes of providing for the public health, safety,
and general welfare of its citizenry. The flood hazard areas of the city of
Lemoore are subject to periodic inundation, which has the potential to result
in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce
and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. These flood losses are
caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from
flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood
hazards that increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood
losses. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)
8-8-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, and words shall
have the following definitions:

date of ordinance 2001-05 (August 21, 2001).
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   F.   "F" Definitions:
    FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM): The official map on which the
federal emergency management agency or federal insurance administration has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.
   FLOOD, FLOODING, OR FLOODWATER:
      1.   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation

and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and
      2.   The condition resulting from flood related erosion.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map on which the federal
emergency management agency or federal insurance administration has delineated
both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable
to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal insurance
administration that may include flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map,
the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the
base flood.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: The community official designated by title to
administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. As provided in
section
8-8-3, "Administration", of this chapter, the floodplain administrator shall be
the public works director.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited
to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: This chapter and other zoning
regulations, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose regulations (such as grading and erosion control), and other
application of police power which control development in flood prone areas.
This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination
thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and
damage.
   FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source. See definition of Flood, Flooding, Or Floodwater.
   FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to

regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION: As related to section
8-8-7, "Variance Procedure", of this chapter, means that the variance granted
must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this
requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly
constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of
the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are
permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during
all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of
the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs,
inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring.
In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is
subject to potential flood damage and can be insured only at very high flood
insurance rates.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair
facilities, and does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   G.   "G" Definitions: Reserved for future use.
   H.   "H" Definitions:
    HARDSHIP: As related to section
8-8-7, "Variance Procedure", of this chapter, means the exceptional hardship
that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city
council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the
property involved. Economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional.
Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal
preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule,
qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved
through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is
more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the
parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN: A plan that incorporates a process whereby the
potential of future loss due to flooding can be minimized by planning and
implementing one or more alternatives to floodplain management on a community
wide basis.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
      1.   Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a
listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined
by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the national register;
      2.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the
interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      3.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
secretary of interior; or
      4.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior or
directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs.

constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including
basement (see definition of Basement). An unfinished or flood resistant
enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles,
building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area is not
considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable
nonelevation design requirements, including, but not limited to:
      1.   The anchoring standards in subsection
8-8-6A1, "Anchoring", of this chapter;
      2.   The construction materials and methods standards in subsection
8-8-6A2, "Construction Materials And Methods", of this chapter;

are considered to be basements (see definition of Basement). This prohibition
includes below grade garages and storage areas.
   M.   "M" Definitions:
    MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE: Determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in
new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation
which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement
of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by
reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building
construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking
into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and its
functional obsolescence, as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall
not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of
replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those
contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only
if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent
professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the
differences.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American vertical datum

8-8-3: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Designation Of The Floodplain Administrator: The public works director
is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by
granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions.
   B.   Duties And Responsibilities Of The Floodplain Administrator: The duties
and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be
limited to, the following:
      1.   Permit Review: Review all development permits to determine that:
         a.   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied,
including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of
existing structures.
         b.   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained.
         c.   The site is reasonably safe from flooding.
         d.   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot (1') at any point within the city of Lemoore.
         e.   Any necessary letters of map revision (LOMRs) are approved prior
to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based
on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow
construction and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction"
definition.
      2.   Development Of Substantial Improvement And Substantial Damage
Procedures:
         a.   Using FEMA publication FEMA P-758, "Substantial Improvement/
Substantial Damage Desk Reference", develop detailed procedures for identifying
and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial
damage, to include defining market value.
         b.   Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/
divisions and implemented by community staff.
      3.   Review, Use, And Development Of Other Base Flood Data: When base
flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with subsection
8-8-4B, "Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard", of this
chapter, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer section
8-8-6, "Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction", of this chapter.
Note: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two (2) methods from
the FEMA publication, "FEMA 265, Managing Floodplain Development In Approximate
Zone A Areas - A Guide For Obtaining And Developing Base (100-Year) Flood
Elevations", dated July 1995.
      4.   Notification Of Other Agencies:
         a.   Alteration Or Relocation Of A Watercourse:
            (1)   Notify adjacent communities and the California department of
water resources prior to alteration or relocation;
            (2)   Submit evidence of such notification to the federal emergency
management agency; and
            (3)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
         b.   Base Flood Elevation Changes Due To Physical Alterations:
            (1)   Within six (6) months of information becoming available or
project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall
submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data
to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR).
            (2)   All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to
the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on
conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow
construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as
specified in the "start of construction" definition.
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical
changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain
management requirements are based on current data.
         c.   Changes In Corporate Boundaries: Notify FEMA in writing whenever
the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and
include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate
limits.

   A.   Nature Of Variances: The issuance of a variance is for floodplain
management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute
according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a
variance.
      The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general
principle of law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not
personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with
physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of
this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the
surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property
and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain
to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property
owners. The city council shall be the approving authority for variances.
      It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from
flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare.
The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be
met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines
provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that
must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are
designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a
variance are more appropriate.
      A variance from the provisions of this chapter is different from a land
development variance as provided in title 9, "Zoning", of the municipal code.
   B.   Conditions For Variances:
      1.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-
half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of sections
8-8-3, "Administration", and
8-8-6, "Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction", of this chapter have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      2.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
"historic structures" (as defined in section
8-8-2, "Definitions", of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
      3.   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      4.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter.
      5.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
         a.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage; and
         b.   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be
recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Kings County
recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of
title of the affected parcel of land.
      6.   The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management
agency.
   C.   Action By The City Council:
      1.   In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and the:
         a.   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
         b.   Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
         c.   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
         d.   Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
         e.   Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         f.   Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         g.   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
         h.   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
         i.   Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
         j.   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and
         k.   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
      2.   Variances shall only be issued upon a:
         a.   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         c.   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary
public expense, create a nuisance (see section
8-8-2, definition of "public safety and nuisance", of this chapter), cause
fraud and victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
regulations.
      3.   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections C1
through C4 of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood, does not result in additional threats to public safety, and does not
create a public nuisance.
      4.   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection B1 of this section
and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter. (Ord. 2012-01, 4-17-2012)

9-1-3: Interpretation
9-1-4: Enforcement, Legal Procedures, And Penalties
9-1-1: PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY:
   A.   Title: This title shall be known as the LEMOORE ZONING CODE, hereafter
referred to as the zoning code.
   B.   Purpose Of The Zoning Code: This title establishes regulations
governing the development and use of land in accordance with the city of
Lemoore general plan (general plan) in a manner that protects the public
health, safety, comfort and convenience, and welfare of residents and
businesses of Lemoore. The zoning code provides information to facilitate the
efficient review of development proposals, while providing opportunity for
public review and comment for proposals that may have a significant impact on
the community. Further, the zoning code:
      1.   Supports the general plan's goals, policies, and land use framework
through:
         a.   Compact urban form as depicted on the general plan land use
diagram;
         b.   Promotion of small town character;
         c.   Accommodation of economic development and jobs through adequately
zoned properties;
         d.   Integration of neighborhoods and neighborhood centers;
         e.   Enhancement of community character and aesthetics;
         f.   Promotion of an interconnected network of open space and parks;

ensure the provision of adequate water, sewage, transportation, drainage,
parks, open space, and other public facilities and services.
      3.   Protects and promotes appropriately located commercial and
industrial activities in order to preserve and strengthen the city's economic
base.
      4.   Fosters a wholesome, serviceable, and attractive living environment,
the beneficial development of areas that exhibit conflicting patterns of use,
and the stability of existing land uses that conform with objectives, policies,
principles, and standards of the general plan.
      5.   Provides a guide for the prezoning of properties within the sphere
of influence in conjunction with the potential annexation proceedings, as
provided by law.
      6.   Conserves and protects the city's natural resources and features
such as canals, significant trees, and historic and environmental resources in
accordance with the policies of the general plan.
      7.   Requires that permitted uses and development provide reasonable
protection from fire, flood, landslide, erosion, or other manmade or natural
hazards.
      8.   Ensures compatibility between residential and nonresidential
development and land uses.
   C.   Authority: This title is enacted based on the authority vested to the
city of Lemoore by the state of California, including, but not limited to,
article XI, section 7 of the state constitution; the planning and zoning law 1
; and the California environmental quality act 2 .
   D.   Applicability Of Regulations: This title applies to all land uses,
structures, subdivisions, and development within the city of Lemoore,
including:
      1.   Relationship To Prior Code: The provisions of this title, as it
existed prior to the effective date of the ordinance enacting this title, are
repealed and superseded as provided in ordinance 2013-05. No provision of this
title shall validate or legalize any land use or structure established,
constructed, or maintained in violation of the title as it existed prior to its
repeal by ordinance 2013-05.
      2.   Prior Rights And Violations: The enactment of this title shall not
terminate or otherwise affect vested land use development permits, approvals,
or agreements authorized under the provisions of any ordinance, nor shall
violation of prior ordinance be excused by the adoption of this title.

is required to lawfully establish, construct, reconstruct, alter, or replace
any use of land or structure.
      4.   Land Use Permits (Entitlements): Land use permits are required when
a "development" as defined by this title is proposed. No person shall initiate
a development requiring a land use permit, and the city shall not issue any
other permit related to the development, until a land use permit has been
approved and the appeals period has expired.
      5.   Existing Uses And Structures: An existing land use or structure is
lawful only when it was legally established and is operated and maintained in
compliance with all applicable provisions of this code. A land use or structure
that was lawfully established before this title was enacted, or before
enactment of any applicable amendment to this title, may continue except as
provided in chapter 2, article C, "Nonconforming Uses, Structures, And
Properties", of this title. No expansion or modification to a preexisting legal
nonconforming use or structure shall be permitted except as allowed by chapter
2, article C, "Nonconforming Uses, Structures, And Properties", of this title.
      6.   Minimum Requirements: The provisions of this title shall be the
minimum to ensure the public health, safety, and welfare. For discretionary
actions, city officials or bodies have the ability to impose more stringent
requirements than set forth in this title as may be necessary to promote
orderly land use development.
      7.   Effect Of Zoning Code Changes On Projects In Process: The enactment
of this title or amendments to its requirements may have the effect of imposing
different standards on new land uses, development, and/or structures than those
that applied to existing land uses, development, and/or structures. Following
the effective date of this title, or any amendments to this title, the
following provisions shall apply:
         a.   Pending Applications: All land use permit applications that are
active and that have been determined by the planning department to be complete
before the effective date of this title or any amendment, will be processed
according to the regulations in effect when the application was accepted as
complete.
         b.   Approved Projects Not Yet Under Construction: Any structure
authorized by a conditional use permit, site plan and architectural review,
temporary use permit, or variance, for which construction has not begun as of
the effective date of this title or any amendment, may still be constructed in
compliance with the approved permit, as long as construction is completed and
the approved land use is established before the expiration of the permit or,
where applicable, before the expiration of any approved time extension.
         c.   Projects Under Construction: A structure that is under
construction pursuant to a valid building permit on the effective date of this
title or any amendment, may be completed and need not be changed to satisfy any
new or different requirements of this title as long as construction is beyond
the approval of the first inspection on the effective date of this title or any
amendment, and provided that construction is diligently pursued to completion.
Such a structure shall be deemed to be a lawfully existing building.
      8.   Conflicting Requirements: Wherever conflict occurs between the
provisions of this title and any other provision of law, the more restrictive
of any such provisions shall apply.
         a.   Municipal Code Provisions: If conflicts occur between
requirements of this title and other portions of the municipal code, or between
this title and other plans and policies adopted by the city, the most
restrictive shall apply.
         b.   General Plan: If conflict occurs between the requirements of this
title and the adopted city general plan, the requirements of the general plan
shall govern.
         c.   Specific Plan: If conflict occurs between the requirements of
this title and any adopted specific plan, the requirements of the specific plan
shall govern.
         d.   Development Agreements: If conflicts occur between the
requirements of this title and standards adopted as part of any development
agreement, the requirements of the development agreement shall govern.
         e.   Private Agreements: This title applies to all land uses and
development regardless of whether it imposes a greater or lesser restriction on
the development or use of structures or land than a private agreement or
restriction (for example, CC&Rs) without affecting the applicability of any
agreement or restriction. The city shall not enforce any private covenant or
agreement unless it is a party to the covenant or agreement.
      9.    Other Requirements/Permits: Nothing in this title eliminates the
need for obtaining any other permits required by the city, or any permit,
approval, or entitlement required by the regulations of any regional, state, or
federal agency.
      10.   Public Nuisance: Neither the provisions of this title nor any
permit or other approval authorized by this title shall authorize the
maintenance of any public nuisance as defined in the municipal code.
      11.   Code Violations: No development shall be permitted and no permits
shall be issued for the division, improvement, or use of land that has been
divided or otherwise developed in violation of this title.
      12.   Severability: If any portion of this title is for any reason held
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unconstitutional, or
unenforceable, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
portions of this title. The city council hereby declares that this title and
each chapter, article, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence,
clause, phrase, and portion thereof is adopted, irrespective of the fact that
one or more portions of this title may be declared invalid, unconstitutional,
or unenforceable. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)

   F.   Permit Revocation Or Modification: This subsection provides procedures
for securing revocation or modification of previously approved land use permits
or entitlements.
      1.   Revocations: The city's action to revoke an entitlement shall have
the effect of terminating the entitlement and denying the privileges granted by
the original approval.
      2.   Modifications: The city may choose to allow the modification of the
operational characteristics instead of revoking an entitlement. These
modifications may include operational aspects, including, but not limited to,

lighting, parking, performance guarantees, property maintenance, signs,
surfacing, and traffic circulation.
      3.   Hearings And Notice: The appropriate review authority shall hold a

granted in compliance with the provisions of this title. A notice shall be
delivered in writing to the applicant and/or owner of the property for which
the permit was granted.

permit may be revoked or modified by the review authority which originally
approved the entitlement if any of the following findings can be made:

have been changed by the applicant to a degree that one or more of the findings
contained in the original permit can no longer be met;

violation of any code, law, ordinance, regulation, or statute; or
         f.   The improvement/use allowed by the permit has become detrimental
to the public health, safety, or welfare, or the manner of operation
constitutes or is creating a public nuisance.
   G.   Enforcement Action: This subsection describes the procedures for
initiating enforcement action in cases where the planning director, or other
city official, has determined that real property within the city is being used
in violation of the provisions of this title.
      1.   Notice To Responsible Parties: The planning director shall provide
the record owner of the subject site and any person in possession or control of
the site with a written notice of violation, which shall include the following
information:
         a.   A description of the violation and citations of applicable zoning
code provisions being violated;
         b.   A time limit for correcting the violation;
         c.   A statement that the city intends to charge the property owner
for all administrative costs associated with the abatement of the violation;
         d.   A statement that the property owner may request and be provided a
meeting with the director or designee to discuss possible methods and time
limits for the correction of the violations.
      2.   Time Limit For Correction: The notice of violation shall state that
the violations shall be corrected within thirty (30) days from the date of the
notice to avoid further enforcement action by the city. The thirty (30) day
time limit may be extended by the city upon determining that the responsible
party will likely correct the violations within a reasonable time period. The
city may also require through the notice of violation that the correction occur
within less than thirty (30) days if the violation constitutes a hazard to
public health or safety.
      3.   Use Of Other Enforcement Procedures: Failure to remedy the violation
within the time limit for correction shall constitute a violation of this title
and shall entitle the city to pursue criminal and civil remedies as provided by
law and title 1, chapter 4 of the municipal code.
   H.   Cost Recovery: The city has the authority to recover costs related to
enforcement actions as follows:
      1.   Cost Recovery Where No Permit Is Required: The city shall be
reimbursed for administrative costs, including, but not limited to, staff and
city attorney time expended on the enforcement of the provisions of this title,
in cases where no permit is required in order to correct a violation.
         a.   Record Of Cost: The planning department shall maintain records of
all administrative costs incurred by responsible city departments and
associated with the processing of violations and enforcement of this title, and
the city shall be entitled to recover costs from the property owner.

of any of the provisions of this zoning code is found to exist, the planning
director or designee shall notify the record owner or any person having
possession or control of the property by mail of the existence of the violation
and the department's intent to charge the property owner for all administrative
costs associated with enforcement.
         c.   Summary Of Costs: At the conclusion of the case, the planning
director shall send a summary of costs associated with enforcement to the owner
and/or persons having possession or control of the property by certified and
first class mail.
         d.   Actions That Require A Permit: Any person who alters or
establishes any land use or structure without first obtaining any permit
required by this title shall pay the additional permit processing fees as
established by the city that result from this action.
      2.   Inspection Fee: An inspection fee as established by the city may be
imposed on each person who receives a notice of violation, notice and order, or
letter of correction of any provision of this title, adopted building code, or
state law. The fee may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection
conducted when the particular violation is not fully abated or corrected as
directed. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)

9-2A-1: PURPOSE:
This article describes the general procedures that apply to land use
entitlement applications. The implementation of these procedures is consistent
with the requirements of the California Government Code, including chapter 2.7
(public hearings), chapter 3 article 6 (preparation, adoption, and amendment of
the general plan), chapter 3 article 8 (specific plans), chapter 4 (zoning
regulations), and chapter 4.5 (review and approval of development projects,
also known as the permit streamlining act), and division 13 of the California
Public Resources Code (the California environmental quality act). (Ord. 2013-
05, 2-6-2014)
9-2A-2: OVERVIEW OF PROCESSING PROCEDURES:
   A.   Overview Of Process: The entitlement procedures provided in this
article are described according to the various stages of the application review
process.
   B.   Types Of Planning Permits And Entitlements: Each planning permit or
entitlement administered by the city is categorized as one of three (3) types.
These types are listed below. Section
9-2A-7,
table 9-2A-7-1, "Planning Permit And Entitlements And Review And Appeal
Authority", of this article lists the various planning permits and entitlements
in Lemoore, identifies the type of permit required, and lists the designated
approving authority and appeal authority for each.
      1.   Administrative decisions are those that require limited or no
interpretation or exercise of judgment in evaluating approval criteria because
the decision is made according to specific criteria.
      2.   Quasi-judicial decisions typically involve some level of discretion
or policy determination on the part of the approval authority and generally
require findings to be made in order to approve planning permits or
entitlements.
      3.   Legislative decisions must be made by the city council. Legislative
land use decisions apply to the general population and prescribe policy and
require the greatest amount of discretion and evaluation. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-
2014)

application is accompanied concurrently with an application for a subdivision
permit (e.g., lot line adjustment, tentative subdivision map, tentative parcel
map, vesting tentative map) as provided in title 8, chapter 7, "Land Division",
of the municipal code, all of the applications shall be processed concurrently

for quasi-judicial and legislative planning permits and entitlements. The
purpose of the preapplication conference is to acquaint applicants with the
requirements of this code, the general plan, and other relevant criteria and to
have a preliminary discussion about the merits and details of a proposed
project. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)

application, a new thirty (30) day period shall begin during which the planning
director shall review materials and determine the completeness of the
application.
      4.   Incomplete Application: If additional information or submittals are
required and the application is not made complete within six (6) months of the
completeness determination letter, the city shall have the discretion to deem
the application as withdrawn. No further action will be taken on the
application. Unexpended fees, as determined by the city, will be returned to
the applicant. If the applicant subsequently wishes to pursue the project, a
new application, including fees, plans, exhibits, and other materials, must
then be filed in compliance with this code.

recommendation to the approving authority to approve, deny, or approve with
conditions the requested entitlement.
         a.   Each staff report shall be furnished to the applicant and
property owner when it is provided to the review authority prior to
consideration of the entitlement request.
         b.   The staff report may be amended as necessary at any time prior to
the hearing to address issues or information not reasonably known at the time
the report is due.
      4.   Determination: The designated approving authority shall notice and
hold a public hearing (if required) and take action to approve, deny, or
conditionally approve the land use permit or entitlement.
      5.   Conditions Of Approval: The approving authority shall have the
authority to impose reasonable conditions of approval to ensure that all
applicable criteria are, or can be, met. Failure to comply with any condition
of approval shall be grounds for revocation of the planning permit(s) or
entitlement(s) and grounds for instituting code enforcement proceedings.
   E.   Withdrawal Of Application:
      1.   Request: An applicant or property owner may withdraw any application
at the request of the applicant, prior to the final written decision on the
entitlement.

itself, project design, or the waiver or alteration of conditions imposed in
the granting of the permit.

substantial conformance with the original approval, the applicant shall be
notified of the requirement to submit a permit modification application for
consideration and action by the same approving authority as the original
permit.
      3.   A permit modification may be granted only when the approving
authority makes all findings required for the original approval and the
additional finding that there are changed circumstances sufficient to justify
the modification of the approval. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)

9-2B-6: REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of allowing reasonable accommodation is to provide
a process for individuals with disabilities to make requests for reasonable
accommodation for relief from the various provisions of this title. It is the
policy of the city, pursuant to the federal fair housing act (as amended) and
the California fair employment and housing act, to provide persons with
disabilities reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, and procedures that
may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing.
   B.   Requesting Reasonable Accommodation:
      1.   A disabled person or representative may request reasonable
accommodation(s) relating to the various provisions of this title.
      2.   A request for reasonable accommodation(s) with regard to various
provisions of this title may be filed on an application form provided by the
city at the time that the accommodation may be necessary to ensure equal access
to housing.
   C.   Approval Authority:
      1.   The planning director shall have the authority to consider and take
action on requests for reasonable accommodation. The planning director shall
issue a written determination of his or her action within fifteen (15) days of
the date of receipt of a completed application and may:
         a.   Grant or deny the accommodation request; or
         b.   Grant the accommodation request subject to specified
nondiscriminatory condition(s).
      2.   If necessary to reach a determination or action on the request for
reasonable accommodation, the planning director may request further information
from the applicant specifying in detail what information is required. In the
event a request for further information is made, the fifteen (15) day period to
issue a written determination shall be stayed until the applicant fully and
sufficiently responds to the request.
   D.   Considerations: The city may consider, but is not limited to, the
following factors in determining whether the requested accommodation is
necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability a reasonable
accommodation:
      1.   Whether the requested accommodation will affirmatively enhance the
quality of life of one or more individuals with a disability;
      2.   Whether the individual or individuals with a disability will be
denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the housing type of their choice absent
the accommodation;
      3.   In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested
accommodation is necessary to make facilities of a similar nature or operation
economically viable in light of the particularities of the relevant market and
market participants;
      4.   In the case of a residential care facility, whether the existing
supply of facilities of a similar nature and operation in the community is
sufficient to provide individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to
live in a residential setting;
      5.   Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the
character of the neighborhood;
      6.   Whether the accommodation would result in a substantial increase in
traffic or insufficient parking;
      7.   Whether granting the requested accommodation would substantially
undermine any express purpose of either the city's general plan or an
applicable specific plan;
      8.   In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested
accommodation would create an institutionalized environment due to the number
of and distance between facilities that are similar in nature or operation.
   E.   Approval Findings: In making a determination regarding the
reasonableness of a requested reasonable accommodation, the approving authority
shall make the following findings:
      1.   The subject site of the request for reasonable accommodation will be
used for an individual protected under the fair housing act.
      2.   The request for reasonable accommodation is necessary to make
specific housing available to an individual protected under the fair housing
act.
      3.   The requested reasonable accommodation does not impose an undue
financial or administrative burden on the city and does not fundamentally alter
city zoning, development standards, policies, or procedures.
      4.   The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental
alteration in the nature of the city's zoning, as "fundamental alteration" is
defined in fair housing laws and interpretive case law.
      5.   The requested accommodation will not, under the specific facts of
the case, result in a direct threat to the health or safety of other
individuals or physical damage to neighboring property. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-
2014)
9-2B-7: SIMILAR USE DETERMINATION:
   A.   Purpose And Applicability: All possible land uses may not be listed
within the provisions of this title, and new uses may evolve over time. When a
particular use is not specifically listed in this zoning code the planning
director determines that an official interpretation is needed. The provisions
established in this section allow the approving authority, by formal action, to
determine whether or not a proposed use is similar to a permitted or
conditionally permitted use and whether such proposed use may be permitted in a
particular zoning district.
   B.   Approving Authority: The planning director shall be the designated
approving authority for similar use determinations.
   C.   Public Hearing And Notice: The issuance of a similar use determination
is an administrative function of the planning director, and no public hearing
or notice is required.
   D.   Approval Findings: In determining "substantial similarity", the
approving authority shall make all of the following findings:
      1.   The characteristics of and activities associated with the proposed
use are equivalent to one or more of the listed uses and will not involve a
higher level of activity or population density than the uses listed in the
zoning district (e.g., traffic, hours of operation, intensity of use,
population density);
      2.   The proposed use will be consistent with the purposes of the
applicable zoning district; and
      3.   The proposed use will be consistent with the general plan, any
applicable specific plan, and this zoning code.
   E.   Documentation Of Determinations: Determinations shall be made in
writing and shall contain the facts that support the determination.
   F.   Keeping Of Similar Use Determinations: The planning director shall
maintain a complete record of all similar use determinations available for
public review. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)

interpretation is made by an applicant, property owner, or interested party to
the planning director, an official zoning interpretation shall be prepared as
described herein.
   B.   Official Zoning Interpretation Defined; Threshold For Preparation Of
Official Zoning Interpretation: An "official zoning interpretation" is a
recorded decision on the meaning and/or application of the development
standards, allowed use regulations, or other standards contained within this
title.
   C.   Content Of Official Zoning Interpretation: Official zoning
interpretations shall be prepared by the planning director, in writing, and

maintain a complete record of all official interpretations available for public
review, indexed by the chapter number of this title that is the subject of the
interpretation.
   F.   Codification Of Official Zoning Interpretations: To the extent
practical, official zoning interpretations shall be incorporated into this
title by amendment as soon as is practical. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-2B-9: HOME OCCUPATION PERMIT:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of the home occupation permit is to provide a
process for the review and permitting of home occupations prior to their

ministerial approval that is conducted to ensure home occupations are conducted
consistent with the development standards of section
9-4D-5, "Home Occupations", of this title.
      2.   Major Home Occupation Permit: A major home occupation permit is
intended for the review and discretionary approval of those home occupations

surrounding residential neighborhood. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
   C.   Approval Authority: The designated approving authority for minor home
occupation permits shall be the planning director. The designated approving
authority for major home occupation permits shall be the planning commission.

complies with all of the following findings:
      1.   The proposed home occupation is consistent with the general plan,
any applicable specific plan, and all applicable provisions of this title
(e.g., section
9-4D-5 of this title); and
      2.   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the home occupation
applied for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case (location,
size, design, and operating characteristics), be detrimental to the health,
safety, peace, morals, comfort, or general welfare of persons residing or
working in the neighborhood of such use or to the general welfare of the city.
   F.   Postapproval Implementation: Requirements for implementation of an
approved home occupation permit shall be provided as follows:
      1.   Minor Home Occupation Permit: A minor home occupation permit is
ministerial in nature. As such, the planning director may not impose conditions
on the issuance of the permit. However, the applicant may be provided with a
list of items necessary for compliance and conformance with this title and the
general plan.

performance standards if the following findings are made:
      1.   There are special circumstances applicable to the property (e.g.,
location, shape, size, surroundings, topography, or other conditions), so that
the strict application of the required performance standards for this home
occupation permit is not necessary to preserve the residential nature of the
neighborhood;
      2.   Alternative performance standards that protect and preserve the
residential nature of the neighborhood have been included as conditions of
approval;
      3.   Granting the home occupation will not adversely affect the interest
of the public or the interest of residents and property owners in the vicinity
of the premises in question; and
      4.   The home occupation permit is consistent with the general plan, any
applicable specific plan or development agreement, and the intent of this
title. (Ord. 2014-06, 10-21-2014)

   A.   Purpose: The purpose of an administrative use permit is to allow for
the individual review of land uses having unique or unusual site development
features or operating characteristics to ensure consistency with this title and
the general plan. These land uses benefit from focused, administrative review
outside of the general business license and zoning clearance process.
   B.   Applicability: An administrative use permit is required prior to the
establishment of any use for which an administrative use permit is required by

specific plans, and all applicable provisions of this title; and
      2.   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use applied for
will not, under the circumstances of the particular case (location, size,
design, and operating characteristics), be detrimental to the health, safety,
peace, morals, comfort, or general welfare of persons residing or working in
the neighborhood of such use or to the general welfare of the city.
   F.   Postapproval Implementation: An administrative use permit is
ministerial in nature. As such, the planning director may not impose conditions
on the issuance of the permit. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)

flexibility in project design with regard to specific development standards.
   B.   Applicability: To achieve more flexible standards, the designated
approving authority may grant minor deviations to the building height, setback,
lot coverage, and parking provisions, not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the
respective development standards in the underlying zoning district for the
subject parcel. All other deviations require approval of a variance
application. Minor deviations do not apply to the use of property.
   C.   Approval Authority: The designated approving authority for minor
deviations is the planning director.
   D.   Process: No public hearing or notice is required for a minor deviation.
   E.   Approval Findings: A minor deviation shall be granted only when the
designated approving authority makes all of the following findings:
      1.   The deviation(s) improves the site, architectural, and/or overall
project design; and
      2.   The deviation(s) is materially consistent with the project and is
compatible with surrounding uses and structures.
   F.   Postapproval Implementation: A minor deviation is ministerial in
nature. As such, the Planning Director may not impose conditions on the
issuance of the permit. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-2B-12: SITE PLAN AND ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of site plan and architectural review is for the
review of the design and layout of new development in the City to ensure that
it is consistent with the regulations of this title, other relevant titles in
the Lemoore Municipal Code, and all relevant City policies, requirements, and
development standards that would apply to the project prior to the issuance of
subsequent permits, such as discretionary actions required by the City Zoning
Ordinance or City Subdivision Ordinance, improvement plans, and building
permits. It is the intent that site plan and architectural review be a
ministerial action limited to review of the project development project for
conformance with City of Lemoore ordinances, policies, requirements, and
development standards.
   B.   Applicability: Site plan and architectural review shall be required
prior to the issuance of any ministerial building permits or site improvement
plans and prior to any discretionary action of corresponding development
applications (e.g., conditional use permit, variance). Site plan and
architectural review may serve as the preliminary application for housing
development projects seeking vesting rights pursuant to SB 330, the Housing
Crisis Act of 2019.
      1.   Review Required: Site plan and architectural review is required for
all of the following activities:
         a.   New nonresidential or mixed-use developments;
         b.   Nonresidential building additions greater than 1,000 square feet;
         c.   Conceptual plan for a mixed-use center as required by chapter 7,
“Mixed Use Development Standards”, of this title.
         d.   New multi-family residential developments of more than two units
(e.g., apartments, condominiums, townhomes)
         e.   The design and layout of new residential subdivisions as part of
the tentative subdivision map process as provided in title 8, chapter 7, “Land
Division”, of the Municipal Code;
         f.   Demolition or exterior alterations and additions to
nonresidential buildings that are more than seventy five (75) years old.
      2.   Exemptions: The following activities are specifically exempt from
site plan and architectural review:
         a.   Single-family residential homes and duplexes on an existing lot;
         b.   Additions to or the exterior remodels of single-family
residential homes within normal setbacks;
         c.   Accessory structures consistent with the provisions of section
9-4D-18, “Residential Accessory Structures”, of this title;
         d.   Changes to the exterior facade of existing buildings;
         e.   Painting existing buildings in the DMX zoning districts with
historic color palettes as described in subsection
9-6-4C, “Colors And Painting”, of this title;
         f.   Repairs and maintenance to the site or structure that do not add
to, enlarge, or expand the area occupied by the land use, or the floor area of
the structure and that employ the same materials and design as the original
construction;
         g.   Interior alterations that do not increase the gross floor area
within the structure, or change/expand the permitted use of the structure
(including solar collectors); and
         h.   Construction, alteration, or maintenance by a public utility or
public agency of underground or overhead utilities intended to service existing
or nearby approved developments.
         i.   Nonresidential building additions of 1,000 square feet of gross
floor area or less.
   C.   Approval Authority: The designated approval authority for site plan and
architectural design review shall be the Community Development Director.
   D.   Process: The applicant shall provide a completed application on a form
provided by the City, a site plan and, if new non-residential buildings or
multi-family dwellings are proposed, an elevation plan. No public hearing or
notice is required for a site plan and architectural review. Site plan and
architectural review is a ministerial process conducted by City staff to
determine compliance with existing City of Lemoore ordinances, policies,
requirements, and development standards and is therefore exempt from the
requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) per State CEQA
Guidelines Section 15268.
   E.   Approval: A site plan and architectural review permit, or any
modification thereto, shall be granted only when the designated approving
authority finds that the proposed project is consistent with the objectives of
the general plan and complies with applicable zoning regulations, specific plan
provisions, and policies and improvement standards adopted by the City, or that
a general plan amendment or zoning amendment is going to be subsequently
applied for by the developer. If the site plan submitted requires major changes
before this finding can be made, the developer may be required to make changes
and submit the site plan again.
   F.   Post approval Implementation: A site plan and architectural design
review permit is ministerial in nature. As such, the Planning Director may not
impose discretionary conditions on the issuance of the permit. If the proposed
development project requires approval of a discretionary action after
completion of the site and architectural design review process, conditions of
approval can be placed on the discretionary approval.
   G.   Appeals. If the applicant disagrees with the interpretation or
application of a City ordinance, policy, requirement, or development standard,
they may appeal the interpretation per procedures in Section
9-2A-7 and
9-2A-8.
   H.   Expiration. A site plan and architectural design review permit shall
expire one (1) year after issuance unless an application for a related
discretionary approval or a building permit is submitted. Upon written request
by the applicant prior to expiration, the Community Development Director may
extend the expiration for an additional one (1) year. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014;
amd. Ord. 2018-03, 5-15-2018; Ord. 2023-10, 9-19-2023)
9-2B-13: SIGN PROGRAM:
   A.   Purpose: A sign program provides a process for the City's review of,
and decisions related to, requests for signs for multi-tenant projects. The
intent of a sign program is to allow for the integration of a project's signs
with the design of the structures to achieve a unified architectural statement
and to approve common sign regulations for multi-tenant projects. No deviations
from City sign standards are allowed through a uniform sign program.
   B.   Applicability: A sign program shall be required for all new multi-
tenant shopping centers, office parks, and other multi- tenant, mixed use, or
otherwise integrated developments of three (3) or more separate tenants/uses
that share buildings, public spaces, landscape, and/or parking facilities.
   C.   Specific Application Requirements: As part of the application, the
applicant shall submit a draft sign program that shall include criteria for
building attached signs, freestanding building signs, and the integrated
development itself to establish consistency of sign type, location, center
logo, and/or letter height, lines of copy, illumination, and construction
details of signs for the project.
   D.   Approval Authority: The designated approving authority for sign
programs shall be the planning director.
   E.   Public Hearing And Notice: No public hearing or notice is required for
a sign program.

only when the designated approving authority makes all of the following
findings:
      1.   That the proposed sign program is consistent with the development
standards for signs as provided in chapter 5, article F, "Signage", of this
title; and
      2.   The design, location, and scale of proposed signs for the integrated
development are in keeping with the architectural character of the development.
   G.   Postapproval Implementation: A sign program is ministerial in nature.
As such, the planning director may not impose conditions on the issuance of the
permit. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-2B-14: CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of a conditional use permit is for the individual
review of uses, typically having unique or unusual site development features or
operating characteristics. A use permit is intended to ensure compatibility
with surrounding areas and uses where such uses are deemed essential or
desirable to the various elements or objectives of the general plan.
   B.   Applicability: A conditional use permit is required prior to the
establishment of any use for which a conditional use permit is required by this
title.
   C.   Approval Authority: The planning commission shall be the designated
approving authority for conditional use permits.
   D.   Public Hearing And Notice: Public hearing and notice are required for a
conditional use permit pursuant to section
9-2A-6, "Public Notice, Hearings, And Decisions", of this chapter.
   E.   Approval Findings: A conditional use permit shall be granted only when
the designated approving authority determines that the proposed use or activity
complies with all of the following findings:
      1.   The proposed use is consistent with the general plan, any applicable
specific plans, and all applicable provisions of this title;
      2.   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use applied for
will not, under the circumstances of the particular case (location, size,
design, and operating characteristics), be detrimental to the health, safety,
peace, morals, comfort, or general welfare of persons residing or working in
the neighborhood of such use or to the general welfare of the city;
      3.   The site of the proposed use is physically suitable for the type,
density, and intensity of the use and related structures being proposed; and
      4.   It will not be contrary to the specific intent clauses, development
regulations, or performance standards established for the zoning district in
which it is located. The proposed use and related structures are compatible
with other land uses, transportation, and service facilities in the vicinity.
   F.   Conditions Of Approval: The designated approving authority may impose
conditions and/or require guarantees in order to ensure compliance with this
title and to prevent adverse or detrimental impact to the surrounding
neighborhood. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-2B-15: MAJOR SITE PLAN AND ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW:
(Rep. by Ord. 2023-10, 9-19-2023)
9-2B-16: VARIANCE:
   A.   Purpose And Applicability: In accordance with California Government
Code section 65906, variances provide relief from the strict application of
development standards and provisions of this title if specified findings can be
made. A variance from the zoning code may not be granted to:
      1.   Allow a land use not otherwise permitted in the zoning district;
      2.   Increase the maximum allowed residential density except as allowed
by state law;
      3.   Waive or reduce parking requirements by more than thirty percent
(30%); or
      4.   Waive or modify a procedural requirement.

shall be the planning commission. The planning director provides a
recommendation and the planning commission approves, conditionally approves, or
denies the variance in accordance with the requirements of this title.
   C.   Public Hearing And Notice: Public hearing and notice are required for a
variance pursuant to section
9-2A-6, "Public Notice, Hearings, And Decisions", of this chapter.
   D.   Approval Findings: The approving authority may approve and/or modify
any variance application in whole or in part, with or without conditions, only
if the applicant can demonstrate that the circumstances of their particular
case can justify making all of the following findings:
      1.   There are special circumstances applicable to the property (e.g.,
location, shape, size, surroundings, topography, or other conditions), so that
the strict application of this zoning code denies the property owner privileges
enjoyed by other property owners in the vicinity and within the same zoning
district;
      2.   Granting the variance is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of substantial property rights enjoyed by other property owners in
the same vicinity and zoning district and denied to the property owner for
which the variance is sought;
      3.   Granting the variance will not adversely affect the interests of the
public or the interests of residents and property owners in the vicinity of the
premises in question; and
      4.   The variance is consistent with the general plan, any applicable
specific plan or development agreement, and the intent of this title.
   E.   Conditions Of Approval: In approving a variance, the designated
approving authority:
      1.   Shall impose conditions to ensure that the variance does not grant
special privileges inconsistent with the limitation on other properties in the
vicinity and the zoning district in which the property is located;
      2.   May impose any reasonable conditions (e.g., the placement, height of
structures, buffers, landscaping and maintenance, off site improvements,
performance guarantees, screening, surfacing, hours of operation) to ensure
that the approval complies with the findings required by this section. (Ord.

application to the city for a determination whether or not the public
convenience and necessity would be served by the granting of such license.
   B.   Approving Authority: Determinations of whether public convenience or
necessity would be served by issuance of those alcoholic beverage licenses
specified in paragraph (b)(2) of section 23958.4 of the Business And
Professions Code shall be made by the planning commission.
   C.   Process: A public hearing before the designated approving authority
shall be required prior to determining if the application provides for the
public convenience or necessity. Notice of the hearing shall be provided as
described in section
9-2A-6, "Public Notice, Hearings, And Decisions", of this chapter.
   D.   Review Of Applications: The designated approving authority shall review
the application, along with all information submitted by the applicant, as well
as the recommendations of the chief of police, the planning director, and other
departments of the city. The designated approving authority shall consider all
other relevant documents and other written information submitted by the
applicant or other interested persons, shall receive, hear and consider
relevant oral and written testimony by the applicant and other interested
persons; and shall consider any other information, including, without
limitation, written or oral testimony, that the designated approving authority
deems necessary to make the determination of public convenience or necessity.

9-2B-18: HIGHWAY ORIENTED SIGN PERMIT:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of the highway oriented sign permit is to provide
a process for the review approval of commercial signs that are oriented to the
highway as defined in this title. The intent of review is to ensure that the
siting, size, and design of a highway oriented sign is in keeping with the
character of the surrounding environment, that it does not create an unsafe
condition for motorists, and that it does not create a public nuisance.
   B.   Applicability: A highway oriented sign permit shall be obtained prior
to the establishment of a "highway oriented sign" as defined in this title and
as provided in chapter 5, article F, "Signage", of this title.
   C.   Approval Authority: The designated approving authority for a highway
oriented sign permit is the planning director.

designated approving authority shall make all of the following findings:
      1.   The proposed sign is consistent with the general plan and all
applicable provisions of this title;
      2.   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the highway oriented
sign will not, under the circumstances of the particular case (location, size,
design, and operating characteristics), be detrimental to the health, safety,
peace, morals, comfort, or general welfare of persons residing or working in
the neighborhood of such use, or the general welfare of the city;
      3.   Should the applicant request, and the approving authority grant,
additional height beyond that allowed in subsection
9-5F-5D, "Highway Oriented Signs", of this title to a maximum of eighty feet
(80'), the approving authority shall also make the following additional
findings:
         a.   That the additional height is necessary to ensure safe viewing
from the highway; and
         b.   That approval of the additional height will not be contrary to
the specific intent of the signage regulations established in chapter 5,
article F, "Signage", of this title.
      4.   Should the applicant request, and the approving authority grant, a
reduced spacing of signs than that required in subsection
9-5F-5D, "Highway Oriented Signs", of this title, the approving authority shall
also make the following additional finding:
         a.   The reduced distance between highway oriented signs will not
cause a safety impact or create sign clutter contrary to a small town
atmosphere. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-2B-19: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of the planned unit development is to provide a
process to allow diversity in the relationship between buildings and open
spaces to create interesting physical environments and to maximize the
development potential of underutilized or problematic land areas. This land use
entitlement is intended to demonstrate that the development plan with any
proposed deviations is consistent with the general plan and will result in a
quality project that is compatible with surroundings, preserves site resources,
minimizes hazards, and provides a public benefit.
   B.   Applicability: To qualify for a planned unit development designation,
projects must include developed or undeveloped property with one or more
contiguous parcels totaling a minimum of two (2) acres in size. Projects of
less than two (2) acres may be considered when determined that the development
area is underutilized (e.g., infill, reuse, redevelopment) and that the
surrounding area will be better served by the project.
   C.   Approving Authority: The designated approving authority for a planned
unit development is the planning commission.

adjacent property, and will not materially impair the purposes of this title or
the public interest.
   G.   Delineation Of Planned Unit Development Areas: On the zoning map, a
planned unit development shall be delineated as an overlay zoning district and
shall be listed in this title as provided in chapter 9, article B, "Planned
Unit Development (PUD) Overlay Zoning Districts", of this title. (Ord. 2013-05,
2-6-2014)
9-2B-20: SPECIFIC PLAN:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of a specific plan is to provide a vehicle for
implementing the city's general plan on an area specific basis. The specific
plan is intended to serve as a regulatory document, consistent with the general
plan. In the event there is an inconsistency or conflict between an adopted
specific plan and comparable provisions of this title, the specific plan shall
prevail. This section is consistent with California Government Code section

manner similar to that of any other zoning district, except that each specific
plan zoned area shall also bear a name, number, symbol, or other delineation,
as determined by the planning director, which distinguishes it from other
specific plan zones, base zoning districts, or overlay zones. The assignment of
the specific plan zone designation serves to provide a reference to the
corresponding specific plan zoning document adopted by ordinance of the city
council. Applicable zoning regulations and standards applicable to the land
area are provided in the specific plan zones document, as adopted by reference
in this title.
   I.   Application Of Specific Plan Development Requirements: Where conditions
of the specific plan differ from the zoning code development standards, the
conditions of the specific plan shall apply. Where a standard is not addressed

ARTICLE C. NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND PROPERTIES
SECTION:
9-2C-1: Purpose And Applicability
9-2C-2: Declaration Of Nonconforming
9-2C-3: Continuation
9-2C-4: Maintenance
9-2C-5: Modification And Expansion
9-2C-6: Abandonment Or Discontinuance Of Nonconforming Use
9-2C-7: Restoration Of Damaged Uses And Structures
9-2C-8: Nonconforming Signs
9-2C-1: PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY:
This article establishes special regulations for nonconforming land uses and
structures that were lawful before the adoption or amendment of this zoning
code, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted differently under
the current terms of this zoning code or future amendments. It is the intent of
these regulations to allow the continuation of nonconformities under limited
conditions outlined herein and reconstruction in the event of natural disaster.
(Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-2C-2: DECLARATION OF NONCONFORMING:
   A.   Nonconforming Use: Any use that is not permitted under the provisions
of this title (or any amendments thereto) but was legally in place, with
licenses and permits in current status, at the effective date of the ordinance
codified in this article or any subsequent ordinance, shall be deemed to be a
nonconforming use.
   B.   Nonconforming Structure: Any structure, including signs, that is not
permitted under the provisions of this title (or any amendments thereto) but
was legally in place, with licenses and permits in current status, at the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this article or any subsequent
ordinance, shall be deemed to be a nonconforming structure.
   C.   Nonconforming Property: Any property or lot that is less than the
minimum lot size required by this title, or has less than the minimum lot
dimensions required by this title, shall be deemed to be a nonconforming
property.
   D.   Legally Nonconforming: A use, structure, or property shall be deemed to
be legal nonconforming if the use, structure, or property was legally
established prior to the change in this title that made it nonconforming. (Ord.
2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-2C-3: CONTINUATION:
   A.   Use: A nonconforming use may continue to operate in perpetuity, be
transferred, or be sold, provided that the use shall not be enlarged or
intensified, nor be expanded to occupy a greater area than it lawfully occupied
before becoming nonconforming. Likewise, plans for any use approved as of the
date the ordinance codified in this chapter becomes effective may be carried
out as approved. Any extension of such approval for which the applicant was
entitled to apply as of the effective date may be granted according to the
regulations in effect prior to the effective date; if granted, such extension
will be considered the same as an approval granted before the effective date.
The person asserting the nonconforming use must present evidence that the use
existed before the enactment of the zoning code provision prohibiting the use.
   B.   Structure: A structure lawfully occupying a site on the effective date
of this title, or of amendments hereto, which does not conform with the
standards of coverage, front yard, side yards, rear yard, or distances between
structures prescribed in the regulations for the district in which the
structure is located shall be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and may be
used and maintained, except as otherwise provided in this article.
   C.   Property: Except as otherwise provided in this article, a property or
site having an area, frontage, width, or depth less than the minimum prescribed
for the district in which the site is located, which is shown on a duly
approved and recorded subdivision map, or for which a deed or valid contract of
sale was of record prior to the adoption of this title, and which had a legal
area, frontage, width, and depth at the time that the subdivision map, deed, or
contract of sale was recorded, may be used for any permitted use listed for the
district in which the site is located, but shall be subject to all other
regulations for such district. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-2C-4: MAINTENANCE:
A nonconforming structure or site may be maintained or improved as follows:
   A.   Maintenance And Repair: A nonconforming structure may be maintained and
repaired. Maintenance may include repair work necessary to keep the building or
structure in sound condition, but maintenance shall not include the replacement
of a building or structure.
   B.   Seismic Retrofitting And Building Code Compliance: Repairs,
alterations, or reconstruction to reinforce unreinforced masonry structures or
to comply with building code requirements shall be allowed, provided that the
work is exclusively to comply with applicable earthquake safety standards and
the building code.
   C.   Safety Improvements: Structural alteration of a nonconforming structure
to improve safety or to reduce fire hazard. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-2C-5: MODIFICATION AND EXPANSION:
   A.   Use: A nonconforming use shall not be expanded or modified.
   B.   Structure: No nonconforming structure shall be altered, enlarged or
reconstructed so as to increase the discrepancy between existing conditions and
the standards of coverage, front yard, side yards, rear yard, height of
structure, or distances between structures prescribed in the regulations for
the district in which the structure is located. No nonconforming structure
shall be moved unless the new location shall conform to the standards
prescribed in the regulations prescribed for the district in which the
structure is located. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-2C-6: ABANDONMENT OR DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING USE:
   A.   Abandonment Or Discontinuance Generally: Whenever a nonconforming use
has become abandoned or discontinued for a continuous period of twelve (12)
months, the nonconforming use shall not be reestablished and the use of the
site or structure thereafter shall be in conformity with the regulations for
the district in which it is located; provided, however, that a similar type
nonconforming use may be established within the twelve (12) month period. A
determination that a use has been abandoned requires both: 1) evidence of an
intention to abandon, and 2) an act or failure to act which shows or implies
that the owner does not continue to claim or retain an interest in the
nonconforming use. Evidence may include, but is not limited to, removal of
equipment, furniture, machinery, structures, or other components of the
nonconforming use, disconnected or discontinued utilities, or no business
records to document continued operation. Maintenance of a valid business
license shall of itself not be considered a continuation of the use. Without
further action by the city, any subsequent use of the site or structure shall
comply with all of the regulations of the applicable zoning district and all
other applicable provisions of this zoning code.
It is the intent of this section to prohibit the addition of a new
nonconforming use with functions and characteristics which clearly are
different from those of the preexisting nonconforming use. The term "similar
type" means similarity in type and intensity of operations or activities and
shall not be construed so as to allow uses which would be more incompatible
with conforming uses within the vicinity. As examples, one type of business use
may be permitted to replace another type of business use, and one type of
contracting service may be allowed to replace another type of contracting
service; provided, that such uses are of same or less general intensity as to
traffic generation and other operational characteristics associated with the
previous nonconforming use.
   B.   Extension Of Residential Uses In Nonresidential Zoning Districts: The
city recognizes that there are existing single- family residential uses in
nonresidential zoning districts. It is the intent of the city that, in the
future, property owners will proceed with development of their property
consistent with the general plan and this title at such time as they choose.
Until such time, should an existing legal nonconforming single-family
residential dwelling in a nonresidential zoning district become vacated for
more than twelve (12) months, the dwelling may be reoccupied upon issuance of a
temporary use permit as provided in section
9-2B-4, "Temporary Use Permit", of this chapter.
   C.   Extension Of Nonconforming Period: A legal nonconforming use may be
reestablished after twelve (12) months of discontinuance upon approval of a
conditional use permit as provided in section
9-2B-14, "Conditional Use Permit", of this chapter. Approval of the conditional
use permit shall be conditioned upon the physical improvement of the property
to bring it into conformance with the requirements of the general plan and this
title, including, but not limited to, necessary right of way dedications and
streetscape improvements. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-2C-7: RESTORATION OF DAMAGED USES AND STRUCTURES:
Whenever a nonconforming use or a nonconforming structure is damaged or
destroyed by fire or other calamity, or by an act of God, or by public enemy,
the following standards shall apply. The extent of damage to any structure
shall be determined by the building official and shall be based upon the ratio
of the estimated cost of restoring the use or structure to its condition prior
to such damage to the estimated cost of duplicating the entire structure as it
existed prior thereto.
   A.   Less Than Seventy Five Percent Damage: To the extent that less than
seventy five percent (75%) of the structure is damaged or destroyed, the
structure may be restored and the nonconforming use may be resumed, provided
that restoration is started within one year and diligently pursued to
completion.
   B.   At Least Seventy Five Percent Damage: To the extent that seventy five
percent (75%) or more of the structure is damaged or destroyed, or shall be
voluntarily razed, or shall be required by law to be razed, the structure shall
not be restored except in full conformity with the regulations for the district
in which it is located, and the nonconforming structure or use shall not be
resumed. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-2C-8: NONCONFORMING SIGNS:
Standards for nonconforming signs are provided in subsection
9-5F-2E, "Nonconforming Signs", of this title. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
CHAPTER 3
ZONING DISTRICTS AND MAP
SECTION:
9-3-1: Purpose
9-3-2: Zoning Districts Established
9-3-3: Map Established
9-3-1: PURPOSE:
This chapter establishes the framework of zoning districts within the city of
Lemoore and their relationships to the city's general plan land use categories.
This chapter also establishes the zoning map as the official designation of
zoning district boundaries. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-3-2: ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED:
Zoning districts are established in order to classify, regulate, designate, and
distribute the uses of land and buildings; to regulate and restrict the height
and bulk of buildings; to regulate the area of yards and other open spaces
around buildings; and to regulate the density of population.
The city of Lemoore is divided into zoning districts that are grouped into two
(2) categories: a) base zoning districts, and b) overlay zoning districts.
These districts conform to and implement the city’s general plan land use
categories as described in table
9-3-2, “Zoning Districts”, of this section. Chapter 4, “Land Uses”, of this
title identifies the allowed uses and requirements for planning entitlements.
Chapter 5, article B, “Development Standards By Zoning District”, of this title
identifies development standards unique to each zoning district.
   A.   Base Zoning Districts: The base zoning district is the primary zoning
district that applies to a property. Every parcel throughout the city has a
base zoning district that establishes the primary land use type, density,
intensity, and site development regulations. Base districts are grouped into
five (5) categories as follows:
      1.   Residential zoning districts;
      2.   Special purpose zoning districts;
      3.   Mixed use zoning districts;
      4.   Office, commercial, and industrial zoning districts; and
      5.   Specific plan zoning districts.
   B.   Overlay Zoning Districts: The overlay zoning districts function to
supplement the base zoning district for one or more of the following purposes:
      1.   To allow more flexibility from the standard provisions of the
underlying base zone;
      2.   When special provisions are needed to protect unique site features
or implement location specific provisions; and/or
      3.   To specify a particular standard or guideline for an area.
   In the event of a conflict between the regulations of the base zoning
district and the overlay zoning district, the provisions of the overlay zoning
district shall apply.

9-3-3: MAP ESTABLISHED:
The city council hereby adopts the city of Lemoore zoning map (hereafter
referred to as the zoning map) as the official designation of zoning district
boundaries on real property within the city. The zoning map shall be regulated
as set forth below.
   A.   Incorporated By Reference: The zoning map is hereby incorporated into
this zoning code by reference as though it were fully included.
   B.   Map Amendments: Amendments to the zoning map shall follow the zoning
amendment process established in chapter 2, article B, "Planning Permits And
Entitlements", of this title.
   C.   Relationship To General Plan And Other Plans: The zoning map shall
implement and shall be consistent with the city's adopted general plan. The
zoning map shall be specifically consistent with the general plan land use plan
and the roadway sizing diagram, and any adopted specific plans, special
planning areas, or master plans.
   D.   Zoning District Symbol: Zoning districts shall be illustrated on the
zoning map as follows:
      1.   Each base zoning district shall be described on the zoning map by
use of its identified zoning district symbol, as listed in section
9-3-2,
table 9-3-2, "Zoning Districts", of this chapter.
      2.   Each specific plan zoning district shall be delineated with a name,
number, symbol, or other delineation, as determined by the planning director,
which distinguishes it from other special purpose zones, base zoning districts,
or overlay zones. The assignment of the special purpose designation serves to
provide a reference to the corresponding special purpose zoning document (e.g.,
specific plan) adopted by ordinance of the city council.
      3.   Overlay zoning districts shall be designated by their representative
symbol in conjunction with the base zoning district in a format determined by
the planning director (e.g., RLD-PUD).
   E.   Zoning Map Interpretation: If there is uncertainty about the location
of any zoning district boundary shown on the zoning map, the precise location
of the boundary shall be determined by the planning director as follows:
      1.   The boundaries of a zoning district shall be the centerlines of
streets, alleys, railroad right of way, drainage channel, or other watercourse,
or the parcel lines of real property, unless otherwise shown. Where a
district's boundaries approximately follow centerlines or plot lines, those
lines shall be interpreted as the district boundaries.
      2.   If a district boundary divides a parcel and the boundary line
location is not specified by distances printed on the zoning map, the location
of the boundary shall be determined by using the scale appearing on the zoning
map. Except as otherwise provided by this code through integrated development,
each portion of the property shall be developed to the standards and allowed
use provisions of the applied zoning district and any applied overlay zone(s).
      3.   Where the street layout on the ground or the parcel lines differ
from such layout or lines shown on the zoning map, the planning director shall
determine the exact boundary and the map shall be amended to conform to the
layout on the ground.
      4.   Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned,
the property that was formerly in the street or alley shall be included within
the zoning district of the adjoining property on either side of the centerline
of the vacated or abandoned street or alley, unless the abandonment shifts from
the centerline, which it will then follow. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)

LAND USES
ARTICLE A.  USE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
SECTION:
9-4A-1: Purpose
9-4A-2: Classification Of Land Uses
9-4A-3: Allowed Land Uses
9-4A-4: Temporary Uses
9-4A-5: Description Of Land Uses
9-4A-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this article is to establish the system for classifying land
uses within the city. This article defines the various land uses referred to
elsewhere in this chapter. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-4A-2: CLASSIFICATION OF LAND USES:
Land uses listed in this article and throughout this title have been grouped
into general categories on the basis of common function, product, or
compatibility characteristics. These allowed use categories are called use
classifications. Use classifications describe one or more uses having similar
characteristics but do not list every use or activity that may appropriately be
within the classification. Each land use is described in article B, "Allowed
Uses And Required Entitlements", of this chapter.
   A.   The following rules apply to use classifications:
      1.   Special Use Regulations: Additional use regulations for special land
uses are listed in article D, "Special Use Standards", of this chapter.
      2.   Uses Not Listed: Land uses that are not listed in the zoning
district tables are not allowed, except as otherwise provided for in this
title.
      3.   Illegal Uses: No use that is illegal under local, state, or federal
law shall be allowed in any zoning district within the city.
      4.   Specific Plan Zoning District: When a property is located within a
specific plan zoning district, the allowed use provisions of that specific plan
zoning district shall govern. If a specific plan zoning district refers back
to, utilizes, or defers to one or more of the city's base zoning districts, the
allowed use provisions in those base zoning districts shall apply. If there are
any conflicts between a base zoning district and a specific plan zoning
district, the specific plan zoning district shall prevail.
      5.   Overlay Zoning District: When a property is located within an
overlay zoning district, the allowed use provisions of that overlay zoning
district shall prevail. When an overlay zoning district is silent on allowed
use provisions, it defers the allowed use provisions to the base zoning

the vicinity of the site.
   F.   Changes In Use: After approval, a live-work facility shall not be
converted to entirely residential use, nor shall the ratio of living space to
working space be changed, unless authorized through administrative use permit
approval. As part of the approval of the administrative use permit, the
designated approving authority must find that the exclusive residential use
will not impair the ability of nonresidential uses on and adjacent to the site
to continue operating because of potential health or safety concerns or
nuisance complaints raised by the exclusively residential use and/or its
occupants. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)

   A.   Purpose and intent. This section is intended to meet the requirements
of State law in providing for accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and junior
accessory dwelling units (JADUs) as required by and in compliance with
Government Code Sections 65852.2 and 65852.22, as either may be amended from
time to time. The standards established by this section shall be interpreted
and applied consistent with the standards set forth in Government Code Sections

will be counted for purposes of identifying adequate sites for housing in the
City’s housing element, as provided in Government Code Section 65583.1(a), and
to reduce the City’s share of the regional housing need, as provided in
Government Code Section 65583.1(d).
   C.   Unless otherwise stated in this section, the requirements and standards
of this Title that apply to the lot and the primary dwelling shall apply to any
ADU and/or JADU, including height, setback, and landscaping. All Fire and
Building Code requirements that apply to detached dwellings and accessory
structures generally shall apply to ADUs and JADUs.

operations to prevent safety, traffic, and health hazards, as well as to
preserve the peace, safety, and welfare of the City and its residents and to
prevent the unregulated proliferation of too many vendors near one (1)
location, thus negatively impacting traffic and pedestrian safety.
   B.   Applicability: The provisions of this section shall apply to all
semipermanent mobile food vendors as described in this chapter. This includes
any vehicle as defined in section 670 of the California Vehicle Code, which is

Notes
1 1. HSC § 113700 et seq.
9-4D-14: SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES:
   A.   Purpose And Intent: It is the purpose and intent of this section to
regulate sexually oriented businesses, including the regulation of live nude
and live seminude entertainment, in order to promote the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent any deleterious location and concentration of
sexually oriented businesses within the city, thereby reducing or eliminating
the adverse secondary effects from such sexually oriented businesses. The city
council finds that among these secondary effects are increased incidents of
unlawful conduct and disorderly behavior, generating a disproportionate demand
for police responses; depreciated property values; vacancy problems; blighted
conditions; and interference with neighbors' enjoyment of property due to
debris, noise, vandalism, and depreciated property values. The city council in
adopting this section takes legislative notice of the existence and content of
the following studies that substantiate the adverse secondary effects of
sexually oriented businesses: 1) Garden Grove, California, 1991; 2) city of
Austin, Texas, May 1986; 3) city of Los Angeles, California, June 1977; 4) city
of St. Paul, Minnesota, 1987, and supp., 1988; and 5) "Final Report Of The
Attorney General's Commission On Pornography", 1986. The provisions of this
section have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any nonobscene communicative materials, including
nonobscene sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor
the effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to nonobscene
sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment, or to deny access
by the distributors and exhibitors of nonobscene sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor is it the
effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material or material harmful to minors.

9-5A-4: General Zoning District Development Standards
9-5A-1: PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY:
The purpose of this article is to provide development standards related to all
properties within Lemoore regardless of underlying zoning designation or land
use. The purpose of this article is to establish development standards for lot
area, allowed density, building setbacks, height, and lot coverage as
appropriate for each of the city's base zoning districts. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-
2014)
9-5A-2: HEIGHT LIMITS MEASUREMENT AND EXCEPTIONS:
   A.   Height Measurement: The height of a structure shall be measured as the
vertical distance from the finish grade of the site to an imaginary plane
located the allowed number of feet above and parallel to the finish grade.

      2.   Wireless telecommunication facilities height limits are established
in section
9-4D-15, "Wireless Telecommunication Facilities", of this title.
      3.   Fire or parapet walls in nonresidential zoning districts may extend
up to four feet (4') above the allowable height limit of the structure. (Ord.
2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-5A-3: SETBACK DETERMINATION AND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Purpose And Applicability:
      1.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish requirements
for yard areas, setbacks, and encroachments. These requirements, in conjunction
with other applicable requirements, are intended to ensure open areas around
primary structures maintain clear visibility for traffic safety and pedestrian
access, buffer between various land uses, establish natural and visual light,
establish airspace privacy, and provide for landscaping and recreation areas.
      2.   Applicability: The rules for measurement of setbacks, yard areas,
and encroachments apply to all properties in the city and shall be in addition
to any other applicable development standards and measurement rules contained
elsewhere within this title.
   B.   General Yard And Setback Regulations:
      1.   Required Yard Area: Except as otherwise specified in this title,
required yard areas shall be kept free of buildings and structures.
      2.   Exclusivity Of Required Yard Area: No yard or other open space
provided around any building for the purpose of complying with this title shall
be considered as providing a yard or open space for any other building or
structure.
      3.   Vertical Clearance: Except as otherwise provided in this title,
every part of a required yard shall be open from its lowest point to the sky
unobstructed. Building overhangs, bay windows, and other such elements may
intrude as permitted, pursuant to subsection D, "Allowed Encroachments Or
Projections Into Required Yards", of this section.
      4.   Corner Lots: In the case of a lot abutting two (2) or more streets,
the main buildings and accessory buildings shall be erected so as not to
encroach upon the required front and street side yards.
      5.   Double Frontage Lots: Where a double frontage lot has a depth of one
hundred twenty five feet (125') or more, such lot may be treated as two (2)
lots for the purpose of determining yard setbacks.
      6.   Flag Lots: The front setback for a flag lot shall be measured from
the property line that abuts the access corridor, not from where the access
corridor meets the public street.
      7.   Lot Area, Depth, Width, And Setback Reduction: Where a lot area or a
lot width, depth, or setback has been reduced for an existing legally created
lot by not more than fifteen percent (15%) as a result of acquisition of
dedication for a highway, road, drain, or other public purpose, or as a result
of dedication pursuant to a condition of approval, the lot area or yard so
reduced may be included in determining compliance with lot area or yard
requirements in the same manner as if the acquisition or dedication has not
taken place.
      8.   Setback Measurement:
         a.   Generally: The setback of all buildings and structures shall be
measured at a right angle from the property line and determined by the exterior
boundaries of the streets and highways and their proposed widening and
extensions as indicated on the circulation plan, planned improvements map of
the city's general plan. Except as permitted in subsection D, "Allowed
Encroachments Or Projections Into Required Yards", of this section, or as
otherwise specified in this title for specific types of structures (e.g.,
accessory structures, signs) or through the issuance of a variance, structures
shall not extend beyond required setback lines.
         b.   Lots On Loop Out And Cul-De-Sac Streets: The minimum front
setback for lots on loop out and cul-de-sac streets shall be five feet (5')
less than the otherwise established minimum front setback.
   C.   Residential Yard And Setback Regulations: In addition to the setback
standards for single-family residential development listed in section
9-5A-4,
table 9-5A-4A, "Development Standards For Residential Zoning Districts", of
this article, the following standards shall apply:
      1.   Front Yard Variation: In any full block of lots established through
a planned unit development, the front yards may be varied so that the required
yard depth is not reduced more than five feet (5'), the average of all lots
equals the required yard depth, and the corner lot yards are not reduced.
      2.   Yard Exceptions For Infill Development: On a site situated between
sites improved with buildings where said buildings are set back less than the
minimum distance required by this subsection, the minimum front yard shall be
the average depth of the front yards on the improved sites immediately
adjoining the side lines of the site.
      3.   Deviations For Lots Recorded Prior To 1987: In case of irregular or
wedge shaped lots and lots in subdivisions recorded prior to 1987, the planning
director may grant setback deviations up to fifteen percent (15%) of the stated
requirements.
   D.   Allowed Encroachments Or Projections Into Required Yards: Bay windows,
cornices, canopies, attached decks and patios, eaves, fireplaces, roof
overhangs, and similar architectural features may encroach up to six feet (6')
into the required front yard and up to two feet (2') into all other required
yard areas. Patio covers attached to the main structure that are no taller than
16 feet may encroach up to five (5') into the required rear yard.

operations of equipment and facilities of adjoining parcels; and
      4.   Vibrations from temporary construction/demolition and vehicles that
leave the subject parcel (e.g., trucks, trains, and aircraft) are exempt from
the provisions of this section. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-5B-3: PROPERTY AND UTILITY IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish rules and
regulations that govern the installation of curbs, gutters, and sidewalks and
the undergrounding of all utilities in the City. These requirements, in
conjunction with other applicable requirements of this Code, are intended to
establish the applicability of said requirements of development in all new
industrial, commercial, residential subdivisions, and infill projects. This
section addresses the applicability of public utility improvements and is not
intended to supersede the City’s construction improvement standards.
   B.   Curbs, Gutters, And Sidewalks: Installation of curbs, gutters, and
sidewalks shall be required for all new development projects except rural
subdivisions. Such improvements shall be provided at the location determined by
the Public Works Director.
   C.   Underground Utility Requirements And Applicability: The requirements
listed below govern the undergrounding of utility lines, including telephone
facilities, electrical (less than 70 kVA), fire alarm conduits, street lighting
wiring, cable television and other wiring conduits, and similar facilities.
      1.   New Developments: In new development areas of the City, all on site
utilities shall be installed underground, if feasible.
      2.   Existing Developments: In existing areas of the City where utility
lines have not been undergrounded, the requirements listed below shall apply:
         a.   For an existing development that is either: 1) being
comprehensively redeveloped or 2) undergoing an addition or renovation of more
than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00), all utilities on the
project site shall be placed underground. All existing overhead utilities that
cross or abut the subject property are also required to be placed underground.
“Comprehensively redeveloped” shall mean any instance where a demolition permit
has or would be issued for a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the existing
building area.
         b.   For development with less than five hundred feet (500') of public
frontage or where utilities are located within a dedicated public utility
easement, the applicant may be permitted by the Public Works Director to pay an
in-lieu fee to be used by the City to underground utilities, provided the
project has been designed to the satisfaction of the Public Works Director and
the project is accessible and can be easily improved at such time as the
utilities are undergrounded.
         c.   Nothing in this section shall limit the ability of the City and
applicant to enter into a deferred improvement agreement for the conversion to
underground utilities at a later point in time.
         d.   When the city determines that undergrounding is impractical, an
in-lieu fee shall be paid. An in-lieu fee shall be based on the number and type
of utility lines and type of surface area being distributed and shall be paid
prior to the recordation of a final or parcel map for the subdivision, or the
issuance of any building permit, as applicable. The in-lieu fees shall be used
by the city to fund underground activities.
      3.   Waiver Of Undergrounding Requirement: Aboveground meters,
transformers, condensers, switches, and other related equipment may be allowed
above ground if approved by the public works director if it is determined that
the equipment is unobtrusive or is adequately screened from public view as part
of the site development review process. If the applicant demonstrates that the
city’s undergrounding requirement has the effect of prohibiting the requirement
of telecommunications facilities, the approving authority shall waive the
undergrounding requirement. Conditions for approval of aboveground equipment
include, but are not limited to: enclosure in a building other than the
principal building of the development, screening with the use of walls, partial
subsurface locations, screening with landscaping, and other architectural
treatment consistent with the design of the development. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-
2014)
9-5B-4: OUTDOOR LIGHTING:
The purpose of this section is to balance the safety and security needs for
lighting with the city’s desire to preserve dark skies and to ensure that light
trespass and glare have negligible impact on surrounding property (especially
residential uses) and roadways.
   A.   Exempt Lighting: The following items shall be exempt from the
requirements of this chapter:
      1.   All outdoor light fixtures producing light directly by the
combustion of fossil fuels, such as kerosene lanterns or gas fixtures.
      2.   Temporary lights used for holiday decorations.

light;
      3.   Lighting fixtures operated in such a manner as to constitute a
hazard or danger to persons or to safe vehicular travel;
      4.   Illumination of entire buildings; and
      5.   Moving, flashing, or animated lighting except as allowed for signs
as provided in article F, “Signage”, of this chapter.
   C.   General Lighting Requirements: The requirements listed below shall
apply to all outdoor lighting:
      1.   Nuisance Prevention: All outdoor lighting shall be designed,
located, installed, and maintained in order to prevent glare, light trespass,
and light pollution.
      2.   Lighting Study Required For Limited Land Uses: A lighting study or
plan (often referred to as a photometric study or plan) shall only be required
for those land uses that are most likely to have a negative impact on
surrounding sensitive receptors, such as residential dwellings. As such, a
lighting study or plan shall only be required for fueling stations, apartment
complexes, and uses with parking lots that contain more than one hundred (100)
spaces.
      3.   Shielding: Except as otherwise exempt, all outdoor lighting shall be
recessed and/or constructed with full downward shielding in order to reduce
light and glare impacts on trespass to adjoining properties and public rights
of way. Each fixture shall be directed downward and away from adjoining
properties and public rights of way, so that no light fixture directly
illuminates an area outside of the project site.
      4.   Level Of Illumination: Outdoor lighting shall be designed to
illuminate at the minimum level necessary for safety and security and to avoid
harsh contrasts in lighting levels between the project site and adjacent
properties.
      5.   Maximum Height Of Freestanding Outdoor Light Fixtures: The maximum
height of freestanding outdoor light fixtures less than ten feet (10') from a
property line abutting residential development shall be eighteen feet (18').
Otherwise, the maximum height for freestanding outdoor light structures shall
be twenty four feet (24'). Height shall be measured from the finish grade,
inclusive of the pedestal, to the top of the fixture. The designated approving
authority may allow greater heights upon finding that there are special
circumstances that affect the feasibility of meeting this standard.
      6.   Energy Efficient Fixtures Required: Outdoor lighting shall utilize
energy efficient fixtures and lamps, such as high pressure sodium, metal
halide, low pressure sodium, hardwired compact fluorescent, or other lighting
technology that is of equal or greater efficiency. All new outdoor lighting
fixtures shall be energy efficient with a rated average bulb life of not less
than ten thousand (10,000) hours.
      7.   Accent Lighting: Architectural features may be illuminated by
uplighting, provided that the lamps are low intensity to produce a subtle
lighting effect and no glare or light trespass is produced. Wherever feasible,
solar powered fixtures should be used. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-5B-5: FENCES AND WALLS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish development
standards and regulations for fences and walls. The intent of these regulations
is to provide for adequate air and light permeability onto lots, for adequate
buffering between and screening of uses and activities, and for the mitigation
of noise.
   B.   Applicability And Exemptions: Except as provided below, the
requirements of this chapter apply to all fences and walls.
      1.   Fences that are required by federal or state law or regulation, or
which are required by the city for public safety (e.g., temporary construction
site fencing) are exempt from this section.
      2.   Walls that are required by mitigation measure and designed and
approved through a tentative subdivision map, tentative parcel map, or site
plan and architecture review for noise attenuation are exempt from this
section. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
   C.   Permit Requirements: Except as provided below, no special planning
permit or entitlement shall be required for fences or walls, except that zoning
plan check shall be conducted in the event that a building permit is required.
      1.   Building Permit Required: A building permit is required for all
fences that exceed seven feet (7') in height. (Ord. 2016-04, 4-19-2016)
      2.   Encroachment Permit Required: An encroachment permit is required for
all fences located within a city maintained public utility easement as provided
in title 7, chapter 12, “Encroachments”, of the municipal code.
      3.   Retaining Walls: Retaining walls, as defined in this title, may only
be constructed as part of an approved grading permit for the site at the time
of initial development, as part of a roadway improvement project, or as part of
the necessary stabilization of soil for the primary intended use of the
property as determined by the public works director.
   D.   Measurement Of Fence And Wall Height: Fence and wall height shall be
measured as the vertical distance between the lowest finished grade at the base
of the fence and the top edge of the fence material. When a fence or wall is
placed atop a “landscape wall” (as defined in this title), the height of the
landscape wall shall be considered as part of the fence or wall for purposes of
determining the height of the fence or wall.
   E.   Fence And Wall Height Limits In Required Yard Areas:
      1.   General Standards: All fences and walls built within required yard
areas or within a clear visibility area shall comply with the height limits
shown in table 9-5B-5-E1, “Development Standards For Fences And Walls”, of this
section. Minimum permeability refers to the amount of surface area of the fence
or wall that shall be open to the passage of light and air. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-
2014)

9-5C-2: DESIGN CONCEPTS:
   A.   General: All projects subject to site plan and architectural review are
expected to implement the following design concepts:
      1.   Provide high quality site planning, architecture, and landscape
design;
      2.   Enhance the character of the City and/or implement specific design
attributes identified in various subareas;
      3.   Ensure physical, visual, and functional compatibility between uses;
and
      4.   Protect land values by ensuring that proper attention is paid to
site and architectural design.
   B.   Neighborhood Design: The following design concepts apply to the
subdivision of land and to larger residential, commercial, and industrial
projects that create a private street network, with the overall intent of
visually and functionally interconnecting neighborhoods with commercial and
employment centers:
      1.   Provide a balanced mix of land uses including housing, schools,
parks, commercial, and employment areas.
      2.   Provide pedestrian friendly neighborhoods which are walkable and
provide easy access to destinations that residents will travel to on a daily
basis.
      3.   Organize new housing in identifiable neighborhoods and provide
diversity of housing types, sizes, and densities.
      4.   Provide multimodal connectivity throughout neighborhoods and between
neighborhoods and commercial and employment centers.
      5.   Incorporate landscaping to minimize urban runoff.
      6.   Create pedestrian friendly streets that include building orientation
to public streets and/or parks and open space.
   C.   Architectural Design:
      1.   Provide authentic architectural styles. Particular attention should
be paid to the design of all front elevations and side elevations facing a
street or open space.
      2.   Include a diversity of commercial building and housing types by size
and mass, elevation, orientation, and setback to avoid repetition. The intent
is to create visual variation and interest throughout the community.
      3.   Design buildings that have a variety in mass and scale to avoid
large featureless walls. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-5C-3: DESIGN STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS:
The standards contained in this section shall apply to new residential
development, including single-family residential subdivisions, master home
plans, and multi-family residential developments. These standards are intended
to implement the design concepts described above.
   A.   Site Design:
      1.   Circulation: Create a circulation system that provides for the safe
and efficient movement of all transportation modes:
         a.   Provide internal streets, driveways, and sidewalks that allow
residents to park once and easily navigate the entire project site on foot.
         b.   Use special paving to identify unique pedestrian areas.
         c.   Provide connections between the public street and the front door
of single-family residential dwellings and multi-family buildings. Design
solutions may include, but are not limited to, dedicated pedestrian paths and
driveways.
         d.   Utilize maximum block lengths of five hundred feet (500'), except
for blocks with single-family residential uses, which may be up to six hundred
feet (600') long or seven hundred fifty feet (750') when developed with mid
block pedestrian connections.
         e.   All new streets and alleys must connect to other streets and
alleys to form a continuous vehicular and pedestrian network. Local, internal
streets should be narrow and designed with traffic calming features to control
speed.
         f.   Limit the use of cul-de-sacs to no more than ten percent (10%) of
the length of all streets in a subdivision map, where constrained by
surrounding land attributes.
         g.   Encourage loop out streets rather than cul-de-sacs.
         h.   Also see title 8, chapter 7, article J, "Subdivision Design
Standards", of the municipal code for additional subdivision design
requirements.
      2.   Building Placement And Orientation: Create diverse residential
streetscapes that facilitate interaction between residents and include homes
and residential structures that orient to the street.
         a.   Multi-unit residential buildings (e.g., townhomes, condominiums,
apartments) shall be designed with different building setbacks and facade
variations when multiple buildings are provided.
         b.   Orient home and building sites to take advantage of solar heating
and opportunities for solar energy generation.
         c.   Residential development adjacent to open space/parks and other
public spaces shall maintain visual access from residential units and common
buildings to provide “eyes on the street” surveillance opportunities.
         d.   Buildings shall be designed with structural and spatial variety
along the front facades to avoid monotonous appearance.
      3.   Public Space/Pedestrian Amenities: Create attractive and active
environments for the enjoyment of residents within residential projects.
         a.   Provide common open spaces within one thousand feet (1,000') of
each residential unit.
         b.   Multi-family project shall provide one or more amenities for
residents as listed below:
            (1)   Tot lot/play structure;
            (2)   Community garden;
            (3)   Picnic tables with barbecue area (with shade structure);
            (4)   Swimming pool; and
            (5)   Indoor recreation facility.
      4.   Garage Placement And Design: Create residential developments where
the garage is subordinate to the main home/building.
         a.   The garage shall not extend more than five feet (5') beyond the
front of the home on at least fifty percent (50%) of the master plan home
designs within a single-family residential subdivision.
         b.   All garages are required to minimize the negative visual impact
of the garage door. Options to achieving this requirement include, but are not
limited to, the following:
            (1)   Place the garage at the rear of lot away from public view
(e.g., alley load);
            (2)   Recess the garage behind the living area of the home;
            (3)   Utilize side-on garages where garage door is perpendicular to
the street (e.g., "swing garage");
            (4)   Cantilever the second story over the garage;
            (5)   Utilize a tandem garage;
            (6)   Articulate garage doors with windows, paneling, recesses, and

pressure of the irrigation system, pressure regulating devices such as in-line
pressure regulators, booster pumps, or other devices shall be installed to meet
the required dynamic pressure of the irrigation system.
            (2)   Static water pressure, dynamic or operating pressure, and
flow reading of the water supply shall be measured at the point of connection.
These pressure and flow measurements shall be conducted at the design stage. If
the measurements are not available at the design stage, the measurements shall
be conducted at installation.
         d.   Sensors (rain, freeze, wind, etc.), either integral or auxiliary,
that suspend or alter irrigation operation during unfavorable weather
conditions shall be required on all irrigation systems, as appropriate for
local climatic conditions. Irrigation should be avoided during windy or
freezing weather or during rain.
         e.   Manual shutoff valves (such as a gate valve, ball valve, or
butterfly valve) shall be required, as close as possible to the point of
connection of the water supply, to minimize water loss in case of an emergency
(such as a main line break) or routine repair.
         f.   Backflow prevention devices shall be required to protect the
water supply from contamination by the irrigation system. The project applicant
shall refer to the applicable local agency code (i.e., public health) for
additional backflow prevention requirements.
         g.   High flow sensors that detect and report high flow conditions
created by system damage or malfunction are recommended.
         h.   The irrigation system shall be designed to prevent runoff, low
head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where irrigation water
flows onto nontargeted areas, such as adjacent property, nonirrigated areas,
hardscapes, roadways, or structures.
         i.   Relevant information from the soil management plan, such as soil
type and infiltration rate, shall be utilized when designing irrigation
systems.
         j.   The design of the irrigation system shall conform to the
hydrozones of the landscape design plan.
         k.   The irrigation system must be designed and installed to meet, at
a minimum, the irrigation efficiency criteria regarding the maximum applied
water allowance.
         l.   It is highly recommended that the project applicant or local
agency inquire with the local water purveyor about peak water operating demands
(on the water supply system) or water restrictions that may impact the
effectiveness of the irrigation system.
         m.   In mulched planting areas, the use of low volume irrigation is
required to maximize water infiltration into the root zone.
         n.   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall have matched
precipitation rates, unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer's
recommendations.
         o.   Head to head coverage is recommended. However, sprinkler spacing
shall be designed to achieve the highest possible distribution uniformity using
the manufacturer's recommendations.
         p.   Swing joints or other riser protection components are required on
all risers subject to damage that are adjacent to high traffic areas.
         q.   Check valves or antidrain valves are required for all irrigation
systems.

eight feet (8') in width in any direction shall be irrigated with subsurface
irrigation or low volume irrigation system.
         s.   Overhead irrigation shall not be permitted within twenty four
inches (24") of any nonpermeable surface. Allowable irrigation within the
setback from nonpermeable surfaces may include drip, drip line, or other low
flow nonspray technology. The setback area may be planted or unplanted. The
surfacing of the setback may be mulch, gravel, or other porous material. These
restrictions may be modified if:
            (1)   The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no
runoff occurs; or
            (2)   The adjacent nonpermeable surfaces are designed and
constructed to drain entirely to landscaping.
         t.   The irrigation designer specifies an alternative design or
technology, as part of the landscape documentation package and clearly
demonstrates strict adherence to irrigation system design criteria to prevent
overspray and runoff.
         u.   Slopes greater than twenty five percent (25%) shall not be
irrigated with an irrigation system with a precipitation rate exceeding three-
fourths (3/4) of an inch per hour. This restriction may be modified if the
landscape designer specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of
the landscape documentation package, and clearly demonstrates no runoff or
erosion will occur. Prevention of runoff and erosion must be confirmed during
the irrigation audit.
      2.   Hydrozone Requirements:
         a.   Each valve shall irrigate a hydrozone with similar site, slope,
sun exposure, soil conditions, and plant materials with similar water use.
         b.   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall be selected

         c.   Where feasible, trees shall be placed on separate valves from
shrubs, ground covers, and turf.
         d.   Individual hydrozones that mix plants of moderate and low water
use, or moderate and high water use, may be allowed if:
            (1)   Plant factor calculation is based on the proportions of the
respective plant water uses and their plant factor; or
            (2)   The plant factor of the higher water using plant is used for
calculations.
         e.   Individual hydrozones that mix high and low water use plants
shall not be permitted.
         f.   On the landscape design plan and irrigation design plan,
hydrozone areas shall be designated by number, letter, or other designation. On
the irrigation design plan, designate the areas irrigated by each valve, and
assign a number to each valve. Use this valve number in the hydrozone
information table. This table can also assist with the irrigation audit and
programming the controller.
      3.   Design Plan Contents: The irrigation design plan, at a minimum,
shall contain:

   F.   Reductions And Exceptions To Minimum Parking Requirements: The
following are exceptions or reductions to the minimum parking requirements
established in
table 9-5E-4-A1, "Required Minimum Parking Ratios", of this section that are
available:
      1.   Parking District Waiver: Minimum off street parking requirements may
be waived for properties that have access to public parking facilities. The
waiver may be granted by the Planning Director.
      2.   Parking Reduction: Parking may be reduced by the designated approval
authority according to the following provisions. A combination of the following
programs may be utilized; however, the total parking reduction shall not exceed
twenty percent (20%) of required parking:
         a.   Reduction For Special Motor Vehicles: Up to twenty percent (20%)
of the off street parking may be provided by smaller parking spaces for special
or alternative motor vehicles (e.g., golf carts, motorcycles, motorized
scooters).
         b.   Reduction For Secure Bicycle Parking: Developments which provide
additional secure bicycle parking facilities over and above the minimum
requirement of this article may reduce their parking requirement by one (1)
vehicle space for every two (2) additional bicycle spaces provided.
         c.   Reduction For Parking Near Major Transit Stops (e.g., Train
Stations, Significant Bus Facilities): Parking requirements may be reduced by
ten percent (10%) when within one-fourth (1/4) mile of a major transit stop.
         d.   Reduction For Existing Uses To Enable Property Enhancements:
Parking requirements for existing nonresidential development may be reduced by
up to ten percent (10%) if any of the following are completed:
            (1)   Landscaping;
            (2)   On site pedestrian plazas, seating areas, shelters, bicycle
racks, and/or walkways; and/or
            (3)   Comprehensive architectural update to existing structures.
         e.   Shower/Locker Facilities: Developments with one hundred (100) or
more employees may reduce their parking requirement by providing shower and
clothing locker facilities for bicycle commuting employees. The maximum
reduction allowed is five percent (5%) of required parking.
         f.   Preferred Car Pool/Vanpool Parking Spaces: Office or industrial
developments that guarantee preferred parking spaces (e.g., covered, shaded, or
near building entrance) to employees who participate regularly in a car pool or
vanpool may reduce their parking requirement by one (1) vehicle space for every
one (1) space that is marked and reserved for car pools/vanpools at a preferred
location. The maximum reduction allowed is five percent (5%) of required
parking.
         g.   Electric Vehicle Charging Station: Mixed use, commercial, office,
and industrial developments that provide parking spaces reserved for electric
vehicles and provide electric vehicle charging stations at those spaces may
reduce their parking requirement by one (1) vehicle space for every one (1)
space that is provided for electric vehicle charging. The maximum reduction
allowed is five percent (5%) of required parking.
      3.   Joint Vehicle Parking Lot Or Structure: Required parking for two (2)
or more freestanding uses on adjacent or nearby sites may be satisfied by the
use of a joint vehicle parking facility to the extent that it can be shown by
the owners or operators that the demand for parking in the joint facility does
not materially overlay (e.g., uses primarily of a daytime versus a nighttime or
weekday versus weekend nature) and provided that such right of joint use is
evidenced by a deed, parking easement, lease, contract, or similar written
instrument upholding such joint use. In this situation, the size of the joint
parking lot shall be at least as large as the number of vehicle parking spaces
required by the largest user. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-5E-5: DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR OFF STREET PARKING AREAS:
   A.   General: All vehicular parking spaces shall be on the same lot as the
main structure they serve, on an abutting lot, or within one thousand feet
(1,000') of the building, subject to the following requirements:
      1.   There is a safe, direct, attractive, lighted, and convenient
pedestrian route between the vehicle parking area and the use being served.
      2.   There is an assurance in the form of deed, parking easement, lease,
contract, or other similar document that the required spaces will continue to
be available for off street parking use according to the required standards.
   B.   Parking Lot Design:
      1.   Surfacing And Striping: Areas used for parking and maneuvering of
vehicles shall be paved with a minimum of two inch (2") asphalt, concrete, or
equivalent surface. All parking areas shall be appropriately striped, marked,
and signed.
      2.   Curb Cuts And Driveway Access Points/Locations: Street access points
shall be the minimum necessary to provide access while not inhibiting the safe
circulation and carrying capacity of the street. New and modified curb cuts and
driveway access points shall be designed as follows:
         a.   For multi-family, commercial, office, and industrial
developments:
         (1)   A minimum of one hundred fifty feet (150') from the curb return.
         (2)   A minimum of one hundred fifty feet (150') between driveways.
         (3)   Lesser distances may be permitted upon review and approval of
the city engineer.
         (4)   Proposed driveways across the street from each other that are
offset less than one hundred fifty feet (150') must be approved by the public
works director.
         b.   For single-family and duplex developments:
         (1)   A minimum of fifty feet (50') from the curb return.
         (2)   A minimum of five feet (5') between the driveway and property
line.
         c.   The public works director may approve exceptions to this section.
      3.   Back Out Parking: With the exception of duplexes and single-family
residences, all parking areas shall be designed so that vehicles can exit
without backing out of the parking area onto a public street.
      4.   Connect Parking Lots: Auto parking areas shall be encouraged to
connect with auto parking areas on adjacent sites to eliminate the necessity of
utilizing the public right of way for cross movements. Joint or shared access,
internal circulation, or parking is encouraged with adjacent uses.
      5.   Minimum Clearance: Driveways, aisles, turnaround areas, and ramps
shall have a minimum vertical clearance of twelve feet (12') for the entire
length and width, but such clearance may be reduced in parking structures.
      6.   Drainage: Adequate drainage shall be provided to dispose of the
runoff generated by the impervious surface area of the parking area. Provision
shall be made for the on site collection of drainage waters to eliminate sheet
flow of such waters onto sidewalks, public rights of way, and abutting private
property. Design solutions may include, but are not limited to, the use of
bioswales, low impact design (LID), and other designs that direct runoff into
landscape areas.
      7.   Pedestrian Circulation/Walkways: Pedestrian circulation/walkways
shall be designed to provide circulation through parking lots from public
sidewalks to primary building entryways. Sidewalks shall be designed to ensure
that vehicles that may overhang or intrude into the sidewalk system do not
reduce the minimum required sidewalk width of four feet (4').
      8.   Screening: The periphery of all parking lots shall be screened from
view from adjacent streets and adjacent residential areas with walls,
landscaping, and landscaped berms (or a combination) to a minimum height of
three feet (3'). Where provided, landscaping shall be consistent with the
standards of subsection 9-5D1-2E5, “Landscaping Of Parking Lots”, of this
chapter.
      9.   Landscaping: Landscaping of parking lots shall be provided as
required in subsection 9-5D1-2E5, “Landscaping Of Parking Lots”, of this
chapter.

designed in accordance with the minimum city standards for stalls and aisles as
set forth in table 9-5E-5-C1, “Parking Space And Drive Aisle Dimensions”, of
this section and illustrated in figure 9-5E-5-C1, “Parking Space And Drive
Aisle Dimensions”, of this section.
      2.   Compact Car Spaces: Up to fifteen percent (15%) of the required
number of parking spaces may be sized for compact cars. Compact car spaces
shall comply with the following standards:
         a.   Compact car parking spaces shall be clearly marked “compact cars
only”, “compact”, or “c”.
         b.   No more than five (5) compact spaces shall be placed next to each
other.

9-5E-6: OFF STREET LOADING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Purpose Of Loading Area Requirements: The purpose of these regulations
is to provide the number, size, location, and screening requirements for
loading areas in mixed use, commercial, and industrial uses. The intent of
these regulations is to minimize disruptions of traffic flow by freight
carrying vehicles blocking the public right-of-way and to minimize impacts to
vehicular and pedestrian conflicts.
   B.   When Loading Regulations Apply: This regulation applies to all
nonresidential development in mixed use, commercial and industrial districts,
whether or not a permit or other approval is required for the development.
Buildings smaller than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in size are exempt
from the requirements of this section.
   C.   General Loading Area Requirements: The number of required loading
spaces is based on the use of the building and the building size, minus any
residential component square footage, as described in
table 9-5E-6-C1, "Required Minimum Loading Spaces", of this section. Where two
(2) or more uses are located on the same premises, the number of loading area
spaces required is the sum of the spaces required for each use.

width and twenty five feet (25') in length, with fourteen feet (14') of
vertical clearance.
      2.   Setback And Landscaping: Loading areas must comply with the setback
and perimeter landscaping and screening standards. When parking areas are
prohibited or not allowed between a building and a street, loading areas are
also not allowed.
      3.   Maintenance: The provision for maintenance of off street loading
facilities is a continuing obligation of the property owner.
      4.   Loading And Maneuvering Areas: Loading and maneuvering areas shall
be hard surfaced unless a permeable surface is required to reduce surface
runoff, as determined by the City.
      5.   Passenger Vehicle Parking: Parking of passenger vehicles may be
allowed in off street loading areas subject to specific time limits to prevent
conflicts with off street loading activities. If parking is allowed, the
parking time limits shall be clearly posted. These parking spaces shall not

9-5F-1: PURPOSE AND SIGN DEFINITIONS:
   A.   The purpose of this article is to establish regulations for signs.
These regulations are intended to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare and provide for the integrity of the community's aesthetics. The city
recognizes that signs and other graphics are an essential element of a
community's visual appearance, provide a means to identify and promote
businesses, provide useful information to the public, and should not become
visual distractions along public roadways. Consequently, the purpose of this
chapter is to provide sign regulations for signs on private property that are
consistent with the goals and objectives of the city's general plan and the
community's visual and aesthetic goals. In addition, these regulations are
intended to:
      1.   Promote an economically stable and visually attractive community;
      2.   Promote signs and graphics that are attractive, pleasing, and
harmonized with the physical character of the building and environment
surrounding properties;
      3.   Prevent an inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over
noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over
any other noncommercial message;
      4.   Encourage individuality among businesses through signage;
      5.   Improve traffic safety and the smooth and efficient flow of
pedestrians and vehicles to their destinations; and
      6.   Direct persons to various activities and enterprises, in order to
provide for maximum public convenience. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
   B.   The following definitions shall apply to this title:
    A-FRAME SIGN: See definition of Portable Sign.
   ABANDONED SIGN: Those signs left after the close of a business and which
have not been updated upon occupancy of a new business at the same location or
within twelve (12) months of business closure. See subsection
9-5F-2F, "Abandoned Signs", of this article.
   ANIMATED SIGN: Any sign which uses mechanical or electrical movement or
change of lighting, either natural or artificial, to depict action or to create
visual motion or the appearance thereof.
   AWNING: A rooflike cover that projects from the wall of a building for the
purpose of shielding a doorway or window from the elements.
   AWNING OR CANOPY SIGN: A sign that is part of or attached to an awning,
canopy, or other material, or structural protective cover over a door,
entrance, window, or outdoor service area.
   BALLOON SIGN: Any sign that uses blown air or a gas to remain inflated.
   BANNER: Any sign of lightweight fabric or similar material that is mounted
to a pole or a building at one or more edges. Flags shall not be considered
banners (see definition of Flag).
   BILLBOARD: A permanent structure sign which is used for the display of off
site commercial messages. The permanent structure of the sign constitutes a
principal, separate or secondary use, as opposed to an accessory use, of the
parcel on which it is located. It is a sign used as advertising for hire (e.g.,
on which display space is made available to parties, other than the owner or
operator of the sign or occupant of the parcel [not including those who rent
space from the sign owner, when such space is on the same parcel or is the same
development as the sign], in exchange for a rent, fee or other consideration).
Billboards are located off site of the location of topic being advertised or
identified.
   BUILDING ATTACHED SIGN: A sign placed on a wall, awning, canopy, parapet, or
a blade bracket. See also definitions of Wall Sign, Awning Or Canopy Sign,
Window Sign, or Projecting Sign.
   CAN SIGN: A sign which contains all the text and/or logo symbols within a
single enclosed box cabinet that is mounted to a wall or other surface. It
specifically does not include the sign cabinet that is part of a freestanding
sign.

   CAN SIGN
    CHANNEL LETTER SIGN: A sign made up of individual letters that are
independently mounted to a wall or other surface. The "airspace" between the
letters is not part of the sign structure but rather the building facade. A
logo may also be considered a channel letter provided it is clearly
distinguishable from other sign elements.

9-5F-2: ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS:
This section describes the administrative provisions for signage regulation,
including permit requirements and review procedures, policies for review of
signs, signs exempt from permit requirements, and prohibited signs.
   A.   Permit Required: The following permits or entitlements shall be
required for signs:
      1.   Zoning Clearance Required: Zoning clearance shall be required for
all permanent signs (building-attached, freestanding, and highway oriented)
prior to erection, relocation, alteration, or replacement of a sign, unless
otherwise exempted by this article. Zoning clearance is conducted as part of
the review of the building permit as provided in section
9-2B-3, "Zoning Clearance", of this title. No planning approvals shall be
required for general maintenance of existing conforming signs or the
replacement of a conforming sign face (including message) when the area of the
sign is not being changed and a building permit is not required (e.g., the
replacement of a sign face on a legal conforming sign). A sign permit is also
not required for the establishment of temporary signs; however, such signs
shall be consistent with the development standards and time duration limits
established in this article.
      2.   Sign Program: A sign program shall be required for all new multi-
tenant shopping centers, office parks, and other multi- tenant, mixed use, or
otherwise integrated developments of three (3) or more separate tenants/uses
that share buildings, public spaces, landscape, and/or parking facilities. A
sign program provides a process for the city's review of, and decisions related
to, requests for signs for multi-tenant projects. The intent of a sign program
is to establish a shared sign design or theme that to which all future tenants
must adhere. The process for application, review, and decision regarding a sign
program shall be as established in section
9-2B-13, "Sign Program", of this title.
      3.   Highway Oriented Sign Permit: A highway oriented sign permit shall
be required for all highway oriented signs as provided in this article. The
process for application, review, and decision regarding a highway oriented sign
permit shall be as established in section
9-2B-18, "Highway Oriented Sign Permit", of this title.
      4.   Variances: Applications for a variance from the terms of this
article shall be reviewed according to the variance procedures set forth in
section
9-2B-16, "Variance", of this title.
   B.   Policies For Signage Regulations: The following policies regarding
signage in the city are established:
      1.   Regulatory Interpretations: The requirements of this article shall
not be interpreted to nullify any easements, covenants, or other private
agreements that provide for more restrictive sign regulations than are required
by this article.
      2.   Message Neutrality: It is the city's policy and intent to regulate
both commercial and noncommercial signs in a viewpoint neutral and/or content
neutral manner. The message of the sign shall not be reviewed except to the
minimum extent necessary to identify the type of sign.
      3.   Message Substitution: Subject to the property owner's consent, a
noncommercial message of any type may be substituted in whole or in part for
the message displayed on any sign for which the sign structure or mounting
device is authorized pursuant to this article, without consideration of message
content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional
approval or permitting. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent any
inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or
favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial
message. In addition, any on site commercial message may be substituted, in
whole or in part, for any other on site commercial message, provided that the
sign structure or mounting device is authorized pursuant to this article,
without consideration of message content. This requirement does not create a
right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, lot, or land; does
not affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly
permitted; does not allow a change in the physical structure of a sign or its
mounting device; and does not allow for the substitution of an off site
commercial message in the place of an on site commercial or noncommercial
message.
      4.   On Site/Off Site Distinction: Within this article, the distinction
between on site and off site signs applies only to commercial messages.
      5.   General Prohibition: Permanent signs not expressly permitted by this
article are prohibited.
      6.   Exceptions To Limitations: Any exception to the limitations listed
herein shall require a variance pursuant to section
9-2B-16, "Variance", of this title. However, consideration of the variance
request shall not evaluate the message or graphic design of the sign.
      7.   Indecent Or Obscene Matter: To the extent allowed by law, signs with
any statements or words of an obscene, indecent, or immoral character, or any
picture or illustration of any human figure in such detail as to offend public
morals or decency, or any other matter or thing of an obscene, indecent, or
immoral character shall be prohibited.
   C.   Exemptions From Permit Requirements: The following sign types are
expressly exempted from the permit requirements of this article but still must
satisfy any and all other applicable permit requirements when necessary (e.g.,
building, electrical, plumbing, grading, encroachment):
      1.   Exempt Signs Without Limitations: The following signs are exempt
from sign permit and city review requirements:
         a.   Change of copy that does not alter the size, location, or
illumination of a conforming sign.

         e.   Noncommercial utility company signs identifying cables, conduits,
and dangerous situations.
         f.   Street address signs on buildings and building identification

organization, including names of buildings and date of erection.
         h.   Signs and advertising for the California state lottery as
authorized by California Government Code section 8880 et seq.
         i.   Gas pricing signs, as required by State law, which identify the
brand, types, octane rating, etc., of gasoline for sale within the City 1 .
This does not limit the approval and design requirement for permanent or
temporary placement and approval provisions listed herein.
         j.   Signs on vehicles and vessels, including license plates, license
plate frames, registration insignia, noncommercial messages, messages relating
to the business for which the vehicle or vessel is an instrument or tool (not
including general advertising, such as mobile billboards), and messages
relating to the proposed sale, lease, or exchange of the vehicle or vessel.

valid permit has been issued and has not expired, as of the date on which this
provision is first adopted. No permit shall be issued for any billboard which

alterations to exterior cabinets, bases, or poles. Customary maintenance, such
as repainting the sign text, cabinet, or other component of the sign, or
routine replacement of border and trim with substantially the same colors and
materials, in its existing approved physical configuration and size dimensions
at the specific location approved by the city shall not constitute substantial
alteration.
   F.   Abandoned Signs: "Abandoned signs" shall be those signs left after the
close of a business and which have not been updated upon occupancy of a new
business at the same location. The following standards shall apply to
conforming and nonconforming abandoned signs:

9-5F-3: GENERAL SIGN PROVISIONS:
This section describes the procedures for measurement of signs (including area
and height) and construction and maintenance requirements.
   A.   Sign Area Measurement Procedures: Generally, the area of a sign shall
be measured as the overall length of the sign multiplied by the overall height
of each segment of copy or logo. See
figure 9-5F-3-A1, "Sign Area", of this section.
   FIGURE 9-5F-3-A1

height by the total length of the sign for one side regardless if it is single
or double face, excluding framework of separate single wood post or masonry
column and single wood or masonry beam. The base of a monument sign is not part
of the sign. See
figure 9-5F-3-A2, "Freestanding Sign Area", of this section.

or statuelike trademarks), the sign area shall be measured as their maximum
visible surface area from any vantage point. See
figure 9-5F-3-A3, "Area Of Three-Dimensional Objects", of this section.

   B.   Sign Height Measurement: Sign height shall be measured from the
uppermost part of the sign used in determining the area of the sign to the
lowest elevation at the base of the sign.
   C.   Construction Requirements: Every sign and all parts, portions, and
materials thereof shall be manufactured, assembled, and erected in compliance
with all applicable state, federal, and city laws and regulations, including
the locally adopted building code. All signs shall comply with the following
criteria:
      1.   All transformers, equipment, programmers, and other related items
shall be screened and/or painted to match the building or shall be concealed
within the sign.
      2.   All permanent signs shall be constructed of quality, low maintenance
materials such as metal, concrete, natural stone, glass, and acrylics.
Techniques shall be incorporated during construction to reduce fading and
damage caused by exposure to sunlight or degradation due to other elements.
      3.   All freestanding signs that incorporate lighting shall have
underground utility service.
      4.   All temporary signs and banners shall be made of a material designed
to maintain an attractive appearance for as long as the sign is displayed.
   D.   Clearance From Public Utility Facilities: The person erecting a sign
and the owner of the premises shall maintain any legally required clearance
from communications and electric facilities. A sign may not be constructed,
erected, installed, maintained, or repaired in any manner that conflicts with a
rule, regulation, or order of the California public utilities commission
pertaining to the construction, operation, and maintenance of public utilities
facilities.
   E.   Interference With Motorist Field Of Vision:
      1.   No sign shall be located in a manner which may obstruct or interfere
with the view of a traffic signal or other traffic regulatory signs. No sign
shall, as determined by the public works director, be so located as to create a
hazard to the life or property of any person using the public right of way.
      2.   Any required on site landscaping may be trimmed as needed to provide
maximum visibility of the sign or signs.
      3.   Signs shall not be located within the clear visibility area.
   F.   Sign Siting:
      1.   Location Of Building-Attached Signs: Building signs may be located
along any frontage of a building that faces directly onto a public right of way
or an internal circulation path of the site. Orientation of signs such that
they face directly onto residential property is to be avoided and is allowed
only when there is no practical alternative and the visibility of the sign from
the residence is minimized and not illuminated.
      2.   Setback And Spacing Of Freestanding Signs:
         a.   The minimum setback distance for freestanding signs shall be
measured from the back of the public right of way or side of a driveway. Unless
an encroachment permit is granted, all freestanding signs shall be located
outside of the public right of way and any required clear visibility area.
         b.   The minimum spacing distance between permanent freestanding
signs, excluding on site directory and menu/order board signs, shall be two
hundred fifty feet (250'), except that highway oriented signs shall be
separated a greater distance as described in subsection
9-5F-5D, "Highway Oriented Signs", of this article. This section shall not be
used to deny a site the placement of a freestanding sign.
   G.   Maintenance Requirements: Every sign and all parts, portions, and
materials thereof shall be maintained and kept in proper repair. The display
surface of all signs shall be kept clean, neatly painted, and free from rust
and corrosion. Any cracked, broken surfaces, malfunctioning lights, missing
sign copy, or other nonmaintained or damaged portions of a sign shall be
repaired or replaced within thirty (30) days following notification by the
city. Noncompliance with such a request will constitute a nuisance condition
and zoning violation and will be enforced as such.
   H.   Sign Removal Or Replacement: When a sign is removed or replaced, all
brackets, poles, and other structural elements that support the sign shall also
be removed. Affected building surfaces shall be restored to match the adjacent
portion of the structure. This requirement does not apply to routine
maintenance. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-5F-4: DESIGN STANDARDS FOR SIGNS:
   A.   General Sign Design Requirements: The following criteria shall be
utilized for permanent on site signs. Signs shall comply with general design
standards as provided here in addition to design standards applicable only to
unique sign types as provided in subsection B, "Design Standards For Specific
Sign Types", of this section.
      1.   Sign Illumination: The artificial illumination of signs, either from
an internal or external source, shall be designed so as not to cast stray light
on surrounding rights of way and properties. The following requirements shall
apply to all illuminated signs:
         a.   External light sources shall be directed and shielded to limit
direct illumination of an object other than the sign;
         b.   The light from an illuminated sign shall not be of an intensity
or brightness that will create glare or other negative impacts on residential
properties in direct line of sight to the sign;
         c.   Unless otherwise permitted by another requirement of this
article, signs shall not have blinking, flashing, or fluttering lights, or
other illumination devices that have a changing light intensity, brightness, or
color;
         d.   Colored lights shall not be used at a location or in a manner so
as to be confused or constructed as traffic control devices; and
         e.   Light sources shall utilize energy efficient fixtures to the
greatest extent possible and shall comply with title 24 of the California code
of regulations.
   B.   Design Standards For Specific Sign Types: In addition to the general
sign design requirements in subsection A, "General Sign Design Requirements",
of this section, the following requirements shall apply to the specific sign
types:
      1.   A-Frame Signs: A-frame signs, where permitted under section
9-5F-6, "Standards For Temporary On Site Signs", of this article, shall be
placed at least fifteen feet (15') behind the face of curb and outside the city
right of way; except that in the downtown they may be located on the sidewalk
in front of the business. No A-frame signs may be placed where they may
obstruct vision or create other public safety hazards or ADA obstruction. A-
frame signs shall be removed during all times when the business is closed.
      2.   Awning And Canopy Signs: Awning and canopy signs may be permitted
only as an integral part of the awning or canopy to which they are attached or
applied and shall be considered wall signs for signage area calculation
purposes. The following requirements shall apply:
         a.   Lettering shall be located within the middle seventy percent
(70%) of the awning area.
         b.   Only permanent signs that are an integral part of the awning or
architectural projection shall be allowed. Temporary signs shall not be placed
on awnings.
         c.   Awning signs shall only be allowed for first and second story
occupancies.
         d.   Awnings shall not be lighted from under the awning (backlit) so
that the awning appears internally illuminated. Lighting directed downward that
does not illuminate the awning is allowed.
      3.   Marquee Or Changeable Copy Sign: These types of signs shall be
considered to be the same as any other type of sign and shall be regulated
based on their location; i.e., if located on a wall, they shall be deemed wall
signs. There shall be at least seven feet (7') of clearance between the bottom
of the sign and the sidewalk immediately below the sign. No such sign shall
project over the public right of way closer than five feet (5') to the curb
line of a street or have a sign area exceeding one hundred (100) square feet.
Electric (digital) changeable copy signs shall not change message more than one
time every seven (7) seconds and intensity shall be adjusted between day and
night hours to not be a safety hazard.
      4.   Freestanding Signs: Freestanding signs, including monument and pylon
signs, shall only be permitted as follows:
         a.   In an effort to promote full architectural integration of signs,
voids between the sign face and the sign structure are prohibited. Either the
sign face shall utilize the full width of the sign structure or coverings that
are architecturally consistent with the rest of the sign shall be used to fill
any voids. Monument and pylon signs, as defined in this title, are the
preferred sign type for freestanding signs.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2301.jpg]
 
         b.   Freestanding signs may only be constructed as follows:
            (1)   For sites with less than three hundred feet (300') of street
frontage, a monument sign is permitted consistent with the requirements of this
article.
            (2)   For sites with three hundred feet (300') or more of street
frontage, a monument or pylon sign is permitted. Multiple adjoining properties
that individually do not have at least three hundred feet (300') for frontage
may establish a joint use easement to allow sharing of one sign. Such
combination shall first require the approval of a sign program for all
properties.
      5.   Projecting Signs: Projecting signs, including, but not limited to,
blade signs, bracket signs, and marquee signs, shall be considered wall signs
for the purposes of sign area calculations. Projecting signs shall only be
permitted as follows:
         a.   Location: Projecting signs shall be placed only on ground floor
facades, except for businesses located above the ground level with direct
exterior pedestrian access.
         b.   Angle Of Projection: Projecting signs shall either be located at
right angles to the building front along the building facade, or, when located
on the corner of a building, at a forty five degree (45°) angle to the corner
of the building.
         c.   Height: The lowest point of a blade or bracket sign shall be a
minimum of six feet eight inches (6'8") above grade.
         d.   Projection: The sign may project a maximum of five and one- half
feet (51/2') from the building.
         e.   Sign Structure: Sign supports and brackets shall be compatible
with the design and scale of the sign.
      6.   Wall Signs:
         a.   Wall signs shall be compatible with the predominant visual
architectural elements of the building facade.
         b.   Wall signs shall not project more than fourteen inches (14") from
the building facade.
         c.   Wall sign raceways shall be concealed from public view (e.g.,
within the building wall or otherwise integrated with the design of the sign
and building) so as to not detract from the architectural character of the
building. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
         d.   Channel letters, reverse channel letters, and pushpin letters are
preferred. (Ord. 2015-08, 1-5-2016)
         e.   Signage containing multiple elements (e.g., logo and text) on one
facade shall be designed so that the multiple elements are located and scaled
with relationship to each other and the building they are attached to.
      7.   Temporary Sign: In addition to the standards of section
9-5F-6, "Standards For Temporary On Site Signs", of this article, no temporary
sign shall be day-glo or fluorescent in color.
      8.   Window Sign:
         a.   Window signs shall not take up more than twenty five percent
(25%) of the total window area of the establishment.
         b.   Window signs shall not count toward the overall allowed permanent
signage allowed for an establishment but the message may be changed out on a
regular basis similar to a temporary sign. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
      9.   Can Sign: A can sign shall at all times have a sign face installed
so that the inside of the can sign's box is not visible. To meet this
requirement, the sign face may be blank. (Ord. 2015-08, 1-5-2016)
      10.   Flags And Flagpoles: Flagpoles may be mounted on the ground, a
roof, or a building wall. Ground-mounted flagpoles shall not be located within
any required side or rear yard setback areas. Flags and flagpoles shall also
meet the following size standards:
         a.   Ground-mounted flagpoles located in the RC, ML, or MH Zones shall
have a maximum height of fifty feet (50') or a maximum height equal to twice
the distance from the base of the pole to the closest lot line, to a maximum of
one hundred feet (100'), whichever is greater.
         b.   Ground-mounted flagpoles located in the AR, RVLD, RLD, RN, RLMD,
RHD, W, AG, PR, or DMX-3 Zones shall have a maximum height of thirty feet
(30'), mounted on the ground.
         c.   Ground-mounted flagpoles located in the DMX-1, DMX-2, MU, CN, PO,
or CF Zones shall have a maximum height of fifty feet (50').
         d.   Roof-mounted flagpoles shall have a maximum height equal to the
height of the building plus thirty feet (30').
         e.   The maximum width (hoist) of an individual flag on a ground-
mounted or roof-mounted flagpole shall be equal to twenty percent (20%) of the
height of the flagpole upon which it is located. The maximum length (fly) of an
individual shall be twice the allowed width (hoist). (Ord. 2017-06, 5-16-2017)
   C.   Design Standards For Specific Sign Types In The Downtown Mixed Use Zone
Districts: In addition to the general sign design requirements in subsection A,
"General Sign Design Requirements", of this section, the following requirements
shall apply to the specific sign types located in the Downtown Mixed Use Zone
Districts:
      1.   Awning Sign:
         a.   Lettering shall only be allowed on valance flaps and shall not
exceed ten inches (10") in height; it shall also be located within the middle
seventy percent (70%) of the valance area.
         b.   Logos, symbols, and graphics are allowed on the shed (slope)
portion of an awning, not exceeding nine (9) square feet.
         c.   Awning signs are only permitted on first and second story
occupancies.
         d.   Awnings may be illuminated through spotlighting (e.g., pendants)
directed at the face of the awning.
      2.   Bracket Sign, Marquee Sign, And Projecting Sign:
         a.   These signs shall not be longer than eight feet (8') and shall
not be taller than four feet (4').
         b.   These signs shall maintain a minimum vertical clear space to
sidewalk of eight feet (8').
         c.   An encroachment agreement is required when this sign is placed
over the public sidewalk. These signs shall maintain a minimum two foot (2')
clear space to curb.
         d.   These signs may be internally or externally illuminated; however,
internally illuminated signs shall be designed so that only the letters, logos,
numbers, or symbols appear illuminated. The background of the sign shall not be
illuminated, such as with a can sign.
         e.   Marquee and projecting signs shall not be attached to the sloping
face of mansard overhangs or other architectural devices intended to resemble
or imitate roof structures.
      3.   Channel Letter, Pushpin, Reverse Channel Letter, And Wall Sign:
         a.   These signs shall not extend above an eave or parapet. When
located along a fascia, they shall not extend beyond the vertical distance of
the fascia.
         b.   These signs shall be placed flat against the wall and shall not
project from the wall more than required for normal construction purposes and
in no case more than twelve inches (12"). The designated approving authority
may modify this requirement in special circumstances where a projection greater
than twelve inches (12") may be desirable to allow the creation of an
especially creative and unique sign design.
         c.   These signs shall be located within the middle seventy percent
(70%) of the building or occupancy frontage.
         d.   These signs shall not cover or obstruct any portion of a window
or architectural element.
         e.   These signs may be internally or externally illuminated; however,
internally illuminated signs shall have opaque face panels so that only the
letters, logos, numbers, or symbols appear illuminated.
      4.   Portable Sign:
         a.   One (1) portable sign shall be permitted per establishment. In
the case of multiple establishments having a common entrance, only one (1)
portable sign shall be permitted per entrance. Examples include, but are not
limited to, mall buildings.
         b.   The maximum size for portable signs shall be eight (8) square
feet. The maximum height allowed shall be four feet (4').
         c.   Portable signs shall be made of long lasting, durable materials
such as wood and metal. Portable signs shall not be made of cardboard or poster
board.
      5.   Window Sign: A window sign shall not make up more than twenty five
percent (25%) of the window area.
      6.   Signs Using Neon Light: Neon light may be used, provided the sign is
compatible with the design character of the building. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-5F-5: STANDARDS FOR PERMANENT ON SITE SIGNS:
The standards of this section provide the regulations for on site signs on
private property, including height, size, placement, and illumination.
Regulations are listed based upon zoning district and sign type.
   A.   Format And Organization Of Standards: The signage standards listed
below are summarized, where applicable, in table format for ease of use and
organization. Concepts described in these tables are as follows:
      1.   Collective Sign Area: The total sign area allowed herein for each
sign type may be distributed among the maximum number of signs permitted for
that sign type.
      2.   Cumulative Sign Area Allowance: Allowable sign area is either a set
square footage per establishment or is based on a ratio of allowable sign area
to primary building frontage (i.e., 1 square foot of sign per 1 linear foot of
primary building frontage, or 1 sf/1 lf). Where a ratio is described, it
applies to the maximum sign area listed in
table 9-5F-5-B1, "Signage Standards For Permanent On Site Signs By Zoning
District", of this section. The sign area allowed for permanent on site signs
shall be independent of the area allowed for temporary signs as provided in
section
9-5F-6, "Standards For Temporary On Site Signs", of this article.
   B.   General Standards: Except as provided in subsections C, "Menu/Order
Board Signs For Drive-In And Drive-Through Uses", and D, "Highway Oriented
Signs", of this section, permanent on site signs shall be consistent with the
standards listed in
table 9-5F-5-B1 of this section as listed by base zoning district. The types of
signs permitted in each district are specified in
table 9-5F-5-B2, "Allowed Types Of Permanent On Site Signs By Zoning District",
of this section. Only those signs specified in the tables shall be permitted.

(Ord. 2015-08, 1-5-2016)
   C.   Menu/Order Board Signs For Drive-In And Drive-Through Uses: Each drive-
in or drive-through use is permitted a maximum of sixty (60) square feet of
menu/order board signage. The sign(s) shall not count as a sign for purposes of
table
9-5F-5-B1, “Signage Standards For Permanent On Site Signs By Zoning District”,
of this section, either in terms of number or cumulative area. The maximum
height for a menu/order board sign shall be six feet (6').
   D.   Highway Oriented Signs: Properties in the mixed use, neighborhood
commercial, regional commercial, professional office, and industrial zoning
districts and within five hundred feet (500') of the centerline of State
Highways 41 or 198 may, upon issuance of a highway oriented sign permit,
establish a highway oriented sign consistent with the following provisions, in
addition to other provisions of this article:
      1.   Permit Requirements: All highway oriented signs require the approval
of a highway oriented sign permit prior to issuance of a building permit. The
procedures for application, review, and decision of a highway oriented sign
permit are as provided in section
9-2B-18, “Highway Oriented Sign Permit”, of this title.
      2.   Number: One highway oriented sign shall be permitted per either:
         a.   Integrated developments, as defined in this title, consisting of
three (3) or more tenants; or
         b.   Sites with a single tenant.
      3.   Height: The maximum height of highway oriented signs shall be as
follows:
         a.   For single-tenant signs, a maximum of sixty feet (60');
         b.   For multi-tenant signs, a maximum of eighty feet (80');
      4.   Location:
         a.   Spacing Between Signs: No highway oriented sign shall be located
closer than eight hundred feet (800') from any other highway oriented sign. A
lesser spacing distance may be allowed through approval of the highway oriented
sign permit, provided the designated approving authority makes the following
findings:
         (1)   The reduced distance between highway oriented signs will not
cause a safety impact or create sign clutter contrary to a small town
atmosphere.
         b.   Setbacks: All portions of signs must be set back a minimum of ten
feet (10') from the highway right-of-way or other distance as determined by
Caltrans. All highway oriented signs must be distanced from any residential
district by a minimum of two hundred feet (200').
         c.   Visibility: Highway oriented signs shall not be located to
inhibit pedestrian or vehicular visibility and more specifically shall not be
located within the “clear visibility area” as defined in this title.
Illuminated signs shall be directed away from any residentially designed land.
         d.   Additional Restrictions: See title 7, chapter 4, “Advertising
Displays Adjacent To Freeways”, of the Municipal Code for additional citing
restrictions along landscaped freeways.
      5.   Area: Highway oriented signs shall comply with the following
limitations on sign area:
         a.   In neighborhood commercial and regional commercial zoning
districts: The maximum allowed sign area for single tenant highway oriented
signs shall be three hundred (300) square feet per side. For multi-tenant
signs, the total maximum sign area shall be twelve hundred (1,200) square feet
per side with each tenant space limited to three hundred (300) square feet. The
maximum tenant space may exceed 300 square feet for the main tenant if the sum
of all square footage does not exceed 300 square feet per tenant sign.
Ancillary components of the sign, such as shopping center identification, shall
not exceed twenty five percent (25%) of the total sign area and shall be
excluded from the calculation of the total maximum sign area.
         b.   In mixed use, professional office, and industrial zoning
districts: The maximum allowed sign area for single tenant highway oriented
signs shall be one hundred (100) square feet per side. For multi-tenant signs,
the total maximum sign area shall be six hundred (600) square feet per side
with each tenant space limited to one hundred (100) square feet.
         c.   Cumulative Sign Area: The area of a highway oriented sign shall
not be counted toward the cumulative maximum sign area of the underlying
property.
         d.   Accommodation for 19th Avenue Off-ramp: Due to the length of the
19th Avenue off-ramp, the maximum allowed sign area for properties within 1,000
feet of the crossing of 19th Avenue over Highway 198 may increase their maximum
allowed sign areas by thirty percent (30%).
      6.   Architecture: Highway oriented signs shall be designed as pylon
signs or pole signs. Pole signs shall include either a structural or
architectural base from which the pole extends. The base shall be a minimum 50%
wider than the diameter of the pole and a minimum twelve feet (12') high as
measured from the ground unless an alternate design is approved by the
Director. Highway oriented signs shall be composed of materials and design that
are aligned with the purpose of this chapter and the community design element
of the general plan. Examples of exterior sign materials include, but are not
limited to, stucco, brick, wood panels, marble, aluminum, and roof structures.
The community development director may modify or waive these architectural
design standards upon finding that the proposed sign provides an alternative
architectural design that is aesthetically equivalent to or greater than these
standards.
      7.   Illumination: All highway oriented signs must be internally lit.
Signs shall not have blinking, flashing, or fluttering lights or other
illuminating devices that have a changing light, brightness, or color.
Changeable copy LED lights are allowed to be incorporated into the structure so
long as they change no more than every seven (7) seconds and shall adjust
intensity between day and night so as to not be a safety hazard. Sign lighting
shall meet the sign lighting standards found in the latest version of the
California Energy Commission’s Nonresidential Compliance Manual.
   E.   Murals:
      1.   The City encourages murals as a way to add visual interest to a
building or area. As such, murals of a noncommercial nature shall be excluded
from the allowed sign area for a property.
      2.   Murals are allowed on facades of buildings other than the side with
the main entrance. The mural may encompass the entire surface area of the wall
but shall not project onto the roof.
      3.   No person shall paint a mural on the exterior of any structure or
change any existing mural on the exterior of any structure prior to the
issuance of a mural permit issued by the City Council. An application for a
mural permit shall be submitted on the form prescribed by the Community
Development Director. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014; amd. Ord. 2018-03, 5-15-2018;

9-5F-6: STANDARDS FOR TEMPORARY ON SITE SIGNS:
This section describes standards for temporary on site signs. Temporary signs
may include, but are not limited to, commercial signs for grand openings or for
special product, sale, or event advertising. All temporary signs must comply
with the standards listed in

this section and are subject to the following:
   A.   Time Duration:
      1.   Generally: Display periods for temporary on site signs shall be
limited to a maximum of thirty (30) days, provided that the same type of
temporary sign was not located on the site for a minimum of thirty (30) days
prior to display and the same type of temporary sign will not be displayed for
a minimum of thirty (30) days after unless described otherwise in this section.
      2.   Subdivision Signs: All temporary signs for subdivisions shall be
removed within ten (10) days after all lots in the subdivision are sold.

(Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-5F-7: STANDARDS FOR OFF SITE SIGNS:
   A.   General Prohibition: Except as outlined below, all new off site
commercial signage is prohibited within the city. Existing off site commercial
signs (e.g., billboards) that are not electronic are considered nonconforming
signs as regulated by subsection
9-5F-2E, “Nonconforming Signs”, of this article. A limited number of electronic
billboards (billboards with electronically changeable copy) within the city
limits may be permitted as regulated by Section
9-5F-9 “Electronic Billboards”, of this article. Additionally, consistent with
state law, the city does permit off site subdivision directional signs
(subdivision kiosk signs) as provided in this section.
   B.   Subdivision Kiosk Sign: The purpose of subdivision kiosk signs is to
direct the traffic related to new residential subdivisions in a manner that
minimizes visual clutter, reduces unnecessary traffic through established
neighborhoods, and provides an orderly, attractive, high quality image of the
city. When originally placed, kiosk signs will require a sign permit as
required by this title and their locations approved within or outside of the
city's right of way.
      1.   Kiosks shall include removable sign panels with no more than one
panel per residential subdivision.
      2.   Kiosks shall not exceed sixty (60) square feet in sign area, twelve
feet (12') in height, and five feet (5') in width with signage at least thirty
six inches (36") off the ground. Proposed kiosks exceeding these dimensions
require approval through the conditional use permit process.
      3.   No directional kiosk may be located within one thousand five hundred
feet (1,500') of another directional kiosk except in the case of signs on
different corners of an intersection, unless an unusual situation causes the
need for a deviation as determined by the city.
      4.   All directional kiosk signs placed on private property shall have
the written consent of the property owner. All directional kiosk signs placed
on city right of way/lighting landscape maintenance district area/public
facility maintenance district area shall obtain an encroachment permit.
      5.   The review of a proposed directional kiosk will include size,
height, design, materials, and colors.
      6.   The directional kiosk sign may only be located in a manner that does
not obstruct the view of traffic or safety signs, encroach within the clear
visibility area, or otherwise pose a traffic or safety hazard.
      7.   There shall be no additions, tag signs, streamers, balloons, flags,
devices, display boards, or appurtenances added to the subdivision kiosk signs
as originally approved.
      8.   The city may deny an application for a directional kiosk or revoke
an existing permit where an applicant, permittee, or developer with a panel on
a kiosk fails to comply with these provisions.
      9.   Panels on directional kiosk signs may not be displayed after a
subdivision developer has completed the sale of all units in the development.
Each developer shall be responsible for their removal. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
   C.   Temporary Off Site Signs Advertising A Nonprofit Event: Up to a maximum
of five (5) temporary off site signs that advertise a nonprofit event to be
held at a specific time, date, and place may be displayed up to twenty one (21)
days prior to the date of the event. The sign face shall be no greater than
thirty two (32) square feet, and the maximum height of the sign shall be six
feet (6'). The sign's material and composition shall have a professionally made
appearance, and shall be either a wooden sign with two (2) posts or attached to
a wall, or a vinyl or vinyl like banner attached to a wall or fence. Signs
shall be placed at least five feet (5') behind the public right of way, and
shall not be placed without the property owner's permission. Signs shall be
removed within three (3) days of the end of the event.
(Ord. 2015-08, 1-5-2016; amd. Ord. 2025-02, 4-1-2025)
9-5F-8: STANDARDS FOR SIGNS ON CITY PROPERTY AND WITHIN PUBLIC RIGHTS OF WAY:
   A.   Purpose And Intent: The purpose of this section is to provide the
process and standards for establishing signage on city property and public
rights of way. In adopting this section, the city council acts in its
proprietary capacity as to "city property", as defined in this title, within
the city. This section is adopted pursuant to the city's general powers,
property rights, Government Code sections 65850(b), 38774, and 38775, Business
And Professions Code section 5200 et seq., and Penal Code section 556 et seq.
   B.   Intent As To Public Forum: The city declares its intent that not all
city property and public rights of way shall function as a designated public
forum, unless some specific portion of city property or public rights of way is
designated herein as a public forum of one particular type. In such case, the
declaration as to public forum type shall apply strictly and only to the
specified area and for the specified time period.
   C.   General Prohibition: Unless specifically authorized by this chapter, no
signs may be displayed on city property or within public rights of way by
private parties. Any sign posted on city property or within public rights of
way in violation of this section may be summarily removed by the city as a
trespass and a public nuisance.
   D.   Governmental Signs: Unless specifically authorized by this chapter,
only the city, or other local or state governmental agencies, may display signs
on city property or within public rights of way.
   E.   Temporary Signs Displaying Noncommercial Message: In areas qualifying
as traditional public forums, private persons may display noncommercial message
signs thereon, provided that such signs conform to all of the following:
      1.   The signs must be personally held by a person or personally attended
by one or more persons. "Personally attended" means that a person is physically
present within five feet (5') of the sign at all times.
      2.   The maximum aggregate size of all signs held or personally attended
by a single person is six (6) square feet. For purposes of this rule, apparel
and other aspects of personal appearance do not count toward the maximum
aggregate sign area. (Ord. 2016-04, 4-19-2016)
      3.   The maximum size of any one sign which is held or personally
attended by two (2) or more persons is fifty (50) square feet, measured on one
side only.
      4.   The sign must have no more than two (2) display faces and may not be
inflatable or air activated.
      5.   In order to serve the city's interests in traffic flow and safety,
persons displaying signs under this section may not stand in any vehicular
traffic lane when a roadway is open for use by vehicles, and persons displaying
signs on public sidewalks must give at least five feet (5') width clearance for
pedestrians to pass by. Persons holding signs may not obstruct the "clear
visibility area", as defined in this title.
      6.   The message substitution policy of this chapter applies only to
traditional public forum areas. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
   F.   Street Banner/Sign Program:
      1.   The street banner/sign program is limited to signs, banners, or
other displays placed by the city over or on city streets, relating to any
civic or public events or activities.
      2.   For purposes of this section, "civic event or activity" shall mean
the following: Any event or activity organized or sponsored by the city,
including, but not limited to:
         a.   Any public program or educational activity; and
         b.   The commemoration or celebration of any historical date, event or
person, holiday, or persons or events of local, state, or national
significance.
      3.   For purposes of this section, "sponsored by" shall mean the city is:
         a.   Participating in an official capacity in the planning,
preparation or promotion of the event or activity; or
         b.   Contributing twenty five percent (25%) of the total estimated
costs of the civic event or activity, or at least one thousand dollars
($1,000.00), whichever is less. This contribution may take the form of funds,
labor, staff time, materials, fee subsidies, or any combination of the
foregoing.
      4.   Street banners shall be allowed to be displayed up to thirty (30)
days prior to the event and shall be removed within nine (9) days after the
event has ended.
      5.   Street signs shall be located so as not to obscure vision or create
other public safety hazards as determined by the public works director.
(Ord. 2016-04, 4-19-2016)
9-5F-9: ELECTRONIC BILLBOARDS:
   A.   Intent and Purpose. It is the intent of this section to allow a limited
number of electronic billboards (billboards with electronically changeable
copy) within the city limits through the Conditional Use Permit process and
subject to design standards.
   B.   General Provisions.
      1.   No billboard shall be constructed, relocated, or upgraded within the
city without a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) unless otherwise allowed by this
Chapter. Each application shall be considered separately and individually.
Multiple billboards shall not be combined into a single application. Multiple
faces on a single billboard shall be submitted as a single application. CUP
requests will be heard in the order that complete applications are received.
      2.   The City may permit a total of up to four (4) electronic billboards
within city limits through the CUP process. No new billboards that are not
electronic shall be permitted. Any existing legal nonconforming billboard in
place at the time of the approval of this section may not be converted to an
electronic billboard.
      3.   All CUPs approved for electronic billboards shall require that the
placement, design, and operations standards in this section be met. The
Planning Commission or City Council may add additional conditions based on
specific circumstances.
   C.   Placement.
      1.   Electronic billboards shall only be permitted within 200 feet of
Highway 198 or Highway 41 and only in the Regional Commercial (RC), Light
Industrial (ML), or Parks and Recreation/Ponding Basin (PR) zone districts.
      2.   No electronic billboard shall be placed within 1,000 feet of another
electronic billboard on the same side of the highway. No electronic billboard
shall be placed within 300 feet of a highway-oriented sign on the same side of
the highway.
   D.   Design.
      1.   The total height of an electronic billboard shall not exceed 60 feet
to the top of the billboard. The bottom of the billboard face shall be no lower
than 30 feet. These standards may be adjusted in the CUP process where the

ARTICLE G. AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCENTIVES (DENSITY BONUS)
SECTION:
9-5G-1: Purpose
9-5G-2: Eligibility For Density Bonus And Incentives And Concessions
9-5G-3: General Provisions For Density Bonus And Incentives And Concessions
9-5G-4: Number And Types Of Density Bonuses And Incentives And Concessions
Allowed
9-5G-5: Location Of Density Bonus Units
9-5G-6: Continued Availability
9-5G-7: Process For Approval Or Denial
9-5G-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this article is to provide incentives for the production of
housing for very low income, lower income, moderate income, special needs, and
senior households in the city of Lemoore and to establish procedures for
carrying out the legislative requirements and complying with California
Government Code section 65915 et seq. In enacting this article, it is the
intent of the city to facilitate the development of affordable housing by
positively impacting the economic feasibility of providing lower income housing
and implementing the goals, objectives, and policies of the city's housing
element. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-5G-2: ELIGIBILITY FOR DENSITY BONUS AND INCENTIVES AND CONCESSIONS:
   A.   The city shall grant one density bonus, with concessions or incentives,
as specified in section
9-5G-4, "Number And Types Of Density Bonuses And Incentives And Concessions
Allowed", of this article, when the applicant for the residential development
seeks and agrees to construct a residential development, excluding any units
permitted by the density bonus awarded pursuant to this article, that will
contain at least one of the following. The units qualifying a development for a
density bonus shall be referred to as "target units". The applicant shall
specify which of the following is the basis for the density bonus:
      1.   Ten percent (10%) of the total units of a housing development for
lower income households;
      2.   Five percent (5%) of the total units of a housing development for
very low income households;
      3.   A senior citizen housing development or age restricted mobilehome
park; or
      4.   Ten percent (10%) of the total dwelling units in a common interest
development as defined in California Civil Code section 4000 et seq., for
persons and families of moderate income, provided that all units in the
development are offered to the public for purchase. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-5G-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR DENSITY BONUS AND INCENTIVES AND CONCESSIONS:
The following general requirements apply to the application and determination
of all incentives and bonuses:
   A.   Rounding: All density calculations resulting in fractional units shall
be rounded up to the next whole number; except that the percentage of total
units proposed to qualify the development for a density bonus shall not be
rounded up. For example, for a two hundred (200) unit project that proposes
twenty one (21) lower income units (or 10.5 percent), the allowed density bonus
would be based on ten percent (10%) lower income units, not eleven percent
(11%).
   B.   Relation To General Plan, Zoning: The granting of a density bonus, or a
concession or incentive, shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require
a general plan amendment, zoning change (rezone), or other discretionary
approval.
   C.   Density Bonus Excluded In Calculation: The density bonus shall not be
included when calculating the total number of housing units that qualifies the
housing development for a density bonus.
   D.   Parking: Upon request by the applicant, the city shall not require that
a housing development meeting the requirements of section
9-5G-2, "Eligibility For Density Bonus And Incentives And Concessions", of this
article provide a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest
parking that exceeds the following:
      1.   Zero (studio) to one bedroom: One on site parking space per unit.
      2.   Two (2) to three (3) bedrooms: Two (2) on site parking spaces per
unit.
      3.   Four (4) or more bedrooms: Two and one-half (2.5) parking spaces per
unit.
If the total of parking spaces required for a housing development is other than
a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to the next whole number. For
purposes of this subsection, a development may provide "on site parking"
through tandem parking or uncovered parking, but not through on street parking.
   E.   Waived Or Reduced Development Standards: The city shall not apply any
development standard that would have the effect of physically precluding the
construction of a housing development meeting the requirements of section
9-5G-2, "Eligibility For Density Bonus And Incentives And Concessions", of this
article at the densities or with the incentives or concessions permitted by
this article. A proposed waiver or reduction of development standards shall
neither reduce nor increase the number of allowable incentives or concessions
under section
9-5G-4, "Number And Types Of Density Bonuses And Incentives And Concessions
Allowed", of this article.
An applicant may submit to the city a proposal for the waiver or reduction of
development standards, when standards would have the effect of physically
precluding the proposed development, and may request a meeting with the city.
Nothing in this subsection, however, shall be interpreted to require the city
to waive or reduce development standards if:
      1.   The waiver or reduction would have a specific adverse impact, as
defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of section 65589.5 of the
California Government Code, upon health and safety or the physical environment
and for which the city determines there is no feasible method to satisfactorily
mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact;
      2.   This would have an adverse impact on any real property that is
listed in the California register of historical resources; or
      3.   The waiver or reduction would be contrary to state or federal law.
   F.   Multiple Zoning Districts: If the site of a development proposal is
located in two (2) or more zoning districts, the number of dwelling units
permitted in the development is the sum of the dwelling units permitted in each
of the zoning districts based on the site acreage within each zoning district.
The permitted number of dwelling units may be distributed within the
development without regard to the zone boundaries.
   G.   City Authority: Nothing in this article shall be construed to enlarge
or diminish the authority of the city to require a developer to donate land as
a condition of development.
   H.   Agreement Required:
      1.   Prior to the award of a density bonus and any related incentives or
concessions, the applicant shall enter into an agreement with the city to
ensure the continued affordability of all target units.
      2.   For all target units, the agreement shall specify the household
income classification, number, location, size, and construction scheduling and
shall require target units in a project and phases of a project to be
constructed concurrently with the construction of nontarget units. The
agreement shall include such other provisions as necessary to establish
compliance with the requirements of this article.
   I.   Reports: The applicant shall submit financial or other reports along
with the application for the project to establish compliance with this article.
The city may retain a consultant to review any financial report (pro forma).
The cost of the consultant shall be borne by the applicant, except that if the
applicant is a nonprofit organization, the cost of the consultant may be paid
by the city upon prior approval of the city council. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)

requirements in section
9-5G-2, "Eligibility For Density Bonus And Incentives And Concessions", of this
article shall be entitled to the following density bonus:
      1.   For developments providing ten percent (10%) lower income target
units, the city shall provide a twenty percent (20%) increase above the
otherwise maximum allowable residential density as of the date of application,
plus a one and a half percent (1.5%) supplemental increase over that base for
every one percent (1%) increase in low income target units above ten percent
(10%). The maximum density bonus allowed including supplemental increases is
thirty five percent (35%).
      2.   For developments providing five percent (5%) very low income target
units, the city shall provide a twenty percent (20%) increase above the
otherwise maximum allowable residential density as of the date of application,
plus a two and a half percent (2.5%) supplemental increase over that base for
every one percent (1%) increase in very low income target units above five
percent (5%). The maximum density bonus allowed including supplemental
increases is thirty five percent (35%).
      3.   For senior citizen housing developments, a flat twenty percent (20%)
of the number of senior units.
      4.   For common interest developments providing ten percent (10%)
moderate income target units, the city shall provide a five percent (5%)

described in this section, an applicant may request specific incentives or
concessions. The applicant shall receive the following number of incentives or
concessions:
      1.   One incentive or concession for projects that include at least ten

least thirty percent (30%) of the total units for lower income households, at
least fifteen percent (15%) for very low income households, or at least thirty
percent (30%) for persons and families of moderate income in a common interest
development.
      4.   The city shall grant the concession or incentive requested by the
applicant unless it makes a written finding of any of the following:
         a.   The concession or incentive is not required in order to provide
for affordable housing costs, as defined in section 50052.5 of the Health And
Safety Code, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in
subdivision (c).
         b.   The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact,
as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of section 65589.5 of the
California Government Code, upon public health and safety or the physical
environment or on any real property that is listed in the California register
of historical resources and for which there is no feasible method to

other residential development approval donates land to the city and agrees to
include a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the total units before the density
bonus for very low income households, the applicant shall be entitled to a
fifteen percent (15%) increase above the otherwise maximum allowable
residential density, plus a one percent (1%) supplemental increase for each
additional percentage of very low income units to a maximum density bonus of
thirty five percent (35%) for the entire development.
      2.   The density bonus provided in this subsection shall be in addition
to any other density bonus provided by this article up to a maximum combined

thirty (30) years from the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy by
the building official, or longer if required by the project financing.
   B.   Common Interest Housing: In the case of a common interest housing
development providing moderate income target units to qualify for a density
bonus, the initial occupant of the target unit must be a person or family of
moderate income. Upon resale, the seller of the target units shall retain the
value of any improvements, the down payment, and the seller's proportionate
share of appreciation, and the city shall recapture any initial subsidy and its
proportionate share of appreciation which shall then be used within three (3)
years for any of the purposes described in subdivision (e) of section 33334.2
of the California Health And Safety Code that promote homeownership. The city's
initial subsidy shall be equal to the fair market value of the home at the time
of initial sale minus the initial sale price to the moderate income household,
plus the amount of any down payment assistance or mortgage assistance. If upon
resale the market value is lower than the initial market value, then the value
at the time of the resale shall be used as the initial market value. The city's
"proportionate share" shall be equal to the percentage by which the initial
sale price to the moderate income household was less than the fair market value
of the home at the time of the initial sale.

(s) request shall be considered in conjunction with any necessary development
entitlements for the project. The designated approving authority for density
bonuses, incentives, and concessions shall be the city council. In approving
the density bonus and any related incentives or concessions, the city and
applicant shall enter into a density bonus agreement.
   B.   Approval Of Density Bonus Required: The city shall grant the density
bonus requested by the applicant provided it is consistent with the
requirements of this article and state law.
   C.   Approval Of Incentives Or Concessions Required Unless Findings Made:
The city shall grant the incentive(s) and concession(s) requested by the
applicant unless the city makes a written finding, based upon substantial
evidence, of any of the following:
      1.   The incentive or concession is not required in order to provide for
affordable housing costs or affordable rent for the target units.
      2.   The incentive or concession would have a specific adverse impact, as
defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of section 65589.5 of the
California Government Code, upon public health and safety or the physical
environment or on any real property that is listed in the California register
of historical resources and for which the city determines there is no feasible
method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without
rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate income households.
      3.   The concession or incentive would be contrary to state or federal
law.

9-6-7: Conversion Of Residences To Nonresidential Uses
9-6-1: PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW:
   A.   Purpose: This chapter describes the specific development and land use
standards for the downtown area of Lemoore. These standards work in concert
with the other provisions of this title to define the allowed use, development,
and design parameters for the downtown.
   B.   Overview Of Form Based Zoning: Form based zoning provides a method of
regulating development to achieve a desired urban form characterized by
building typologies, and street frontage requirements. Form based provisions
address the relationship between building facades and the public realm (e.g.,
streets and sidewalks), and the form and mass of buildings.
   C.   Applicability Of Standards: As established in chapter 3, "Zoning
Districts And Map", of this title, downtown Lemoore is broken down into three
(3) zoning districts: downtown mixed use - core (DMX-1), downtown mixed use -
auto oriented (DMX-2), and downtown mixed use - transitional (DMX-3). Chapter
4, "Land Uses", of this title identifies the allowed uses within each of these
districts. This chapter identifies the development standards and design
requirements for all new development and remodels of existing development
within these districts. Unless otherwise exempted, all development and
redevelopment in the DMX-1, DMX-2, and DMX-3 districts shall comply with the
standards in this chapter and shall be reviewed for consistency as part of site
plan and architectural review and zoning plan review.
   D.   Deviations: Deviations from this chapter shall be allowed through the
site plan and architectural review process for public/civic buildings. (Ord.
2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-6-2: BASE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
All proposed development and redevelopment of property within the downtown
shall comply with the base development standards listed in this section.
   A.   Building Placement: Each proposed new or remodeled structure shall
comply with the build-to line, setback, and buildable area standards listed in
table 9-6-2-A1, "Building Placement", of this section, except that
encroachments into the public right of way may be allowed as provided in
subsection
9-6-3B, "Encroachments", of this chapter.

may be recessed. A higher percentage shall be allowed through site plan and
design review where the setback area provides a more meaningful pedestrian
area, such as patio seating for a restaurant, or other gathering spaces. See
figure 9-6-2-A1, "Recessed Spaces", of this section.
      2.   Exceptions shall be granted through site plan and design review for
historic home/office conversion buildings and frontages to a maximum of 20
feet.
      3.   Exceptions shall be granted through site plan and design review for
automotive related uses to a maximum setback of 30 feet.

9-6-4: ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN STANDARDS:
This section includes architectural design standards for all new buildings,
renovated buildings, and remodels within the downtown.
The city shall not require more than twenty percent (20%) of the construction
costs for the building to be toward architectural detailing. Documentation
showing the cost of the detailing relative to the overall cost of the structure
will only need to be submitted by the applicant if they seek relief as part of
the site plan and architectural design review process.
   A.   Architectural Details:
      1.   New and remodeled buildings within the downtown shall include
architectural detailing consistent with the design character of the DMX
district within which it is located. Design features include, but are not
limited to, the following concepts identified below and illustrated in
figure 9-6-4-A1, "Design Concepts", of this section:
         a.   Detailed cornice such as relief banding, tile banding, and accent
tiles;
         b.   Trim around windows (e.g., window hoods and lintels) and doors;
         c.   Windows with muntins or glazing bars (elements that divide the
window into multiple panes/lites) and/or mullions (structural elements that
divide adjacent window units);
         d.   Expression lines between the first and second floors of multi-
story buildings;
         e.   Transom windows on the first floor;
         f.   Recessed entries;
         g.   Large display windows that run the length of the building
frontage; and
         h.   Wainscot base treatments along the bulkhead.
   FIGURE 9-6-4-A1
   DESIGN CONCEPTS

IMAGES/0-0-0-2311.jpg]
 
      2.   The physical design of building facades shall vary every twenty (20)
to thirty (30) linear feet. This can be achieved through such techniques as:
         a.   Architectural division into multiple buildings,
         b.   Break or articulation of the facade,
         c.   Significant change in facade design,
         d.   Placement of window and door openings, or
         e.   Position of awnings and canopies.
   B.   Building Materials: Building materials and finishes shall be selected
to reinforce the overall design intent of the project and be consistent with
the desired architectural character of the building. Buildings and structures
shall be constructed with durable, low maintenance, and timeless building
materials of the same or higher quality as surrounding developments. See
figure 9-6-4-B1, "Building Materials", of this section.
      1.   The following materials are encouraged, but not required:
         a.   Roofs:
            (1)   Barrel "U" shaped mission tile in a natural terra cotta or
clay earth tone color;
            (2)   Concrete tiles in terra cotta or earth tones;
            (3)   Exposed wood structural members such as rafter tails, roof
beams, and corbels;
            (4)   Copper accents, gutters, downspouts, and scuppers;
            (5)   Built up stucco or preformed molding on parapets for flat
roof buildings.
         b.   Building walls:
            (1)   Stucco (with hand troweled, smooth appearance), adobe, terra
cotta, brick, replica brick, and cut stone are all acceptable materials to use
on a main surface of a building;
            (2)   Wood surfaces in the form of lap siding or board and batten
may be used when consistent with architectural character of the building;
            (3)   Ornamental tiles, wood, and bricks can be used as trim or
accents around the base of the building;
            (4)   Split face block may be used on unexposed sides and rears of
buildings.
      2.   The following materials are prohibited:
         a.   Roofs:
            (1)   Brightly colored glazed roofing tiles; and
            (2)   Wood shingles and shake roofs.
         b.   Building walls:
            (1)   Synthetic materials of poor quality;
            (2)   Corrugated fiberglass;
            (3)   Coarsely finished or unfinished plywood;
            (4)   Metal siding;
            (5)   Unfinished concrete block and split face block;
            (6)   Shingles and T-111 siding;
            (7)   Slumpstone block; and

   C.   Colors And Painting: Color is an important aspect of the overall
building design and character. Palettes shall be balanced, using the correct
proportions between the lighter base colors and the brighter accent colors.
Colors are to be chosen from the city adopted historic color palette, which is
the Benjamin Moore Historic Colors palette, the America's Colors palette, and
the Ready Mixed Colors palette. See
figure 9-6-4-C1, "Building Color", of this section.
      1.   Brick: Brick shall not be painted unless it has been determined by
the chief building official that the brick has lost its fire face and clear
coat painting is necessary to assist in slowing the degradation of the brick
and mortar.
      2.   Base Color: Buildings with large expanses of blank walls shall have
a light and subtle base color. The base color on smaller buildings or those
with more elaborate detail may use slightly stronger tones. Examples of base
colors include, but are not limited to, light gray, cream, white, pale flesh,
pale yellow, light beige, sage green, and caramel.
      3.   Accent Color: Brighter accent colors shall be used minimally to
accent windows, doors, and awnings. Special materials such as glazed tile can
also be used to introduce accent colors on building facades. Examples of accent
colors include, but are not limited to, forest green, deep blue green, brick
red, deep blue, and sea green.

   D.   Landmark Buildings: The city encourages that new and remodeled
buildings on corner lots in the DMX-1 zone be developed with the following
features, achieving a concept called "landmark buildings" where corner lots
have a more prominent presence and character than interior lots.
      1.   Utilize a multi-story design (at least 2 stories tall) with full,
habitable upper floors;
      2.   Utilize corner treatments, including the use of towers, angled
entries, balconies, and plaza areas;
      3.   Incorporate a higher level of architectural treatment than interior
lots, including, but not limited to, articulated parapets and enhanced facade
detail and trim (e.g., detailed cornice and expression line).
   E.   Lighting: Lighting shall be used to enhance the architectural details
of a building, such as spotlighting for a shadow effect, to provide security to
a building and to indicate whether a business is open. In addition to the
requirements of section
9-5B-4, "Outdoor Lighting", of this title, development within the downtown
shall comply with the following lighting standards:
      1.   Lighting fixtures shall be attractively designed to complement the
architecture of the project. Accent lighting should be used to accent building
details such as tower elements, ornamental windows, and tile, or to accent
landscaping.
      2.   Lighting should improve visual identification of residences and
businesses and create an inviting atmosphere for passersby.
      3.   Wall mounted lights should be used to the greatest extent possible
to minimize the total number of freestanding light standards and shall be well
detailed to complement the building architecture.
      4.   Parking lot lighting fixtures should not exceed twenty four feet
(24') in height. When within fifty feet (50') of residential properties,
fixtures should not exceed eighteen feet (18').
      5.   The light source used in outdoor lighting should provide a warm,
calm glow, such as yellow light.
      6.   Street lighting shall be provided consistent with the city's
improvement standards and other adopted lighting standards for the downtown,
including specifically the type and style of historic light fixture similar to
those existing in downtown. See
figure 9-6-4-E1, "Street Lighting", of this section for an example.

   F.   Roof Forms: The following are the required design of roofs within the
downtown. See
figure 9-6-4-F1, "Roof Forms", of this section.
      1.   Parapet walls shall be used on all flat roof buildings to screen
roof mounted mechanical equipment. Parapets shall always include a cap and
corner detail.
      2.   The visible portion of sloped roofs should be sheathed with a
roofing material complementary to the architectural style of the building and
other surrounding buildings.
      3.   Simple, low pitched gable and shed roofs should be used with Spanish
styled architecture. Terra cotta Spanish tile with detailed corbels and rafter
tails can also be used.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2315.jpg]
 
   G.   Windows, Doors, And Awnings: New and remodeled windows, doors, and
awnings shall meet the following standards:
      1.   Recess doors and windows to give the appearance of traditional,
thick masonry walls consistent with architecture of the early 1900s and to
produce interesting shadows.
      2.   Provide large storefront windows along first floor elevations
accessible by the general public. These windows open up the sidewalk to create
an inviting pedestrian atmosphere.
      3.   Use consistent treatment and types of windows and door frames across
the entire building (or tenant space when a building is visually broken down to
appear as multiple buildings from the street).
      4.   Windows shall include muntins or glazing bars (elements that divide
the window into multiple panes/lites) and/or mullions (structural elements that
divide adjacent window units) consistent with the architectural style of the
building.
      5.   Awnings and canopies shall be constructed of canvas and metal.
Textured plastic is not allowed.
      6.   Store entrances should open onto the public sidewalk. Space
entrances to stores, particularly in the DMX-1 district, between twenty feet
(20') and thirty feet (30') apart.
      7.   Windows shall not be reflective or dark glass and may not be tinted
more than to meet building energy codes. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-6-5: BUILDING TYPES AND FRONTAGES:
   A.   Overview Of Standards: This section identifies the types of buildings
and frontages allowed within downtown. Frontage type refers to the
architectural composition of the front facade of a building, particularly
concerning how it relates and ties into the surrounding public realm. The
downtown Lemoore frontage types are intended to enhance social interactions in
the historic downtown while simultaneously providing appropriate levels of
privacy in residential areas. All new development within the downtown shall be
consistent with one or more of the building and frontage types allowed within
the applicable DMX district.
There are nine (9) types of buildings and frontages that can be developed
throughout the downtown. The types allowed in each downtown district are listed
in subsection B, "Allowed Buildings And Frontages In Each DMX District", of
this section. The frontage types are defined, along with specific development
standards for each type, in subsection C, "Building And Frontage Definitions
And Standards", of this section.
   B.   Allowed Buildings And Frontages In Each DMX District: Allowed building
and frontage types in the different DMX districts are listed in
table 9-6-5-B1, "Allowed Buildings And Frontages", of this section. The symbols
in the table shall have the following meanings:
      1.   An "A" means that the building and frontage type is allowed;
      2.   An "E" means that the building and frontage type is preferred and
encouraged; and
      3.   An "N" means that the building and frontage type is not permitted.

   C.   Building And Frontage Definitions And Standards: The following defines
the various building and frontage types allowed in the downtown. Each type
includes text and illustrations describing the features that define the
building and its frontage. It also includes a series of development standards
for each type (e.g., minimum spacing between supporting columns). Development
applications will be reviewed for consistency with these standards as part of
site plan and architectural review and building permit plan check. These
standards are in addition to any requirements of the city adopted building and
fire codes as may be required at the time of building permit issuance.
   ALLEY/PASEO - ACTIVE

Alley/Paseo - Active Description: The active alley/paseo frontage is the
development of the rear of a building abutting an alley with an active
pedestrian area. Examples include patio seating for restaurants, primary
entrances for ground floor businesses, and other gathering spaces for
pedestrians. While alleys are typically used as the service areas for buildings
(e.g., trash collection, utility service), the city recognizes that parcels in
the downtown have substantial depth and present an opportunity for property
owners to create multiple tenant spaces at both ends of their buildings.

Alley/Paseo - Nonactive Description: The nonactive alley/paseo frontage is the
development of a building directly abutting the rear property line where there
is an alley. This type of frontage may have secondary/emergency access to the
building, along with utility and service access. This type of frontage is
appropriate for retail and office buildings throughout the downtown, as well as
row houses with alley access garages. This frontage type does allow for a
balcony or balconies to be built along the frontage, provided the balcony does
not encroach into the alley.
      Alley/Paseo - Nonactive Dimensions

Balcony/Bay Window Description: A balcony/bay window frontage is characterized
by a facade which is aligned close to or directly on the build-to line with the
building entrance at the sidewalk grade and by a balcony or bay window
projecting into the right of way on a floor other than the ground floor. This
frontage is typically appropriate for ground floor retail or restaurant use
with office or residential above. An encroachment agreement is needed to
construct this frontage type.

Gallery - Deck Or Roof Description: A gallery - deck or roof frontage is
characterized by a facade which is aligned close to or directly on the build-to
line with the building entrance at the sidewalk grade and with an attached
colonnade deck that projects over the public sidewalk and encroaches into the
public right of way. The sidewalk must be fully absorbed within the colonnade
so that a pedestrian may not bypass it. The colonnade may project over the
public sidewalk, provided that the upper stories of the building do not also
project over the public sidewalk. This frontage is typically appropriate for
retail use. An encroachment agreement is needed to construct this frontage
type.

MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
SECTION:
9-7-1: Purpose And Applicability
9-7-2: Design Concept
9-7-3: Conceptual Plan Requirements
9-7-4: Residential Development
9-7-5: Connectivity And Circulation
9-7-6: Development Standards
9-7-7: Architectural Design Standards
9-7-8: Pedestrian Spaces And Ways
9-7-1: PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY:
   A.   Purpose: This chapter establishes the rules and regulations for
development and design of property designated as a mixed use (MU) district.
Provisions herein address the compatible integration of residential,
commercial, office, and/or industrial uses on a contiguous project site within
the mixed use district. The regulations are intended to be flexible to allow a
variety of activities and mix of tenants. These provisions implement mixed use
land use policies within sections 2.5 (downtown and shopping centers) and 3.5
(activity centers) of the general plan. The requirements for specific master
planning of mixed use sites through conceptual plans is adopted consistent with
the provisions provided to the city by section 65302.4 of the California
Government Code.
Specifically, mixed use development standards do the following:
      1.   Allow a range of uses;
      2.   Establish incentives for mixed use development that create a public
benefit (e.g., workforce housing, daycare centers, small scale commercial/
service uses);
      3.   Provide for the flexible integration of different use types
independent of property locations;
      4.   Provide guidance for the types of mixed use development desired by
the city;
      5.   Ensure that new mixed use centers are compatible with surrounding
neighborhoods;
   B.   Applicability Of Standards: The standards within this chapter apply to
the mixed use (MU) zoning district. This chapter identifies the development
standards and design requirements for all development within this district.
Unless otherwise exempted, all new development and reuse redevelopment of
existing structures within the mixed use district shall comply with the
standards in this chapter and shall be reviewed for consistency as part of site
plan and design review and building permit plan check. Exemptions to specific
standards may be approved through the site plan and architectural review
process if the approving authority makes a finding that the there are special
circumstances applicable to the site that warrant an exemption from the
standard.
   C.   Mixed Use Centers Established: The city's general plan establishes five
(5) mixed use centers, each a collection of parcels adjacent to each other that
are collectively designated under the general plan as mixed use. These
properties are all zoned mixed use. These centers are located at the following
major roadway intersections and shall be referred to by these names and can be
identified in
figure 9-7-1-C1, "Mixed Use Centers", of this section:
      1.   Bush Street and College Avenue.
      2.   19th Avenue and Iona Avenue.
      3.   East D Street and Bush Street.
      4.   Lemoore Avenue and Cinnamon Drive.
      5.   Hanford-Armona Road and State Route 41.

(Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-7-2: DESIGN CONCEPT:
   A.   The design concept for the mixed use district is intended to provide
the following key characteristics:
      1.   Retail, residential, office, business and personal services, public,
and institutional uses in neighborhood oriented centers in a variety of mixed
use configurations, such as ground floor commercial with residential or office
uses above, or collocation of buildings with different single uses on a
contiguous mixed use area.
      2.   Development is pedestrian oriented to enhance street life and to
enhance the vibrancy of new and existing neighborhoods.
      3.   Residential density ranges from eight (8) to twenty (20) units per
gross acre.
      4.   Buildings are typically a combination of one-, two-, and three-story
buildings, with less development intensity adjacent to single-family
residential areas. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-7-3: CONCEPTUAL PLAN REQUIREMENTS:
A conceptual plan is required for all new development and redevelopment within
a designated mixed use district. The planning director may waive the
requirement for a conceptual plan when it is determined that the proposed new
development is minor or is replacing or expanding existing development.
   A.   Conceptual Plan Purpose: The intent of the conceptual plan is to
illustrate key components of each mixed use center. The conceptual plan should
include information on the private realm (development standards, building
prototypes, and frontage types) and the design of the public realm (street
typologies). The conceptual plan shall describe the conceptual configuration of
land uses, the on site circulation system, and the relationship to adjacent
properties and uses for the center. The purpose is to develop each mixed use
center in an integrated fashion with connected streets, an integrated
pedestrian system, and common parking areas. It is not meant to lock landowners
into a set development pattern or restrict the types or range of uses that are
allowed on a given property. Rather, its focus is on planning for and providing
integrated access across properties for efficient and cohesive operations and
placement of proposed uses appropriately based on existing surrounding
development.
   B.   Conceptual Plan Components: A conceptual plan shall be established for
a mixed use center prior to or in conjunction with approval of the first
tentative subdivision or parcel map or site plan and design review within the
center. The plan shall be created by the project proponent and submitted to the
city for review and approval (see subsection C of this section, conceptual plan
approval).
Each conceptual plan shall specifically include the following written and
graphic components:
      1.   Location of any new streets and pedestrianways;
      2.   Location of any plazas and other types of open space;
      3.   Location of storefront frontage along key pedestrian paths;
      4.   Location of storefront frontage along streets;
      5.   Anticipated vehicular and pedestrian connections within the entire
mixed use district as well as connections to adjacent properties;
      6.   Location of any common parking facilities (individual parking lots
are discouraged in the mixed use district);
      7.   Location of any transit/bus stop; and
      8.   A written description of how the conceptual plan achieves the
development standards within this chapter.
   C.   Conceptual Plan Approval And Modification: A conceptual plan shall be
reviewed and approved by the city through a minor site plan and architectural
review (see section
9-2B-12, "Minor Site Plan And Architectural Review", of this title). The plan
shall be prepared by the applicant consistent with the requirements of this
chapter and submitted to the planning department for review. As part of the
submittal, the applicant shall demonstrate that they have provided a copy of
the draft plan to other owner(s) of property within the center for review and
provide copies of their comments (if any) to the city.
After approval of the conceptual plan, the plan may be modified through an
amendment to the minor site plan and architectural review. The amendment may be
prepared by any landowner within the mixed use center or by the city.
The city may, at its discretion, provide assistance to property owners with the
preparation of the conceptual plan prior to submittal of subsequent application
for development of the site.
   D.   Development Proposal Process: After approval of the conceptual plan,
subsequent planning permits and entitlements and other approvals may be issued.
(Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-7-4: RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   Residential Uses Generally: The city encourages each mixed use center
to include residential uses within the development. In doing so, these centers
create opportunities for people to live, work, and shop in the same area. It
builds in a dedicated customer base for retail and restaurant uses and creates
flexible housing choices for workers. Consistent with the city's general plan,
where residential uses are provided in mixed use centers, the minimum
residential density is eight (8) dwelling units per acre and the maximum
density is twenty (20) dwelling units per acre.
   B.   Transfer Of Units Between Properties: To further encourage the
development of residential uses within mixed use centers, the city allows for
the residential development potential of one or more parcels within a mixed use
center to be transferred to any other parcel or parcels within the same center
by right, provided the maximum number of residential dwellings in each center
does not exceed the number identified in
table 9-7-4-A1, "Maximum Residential Development", of this section. The number
of dwellings listed in
table 9-7-4-A1 of this section is calculated based upon the number of acres in
each center multiplied by the maximum allowed density of twenty (20) units per
acre.

9-7-5: CONNECTIVITY AND CIRCULATION:
In keeping with the design concept for mixed use development (see section
9-7-2, "Design Concept", of this chapter), mixed use centers shall be developed
with an internal set of streets, drive aisles, and other similar paths that
divide the sites into smaller blocks. To that end, mixed use centers are
subject to the connectivity requirement in
table 9-7-5-1, "Connectivity Requirements", of this section. The intent is to
achieve these requirements through the implementation of the regulating plan
established for each mixed use center (see section
9-7-3, "Conceptual Plan Requirements", of this chapter). The standards listed
in
table 9-7-5-1 of this section are illustrated using a variety of development
types in
figure 9-7-5-1, "Connectivity", of this section. A new regulating plan shall be
created or updated prior to development within each mixed use center.

   A.   Street System: Each mixed use center, as part of the regulating plan,
shall establish an internal system of streets that connect to the city street
system at appropriate locations. These internal streets may be public (street)
or private (drive aisle). Internal streets shall be based upon the following
roadway hierarchy and consistent with the development standards listed in
subsection C, "Development Standards For Streets And Pedestrianways", of this
section:
      1.   Main Street: A "main street", or "main way", is a drive aisle or
street that functions as a major vehicular pathway through a site. This street
features active pedestrian spaces with wide sidewalks (greater than 8 feet).
Buildings are constructed directly adjacent to the sidewalk (e.g., 0 foot
built-to line). On street parking is provided within the pavement area and is
typically angled such that vehicles can only pull into spaces directly in front
of them on the passenger side of the vehicle. The sidewalk is lined with street
trees in tree wells near the curb. Intersections may be controlled with stop
signs when warrants support such controls.
      2.   Drive Aisle: A drive aisle is a vehicular pathway that provides
access from the public street system or on site private main street(s) to the
parking areas of the project.
      3.   Alley: Alleys are narrow roads that provide access to utility areas.
These roads are intended for large deliveries and trash collection and are not
meant as pedestrian areas. Alleys do not provide parking (but may provide
access to parking).
   B.   Pedestrianways: Pedestrianways within mixed use centers are generally
broken down into two (2) categories: sidewalks and other pedestrian paths. Each
shall comply with the following standards:
      1.   Sidewalks: Every internal street or drive aisle shall include a
sidewalk between the roadway and the adjacent building. Exceptions shall be
granted through regulating plan approval for alleys and areas where pedestrians
should not be. Sidewalks shall be designed consistent with the standards listed
in subsection C, "Development Standards For Streets And Pedestrianways", of
this section.
      2.   Other Pedestrian Paths: As identified in
table 9-7-5-1, "Connectivity Requirements", of this section, additional
pedestrian paths shall be provided between block ends within mixed use centers.
These paths shall comply with the following standards:
         a.   Pedestrian paths between buildings shall be a minimum of ten feet
(10') wide with a minimum paved area of five feet (5').
         b.   Pedestrian paths shall be designed with features such as enhanced
paving, trellis structures, and additional landscaping or lighting to
distinguish paths from the sidewalk.
         c.   Hardscape materials used in pedestrian oriented spaces such as
plazas, paths, and sidewalks shall be attractive, durable, slip resistant, of
high quality, and compatible in color and pattern with a project's design.
Surfaces in pedestrian circulation areas shall be constructed from materials
that provide a hard, stable surface and that permit maneuverability for people
of all abilities.
         d.   Pedestrian pathways crossing a vehicle drive, loading area, or
parking area shall be made identifiable by the use of an alternative hardscape
material such as pavers or patterned, stamped, or colored concrete.
   C.   Development Standards For Streets And Pedestrianways: Main streets
shall include the design features in
table 9-7-5-C, "Main Street Design Features", of this section.

All proposed development and redevelopment of property within the mixed use
district shall comply with the base development standards listed in this
section.
   A.   Building Placement: New structures shall comply with the build-to line,
setback, and buildable area requirements listed in
table 9-7-6-A1, "Building Placement", of this section. Setbacks and build-to
lines shall be measured from the back of the property line when along a public
street or from a sidewalk when along an internal, private drive. The planning
director may waive this requirement if it is determined that the proposed new
development is replacing or expanding existing development.

      3.   Number Of Required Parking Spaces: The number of parking spaces
required for mixed use centers shall be based upon the standards listed in
chapter 5, article E, "Off Street Parking And Loading", of this title. The
required parking shall be calculated based upon the range of uses developed
within the center by type of use during the peak parking period.
      4.   Location Of Parking Spaces: The parking required for each individual
use need not be provided on the same parcel or immediately adjacent to the use
generating the required parking. Rather, the required parking just needs to be
provided somewhere within the center. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-7-7: ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN STANDARDS:
Buildings within mixed use centers shall comply with the architectural
standards of chapter 5, article C, "Architectural And Site Design Standards",
of this title for the type of use. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-7-8: PEDESTRIAN SPACES AND WAYS:
This section identifies the development standards for the public areas of mixed
use centers, more specifically the streets, alleys, and other pedestrianways.
The intent of this section is to identify how the public spaces shall be
developed and maintained in order to promote an active pedestrian environment.
   A.   Required Pedestrian Spaces: Every mixed use center shall include one or
more outdoor gathering spaces. Public space shall occupy at minimum two percent
(2%) of the gross area of each mixed use center.
   B.   Standards For Pedestrian Spaces: All pedestrian spaces shall comply
with the following standards:
      1.   Landscaping: Landscaping in pedestrian spaces shall be consistent
with the requirements of chapter 5, article D1, "Landscaping Standards", of
this title.
      2.   Lighting: Pedestrian spaces shall be illuminated for safety and to
complement the architecture of the space. Lighting shall be consistent with the
standards of section
9-5B-4, "Outdoor Lighting", of this title.
      3.   Electrical Power: Pedestrian spaces shall be serviced with at least
two (2) electrical outlets for every two thousand (2,000) square feet of public
space. The intent is to provide adequate power for temporary uses and
activities and to facilitate proper maintenance.
      4.   Materials: Materials used in pedestrian oriented spaces shall be
attractive, durable, slip resistant, of high quality, and compatible in color
and pattern with a project's design. Surfaces in pedestrian circulation areas
shall be constructed from materials that provide a hard, stable surface and
that permit comfortable maneuverability for people of all abilities. Wherever a
pathway crosses a drive aisle, loading area, or parking area, the pathway shall
be made identifiable by the use of one of the following: elevation changes,
changes in paving materials, and/or the use of colors. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)

OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS
ARTICLE A. PURPOSE AND INTENT OF OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS
SECTION:
9-9A-1: Purpose And Intent
9-9A-2: Designation On Zoning Map
9-9A-3: Applicability Of Standards
9-9A-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
This chapter establishes a series of overlay zoning districts. These overlay
zoning districts supplement the land use regulations and/or development
standards of the corresponding underlying base zoning district by recognizing
distinct areas of the city that have special, unique, or important social,
architectural, site, neighborhood, environmental, or compatibility issues or
characteristics that, because of their nature, require special considerations
not otherwise adequately provided by the underlying base zoning district
applicable to the property. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-9A-2: DESIGNATION ON ZONING MAP:
As described in chapter 3, "Zoning Districts And Map", of this title, overlay
zoning districts shall be designated on the city zoning map by their
representative symbol along with the base zoning district in a format
determined by the planning director. For example, a planned development overlay
zoning district combined with a medium density residential base zoning district
would be shown on the zoning map with the medium density residential shown as
the underlying district and the overlay shown with an outline. (Ord. 2013-05,
2-6-2014)
9-9A-3: APPLICABILITY OF STANDARDS:
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all parcels of land located
within the designated boundaries of an overlay district as illustrated on maps
contained on the city zoning map. In the event of a conflict with the
regulations of the underlying base zoning district and the overlay zoning
district, the provisions of the overlay zoning district shall apply. Where an
overlay zoning district is silent, the regulations of other sections of this
title shall apply. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
ARTICLE B. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS
SECTION:
9-9B-1: Purpose And Intent
9-9B-2: Form And Content Of Planned Unit Development Overlay Zones
9-9B-3: Adoption Of Planned Unit Development Overlay Zones
9-9B-4: Special Development Standards For Specific Planned Unit Developments
9-9B-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
This article establishes the Planned Unit Development (PUD) Overlay Zone for
the purpose of providing project specific architectural and development
standards for new development of residential subdivisions in the City. The PUD
is intended to allow some flexibility in the zoning district development
standards with special consideration and review. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-9B-2: FORM AND CONTENT OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY ZONES:
   A.   Form And Adoption Of New Planned Unit Development Overlay Zones:
Subsequent to the adoption of this title, all new Planned Unit Development
Overlay Zones shall be established by ordinance of the City Council. The
ordinance shall include, or shall reference in a separate document, all of the
components for a planned unit development as described in subsection B of this
section.
   B.   Required Components: Each new Planned Unit Development Overlay Zone
shall, at a minimum, contain the following components:
      1.   Performance and development requirements related to yards, lot area,
intensity of development on each lot, parking, landscaping, and signs;
      2.   Time, phasing, and sequence of development projects;
      3.   Infrastructure plan;
      4.   Circulation plan;
      5.   Master home plan floor plans and elevation plans; and
      6.   Other design standards appropriate for the specific site and
development.
   C.   Requirements For Existing Planned Unit Developments: Existing Planned
Unit Development Overlay Zones need not be modified to include these components
unless the underlying tentative subdivision map has expired or the project
proponent is requesting a significant change in the project design as
determined by the City. Otherwise, the conditions of approval for the tentative
map shall serve as the plan for the development. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-9B-3: ADOPTION OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY ZONES:
The Planned Unit Development Overlay Zones listed in
table 9-9B-3-1, "Planned Unit Development Overlay Zones", of this section are
hereby adopted into this Code by reference. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)

9-9B-4: SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR SPECIFIC PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS:
In an effort to provide design flexibility and consistency with the
architectural standards historically required for planned unit developments, as
well as the standards provided in this title, the City has approved special
setback standards for some planned unit developments.
Table 9-9B-4-1, "Development Standards For Planned Unit Development Overlay
Zones", of this section identifies the standards for each planned unit
development where they deviate from the requirements of this title. The City
may approve special setbacks for new planned unit developments, subject to an
amendment to this table to include the special standards.

ARTICLE C. NAVAL AIR STATION LEMOORE (NASL) OVERLAY ZONE
SECTION:
9-9C-1: Purpose
9-9C-2: Applicability
9-9C-3: Development Standards
9-9C-1: PURPOSE:
This article establishes the Naval Air Station Lemoore (NASL) overlay zoning
district for the purpose of recognizing the potential adverse impacts on the
population from Naval Air Station Lemoore and establishing special development
regulations to ensure public health, safety, and welfare. (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-
2014)
9-9C-2: APPLICABILITY:
The regulations of the Naval Air Station Lemoore (NASL) overlay zone as
provided in this article shall apply to those properties as designated on the
zoning map, generally west of State Route 41 and south of the city limits,
which fall in the military influence area (MIA). (Ord. 2013-05, 2-6-2014)
9-9C-3: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Overlay Areas: Lands within the NASL overlay zoning district are broken
down into overlay areas I, II, and III, as described in the joint land use
study. Overlay I areas are the most restrictive, applying to accident potential
zones (APZs) and areas experiencing aircraft noise greater than seventy five
decibels (>75 dB CNEL). Overlay II areas are those experiencing aircraft noise
between sixty five and seventy five decibels (65–75 dB CNEL). Overlay III areas
are those that experience aircraft noise less than sixty five decibels (<65 dB
CNEL).
Figure 9-9C-3-A, "NASL Overlay Areas", of this section illustrates the location
of these overlay areas. While there are no overlay I areas within the NASL
overlay zoning district, there are properties within overlay II and overlay
III, as well as low level flight tracking.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2357.jpg]
 
   B.   Height Limit: Restrictions on the height of structures within the NASL
overlay zone are necessary to ensure that structures will not impair flight
safety. To that end, no structure shall be built and no tree shall be allowed
to grow above a height of one hundred fifty feet (150').
   C.   Construction Requirements: Development located within overlay II and
overlay III of the NASL overlay zone where aircraft noise exceeds sixty five
decibels (65 dB CNEL) shall be constructed so as to attain an indoor noise
level of forty five decibels (45 dB CNEL). New residences shall be constructed
in accordance with noise attenuation standards of the city adopted building
code.
   D.   Development Review And Notification Required: Applications for
development, including conditional use permits, site plan and architectural
review, tentative maps, rezones, and general plan amendments, within the NASL
overlay zone shall be routed to Naval Air Station Lemoore and the federal
aviation administration for notification and review when involving tall
structures.
   E.   Disclosure Requirements: All new subdivisions of land within the NASL
overlay zone through tentative map as provided in title 8, chapter 7, article
F, "Tentative Maps", of the municipal code shall be required, as a condition of
approval, to record at time of final or parcel map an easement on all lots
created. Such easement shall identify that the property is near a military
installation subject to high aircraft noise, low level aircraft, aircraft
tests, and/or other military related issues within overlays II and III. (Ord.
