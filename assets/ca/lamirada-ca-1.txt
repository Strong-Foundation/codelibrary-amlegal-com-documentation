PREFACE
   The La Mirada Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing
Company in 1969, has been kept current by regular supplementation by its
successor in interest Matthew Bender & Company, Inc. and American Legal
Publishing of Cincinnati, Ohio.
   During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and
indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction
of the city attorney.
   The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor
decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation
without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number
designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus,
Section
6.12.070 is Section .070, located in Chapter
6.12 of Title 6. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020,
.030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to
accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to
provide for internal expansion.
   In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying
the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative
history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text
of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they
appear in the codification.
   Footnotes referring to applicable statutory provisions are located
throughout the text. A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing,
locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers.
   This supplement brings the code up to date through Ordinance 741, passed May
13, 2025..

this chapter, serve a compliance order on a responsible person using either of
the following methods:
      (1)   Personal service. The citing official may issue the administrative
citation or serve a compliance order by personal delivery thereof to a
responsible person. The citing official shall attempt to obtain on the
administrative citation or compliance order the signature of the responsible
person. If the responsible person or person served refuses or fails to sign the
administrative citation or compliance order, the failure or refusal to sign
shall not affect the validity of the citation, the compliance order or of
subsequent proceedings. Service shall be deemed effective on the date of
delivery.
      (2)   Mail. The citing official may mail the administrative citation or

post the administrative citation or compliance order on any real property
within the city in which the responsible person has a legal interest and, when

responsible person personally, by registered mail or by posting, the citing
official shall cause the administrative citation to be published once a week
for four successive weeks in a local newspaper published, in English, at least
once a week. Service shall be deemed effective upon the final date of
publication. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.090 Administrative fine.
   (a)   For any violation of this code for which there is no specific
administrative penalty established in this code or by the city council, the
fine shall be in the amount of one hundred dollars for a first violation; two
hundred dollars for a second violation of the same provision of this code
within a twelve month period; and five hundred dollars for each additional
violation of the same provision of this code within a twelve month period.
   (b)   Administrative fines assessed pursuant to an administrative citation
are a debt owed to the city. (Ord. 629, §2, 2009).
1.08.100 Payment of administrative fine.
   The fine imposed pursuant to this chapter for a particular violation and for
any subsequent violation of the same code section, shall be in the amount set
forth in the bail schedule established by resolution of the city council. The
administrative fine shall be paid to the city clerk within twenty days from the
date of service of the administrative citation. If, after a hearing requested
pursuant to this chapter, the hearing officer determines that the

refunded in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 629, § 2,
2009).

providing notice that a request for an advance deposit hardship waiver has been
filed pursuant to this chapter. A request for hearing form may be obtained from
the city clerk.
   (b)   Any responsible person desiring an administrative hearing shall file
with the city clerk a completed request for hearing form and the administrative
fine or completed hardship waiver form pursuant to this chapter within twenty
days from the date of service of the administrative citation. In the event of
any dispute as to the date of filing, the date indicated on a file stamped copy
in the city clerk's office or a city clerk-file stamped copy in the possession
of the responsible party shall control. The responsible person's failure to
file the request for hearing form and the fine or hardship waiver form within
twenty days of the date of service of the administrative citation shall
constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing.
   (c)   The person requesting the hearing shall be notified by registered mail
of the time and place of the hearing at least ten days before the date of the
hearing. Any documentation, other than the administrative citation the citing
official has submitted or will submit to the hearing officer, shall be served
on the person requesting the hearing by registered mail at least five days
before the date of the hearing. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.120 Advance deposit hardship waiver.
   (a)   Any responsible person who requests an administrative hearing and who
is financially unable to deposit the administrative fine as provided in this
chapter may file a request for an advance deposit hardship waiver. The request
shall be filed with the city clerk on an advance deposit hardship waiver
application form, available from the city clerk, no later than twenty days
after service of the administrative citation. The responsible person's failure
to file a completed form, with all supporting documents, within twenty days
after service of the administrative citation shall constitute a waiver of the
right to receive a hardship waiver. In the event of any dispute as to the date
of filing, the date indicated on a file stamped copy in the city clerk's office
or a city clerk-file stamped copy in possession of the responsible party shall
control.
   (b)   The city manager may issue an advance deposit hardship waiver only if
the person requesting the waiver submits a sworn affidavit, together with any
supporting documents, demonstrating to the satisfaction of the city manager,
the person's financial inability to deposit with the city the full amount of
the fine in advance of the hearing. The city manager shall issue a written
decision specifying the reasons for issuing or not issuing the waiver. The
decision shall be served upon the person requesting the waiver by registered
mail. The decision shall be deemed served on the date of mailing. If the city
manager determines that the waiver is not warranted, the person shall remit the
full amount of the fine to the city clerk within ten days of service of the
city manager's written decision. The City manager's decision whether to issue a
hardship waiver shall be final. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.130 Time for administrative hearing.
   Only after a request for hearing form is received by the city clerk within
the required period, and the responsible person requesting the hearing has
either deposited the administrative fine in full or obtained an advance deposit
hardship waiver (hereinafter a "perfected appeal"), shall the city set the date
and time for the administrative hearing. The hearing shall be set for a date
not less than fifteen days nor more than sixty days after an appeal becomes a
perfected appeal. The city shall send notice of the date, time, and place of
the hearing to the person requesting the hearing by registered mail at least
ten days before the date of the hearing. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.140 Request for continuance of hearing.
   The responsible person requesting a hearing may request one continuance, and
the city may continue the hearing on its own initiative, but in no event shall
the hearing begin later than ninety days after the date the appeal becomes a
perfected appeal. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.150 Appointment of administrative hearing officer.
   The city manager shall establish procedures for the selection of
administrative hearing officers. In no event, however, shall the same person
who issued the administrative citation or any person who has been "adverse" to
the recipient of the citation in any other legal or administrative proceeding,
be the administrative hearing officer. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.160 Procedures at administrative hearing.
   Administrative hearings are informal, and formal rules of evidence and
discovery do not apply. Each party shall have the opportunity to present
evidence in support of that party's case and to cross-examine witnesses. The
city bears the burden of proof at an administrative hearing to establish a
violation of the municipal code. Administrative citations, compliance orders
and any additional reports submitted by the citing official shall constitute
prima facie evidence of the facts contained in those documents. The
administrative hearing officer must use preponderance of evidence as the
standard of review in deciding the issues. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.170 Failure to attend administrative hearing.
   If the responsible person fails to attend the scheduled hearing, the hearing
will proceed without the responsible person, and the responsible person will be
deemed to have waived the right to an administrative hearing. (Ord. 629, § 2,
2009).
1.08.180 Decision of administrative hearing officer.
   The administrative hearing officer shall issue a written decision entitled
"administrative order" no later than thirty days after the date on which the
administrative hearing concludes. The administrative order shall include the
administrative hearing officer's written decision to uphold or cancel the
administrative citation. The decision shall set forth the reasons for the
decision. If the administrative hearing officer upholds the administrative
citation, the city shall retain the fine deposited by the responsible person.
If the administrative hearing officer upholds the administrative citation and
the fine has not been deposited pursuant to an advance deposit hardship waiver,
the administrative hearing officer shall specify in the decision a payment
schedule for the fine. If the administrative hearing officer cancels the
administrative citation, any fine deposited with the city shall be promptly
refunded. The administrative order shall be served upon the responsible person
by registered mail. Service shall be deemed effective on the date of mailing.
The administrative order shall become final on the date of service, and shall
notify the responsible person of the right to appeal as provided in this
chapter. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.190 Late payment charges.
   Any person who fails to pay to the city, on or before the due date, any
administrative fine imposed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall
be liable for the payment of the applicable late payment charges as follows:
   (a)   For payments received within thirty days after the due date, a late
fee in the amount of fifty percent of administrative fine due;
   (b)   For payments received more than thirty days after the due date, a late
fee in the amount of fifty percent of administrative fine due, plus an
additional ten percent of the overdue administrative fine for each month the
payment is overdue. The maximum late fee shall be one hundred percent of the
overdue administrative fine. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.200 Collection of administrative fine.
   The city may collect any past-due administrative fine or late payment
charges by use of any available legal means, including the lien procedure set
forth in this chapter. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.210 Appeal of decision of administrative hearing officer.
   Within twenty days after service of the decision of the administrative
hearing officer upon the responsible person, the responsible person may seek de
novo review of the decision by filing a notice of appeal with the Los Angeles
Superior Court. The responsible person shall serve upon the city clerk, either
in person or by registered mail, a copy of the notice of appeal. If the
responsible person fails to timely file a notice of appeal, the administrative
hearing officer's decision shall be deemed confirmed. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.220 Appeal fee.
   The responsible person seeking review of an administrative order must pay a
fee of twenty-five dollars, or such other fee as may be established, to the Los
Angeles Superior Court. In the event that the court finds in favor of the
responsible person, the city will refund this fee to the responsible person.
(Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.230 Failure to comply with administrative order or pay administrative
fine.
   Failure to comply with an administrative order after it becomes final, or to
pay an administrative fine or late payment charges, is a misdemeanor. Filing a
criminal misdemeanor action does not preclude the city from using any other
legal remedy available to gain compliance with an administrative order, or to
collect any past-due administrative fine or late payment charges. (Ord. 629, §
2, 2009).
1.08.240 Remedies cumulative.
   The conviction and punishment of any person for failure to comply with the
provisions of this chapter shall not relieve such person from paying any tax,
fee, penalty, or interest due and unpaid at the time of such conviction, nor
shall payment prevent a criminal prosecution or a civil or administrative
penalty for the violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. All
remedies shall be cumulative, and the use of any one or more remedies by the
city shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.250 Administrative penalties: continuing violations - compliance orders.
   The administrative remedy provided in this chapter for any continuing
violation of this code related to building, plumbing, electrical, mechanical or
other similar structural or zoning issues, that does not create an immediate
danger to health or safety, may be exercised in place of, or in addition to,
any other remedy which is allowed by law, whether administrative, criminal,
civil, or equitable. The city attorney or city prosecutor shall have sole
discretion to determine whether a violation will be prosecuted criminally. If a
violation is not prosecuted criminally, the city may proceed with civil or
administrative proceedings pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 629, §2, 2009).
1.08.260 Compliance order.
   Whenever the citing official determines that there exists a continuing
violation of any provision of this code related to building, plumbing,
electrical, mechanical or other similar structural or zoning issues, that does
not create an immediate danger to health or safety, the citing official shall
issue or cause to be issued a written compliance order to any responsible
person, and such order shall be served by the citing official as provided in
this chapter. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
 1.08.270 Content of compliance order.
   A compliance order shall contain all of the following information:
   (a)   The date and location of the violation and the approximate time the
violation occurred.
   (b)   The municipal code section violated and a description of the
violation.
   (c)   The action required to correct the violation and the date by which

   (a)   If the citing official determines that all violations specified in the
compliance order have been corrected within the time set forth in the order, no
further action shall be taken against the responsible person regarding the
violations.
   (b)   When a compliance order is issued, if the responsible person provides
written notice that the violation has been corrected, and if the citing
official finds compliance, the citing official shall deem the date the written
notice was postmarked or personally delivered to the city official to be the
date the violation was corrected. If, however, a final inspection confirms
compliance before mailing or personal delivery of a written notice, or if no
written notice is provided, the date of final inspection shall be the date the
violation was corrected. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.290 Failure to comply - administrative citation.
   If the responsible person fails to fully comply with the compliance order
within the time specified therein, the citing official may issue an
administrative citation as provided in this chapter. The issuance of the
administrative citation does not obviate the responsible person's obligation to
fully comply with the compliance order. (Ord. 629, § 2, 2009).
1.08.300 Decision of administrative hearing officer following appeal.
   (a)   If an administrative citation is appealed by the responsible person
and an administrative hearing is held as provided in this chapter, the
administrative hearing officer shall issue a written decision entitled
"administrative order" no later than thirty days after the date on which the
administrative hearing concludes. The administrative hearing officer shall make
findings within the administrative order regarding the existence of the
violation(s) specified in the compliance order, and regarding whether the

set forth a schedule for correction. If the administrative hearing officer
determines that the violation(s) set forth in the compliance order did not

regarding the violation(s) shall immediately cease and the administrative

costs by imposing a lien against the real property on which the violation
occurred.
   (b)   Prior to recording the lien with the Los Angeles County Recorder's
Office, the city council shall conduct a hearing to hear any protest or
objection to the lien. The citing official shall serve notice of the hearing
upon the owner of record of the real property, based on the last equalized
assessment roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is more current. The notice
of hearing shall include the time, date, and place of the hearing, and shall be

3.05.040 Purpose.
The city council declares that this chapter is adopted to achieve the
following, among other purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be
interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:
   (1)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the
requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code;
   (2)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates provisions
identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state insofar as those
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained
in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;
   (3)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and
provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State
Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable
to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the California state sales and use taxes;
   (4)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a
manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part
1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of
collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of
record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this
chapter.
(Ord. 204 § 1 (part), 1973).
3.05.050 Contract with state.
Prior to the operative date, this city shall contract with the State Board of
Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and
operation of this sales and use tax chapter; provided, that if this city has
not contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative
date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date
shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of
such a contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter
following the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter.
(Ord. 204 § 1 (part), 1973).
3.05.060 Sales tax.
For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is
imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate stated in Section

personal property sold at retail in this city on and after the operative date.
(Ord. 204 § 1 (part), 1973).
3.05.070 Place of sale.
For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place
of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is
delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a
common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts
from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject
to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is
made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state
or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail
sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be
prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.

delivery charges when such charges are subject to state sales or use tax
regardless of the place to which delivery is made.
(Ord. 204 § 1 (part), 1973).
3.05.090 Adoption of provisions of state law.
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter and except insofar as they are
inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code are adopted and made a part of this chapter as though fully set
forth herein.
(Ord. 204 § 1 (part), 1973).
3.05.100 Limitations on adoption of state law.
In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code, wherever the state is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name
of this city shall be substituted therefor. The substitution, however, shall
not be made when the word "state" is used as part of the title of the State
Controller, the State Treasurer, the State Board of Control, the State Board of
Equalization, the State Treasury or the Constitution of the state; the
substitution shall not be made when the result of that substitution would
require action to be taken by or against the city, or any agency thereof,
rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the
functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter; the
substitution shall not be made in those sections, including, but not
necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the
state, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption
from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption
of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax
while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by
the state under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales storage, use
or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject
to tax by the state under said provisions of that code; the substitution shall
not be made in Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711,
6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; and the substitution
shall not be made for the word "state" in the phrase "retailer engaged in
business in this state" in Section 6203 or in the definition of that phrase in
Section 6203.
(Ord. 204 § 1 (part), 1973).
3.05.110 Permit not required.
If a seller's permit has been issued to a retailer under Section 6067 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code, an additional seller's permit shall not be required
by this chapter.
(Ord. 204 § 1 (part), 1973).
3.05.120 Exclusions and exemptions.
   (a)   The amount subject to tax shall not include any sales or use tax
imposed by the state upon a retailer or consumer.
   (b)   The storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property,
the gross receipts from the sale of which have been subject to tax under a
sales and use tax ordinance enacted in accordance with Part 1.5 of Division 2
of the Revenue and Taxation Code by any city and county, county, or city, in
this state shall be exempt from the tax due under this chapter.
   (c)   There are exempted from the computation of the amount of the sales tax
the gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property to operators of
aircraft to be used or consumed principally outside the city in which the sale
is made and directly and exclusively in the use of such aircraft as common
carriers of persons or property under the authority of the laws of this state,
the United States, or any foreign government.

tangible personal property purchased by operators of aircraft and used or
consumed by such operators directly and exclusively in the use of such aircraft

certificate of public convenience and necessity issued pursuant to the laws of
this state, the United States, or any foreign government is exempted from the
use tax.

All subsequent amendments of the Revenue and Taxation Code which relate to the
sales and use tax and which are not inconsistent with Part 1.5 of Division 2 of
the Revenue and Taxation Code shall automatically become a part of this
chapter.
(Ord. 204 § 1 (part), 1973).
3.05.160 Enjoining collection forbidden.

issue in any suit, action or proceeding in any court against the state or this
city, or against any officer of the state or this city, to prevent or enjoin
the collection under this chapter, or Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected.

   This chapter shall be known as the "uniform transient occupancy tax
ordinance." (Ord. 267 § 1 (part) , 1978).
3.06.020 Definitions.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have
the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section:
   (1)   "Hotel" means any structure or any portion of any structure which is
occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling,
lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or
house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house,
apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer
at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.
   (2)   "Occupancy" means the use or possession or the right to the use or
possession of any rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging
or sleeping purposes.
   (3)   "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in
the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or
any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a
managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing
agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and
shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with
the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent
shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   (4)   "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (5)   "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for
the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in
money, goods, labor or otherwise including all receipts, cash, credits and
property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (6)   "Tax administrator" means the city administrator or his designee.
   (7)   "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to
occupancy by reason of concession permit, right of access, license or other
agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting
portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a
hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has
expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the
occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy.
(Ord. 267 § 1 (part), 1978).
3.06.030 Payment of transient occupancy tax.
   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to
and shall pay a tax in the amount of seven percent of the rent charged by the
operator. Commencing January 1, 2010, said tax shall increase to nine percent,
and commencing January 1, 2013, said tax shall increase to ten percent. Such
tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city, which is extinguished
only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax
to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid
in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each
installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy
space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator
of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid
directly to the tax administrator.
(Ord. 628, § 1, 2009: Ord. 399 §2, 1987; Ord. 267 §1 (part), 1978).
3.06.040 Persons deemed except from tax.

   (1)   Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the
power of the city to impose the tax provided in this chapter;
   (2)   Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by
reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty. No
exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent
is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the tax
administrator.
(Ord. 267 § 1 (part), 1978).
3.06.050 Collection--Advertising that payment of tax not required prohibited.
   Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same
extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The
amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged,
and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No

person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an
unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all
local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit
from any board, commission, department or offices of this city. This

received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time
the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to
the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting
periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to ensure
collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return.
Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any
reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held
in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax
administrator.
(Ord. 267 § 1 (part), 1978).

percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the
penalties stated in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.
   (d)   Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails

   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed
in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to
base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator procures
such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the
assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who
has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and
remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the
tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such
determination is made, the tax administrator shall give notice of the amount so
assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known
place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or
mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for
a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing
is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if
any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable. IF such application is made, the tax administrator
shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed in
this chapter to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such
notice why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax,
interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer
evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed.
After such hearing, the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be
remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner
prescribed in this chapter of such determination and the amount of such tax,
interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after
fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section
3.06.100.

the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The council shall fix a
time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in
writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of
the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the
appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any
amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of
notice.
(Ord. 267 § 1 (part), 1978).
3.06.110 Records to be kept for a period of three years.
   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment
to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a
period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount
of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the
city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at
all reasonable times.
(Ord. 267 § 1 (part), 1978).
3.06.120 Refunds.
   (a)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) of this section; provided, that a claim in writing
therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the
claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within one year of the
date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax
administrator.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a
credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the
transient to the operator.
   (c)   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than
once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a
claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) of this section, but only when
the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator or when the
transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction
of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund
from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.
(Ord. 267 § 1 (part), 1978).
3.06.130 Action by city to collect tax.
   Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this
article shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax
collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a
debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under
the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name
of the city for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 267 § 1 (part), 1978).
3.06.140 Violation of provisions of chapter deemed misdemeanor--Penalties.
   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be punishable therefor by a fine of not more than five
hundred dollars or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more
than six months or by both such fine and imprisonment.
   Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required in
this chapter, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or
refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax
administrator or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty
of a misdemeanor, and is punishable as stated above. Any person required to
make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes false or fraudulent
report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount
due required by this chapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is
punishable as aforesaid.

3.10.030 Purpose.
   This chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes, and
directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those
purposes:
   (a)   To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the
provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which
authorizes the city to adopt this tax ordinance which shall be operative if a
majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition
of the tax at an election called for that purpose.
   (b)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates
provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of
California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the
requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code.
   (c)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a
tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by
the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as
practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing
statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of
Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use
Taxes.
   (d)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes,
and at the same time, minimize the burden of recordkeeping upon persons subject
to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 654 § 1 (part), 2012).
3.10.040 Contract with state.
   Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the State Board of
Equalization to perform all functions incidental to the administration and
operation of this transactions and use tax ordinance; provided, that if the
city has not contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the
operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the
operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following
the execution of such a contract. (Ord. 654 § 1 (part), 2012).
3.10.050 Transactions tax rate.
   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is
hereby imposed upon all retailers in the incorporated territory of the city at
the rate of one percent (1.0%) of the gross receipts of any retailer from the
sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in said territory on and
after the operative date of this chapter. (Ord. 654 § 1 (part), 2012).
3.10.060 Place of sale.
   For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the
place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is
delivered by the retailer or his or her agent to an out-of-state destination or
to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross
receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are
subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which
delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in
the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which
the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and
regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.
(Ord. 654 § 1 (part), 2012).

said territory at the rate of one percent (1.0%) of the sales price of the
property. The sales price shall include delivery charges when such charges are

made. (Ord. 654 § 1 (part), 2012).
3.10.080 Adoption of provisions of state law.

inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 (commencing with Section 6001)
of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby adopted and made a
part of this chapter as though fully set forth herein. (Ord. 654 § 1 (part),

through 51034, Government Code § 37101, Business and Professions Code § 16000,

I. CABLE, VIDEO, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS
ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS
4.50.010 Title.
This Part I is known and may be cited as the "Cable, Video, and
Telecommunications Service Providers Ordinance" of the city of La Mirada.
(Ord. 568 § 2 (part), 2001).
4.50.020 Purpose and intent.
   (a)   The city council finds and determines as follows:
      (1)   The development of cable, video and telecommunications services and
systems may provide significant benefits for, and have substantial impacts
upon, the residents of the city.
      (2)   Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated
with cable, video and telecommunications services and systems, the public
convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing
regulatory powers to be exercised by the city.
      (3)   This Part I adopts provisions that authorize the city to regulate
cable, video and telecommunications service providers to the extent authorized
by federal and state law, including but not limited to the Federal Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984, the Federal Cable Television Consumer
Protection and Competition Act of 1992, the Federal Telecommunications Act of
1996, applicable regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, and
applicable California statutes and regulations.
      (4)   The cable, video and telecommunications services that are addressed
in this ordinance include services provided by cable television systems, open
video systems, master antenna television systems, satellite master antenna
television systems, direct broadcast satellite systems, multichannel multipoint
distribution systems, local multipoint distribution systems, and other
providers of video programming, whatever their technology as well as voice and
data services provided by telephone corporations.
   (b)   The purpose and intent of this Part I is to provide for the attainment
of the following objectives:
      (1)   To enable the city to discharge its public trust in a manner
consistent with rapidly evolving federal and state regulatory policies,
industry competition, and technological development;
      (2)   To authorize and to manage reasonable access to the city's public
rights-of-way and public property for cable, video and telecommunications
purposes on a competitively neutral and non-discriminatory basis;
      (3)   To obtain fair and reasonable compensation for the city and its
residents for authorizing the private use of the public rights-of-way and
public property;
      (4)   To promote competition in cable, video and telecommunications
services, minimize unnecessary local regulation of cable, video and
telecommunications service providers, and encourage the delivery of advanced
and competitive cable, video and telecommunications services on the broadest
possible basis to local government and to the businesses, institutions and
residents of the city;
      (5)   To establish clear local guidelines, standards and time frames for
the exercise of local authority with respect to the regulation of cable, video
and telecommunications service providers;
      (6)   To encourage the deployment of advanced cable, video and
telecommunications infrastructure that satisfies local needs, delivers enhanced
government services and provides informed consumer choices in an evolving
cable, video and telecommunications marketplace.
(Ord. 568 § 2 (part), 2001).
4.50.030 Defined terms and phrases.
Various terms and phrases used in this Part I are defined below in Section
4.50.170.
(Ord. 568 § 2 (part), 2001).
ARTICLE 2. CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEMS
4.50.040 Authority and findings.
   (a)   In accordance with applicable federal and state law, the city is
authorized to grant one or more non-exclusive franchises to construct,
reconstruct, operate and maintain cable television systems within the city
limits.
   (b)   The city council finds that the development of cable television and
related telecommunications services may provide significant benefits for, and
substantial impacts upon, the residents of the city. Because of the complex and
rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the city council
further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best
be served by establishing regulatory powers to be exercised by the city. This
Article 2 is intended to specify the means for providing to the public the best
possible cable television and related telecommunications services, and every
franchise issued in accordance with this Article 2 is intended to achieve this
primary objective. It is the further intent of this Article 2 to adopt
regulatory provisions that will enable the city to regulate cable television
and related telecommunications services to the maximum extent authorized by
federal and state law.
(Ord. 568 § 2 (part), 2001).
4.50.050 Franchise terms and conditions.
   (a)   Franchise Purposes. A franchise granted by the city under the
provisions of this Article 2 may authorize the grantee to do the following:
      (1)   To engage in the business of providing cable service and such other
telecommunications services as may be authorized by law and which grantee
elects to provide to its subscribers within the designated franchise service
area;
      (2)   To erect, install, construct, repair, rebuild, reconstruct,
replace, maintain, and retain, cable lines, related electronic equipment,
supporting structures, appurtenances and other property in connection with the
operation of the cable system in, on, over, under, upon, along and across
streets or other public places within the designated franchise service area;
      (3)   To maintain and operate the franchise properties for the
origination, reception, transmission, amplification and distribution of
television and radio signals, and for the delivery of cable services and such
other services as may be authorized by law.
   (b)   Franchise Required. It is unlawful for any person to construct,
install, or operate a cable television system within any street or public way
in the city without first obtaining a franchise under the provisions of this
Article 2
   (c)   Term of the Franchise.
      (1)   A franchise granted under this Article 2 will be for the term
specified in the franchise agreement, commencing upon the effective date of the
ordinance or resolution adopted by the city council that authorizes the
franchise.
      (2)   A franchise granted under this Article 2 may be renewed upon
application by the grantee in accordance with the then-applicable provisions of
state and federal law and this Article 2.
   (d)   Franchise Territory. A franchise is effective within the territorial
limits of the city, and within any area added to the city during the term of
the franchise, unless otherwise specified in the ordinance or resolution
granting the franchise or in the franchise agreement.
   (e)   Federal or State Jurisdiction. This Article 2 will be construed in a
manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws, and it applies to
all franchises granted or renewed after the effective date of this Part I, to
the extent authorized by applicable law.
   (f)   Franchise Non-Transferable.
      (1)   Grantee may not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, or dispose
of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary
sale, contract, consolidation, or otherwise, the franchise or any of the rights
or privileges therein granted, without the prior written consent of the city
council and then only upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by
the city council, which consent may not be unreasonably denied or delayed.
      (2)   The requirements of subsection (f)(1) apply to any change in
control of grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to the
ownership of major stockholder or partnership interests, but includes actual
working control in whatever manner exercised. If grantee is a partnership or a
corporation prior authorization of the city council is required where ownership
or control of twenty five percent or more of the partnership interests or of
the voting stock of grantee, or any company in the tier of companies
controlling the grantee, whether directly or indirectly, is acquired by a
person or a group of persons acting in concert, none of whom, singularly or
collectively owns or controls those partnership interests or that voting stock
of the grantee, or grantee's upper tier of controlling companies, as of the
effective date of the franchise.
      (3)   Grantee must notify the city in writing of any foreclosure or
judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the grantee's franchise property,
or upon the termination of any lease or other interest covering all or a
substantial part of that franchise property. That notification will be
considered by the city as notice that a change in control of ownership of the
franchise has taken place, and the provisions of this paragraph that require
the prior written consent of the city council to that change in control of
ownership will apply.
      (4)   For the purpose of determining whether it will consent to an
acquisition, transfer, or change in control, the city may inquire as to the
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and grantee
must assist the city in that inquiry. In seeking the city's consent to any
change of ownership or control, grantee or the proposed transferee, or both,
must complete Federal Communications Commission Form 394 or its equivalent.
This application must be submitted to the city not less than one hundred twenty
days prior to the proposed date of transfer. The transferee must establish that
it possesses the legal, financial, and technical capability to operate and
maintain the cable system and to comply with all franchise requirements during
the remaining term of the franchise. If the legal, financial, and technical
qualifications of the proposed transferee are determined to be satisfactory,
then the city will consent to the transfer of the franchise.
      (5)   Any financial institution holding a pledge of the grantee's assets
to secure the advance of money for the construction or operation of the
franchise property has the right to notify the city that it, or a designee
satisfactory to the city, will take control of and operate the cable television
system upon grantee's default in its financial obligations. Further, that
financial institution must also submit a plan for such operation within ninety
days after assuming control. The plan must insure continued service and
compliance with all franchise requirements during the period that the financial
institution will exercise control over the system. The financial institution
may not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding eighteen months
unless authorized by the city, in its sole discretion, and during that period
of time it will have the right to petition the city to transfer the franchise
to another grantee.
      (6)   Grantee must reimburse the city for the city's reasonable review
and processing expenses incurred in connection with any transfer or change in
control of the franchise. These expenses may include, without limitation, costs
of administrative review, financial, legal, and technical evaluation of the
proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all
costs incurred by these experts), notice and publication costs, and document
preparation expenses. The total amount of these reimbursable expenses may be
subject to maximum limits that are specified in the franchise agreement between
the city and the grantee. No reimbursement may be offset against any franchise
fee payable to the city during the term of the franchise.
   (g)   Geographical Coverage.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement, grantee must
design, construct, and maintain the cable television system to have the
capability to pass every dwelling unit and commercial building in the franchise
service area, subject to any service-area line extension requirements or
territorial restrictions set forth in the franchise agreement.
      (2)   After service has been established within all or any part of the
franchise service area by activating trunk or distribution cables, grantee must
provide service to any requesting subscriber within that activated part of the
service area within seven days from the date of request, provided that the
grantee is able to secure on reasonable terms and conditions all rights-of-way
necessary to extend service to that subscriber within that seven-day period.
   (h)   Non-exclusive Franchise. Every franchise granted is non-exclusive. The
city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional
franchises for a cable television system that it deems appropriate, subject to
applicable state and federal law. If an additional franchise proposed to be
granted to a subsequent grantee, a noticed public hearing must first be held if
required by the provisions of Government Code § 53066.3.
   (i)   Multiple Franchises.
      (1)   The city may grant any number of franchises, subject to applicable
state and federal law. The city may limit the number of franchises granted,
based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law
and the following specific local considerations:
         (A)   The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple
cables in addition to the cables, conduits, and pipes of the existing utility
systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas, and sewerage;
         (B)   The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result of cable
system competition, such as lower rates and improved service;
         (C)   The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition,
such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and the
disruption arising from numerous excavations within the public rights-of-way.
      (2)   The city may require that any new grantee be responsible for its
own underground trenching and the associated costs if, in the city's opinion,
the rights-of-way in any particular area cannot reasonably accommodate
additional cables.
(Ord. 568 § 2 (part), 2001).

interconnect their networks for the purpose of providing PEG access channel
programming. Interconnection may be accomplished by direct cable, microwave
link, satellite, or other reasonable method of connection. State video
franchise holders and incumbent cable operators shall provide interconnection
of the PEG access channels on reasonable terms and conditions and may not
withhold the interconnection. If a state video franchise holder and an
incumbent cable operator cannot reach a mutually acceptable interconnection
agreement, the city may require the incumbent cable operator to allow the state
video franchise holder to interconnect its network with the incumbent's network
at a technically feasible point on the holder's network as identified by the
holder. If no technically-feasible point for interconnection is available, the
state video franchise holder shall make an interconnection available to the
channel originator and shall provide the facilities necessary for the
interconnection. The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by the state
video franchise holder requesting the interconnection unless otherwise agreed
to by the parties.
   (h)   Emergency Alert System and Emergency Overrides. A state video
franchise holder must comply with the emergency alert system requirements of
the Federal Communications Commission in order that emergency messages may be
distributed over the holder's network. Provisions in city-issued franchises
authorizing the city to provide local emergency notifications shall remain in
effect, and shall apply to all state video franchise holders in the city for
the duration of the city-issued franchise, or until the term of the franchise
would have expired had it not been terminated pursuant to subdivision (m) of
Section 5840 of the California Public Utilities Code, or until January 1, 2009,
whichever is later.
   (i)   Encroachment Permit Applications and Appeal Procedures.
      (1)   As used in this paragraph (i), the term "encroachment permit" means
any permit issued by the city relating to construction or operation of
facilities in public rights-of-way by the holder of a state video franchise.
      (2)   The city shall either approve or deny an application from a holder
of a state video franchise for an encroachment permit within sixty days of
receiving a completed application.
      (3)   If the city denies an application for an encroachment permit, the

council in accordance with the following procedures:

or action requested from the city council.
         (C)   The notice of appeal must be accompanied by such fee as may have
been established by resolution of the city council.
         (D)   Upon the timely filing of a notice of appeal in proper form, the
city clerk will schedule the matter for hearing by the city council at a
regular meeting, but not later than forty-five days after receipt of the notice
of appeal. The city clerk will cause the notice of hearing to be given to the
appellant not less than ten days prior to the hearing, unless that notice is
waived in writing by the appellant. The city clerk will also cause a copy of
the notice of appeal and the hearing to be transmitted to the city official or
body whose decision is being appealed.
         (E)   At the time of consideration of the appeal by the city council,
the appellant will be limited to a presentation on the specific grounds of
appeal and related matters set forth in its notice of appeal. The appellant
will have the burden of persuading the city council that the decision appealed
from should be reversed or modified.
         (F)   The city council may continue the hearing on the appeal from
time to time as may be deemed necessary. The city council may, by resolution,
affirm, reverse, or modify, in whole or in part, the decision appealed from and
may take any action that might have been taken in the first instance by the
city official or body from whose decision the appeal has been taken.
         (G)   The decision of the city council will be deemed final and
conclusive upon adoption of the resolution. A copy of the resolution adopted by
the city council will be served upon the appellant by placement in the United

4.50.110 Review of the application.
Within thirty days after receipt of an application filed under Section
4.50.100 that is deemed to be complete, the city manager will give written
notice to the applicant of the city's intent to negotiate an agreement setting
forth the terms and conditions under which the operation of the proposed open
video system will be authorized by the city. The commencement of those
negotiations will be on a date that is mutually acceptable to the city and to
the applicant.
(Ord. 568 § 2 (part), 2001).
4.50.120 Agreement required.
   (a)   No video programming services may be provided in the city by an open
video system operator unless the operator and the city have executed a written
agreement, which may be designated as a franchise, setting forth the terms and
conditions under which the operation of the proposed open video system will be
authorized by the city.
   (b)   The agreement between the city and the open video system operator may
contain provisions that relate to the following subject matters, to the extent
that such provisions and subject matters are not pre-empted by federal law or
regulations:
      (1)   The nature, scope, and duration of the agreement, including
provisions for its renewal or extension;
      (2)   The obligation of the open video system operator to pay to the
city, at specified times and in lieu of the franchise fees permitted under
Section 622 of the Communications Act, fees on the gross revenue received by
the operator, as authorized by 47 CFR 76.1511, in accordance with the following
standards and procedures:
         (A)   The amount of the fees on the gross revenue will be the maximum
amount authorized by Section 653(c)(2)(B) of the Communications Act, which is
the rate imposed by the city on the existing franchised cable operator.
         (B)   The term "gross revenue" has the meaning set forth in 47 CFR
76.1511, and includes: (1) all gross revenue received by an open video system
operator or its affiliates, including all revenue received from subscribers and
all carriage revenue received from unaffiliated video programming providers;
and (2) all advertising revenue received by the operator or its affiliates in
connection with the provision of video programming, where such revenue is
included in the calculation of the cable franchise fee paid to the city by the
franchised cable operator. The term "gross revenue" does not include revenue,
such as subscriber or advertising revenue, collected by unaffiliated video
programming providers.
      (3)   The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with
requirements relating to information collection and record keeping, accounting
procedures, reporting, periodic audits and inspection of records in order to
ensure the accuracy of the fees on the gross revenue that are required to be
paid as specified above in subsection 2;
      (4)   The obligation of the open video system operator to meet the city's
requirements with respect to public, educational and governmental access
channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment, as provided for in 47
CFR 76.1505. In this regard, the following standards and procedures are
applicable:
         (A)   The open video system operator is subject to the same public,
educational and governmental access requirements that apply within the cable
television franchise service area with which its system overlaps.
         (B)   The open video system operator must ensure that all subscribers
receive all public, educational, and governmental access channels within the
franchise service area in which the city's subscribers are located.
         (C)   The open video system operator may negotiate with the city to
establish the operator's obligations with respect to public, educational and
governmental access channel capacity services, facilities, and equipment. These
negotiations may include the city's franchised cable operator if the city, the
open video system operator, and the franchised cable operator so desire.
         (D)   If the open video system operator and the city are unable to
reach an agreement regarding the operator's obligations with respect to public,
education and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities and
equipment within the city's jurisdictions then the following obligations will
be imposed:
            (i)   The open video system operator must satisfy the same public,
educational and governmental access obligations as the city's franchised cable
operator by providing the same amount of channel capacity for public,
educational and governmental access and by matching the city's franchised cable
operator's annual financial contributions in support of public, educational and
governmental access services, facilities and equipment that are actually used
by the city. For in-kind contributions such as cameras or production studios,
the open video system operator may satisfy its statutory obligation by
negotiating mutually agreeable terms with city's franchised cable operators so
that public, educational and governmental access services to the city are
improved or increased. If such terms cannot be agreed upon, the open video
system operator must pay to the city the monetary equivalent of the franchised
cable operator's depreciated in-kind contribution, or, in the case of
facilities, the annual amortization value. Any matching contributions provided
by the open video system operator must be used to fund activities arising under
Section 611 of the Communications Act.
            (ii)   The city will impose upon the open video system operator the
same rules and procedures that it imposes upon the franchised cable operator
with regard to the open video system operator's use of channel capacity
designated for public, educational and governmental access use when that
capacity is not being used for such purposes.
         (E)   The city's franchised cable operator is required under federal
law to permit the open video system operator to connect with its public,
educational and governmental access channel feeds. The open video system
operator and the franchised cable operator may decide how to accomplish this
connection, taking into consideration the physical and technical
characteristics of the cable and the open video systems involved. If the
franchised cable operator and the open video system operator cannot agree on
how to accomplish the connection, the city has the right to decide. The city
may require that the connection occur on city-owned property or on public
rights-of-way.
         (F)   All costs of connection to the franchised cable operator's
public, educational and governmental access channel feed must be borne by the
open video system operator. These costs will be counted towards the open video
system operator's matching financial contributions set forth above in
subparagraph(D)(i).
         (G)   The city will not impose upon the open video system operator any
public, educational, or governmental access obligations that are greater than
those imposed upon the franchised cable operator.
         (H)   If there is no existing franchised cable operator, the
provisions of 47 CFR 76.1606(d)(6) will be applicable in determining the
obligations of the open video system operator.
         (I)   The open video system operator must adjust its system to comply
with new public, educational and access obligations imposed on the city's
franchised cable operator following a renewal of the cable television
franchise; provided, however, that the open video system operator will not be
required-to displace other programmers using its open video system to
accommodate public, educational and governmental access channels. The open
video system operator must comply with such new public, educational and
governmental access obligations whenever additional capacity is or becomes
available, whether it is due to increased channel capacity or to decreased
demand for channel capacity.
      (5)   If the city and the open video system operator cannot agree on the
application of the FCC's rules regarding the open video system operator's
obligations to provide public, educational and governmental access under the
provisions of subsection (4) set forth above, then either party may file a
complaint with the FCC in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set
forth in 47 CFR 76.1514. No agreement will be executed by the city until the
dispute has been finally resolved;
      (6)   If the open video system operator intends to maintain an
institutional network, as defined in Section 611(f) of the Communications Act,
the city will require that educational and governmental access channels be
designated on that institutional network to the same extent that those channels
are designated on the institutional network of the city's franchised cable
operator;
      (7)   The authority of an open video system operator to exercise
editorial control over any public, educational, or governmental use of channel
capacity will be restricted in accordance with the provisions of 47 CFR 76.1505
(f);
      (8)   The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with all
applicable federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations
relating to customer service standards, including the Cable Television and
Video Customer Service and Information Act (Government Code §§ 53054 et seq.),
the Video Customer Service Act (Government Code §§ 53088 et seq.), and Section
6-2.08 of Article 2 of this Part I;
      (9)   If new physical plant is proposed to be constructed within the
city, the obligation of the open video system operator to comply with the
following rights-of-way use and management responsibilities that are also
imposed by the city upon other cable television and telecommunications service
providers in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner:
         (A)   Compliance with all applicable city codes, including
applications for excavation, encroachment and construction permits and the
payment of all required permit and inspection fees;
         (B)   The coordination of construction activities;
         (C)   Compliance with established standards and procedures for
constructing lines across private property;
         (D)   Compliance with all applicable insurance and indemnification
requirements;
         (E)   The repair and resurfacing of construction- damaged streets;
         (F)   Compliance with all public safety requirements that are
applicable to cable television and telecommunications service providers using
public property or public rights-of-way.
      (10)   Acts or omissions constituting breaches or defaults of the
agreement, and the applicable penalties, liquidated damages, and other
remedies, including fines or the suspension, revocation, or termination of the
agreement;
      (11)   Requirements relating to the sale, assignment, or transfer of the
open video system;
      (12)   Requirements relating to the open video system operator's
compliance with and implementation of state and federal laws, rules and
regulations pertaining to the operation of the open video systems;
      (13)   Such additional requirements, conditions, terms, policies and
procedures as may be mutually agreed upon by the city and the open video system
operator and that will, in the judgment of the city council, best serve the
public interest and protect the public health, welfare and safety.
(Ord. 568 § 2 (part), 2001).
ARTICLE 4. OTHER VIDEO AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND SYSTEMS
4.50.130 Other multichannel video programming distributors.
The term "cable system" as defined in federal law and as set forth in Section
4.50.170 below, does not include a facility that serves subscribers without
using any public rights-of-way. Consequently, the categories of multichannel
video programming identified below are not deemed to be "cable systems" and are
therefore exempt from the city's franchise requirements and from certain other
local regulatory provisions authorized by federal law, provided that their
distribution or transmission facilities do not involve the use of the city's
public rights-of-way:
   (a)   Multichannel multipoint distribution service ("MMDS"), also known as
wireless cable, which typically involves the transmission by an FCC-licensed
operator of numerous broadcast stations from a central location using line-of-
sight technology;
   (b)   Local multipoint distribution service ("LMDS"), another form of over-
the-air wireless video service for which licenses are auctioned by the FCC, and
which offers video programming, telephony and data networking services;
   (c)   Direct broadcast satellite ("DBS"), also referred to as "direct-to-
home satellite services," which involves the distribution or broadcasting of
programming or services by satellite directly to the subscriber's premises
without the use of ground receiving or distribution equipments except at the
subscriber's premises or in the uplink process to the satellite. Local
regulation of direct-to-home satellite services is further proscribed by the
following federal statutory provisions:
      (1)   47 U.S.C. § 303(v) confers upon the FCC exclusive jurisdiction to
regulate the provision of direct-to-home satellite services;
      (2)   Section 602 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 states that a
provider of direct-to-home satellite service is exempt from the collection or
remittance, or both, of any tax or fee imposed by any local taxing jurisdiction
on direct-to-home satellite service. The terms "tax" and "fee" are defined by
federal statute to mean any local sales tax, local use tax, local intangible
tax, local income tax, business license tax, utility tax, privilege tax, gross
receipts tax, excise tax, franchise fees, local telecommunications tax, or any
other tax, license, or fee that is imposed for the privilege of doing business,
regulating, or raising revenue for a local taxing jurisdiction.
(Ord. 568 § 2 (part), 2001).
4.50.140 Video providers--Registration--Customer service standard.
   (a)   Unless the customer protection and customer service obligations of a
video provider, as that term is defined in Section
4.50.170, are specified in a franchise, license, lease, or similar written
agreement with the city, a video provider must comply with all applicable
provisions of the following state statutes:
      (1)   The Cable Television and Video Customer Service and Information Act
(Government Code §§ 53054 et seq.);
      (2)   The Video Customer Service Act (Government Code §§ 53088 et seq.);
   (b)   All video providers that are operating in the city on the effective
date of this Part I, or that intend to operate in the city after its effective
date, must register with the city; provided, however, that this registration
requirement is not applicable to any video provider that has executed a
franchise, license, lease or similar written agreement with the city. The
registration form must include or be accompanied by the following:
      (1)   The video provider's name, address, and local telephone numbers;
      (2)   The names of the officers of the video provider;
      (3)   A copy of the video provider's written policies and procedures
relating to customer service standards and the handling of customer complaints,
as required by Government Code §§ 53054 et seq. These customer service
standards must include, without limitation, standards regarding the following:
         (A)   Installation, disconnection, service and repair obligations,
employee identification and service call response time and scheduling;
         (B)   Customer telephone and office hours;
         (C)   Procedures for billing, charges, refunds, and credits;
         (D)   Procedures for termination of service;
         (E)   Notice of the deletion of a programming service, the changing of
channel assignments, or an increase in rates;
         (F)   Complaint procedures and procedures for bill dispute resolution;
         (G)   The video provider's written commitment to distribute annually
to the city, and to its employees and customers, a notice describing the
customer service standards specified above in subparagraphs (A) through (F).
This annual notice must include the report of the video provider on its
performance in meeting its customer service standards, as required by
Government Code § 53055.2.
      (4)   Unless a video provider is exempt under federal law from its
payment, a registration fee in an amount established by resolution of the city
council to cover the reasonable costs incurred by the city in reviewing and
processing the registration form;
      (5)   In addition to the registration fee specified above in subsection
(4), the written commitment of the video provider to pay to the city, when due,
all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the city in resolving any
disputes between the video provider and its subscribers, which dispute
resolution is mandated by Government Code § 53088.2(o).
   (c)   The city council may establish by ordinance a schedule of monetary
penalties for the material breach by a video provider of its obligations under
subparagraphs (a) through (n) of Government Code § 53088.2. As used herein, the
term "material breach" means any substantial and repeated failure to comply
with the consumer service standards set forth in Government Code § 53088.2. The
provisions of that ordinance must be consistent with the provisions of
Government Code § 53088.2. The schedule of monetary penalties may also impose a
penalty, as authorized by Government Code § 53056(a), for the failure of a
video provider to distribute the annual notice required by Government Code §
53055.1, which penalty may not exceed $500 for each year in which the notice is
not distributed as required by state statute.
(Ord. 568 § 2 (part), 2001).
4.50.150 Telecommunications service provided by telephone corporations.
   (a)   The city council finds and determines as follows:
      (1)   The federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempts and declares
invalid all state rules that restrict entry or limit competition in both local
and long-distance telephone service.
      (2)   The California Public Utilities Commission ("CPUC") is primarily
responsible for the implementation of local telephone competition, and it
issues certificates of public convenience and necessity to new entrants that
are qualified to provide competitive local telephone exchange services and
related telecommunications service, whether using their own facilities or the
facilities or services provided by other authorized telephone corporations.
      (3)   Section 234(a) of the California Public Utilities Code defines a
"telephone corporation" as every corporation or person owning, controlling,
operating, or managing any telephone line for compensation within this state.
      (4)   Section 616 of the California Public Utilities Code provides that a
telephone corporation may condemn any property necessary for the construction
and maintenance of its telephone line.
      (5)   Section 2902 of the California Public Utilities Code authorizes
municipal corporations to retain their powers of control to supervise and
regulate the relationships between a public utility and the general public in
matters affecting the health, convenience and safety of the general public,
including matters such as the use and repair of public streets by any public
utility and the location of the poles, wires, mains, or conduits of any public
utility on, under, or above any public streets.
      (6)   Section 7901 of the California Public Utilities Code authorizes
telephone and telegraph corporations to construct telephone or telegraph lines
along and upon any public road or highway along or across any of the waters or
lands within this state and to erect poles, posts, piers, or abutments for
supporting the insulators, wires, and other necessary fixtures of their lines,
in such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the
road or highway or interrupt the navigation of the waters.
      (7)   Section 7901.1 of the California Public Utilities Code confirms the
right of municipalities to exercise reasonable control as to the time, place,
and manner in which roads, highways, and waterways are accessed, Which control
must be applied to all entities in an equivalent manner. Nothing in Section
7901.1 adds to or subtracts from any existing authority that municipalities
have with respect to the imposition of fees.
      (8)   Section 50030 of the California Government Code provides that any
permit fee imposed by a city for the placement, installation, repair, or
upgrading of telecommunications facilities, such as lines, poles, or antennas,
by a telephone corporation that has obtained all required authorizations from
the CPUC and the FCC to provide telecommunications services, must not exceed
the reasonable costs of providing the service for which the fee is charged, and
must not be levied for general revenue purposes.
   (b)   In recognition of and in compliance with the statutory authorizations
and requirements set forth above in paragraph (a), the following regulatory
provisions are applicable to a telephone corporation that desires to provide
telecommunications service by means of facilities that are proposed to be
constructed within the city's public rights-of-way:
      (1)   The telephone corporation must apply for and obtain, as may be
applicable, an excavation permit, an encroachment permit, or a building permit
("ministerial permit").
      (2)   In addition to the information required by this code in connection
with an application for a ministerial permit, a telephone corporation must
submit to the city the following supplemental information:
         (A)   A copy of the certificate of public convenience and necessity
issued by the CPUC to the applicant, and a copy of the CPUC decision that
authorizes the applicant to provide the telecommunications service for which
the facilities are proposed to be constructed in the city's public rights-of-
way. Any applicant that, prior to 1996, provided telecommunications service
under administratively equivalent documentation issued by the CPUC may submit
copies of that documentation in lieu of a certificate of public convenience and
necessity.
         (B)   If the applicant has obtained from the CPUC a certificate of
public convenience and necessity to operate as a "competitive local carrier,"
the following additional requirements are applicable:
            (i)   As required by Decision No. 95-12-057 of the CPUC, the
applicant must establish that it has timely filed with the city a quarterly
report that describes the type of construction and the location of each
construction project proposed to be undertaken in the city during the calendar
quarter in which the application is filed, so that the city can coordinate
multiple projects as may be necessary.
            (ii)   If the applicant's proposed construction project will extend
beyond the utility rights-of-way into undisturbed areas or other rights-of-way,
the applicant must establish that it has filed a petition with the CPUC to
amend its certificate of public convenience and necessity and that the proposed
construction project has been subjected to a full-scale environmental analysis
by the CPUC, as required by Decision No. 95-12-057 of the CPUC.
            (iii)   The applicant must inform the city whether its proposed
construction project will be subject to any of the mitigation measures
specified in the Negative Declaration "Competitive Local Carriers (CLCS)
Projects for Local Exchange Communication Service throughout California or to
the Mitigation Monitoring Plan adopted in connection with Decision No. 95-12-
057 of the CPUC. The city's issuance of a ministerial permit will be
conditioned upon the applicant's compliance with all applicable mitigation
measures and monitoring requirements imposed by the CPUC upon telephone
corporations that are designated as "competitive local carriers."
   (c)   The city reserves all rights that it now possesses or may later
acquire with respect to the regulation of any cable or telecommunications
service that is provided or proposed to be provided by a telephone corporation.
These reserved rights may relate, without limitation, to the imposition of
reasonable conditions in addition to or different from those set forth in this
section, the exaction of a fee or other form of consideration or compensation
for use of public rights-of-way, and related matters provided, however, that
such regulatory rights and authority must be consistent with federal and state
law that is applicable to cable or telecommunications services provided by
telephone corporations.
(Ord. 568 § 2 (part), 2001).
ARTICLE 5. USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY
4.50.160 Findings--Policies and procedures.
   (a)   The city council finds and determines that numerous and repetitive
excavations in the public rights-of-way diminish the useful life of the surface
pavement and generally cause adverse negative impacts for local residents,
local businesses, and vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The city council
further finds and determines that the utility substructure in the public
rights-of-way is subject to potential adverse negative impacts as a consequence
of new economic and regulatory policies that foster increased competition
between various utility service providers, including telephone corporations,
and between other service providers, such as cable system operators. In order
to mitigate these potential adverse negative impacts, the following policies
are adopted:
      (1)   The city manager is directed to develop and to implement public
rights-of-way policies and procedures that incorporate, to the extent
reasonably feasible and consistent with all applicable laws and regulations,
the following requirements that are intended to encourage the shared use by
utility and other service providers of existing facilities in the public
rights-of-way:
         (A)   A requirement that utility and other service providers
requesting permits review information provided by the city that identifies the
location of facilities, such as underground conduits, that are available for
shared use, and the owners of those facilities;
         (B)   A requirement that utility and other service providers
requesting permits submit a written statement that describes in reasonable
detail the efforts made to obtain from other utility service providers the
right to use excess capacity within existing facilities, and to thereby avoid
the construction of new facilities;
         (C)   A requirement that utility and other service providers occupying
the public rights-of-way submit annually to the city a map, which may be in a
uniform electronic data format to be specified by the city, that shows the
location of their respective facilities in the public rights-of-way.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an updated annual map need not be provided
unless there are changes to the location of the service provider's facilities
in the public rights-of-way;
         (D)   Such additional requirements as will encourage utility and other
service providers to share excess capacity within previously-constructed
facilities and to coordinate the construction of new facilities so as to
minimize the number of excavations in the public rights-of-way.
      (2)   The city manager is directed to ensure that all utility and other
service providers, including telephone corporations and cable system operators,
comply with all local design, construction, maintenance and safety standards
that are consistent with state and federal laws and regulations and that are
contained within, or are related to, any permit that authorizes the
construction of facilities within the public rights-of-way, including all
applicable insurance provisions.
      (3)   Based upon the city's projected plans for street construction or
renovation projects, the city manager is authorized to establish on a quarterly
basis one or more construction time periods or "windows" for the installation
of facilities within the public rights-of-way. Cable system operators,
telephone corporations, and other utility service providers that submit
applications for permits to construct facilities after a predetermined date may
be required to delay such construction until the next quarterly "window" that
is established by the city.
   (b)   The city council finds and determines that the installation in the
public rights-of-way of numerous aboveground facilities by utility service
providers, including telephone corporations, and other service providers may
create safety hazards and adverse visual impacts. Consequently, the Public
Works Department is authorized to impose reasonable conditions in order to
mitigate those potential adverse impacts that may result, whether on an
individual or a cumulative basis, from permitted aboveground facilities. Those
conditions may include or relate to, without limitation, the following:
      (1)   Prior to issuance of the requisite permits, all above-ground
facilities proposed to be installed by a utility or other service provider in
the public rights-of-way must be clearly delineated on the plans when they are
submitted for the city's review;
      (2)   The design and installation by qualified professionals of
landscaping and barriers to minimize public view of above-ground facilities
whose location has been approved by the city;
      (3)   The maintenance of all above-ground facilities in good condition,
including compliance with the city's ordinances regarding graffiti removal. In
this regard, a utility or other service provider may be required to affix to
its above-ground facilities a coded label or marker that identifies the
specific facility and sets forth a telephone number that may be called to
report any damage, destruction, or graffiti vandalism involving that facility;
      (4)   The placement of above-ground facilities, such as overhead drops,
as close as possible to other utility drops, consistent with all applicable
electrical codes;
      (5)   Reasonable limitations upon the number of above- ground facilities
that may be installed within a designated geographical area;
      (6)   Reasonable limitations upon the dimensions or volume, or both, of
above-ground facilities;
      (7)   The specification of colors of above-ground facilities reasonably
requested by the city to ensure that these facilities blend with the
surrounding environment to the maximum extent possible;
      (8)   Such additional conditions regulating the time, place, and manner
of installations of above-ground facilities as will reasonably mitigate
potential safety hazards and adverse visual impacts attributable to these
facilities.
   (c)   The city reserves all rights that it now possesses or may later
acquire to adopt and implement citywide requirements for the under grounding of
above-ground facilities, or any portion thereof, in a competitively neutral and
non-discriminatory manner. To the extent authorized by law, all utility and
other service providers will be required to comply with those requirements at
their sole expense.

misdemeanor and is punishable as provided for in Chapter 1.08 of Title 1 of
this code.
   (b)   The misdemeanor penalty specified above in paragraph (a) is not

4.50.190 Severability.
If any provision of this Part I is determined by any court of competent
jurisdiction, or by any federal or state agency having jurisdiction over its
subject matter, to be invalid and in conflict with any paramount federal or
state law or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is determined by that
court or agency to require modification in order to conform to the requirements
of that paramount law or regulation, then that provision will be deemed a
separate, distinct, and independent part of this Part I, and such determination
will not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provisions. If
that paramount federal or state law or regulation is subsequently repealed or
amended so that the provision of this Part I determined to be invalid or
subject to modification is no longer in conflict with that law or regulation,
then that provision will again become effective and will thereafter be binding
on the city and any affected cable or telecommunications service provider;
provided, however, that the city must give the affected cable or
telecommunications service provider 30 days written notice of that change
before requiring compliance with that provision, or such longer period of time
as may be reasonably required for the cable or telecommunications service
provider to comply with that provision.

and written agreement entered into prior to the conclusion of the subject term

finance director only for the minimum license period of any such business, and
may be renewed for the same period under the same conditions and in the same
manner as originally obtained.

specified in this chapter as meriting exemption from license requirements
exists as to any person to whom any such exemption has been allowed, the
finance director may revoke such exemption and the exempt license issued

investigation of a police officer on the scene or by the lack of a police
report filed by the occupant or property owner, and no individual who was on or
near the premises or who viewed a video communication from, or live-monitored
the premises called for the dispatch or confirmed a need for police response;

Alternative to providing such response, the alarm system may be equipped with
an automatic shut-off device which shall silence the alarm within fifteen
minutes after activation when the alarm system is protecting a residential
structure or within thirty minutes of activation when the alarm system is
protecting a commercial or industrial structure. The failure of an alarm
subscriber to comply with the response and alarm silencing time limits set
forth herein shall be chargeable as a false alarm. (Ord. 649 § 2, 2012)
9.06.050 Alarm businesses and agents.
   All alarm company operators performing services in the City of La Mirada
shall obtain a city business license, and all such operators and alarm agents
shall register their name and file a copy of their state identification card,
license, or permit with the Alarm System Coordinator. Each alarm agent while
engaged in the duties of an alarm agent shall carry on such agent’s person at
all times the state identification card, license, or permit and shall display
same to the Alarm Officer when requested. No alarm system may be installed by

   No alarm system, not including automatic dialing device alarms, shall be
operated unless the alarm subscriber has entered into a service contract with
an alarm company operator providing for service twenty-four hours per day.
Every alarm system shall be equipped so that it shall not activate in the event
of a power outage unless there exists an emergency situation for which the
alarm was designed to detect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any alarm
subscriber whose alarm system provides only an audible alarm and does not send
an alarm notification to a monitoring company or to any public safety agency,
may request a waiver of the requirements of this section by submitting a
written request for waiver to the Alarm System Coordinator. The request shall
state the location, make, model, and type of alarm system, and shall include
manufacturer’s information verifying that the alarm is designed to
automatically silence after no more than fifteen total minutes of activation
when used for a residential structure, or thirty minutes when used for a
commercial structure. Only alarm systems that are equipped and operated to
automatically silence after no more than fifteen total minutes (residential) or
thirty total minutes (commercial) of activation, are eligible for a waiver. The
Alarm System Coordinator may inspect the alarm system and/or require provision
of any additional information deemed necessary to ensure compliance with this
section. Any waiver issued pursuant to this section may be revoked, after
written notice, for failure to comply with the requirements of this section.
The issuance of a waiver shall not affect the liability of an alarm subscriber
for false alarm charges. (Ord. 649 § 2, 2012).
9.06.080 Maintenance and inspections.
   A.   Maintenance. Each alarm subscriber shall maintain each alarm system in
good working order, and provide the necessary service to prevent malfunctions.
   B.   Inspections. The Alarm Officer may require an alarm subscriber to have
a nuisance alarm system inspected at the subscriber’s expense, by the company
providing the alarm subscriber’s alarm services, or other person qualified to
inspect and service such equipment. Inspections shall be complete enough to
detect any likely malfunctions and shall include testing of the equipment.
Particular attention shall be paid to the conditions that have the potential of
causing false alarms. The person making the inspection shall provide a written
report to the alarm subscriber and the Alarm System Coordinator, detailing
measures taken to eliminate the likelihood of further false alarms caused by
the alarm system. The report shall be kept on the premises for two years, and
shall be subject to inspection by the Alarm System Coordinator upon request.
(Ord. 649 § 2, 2012).
9.06.090 Reimbursement for false alarm responses.
   Each alarm subscriber shall reimburse the City for the cost of law
enforcement or fire personnel and equipment responses to ‘excessive false
alarms’ as defined in, and in such amount as set by, resolution of the City
Council. Failure to pay any false alarm fee when due is a violation of this
section and shall be subject to a civil penalty in the amount of ten percent
(10%) of the original false alarm fee amount, for each month the amount remains
unpaid, provided that such penalty shall not exceed the original amount due.
(Ord. 649 § 2, 2012).
9.06.100 Maintaining a nuisance alarm.
   A.   No alarm subscriber shall operate or maintain an alarm system which
generates more than three false alarms in any twelve-month period.
   B.   Any alarm system operated or maintained in violation of this section is
a nuisance and shall be deemed a public nuisance alarm. (Ord. 659 § 1, 2012;

9.06.110 Exempt alarms.
   The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to:
   A.   Audible alarms affixed to automobiles.
   B.   Any alarm system installed or maintained by the Alarm Officer, or any
alarm that is otherwise exempted by law from the provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Any auxiliary device installed by a telephone company to protect
telephone company systems that might be damaged or disrupted by the use of an
alarm system.
   D.   Proprietor alarms. (Ord. 649 § 2, 2012).
9.06.120 Automatic dialing device requirements.
   A.   No person shall use or operate an automatic dialing device without
complying with this Section
9.06.120.
   B.   The device must be programmed to initiate and deliver the recorded
message or signal only to such City or County telephone number or numbers as
may be assigned or approved by the Alarm System Coordinator.

responses caused by the alarm system.

entity, as a result of any defect in an alarm system, failure of the city to
receive an alarm, or failure of the city or its police or fire departments to
respond to any alarm regulated by this chapter, whether false or not. The City
Council declares that it shall be entirely within the discretion of each police
officer or fire department receiving a report of an alarm activation, as to
whether or not to respond to such alarm, and that the City of La Mirada assumes
no duty to respond to any alarm as a result of the enactment of this chapter or
prior decisions to respond to alarms. (Ord. 649 § 2, 2012).
9.06.160 Appeals.
   Any person or business aggrieved by any determination of the Alarm System
Coordinator or Alarm Officer, including determination of a public nuisance
alarm, or false alarm(s), may, within ten days of such determination, appeal
the same by requesting, in writing addressed to the Alarm System Coordinator,
one of the following:
   A.   Administrative review by a Hearing Officer of the facts surrounding the
determination. The Hearing Officer shall consider any written material or other
evidence submitted, including any relevant City, police or fire reports or
other documentation and within ten days thereafter shall render a written
decision either denying the appeal, or reversing the determination with or
without modification; or
   B.   A hearing before a Hearing Officer to contest the determination. Upon
receipt of a timely appeal, notice of a hearing date to be conducted not more
than twenty-one (21) days thereafter, shall be served by first class mail to
the appellant at the address provided in the request for hearing. At the
hearing the Hearing Officer shall consider all relevant written and oral
evidence and, within ten days thereafter shall render a written decision either
denying the appeal, or reversing the determination with or without
modification.
   C.   The Hearing Officer shall be appointed by the City Manager and shall be
an unbiased active or retired City or County of Los Angeles employee having no
connection with the determination being appealed. The Hearing Officer may not
be anyone who works under the supervision of the person making the
determination being appealed. The Hearing Officer’s decision shall be final.
   D.   Because the determination that an alarm was a false alarm is based on
the professional judgment of first responders employing all facts known to the
responders at the time of the alarm, the burden of proof in the hearing shall
be on the appellant. Furthermore, the appellant must establish with credible
evidence that facts not considered by the Alarm Officer existed at the time of
the incident, and reasonably lead to the conclusion that the alarm was not
false.
(Ord. 649 § 2, 2012).
9.06.170 Civil remedies.
   In addition to other penalties provided herein, the violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter hereby adopted shall constitute a nuisance and may
be abated by the city through civil process by means of restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or in any other manner provided by law for
the abatement of such nuisances.

factors which necessitate a higher level of governmental regulation of minors
include their general inability to make critical decisions in an informed and
mature manner and the importance of the parental role in child rearing.

Chapter 9.90
GRAFFITI
Sections:
   
9.90.010   Purpose and intent.
   
9.90.020   Definitions.
   
9.90.030   Unlawful to apply graffiti.
   
9.90.040   Possession of graffiti implements by minors prohibited.
   
9.90.050   Possession of graffiti implements prohibited in designated public
places.
   
9.90.060   Accessibility to graffiti implements.
   
9.90.070   Removal provisions.
   
9.90.080   Rewards for information.
   
9.90.090   Reimbursement of cellular phone costs (Repealed by 731).
   
9.90.100   Penalties and civil liability of parents.
9.90.010 Purpose and intent.
   (a)   The city council finds that graffiti on public or private property is
a blighting factor which not only depreciates the value of property which has
been the target of such vandalism but also depreciates the value of the
adjacent and surrounding properties so as to create a negative impact upon the
entire city.
   (b)   Graffiti has also been found to be a means of identification utilized
by gangs and its presence may encourage further gang-related activities. The
power of graffiti to create fear within the community and blight upon the
landscape, devaluing property and detracting from a sense of community enjoyed
by the residents of La Mirada goes beyond the cost of cleanup or removal. Not
only is graffiti vandalism of property a crime, but a social crime upon the
quality of life and freedom from intimidation citizens desire in their
neighborhoods.
   (c)   California Government Code Section 53069.3 authorizes the city, under
certain circumstances, to provide for the removal of graffiti and other
inscribed materials from private as well as public property. The council finds
and determines that graffiti is obnoxious and a public nuisance and unless the
city causes it to be removed from public and private property, it tends to
remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti with the result
that entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in
which to be.
   (d)   It is the purpose and intent of the city council through the adoption
of this chapter, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and
private property from acts of vandalism and defacement, including the
application of graffiti on privately and publicly-owned walls and structures.
Such acts are destructive of the rights and values of private property owners
as well as the entire community.
   (e)   It is the further intent of the city council, through the adoption of
this chapter, to provide to all of those who disregard the property rights of
others, that the law enforcement agencies of the city, sheriff's department,
and the district attorney's office, will strictly enforce the law and
vigorously prosecute those persons engaging in the defacement of public and
private properties.
(Ord. 468 § 1 (part), 1993).
9.90.020 Definitions.

made for the purpose of applying spray painting, or other substance capable of
defacing property.
   "Felt tip marker" means any marker or similar implement with a tip which, at
its broadest width, is greater than one-eighth of an inch, containing ink or
other pigmented liquid.
   "Graffiti" means any unauthorized inscription, word, figure, or design that
is marked, etched, scratched, drawn, or painted on or otherwise affixed to or
on any surface, regardless of the nature of the material to the extent that the
same was not authorized in advance by the owner thereof, or, despite advance
authorization, is otherwise deemed by the city council to be a public nuisance.
   "Graffiti implement" means an aerosol paint container, a felt tip marker,
gum label, paint stick, etching tool, adhesive label, or any other device
capable of being used to leave a visible mark at least one-eighth of an inch in

paint, chalk, wax, epoxy, or similar substance capable of being applied to a
surface by pressure, and upon application, leaving a mark at least one-eighth
of an inch in width.

shall also be unlawful for any person to apply or affix any adhesive backed
label, sticker, "bumpersticker" or similar item, to any tree or structure not
owned or lawfully possessed by such person.
(Ord. 468 § 1 (part), 1993).
9.90.040 Possession of graffiti implements by minors prohibited.
It shall be unlawful for any person under the age of eighteen years to have in
his or her possession any graffiti implement while upon public property, or
upon private property without the prior written consent of the owner of such
property. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the possession of
felt tip markers by minors attending, or traveling to or from school at which
the minor is enrolled, if the minor is participating in a class at the school
which formally requires the possession of felt tip markers. The burden of proof
in any prosecution for violation of this section shall be upon the minor
student to establish the need to possess a felt tip marker.
(Ord. 468 § 1 (part), 1993).
9.90.050 Possession of graffiti implements prohibited in designated public
places.
No person shall have in his or her possession any graffiti implement while in
or upon any public park, playground, swimming pool, recreational facility, or

9.90.060 Accessibility to graffiti implements.
   (a)    Furnishing to Minors Prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person,
other than a parent or legal guardian, to sell, exchange, give, loan, or

the parent or other lawfully designated guardian which consent shall be given
in advance in writing.
   (b)   Display Requirements. No person or business engaged in commercial
enterprise shall display for sale, trade or exchange, any graffiti implement
except in an area from which the public shall be securely precluded without
employee assistance. Two such acceptable methods for displaying graffiti
implements for sale shall be by containment in (1) a completely enclosed
cabinet or other storage device which shall be permanently affixed to a
building or structure, and which shall, at all times except during access by
authorized representatives, remain securely locked; or (2) in an enclosed area
behind a sales or service counter from which the public is precluded from
entry. Nothing in this chapter shall relieve such persons or business entity
from, at all times, complying with the requirements of the California Penal
Code Section 594.1(c) by posting signs as described therein.
   (c)   Storage Requirements. No person or business engaged in the business of
selling, providing or trading graffiti implements shall store any graffiti
implement except in either (1) a completely enclosed room which shall, at all
times except during access or actual occupancy by the owner or authorized adult
representative of the owner, remain securely locked; or (2) in a completely
enclosed cabinet or other storage device which shall be permanently affixed to
a building or building structure, and which shall at all times except during
access by the owner or an adult representative of the owner, remain securely
locked. For purposes of this section, an owner or authorized representative of
the owner, shall be deemed to actually occupy a room even during brief periods
of absence if the room is contained within a larger structure which is occupied
by the owner.
   (d)   Civil Responsibility for Damages for Wrongful Display or Storage. Any
person who displays or stores or permits the display or storage of any graffiti
implement in violation of the provisions of this section shall be personally
liable for any and all costs, including attorneys fees and court costs,
incurred by any party in connection with the removal of graffiti, the repair of
any property containing graffiti, or such party's prosecution of a civil claim
for reimbursement or damages resulting from such graffiti removal or property
repair, arising from the use by any person of such wrongfully displayed or
stored graffiti implement in violation of the provisions of any of the
California Penal Code Sections, set forth in subsection (b) of this section, or
Section
9.90.030 of this chapter.
(Ord. 468 § 1 (part), 1993).
9.90.070 Removal provisions.
   (a)   Right of City to Require Removal. It is unlawful for any person who is
the owner, or who has primary responsibility for control, or who has primary
responsibility for the repair or maintenance of property visible to the public,
including property under any such person’s ownership or control that is located
within any City right-of- way, to permit the property which is defaced with
graffiti to remain so defaced for a period longer than seventy-two (72) hours
after written notification or documented verbal notification by the City that
the graffiti must be removed. Property shall be considered no longer defaced
when the graffiti is removed or the defaced area is covered by paint that is
substantially similar in shade and color to the surface upon which the graffiti
is placed.
   (b)   Declaration of Nuisance.
      (1)   Graffiti as a Nuisance. The city council declares and finds
graffiti to be a nuisance subject to abatement according to the provisions and
procedures contained in this chapter.
   (2)   Graffiti Attracting Surface as a Nuisance. The existence of any
surface of a structure on any privately owned parcel of land which has been
defaced with graffiti after removal more than five times in twelve months is
hereby deemed to be a nuisance, and may be abated by the city's requiring
modifications thereto, or to the immediate area surrounding same, according to
the provisions and procedures set forth in Chapter 21.55 of this code. Such
modifications may include, but are not limited to: retrofitting of such
surfaces at the expense of the property owner(s) of the lot, not to exceed a
total cost of five hundred dollars, or at the cost of the city at the city's
option, with such features or qualities as may be established by the city as
necessary to reduce the attractiveness of the surface for graffiti, or as
necessary to permit more convenient, expedient or efficient removal of graffiti
therefrom.
   (c)   Right of City to Remove.
      (1)   Use of Public Funds. Whenever the city becomes aware, or is
notified and determines that graffiti is so located on public or privately
owned property viewable from a public or quasi-public place within the city,
the city shall be authorized to use public funds for the removal of same, or
for the painting or repairing of same, but shall not authorize or undertake to
provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive area than that where
the graffiti is located, unless the city manager, or his designee, determines
in writing that a more extensive area is required to be repainted or repaired
in order to avoid aesthetic disfigurement to the neighborhood or community, or
unless the responsible party agrees to pay for the costs of repainting or
repairing the more extensive area.
      (2)   Right of Entry on Private Property.
         A.   Securing Owner Consent. Prior to entering upon private property
or property owned by a public entity other than the city, for purposes of
removal of graffiti, the city shall attempt to secure the consent of the
responsible party, and a release of the city from liability for private or
public property damage.
         B.   Failure to Obtain Owner Consent. If a responsible party fails to
remove the offending graffiti within the time specified in this section, or if
the city shall have requested consent to remove or paint over the offending
graffiti and the responsible party shall have refused consent for entry on
terms acceptable to the city consistent with the terms of this section, the
city may commence abatement and cost recovery proceedings for the removal of
the graffiti pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 21.55 of this code, which
procedures authorize the recovery of all costs incurred by the city in abating
graffiti including the recordation of a lien as to affected property.
      (3)   City Authorized to Obtain Restitution of Abatement Costs. In the
event a responsible party fails to remove the offending graffiti within the
time specified in this section and the City is required to undertake graffiti
abatement as a result thereof, the City shall be deemed to be a ‘victim’ and
responsible for the abatement pursuant to Penal Code Section 1202.4(k)(5).
Further, the City shall be authorized to obtain restitution for all costs of
abatement. In order to qualify for such restitution, efforts to obtain graffiti
clean-up from the responsible party must have been unsuccessful, clean-up is
necessary in order to protect the community from the continued nuisance
condition, and the City must have incurred specific costs to abate the graffiti
which have not and will not likely be recoverable from the responsible party.
The remedies set forth in this Subsection shall be in addition to any other
remedies available to the City to collect its costs incurred in abating
graffiti. Nothing herein shall be deemed to create any mandatory duty on the
part of the City to abate graffiti.
   (d)   Ease of Removal Provisions.
      (1)   Common Utility Colors and Paint Type. Any gas, telephone, water,
sewer, cable, telephone and other utility operating in the city, other than an
electric utility, shall paint their above-surface metal fixtures which are
installed after the effective date of this chapter, with a uniform paint type
and color as directed by the city manager.
      (2)   Conditions on Encroachment Permits. Encroachment permits issued by
the city may, among other things, be conditioned on (1) the permittee applying
an anti-graffiti material to the encroaching object or structure of a type and
nature that is acceptable to the city manager, or his or her designee; (2) the
immediate removal by the permittee of any graffiti; (3) the right of the city
to remove graffiti or to paint the encroaching object or structure; (4) the
permittee providing city with sufficient matching paint and/or anti-graffiti
material on demand for use in the painting of the encroaching object or
structure containing graffiti.

conditional use permits, variances, building permits to the extend permitted by

applications, the city may impose any or all of the following conditions, or
other similar or related conditions:
         A.   Use of Anti-graffiti Material. Applicant shall apply an anti-
graffiti material of a type and nature that is acceptable to the city manager,
or his or her designee, to such of the publicly-viewable surfaces to be
constructed on the site deemed by the city manager, or designee, to be likely
to attract graffiti (graffiti attracting surfaces);
         B.   Right of Access to Remove Graffiti. Applicant shall grant in
writing, the right of entry over and access to such parcels, upon forty-eight
hours posted notice, by authorized city employees or agents, for the purpose of
removing or "painting over" graffiti on graffiti attracting surfaces previously
designated by the director. Such grant shall be made an express condition of
approval and shall be deemed to run with the land;
         C.   Supply City with Graffiti-Removal Material. Applicant, and any
and all successors in interest, shall, for a period of two years after
approval, provide the city with sufficient matching paint and/or anti-graffiti
material on demand for use in the painting over or removal of designated
graffiti attracting surfaces;
         D.   Owner to Immediately Remove Graffiti. Persons applying for
subdivision maps shall, as part of any conditions, covenants and restrictions,

city, that the owners of the lots shall immediately remove any graffiti placed
on publicly viewable trees and structures thereon to city's satisfaction.

hereby offer a reward in an amount to be established by resolution of the city
council, for information leading to the arrest and conviction of any person for
violation, within the city, of California Penal Code Section 594 or 594.3 by

9.90.050 of this chapter. In the event of multiple contributors of information,
the reward amount shall be divided by the city in the manner it shall deem
appropriate. For the purposes of this section, diversion of the offending
violator to a community service program, or a plea bargain to a lesser offense,
shall constitute a conviction.
   (b)   Claims for rewards under the section shall be filed with the city.
Each claim shall:
      (1)   Specifically identify the date, location and kind of property
damaged or destroyed.
      (2)   Identify by name the person who was convicted.

   (c)   No claim for a reward shall be allowed by the city council unless the
city investigates and verifies the accuracy of the claim and determines that
the requirements of this section have been satisfied. The investigation must
determine that the claimant's information was relevant and directly responsible
for the arrest and conviction of the suspect.
   (d)   The person committing the graffiti vandalism, and if an unemancipated
minor, then the parent or lawful guardian of the minor, shall be civilly liable
for any reward paid pursuant to this section pursuant to the provisions of the
California Government Code Section 53069.5.

9.98.010 Definitions.
   For purposes of this chapter, "Admission charge" means a tangible benefit,
monetary or otherwise, which is expressly or impliedly required as a condition
of admittance to a party. Customary courtesies and clearly noncommercial
activity such as gifts by guests and voluntary sharing of expenses for meals
shall not be considered to be an "admission charge." "Admission charge" shall
not include donations for political, community service, charitable or religious
purposes.
   The term "party" or "parties" means three or more persons meeting together
for social, recreational, or amusement purposes.
(Ord. 541 § 3 (part), 1999).
9.98.020 Admission charge parties prohibited.
No person shall require, impliedly or expressly, any admission charge to any
party conducted in a residential zone.
(Ord. 541 § 3 (part), 1999).
9.98.030 Imposition of fees for police personnel at nuisance parties.
   (a)   When any loud (as defined in La Mirada Municipal Code Section
9.04.010) or unruly party occurs or is held, and it is determined that there is
a disruption to the public peace, health, safety or general welfare, the person
in charge of the premises and the person responsible for the party, or if
either of those persons is a minor, then the parents or guardians of the minor,
will be held jointly and severally liable for the cost of providing sheriff
personnel for special security assignment over and above the law enforcement
services normally provided by the city and the sheriff's department, and the
same may be given a written warning containing notice of the provisions of this
section.
   Sheriff personnel utilized during a second response to the same location
within seventeen days after a first warning is issued, to control the
disturbance to the public peace, health, safety or general welfare, shall be
deemed to be on special security assignment over and above the services
normally provided. A party requiring such a second sheriff response is deemed
to be a "nuisance party." Furthermore, those persons deemed liable for the cost
of the special security assignment shall be deemed to have consented to such
liability by failing to immediately take all steps necessary to avoid the need
for the second sheriff response. The disturbance causing the second response
shall be deemed to be a continuation of the disturbance causing the first
response.
   (b)   The costs of such special security assignment may include costs of
personnel, damages to city property, and injuries to city and sheriff
personnel. The charges assessed will be the actual cost of service for
controlling the disturbance and restoring the public peace, health, safety or
general welfare at the location of the disturbance. Such charges shall be
consistent with the current rate being charged to the city by the county of Los
Angeles.
   (c)   In addition, charges for damage to public property shall be determined
and set forth in an official written estimate from the Los Angeles County
department of public works or the city environmental services department. The
city reserves the right to elect any other legal remedies when deemed
necessary.
   (d)   When a second sheriff's response to a party following issuance of a
warning occurs, the sheriff's department shall provide the city with a copy of
the first response warning issued at the disturbance and with all city-required
information. This information shall include the number and type of sheriff
personnel and units used, and time spent, to control the disturbance. The city
will bill the responsible party or parties for costs of providing the special
security assignment plus an additional twenty-five percent of said costs as
costs of administration to process the bill and collect the charges. Failure to
pay the charge, as billed by the city, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter. Such costs shall be deemed to be a personal debt of those liable for
payment, and may be collected as a debt on a contract.
(Ord. 541 § 3 (part), 1999).
9.98.040 Administrative penalties for conducting or allowing an admission
charge or nuisance party.
   It is unlawful for any person to conduct or allow a party to be conducted in
violation of Section
9.98.020 ("admission charge party"), or to conduct a nuisance party, as defined
in Section
9.98.030, or allow a nuisance party to be conducted. In addition to any other
penalties provided in this chapter, any person conducting an admission charge
party or nuisance party, or allowing an admission charge or nuisance party to
be conducted, on residential property under such person's ownership or control,
or if such person is a minor, then the parents or guardians of that minor,
shall be subject to the following administrative penalties which shall be
administered as set forth in
Chapter 1.08 of this code:
   A.   For a second admission charge or nuisance party conducted within any
seventeen (17) consecutive day period, the administrative penalty shall be
$100.
   B.   For a third admission charge or nuisance party conducted within any
seventeen (17) consecutive day period, the administrative penalty shall be
$200.
   C.   For a fourth or additional admission charge or nuisance party conducted
within any seventeen (17) consecutive day period, the administrative penalty
shall be $500. (Ord. 659 § 3, 2012).

If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this
chapter is for any reason deemed or held to be invalid or unconstitutional by
the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, or by reason of any
preemptive legislation, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portion of this chapter. The city council declares that it would have
adopted the ordinance codified in this chapter and each section, subsection,
sentence, clause, phrase or portion thereof, irrespective of the fact that any
one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, phrases, or other
portions might subsequently be declared invalid or unconstitutional.

relating to the abatement of such public nuisances by establishing a process
whereby such nuisances may be abated by a voluntary cooperative effort between
the city and the owner of the property whereon such public nuisances are
occurring. The procedures established in this chapter describe and establish
this process and further, establish provisions for obtaining judicial relief in
circumstances where voluntary abatement is not achieved.

defined as follows:
   (a)   "Charity" means and has that definition set forth in California
Business and Professions Code Section 17510.2(d)which defines "charity" as
including "any person who, or any nonprofit community organization, fraternal,
benevolent, educational, philanthropic, or service organization, or
governmental employee organization which, solicits or obtains contributions
solicited from the public for charitable purposes or holds any assets for
charitable purposes." Whenever the term "charitable purposes" is utilized in

benefit or are purported to benefit any charity.
   (b)   "Solicit" or "solicitation" means:
      (1)   Any request, plea, demand, or invitation, or attempt thereof, to

purpose and without prior invitation, appointment or consent, any
advertisement, advertising space, book, card, chance, coupon device, magazine
subscription, membership, merchandise, ticket of admission, or any other thing
or service upon any private property in the city in which the solicitor has no
possessory or ownership interest.
   (c)   "Solicitor" means any person who solicits.
(Ord. 520 § 2 (part), 1998).
9.109.020 Charitable solicitation permit required.
   (a)   No person shall solicit, or permit or cause any other person to
solicit on said person's behalf, where it is represented that any proceeds of
such solicitation are to be used for charitable purposes, or otherwise engage
in any "solicitation for charitable purposes" or "sales solicitation for
charitable purposes," as those terms are defined in California Business and
Professions Code Section 17510.2, or any successor provision thereto, without
first obtaining and being the holder of a valid charitable solicitation permit
issued by the finance director. The fee for such permit shall be in such amount
as may be set by resolution of the city council and which will compensate the
city for the actual costs of the permit and identification card(s) required to
be in the possession of each solicitor at all times while soliciting, and the
cost of administering this chapter.
   (b)   The foregoing permit shall be required only of the person in charge of
charitable solicitations on behalf of a charity, but no person shall solicit as
agent, servant or representative of an unpermitted person required under the
provisions of this section to have a charitable solicitation permit.

officers); the name of the person or persons who are to act as charitable
solicitors; the total amount to be raised; the estimated total amount to be
expended as compensation or reward for such charitable solicitation, or the
percentage of the total amount intended to be raised or realized in the drive
or campaign such estimated total of expenditures represents; and the purpose
for which the money or property derived from such charitable solicitation is to
be used. This statement shall be verified by declaration or affidavit of the
person, or chief officer of the organization, for whom charitable solicitation
is to be made, or if solicitation is to be for an unorganized class of persons,
verification shall be made by the person in charge of such charitable
solicitation.
   To the extent not required above, each applicant shall also provide to the
finance department as part of the sworn statement of the information required
to be disclosed pursuant to California Business and Professions Code Section
17510.3, the name and address of each person who shall actually solicit for
charitable purposes. This sworn statement shall be on such form as provided by
the finance department and shall constitute the required application.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided none of the information given in
connection with an application for an initial charitable solicitation permit
has changed, an applicant for renewal shall only be required to verify the same

   (d)   Before issuing a charitable solicitation permit, the finance
department may investigate the information provided in the application. Unless
upon such inquiry or from such statement the finance department discovers any
false material statement or representation, or that the applicant does not
represent a bona fide charity, as defined herein and in California Business and
Professions Code Section 17510.2, or that the solicitation activities proposed
would violate any provision of California Business and Professions Code Section
17510 et seq., or any other law, the application shall be approved. Each
complete application for a charitable solicitation permit shall be approved or
denied within fourteen days of receipt or the application shall be deemed
approved. The permit shall be valid for one year unless revoked or renewed as
provided herein. If denied, the basis for denial shall be provided in writing
within seven calendar days by mail to the applicant.

Professions Code Section 17510.3, upon commencement of any charitable

      (3)   The amount, stated as a percentage of the total gift or purchase

expenses;

charitable purposes, the card or brochure may state, in place of the amount of
fundraising expenses, that an audited financial statement of these expenses may

any nongovernmental organization by any name which includes, but is not limited
to, the term "officer," "peace officer," "police," "law enforcement," "reserve
officer," "deputy," "California Highway Patrol," "Highway Patrol," or "deputy
sheriff," or "firefighter," "firemen" or "fire department," which would

enforcement or fire department or firefighting personnel, the charitable
solicitor shall give the total number of members in the organization and the
number of members working or living within the county where the charitable
solicitation is being made, and if the solicitation is for advertising, the
statewide circulation of the publication in which the solicited ad will appear;
      (9)   If the organization making the charitable solicitation represents

imply that the organization is composed of veterans, the charitable solicitor
shall give the total number of members in the organization and the number of
members working or living within the county where the solicitation is being
made. This subsection (e)(9) does not apply to federally chartered or state
incorporated veterans' organizations with two hundred or more dues paying
members or to a thrift store operated or controlled by a federally chartered or
state incorporated veterans organization. This subsection (e)(9) does not apply
to any state incorporated community-based organization that provides direct
services to veterans and their families and qualifies as a tax-exempt
organization under Section 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code
and Section 23701(d) of the California Revenue and Taxation Code;

organization, may comply with the provisions of subsection (e) of this section,

connection with, a solicitation or sales solicitation by a charitable

exempt from the provisions of subsection (e) of this section;
   (g)   Each charitable solicitor receiving money or property from any person
as a result of any solicitation shall provide a written receipt to such person.

received, as well as the name, business or home address and telephone number of
the charitable solicitor. The receipt shall also state whether or not the money
or property received constitutes a state or federal tax deduction;
   (h)   Each charitable solicitor, or the charity on whose behalf such
solicitation is made, shall maintain full and complete written records of all
money and property received as a result of the permitted charitable
solicitation activities. Such records shall be available for review by the

subject charity.

Such safe storage shall not be deemed to be an impoundment, and no tagging and
retrieval fee or civil penalty may accrue as a result thereof.
   Alternatively, any owner-identified shopping cart which is not retrieved
within three business days from the date the owner of the cart, or his or her
agent, receives actual notice including, but not limited to, telephonic notice,
from the city of the shopping cart's discovery and location, may be impounded

impoundment. Pursuant to Business and Professions Code Section 22435.7(g)
written notice shall be mailed to the owner of any owner-identified shopping
cart which is impounded pursuant to this section, which shall specify the date
and time of such impoundment, the location where the cart may be retrieved, the
cost of retrieval and that failure to retrieve such cart within thirty calendar
days may result in the cart being disposed of as permitted by law.
   (c)   This section shall not apply to a cart attended by any person who can
demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the city or its authorized contractor,
ownership of the shopping cart or written permission of the owner, to have the
cart in his/her possession.

contractor to any shopping cart with the intent of interfering with the
enforcement of this chapter or evading any of its provisions.
   (b)   No person shall obstruct, impede or interfere with any representative
of the city or its authorized contractor who is engaged in tagging, removing or

(Ord. 516 § 2 (part), 1997).
9.112.060 Impound appeal.
Any person who can demonstrate that he or she is a cart owner may appeal the
imposition of a tagging and retrieval fee by presenting evidence that the cart
removal and storage was not performed substantially in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. Appeals shall be made in writing to the city
manager or designee within ten calendar days of paying the fee. An office
hearing will be held within thirty calendar days of the receipt of such appeal
request. The shopping cart owner or authorized representative may appear and be
heard on the matter. If the city manager or designee determines that the
shopping cart was not removed and stored in substantial accordance with the
provisions of this chapter, the tagging and retrieval fee shall be refunded.
The decision of the city manager or designee shall be final.
(Ord. 516 § 2 (part), 1997).
9.112.070 Unauthorized removal or possession of shopping carts.
It is unlawful to do any of the following acts:
   (1)   Remove an unidentified shopping cart from the premises or parking area
of a retail establishment;
   (2)   Be in possession of an unidentified shopping cart that has been
removed from the premises or the parking area of a retail establishment;
   (3)   Leave or abandon a shopping cart on public or private property and at
a location other than the premises or parking area of the retail establishment.
   Any cart in the possession of, or abandoned by, any person found to be in
violation of subsections (1), (2) or (3) above, may be impounded in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section
9.112.030 applicable to unidentified shopping carts, whether or not such cart
is actually located on public or private property.
   This section shall not apply to any person who can satisfactorily
demonstrate ownership of the shopping cart, or to any person having written
permission of the owner to have the cart in his or her possession.
   Removal, possession and abandonment of owner identified shopping carts,
shall be governed by the provisions of Business and Professions Code Section
22435.2. Any cart in the possession of any person found to be in violation of
Business and Professions Code Section 22435.2 may be impounded by the city
provided, however, that written notice shall be given to the identified owner
of the impoundment of such cart. Provided the owner or representative thereof
makes a proper claim for such cart within thirty calendar days of the date of
mailing of such notice, no costs of retrieval shall be imposed upon such owner
or representative. In the event any such cart remains unretrieved for thirty
days following the mailing of such notice, the city may sell or otherwise
dispose of such cart.
(Ord. 516 § 2 (part), 1997).
9.112.080 Penalties applicable to owners of shopping carts.
   (a)   Pursuant to the provisions of Business and Professions Code Section
22435.7(f), upon a fourth failure and upon each successive failure thereafter
within any six consecutive month period by an owner of an owner identified
shopping cart, to retrieve any such cart or carts for which notice of discovery
thereof has been given by the city pursuant to this chapter, a civil penalty in
the amount of fifty dollars shall be paid by such owner.
   (b)   Upon a fourth failure and upon each successive failure thereafter
within any six consecutive month period by an owner of an unidentified shopping

in Section
9.112.030(b), a civil penalty in the amount of fifty dollars shall be paid by
such owner.
   (c)   No more than one failure to retrieve may accrue for any given day as
to any owner, regardless of the number of such owner's carts retrieved on such
day.
   (d)   Any and all civil penalties authorized by this section shall be deemed
to be imposed without prior notice being given by the city. The city manager or
designee shall maintain records of facts relevant to the imposition of any and
all civil penalties. Within ninety days, and at the city's discretion and
convenience, notice of assessment of a civil penalty or penalties shall be
given to affected shopping cart owners by first class mail addressed to their
respective retail establishments. Such notice shall set forth the date and
circumstances surrounding the imposition of each civil penalty and shall
further state that the amount of the penalty is payable within thirty days of
the date of the notice. Thereafter, each civil penalty imposed shall be paid
within such period unless, within ten calendar days of the date of such notice,
the shopping cart owner files a written appeal with the city council or its
designee. Thereafter, a hearing will be scheduled and conducted within thirty
calendar days at which time the owner or authorized representative may appear
and be heard on the matter. If the city council or designee determines that the
city did not substantially comply with applicable provisions of this chapter,
or finds that any civil penalty was otherwise not properly imposed, the owner
shall not be required to pay such civil penalty. The decision of the city
council or designee shall be final.
   (e)   In the event any civil penalty, not successfully appealed, remains
unpaid after thirty days of the date of the notice thereof, such penalty shall
constitute a civil debt of the shopping cart owner and may be collected as a
contract debt by way of legal action or otherwise as permitted by law.
Furthermore, such civil penalties may be added to any tagging and retrieval
fees which may accrue to such shopping cart owner. In such instance, the entire
amount of tagging and retrieval fees, plus accrued civil penalties shall be
paid prior to any impounded shopping carts being released to such owner.
(Ord. 516 § 2 (part), 1997).
9.112.090 Exemption for retail establishments utilizing cart retrieval
services.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any shopping cart owner
which has retained a shopping cart retrieval service as of the day any of the
owner's carts is impounded, and for at least three months prior thereto, shall
not be required to pay a tagging and retrieval fee, nor shall the same be
subject to the accrual of any civil penalties pursuant to this chapter,
provided that throughout such period the city has had written notification that
the shopping cart retrieval service has been ready and willing to retrieve any
of the owner's abandoned shopping carts within twenty-four hours of receipt of
telephonic notice by the city. The burden of establishing such exemption shall
be upon the shopping cart owner.
   This exemption shall not apply, however, if, on three or more prior
occasions within a one-year period, the city has informed a designated shopping
cart retrieval service of the presence of an abandoned shopping cart and the
same has not been removed by the service within twenty-four hours of the city's
notification.

Prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, there was no
mechanism by which the city could prevent confusion on the part of the public
if the city's seal or logos are used without authorization so that members of
the general public would reasonably believe that a document bearing the seal or
logos was generated by the city or that the person or entity responsible for
creation of the document is employed by or affiliated with the city. In the
absence of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the public
could become confused, deceived or misled by such documents, which is
detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare and the effective
operation of the city.

imitation, copy or replication of the city seal or logos on any document so as
to cause another person to reasonably believe that the document bearing the
seal or logos was generated by the city or that the person or entity
responsible for creating the document is employed by or affiliated with the
city. Any person who violates the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor and shall be subject to the penalties specified in Chapter 1.07
of Title 1 of this municipal code.

   In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the
authority granted by the state of California under Section 22660 of the Vehicle
Code to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts
thereof as public nuisances, the city council hereby makes the following
findings and declarations:
   The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or
inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property not
including highways is hereby found to create a condition tending to reduce the
value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite
plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance
creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for
rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general
welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or
inoperative vehicle or part thereof, on private or public property not
including highways, except as expressly hereinafter permitted, is hereby
declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

propelled, moved, or drawn upon a highway, except a device moved by human power
or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks;
   (2)   "Highway" means a way or place of whatever nature, publicly maintained
and open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel. Highway
includes street;
   (3)   "Public property" does not include "highway."
(Ord. 131 § 1 (part), 1968; prior code § 4400).
10.08.020 Exclusions.
This chapter shall not apply to:
   (1)   A vehicle or part thereof which is completely enclosed within a

   (3)   A vehicle or part thereof which is parked or stored in a lawful manner
on private property and is not plainly visible from a public street and is not
parked or stored in the front or side yard setback area of such private
property.

chapter such officer and his deputies may enter upon private or public property
to examine a vehicle or parts thereof, or obtain information as to the identity
of a vehicle and to remove or cause the removal of a vehicle or part thereof
declared to be a nuisance pursuant to this chapter.

or persons, such person or persons shall be authorized to enter upon private
property or public property to remove or cause the removal of a vehicle or
parts thereof declared to be a nuisance pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 131 § 1 (part), 1968; prior code § 4404).
10.08.060 Assessment of administrative costs.
The city council shall from time to time determine and fix an amount to be
assessed as administrative costs under this chapter.
(Ord. 131 § 1 (part), 1968; prior code § 4405).

   (a)   All hearings under this chapter shall be held before the city council
which shall hear all facts and testimony it deems pertinent. The facts and
testimony may include testimony on the condition of the vehicle or part thereof
and the circumstances concerning its location on private property or public
property. The city council shall not be limited by the technical rules of

at the hearing, and deny responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the
land, with his reasons for such denial.
   (b)   The city council may impose such conditions and take such other action
as it deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purpose of
this chapter. It may delay the time for removal of the vehicle or part thereof
if, in its opinion, the circumstances justify it. At the conclusion of the
public hearing, the city council may find that a vehicle or part thereof has
been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or is inoperative on private or public
property and order the same removed from the property as a public nuisance and
disposed of as hereinafter provided and determine the administrative costs and

which the vehicle or part thereof is located. The order requiring removal shall
include a description of the vehicle or part thereof and the correct
identification number and license number of the vehicle, if available at the
site.

land without the consent of the land owner and that he was not subsequently
acquiesced in its presence, the city council shall not assess costs of
administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the
vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such land
owner.
   (d)   If an interested party makes a written presentation to the city
council but does not appear, he shall be notified in writing of the decision.

leave or permit the abandonment, parking, storing or leaving of any licensed or
unlicensed vehicle or part thereof which is in an abandoned, wrecked,
dismantled or inoperative condition upon any private property or public
property not including highways within the city for a period in excess of six

12.04.010 Designated.
   By reason of the fact that changes will occur in the local neighborhoods and
the city generally due to the increase in vehicular traffic, including
trucking, increase in pedestrian traffic and other activities associated with
the city's development and growth, the following improvements are deemed to be
necessary to prevent congestion and other hazards that are related to the
intensified use of the land, and these requirements must be met and complied
with before any building permit may be issued:
   All street, highway and alley improvements shall have either been installed
or a performance bond in a reasonable amount to be determined by the city
engineer, with sureties to be approved by the city attorney, shall have been
filed with the city clerk, or cash in a like amount shall have been deposited
with the finance director to be placed in a trust fund. The improvements shall
meet the standards established by the city and shall include curb, gutter,
sidewalk, street and alley paving, street trees, street signs, street lights,
and all required utilities.
   EXCEPTIONS: Curbs, gutters, sidewalks, and street paving already existing,
and approved by the city engineer for continued use need not be replaced.
   Sidewalks shall not be required in residential zones where seventy-five
percent or more of the existing street frontage on that side of the street
between intersecting streets has been developed without sidewalks.
   Sidewalks shall not be required in industrial zones except in those
locations where the planning director determines there may be school pedestrian
traffic. When so determined by the planning director, sidewalks shall be
required in industrial zones.
   Lots having no frontage on a planned local street shall be excluded from the
requirements of this section.
   Where curbs, gutters, sidewalks or street paving are not presently installed
along the street frontage between intersecting streets, the applicant, if
granted a variance by the planning commission, shall enter into a standard
improvement agreement with the city to install these improvements when directed
to do so by the city.
(Ord. 64 § 2, 1963; Ord. 46 § 1 (part), 1962; prior code § 6700).
12.04.020 Building permit.

the requirements of Section
12.04.010 have been met.
(Ord. 64 § 3, 1963; Ord. 46 § 1 (part), 1962; prior code § 6701).
12.04.030 Variance.
   (a)   Applications for a variance from the provisions of Section
12.04.010 shall be made in writing to the planning commission in such form as
is approved by the planning commission. The planning commission may provide
forms for such purposes and may prescribe the type of information to be
provided thereon. No petition shall be received unless it complies with such
requirements. The planning commission shall give the applicant for such
variance an opportunity to be heard if he so desires, and thereafter may grant
or deny the application for the variance or may grant thy same upon such
conditions as the planning commission deems necessary for the preservation of
the safety, health or property of the general public.
   (b)   The planning commission upon such application, or on its own motion,
may grant a variance from the provisions of this section for one or more of the
following reasons:
      (1)   The construction of sidewalks or curbs and gutters in the area
involved is included in a budgeted city project or within an approved
assessment district;
      (2)   Because of the location of the property, the terrain or condition
thereof, the construction of sidewalks or curbs and gutters would be
impractical or unnecessary or would impose undue hardship on the owner of the
property.
(Ord. 64 § 4, 1963; Ord. 46 § 1 (part), 1962; prior code § 6702).
12.04.040 Appeal.
   (a)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission
including any city official may, within fifteen days after the action and
decision of the planning commission concerning the variance application, appeal
to the city council by filing with the city clerk such notice of appeal. Except
in the case of an appeal by a city official, such notice of appeal shall be
accompanied by a ten dollar filing fee.
   (b)   Unless the city council, within thirty days after notice of appeal has
been filed, determines to grant a hearing or to refer the matter back to the
planning commission for rehearing, the appeal shall be deemed dismissed and the
decision of the planning commission shall thereupon become final.
   (c)   The city council may consider the appeal on the record, if any, made
before the planning commission, or de novo; and thereafter the city council may
refer the matter back to the planning commission for further consideration or
may reverse, affirm or modify the decision of the planning commission subject
to the same standards and limitations imposed upon the planning commission by
this section, except as herein expressly otherwise provided, the decision of
the city council shall be final.
(Ord. 46 § 1 (part), 1962; prior code § 6703).
12.04.050 Estimate of costs.
Whenever the installation of curbs, gutters, sidewalks or paving is found to be
impracticable by the city engineer by reason of the then existing width or
condition of the existing street, the city engineer shall estimate what the
reasonable cost of installing the sidewalk, curb, gutter, or paving to be, and
the cost shall be deposited with the city by the owner, lessee or agent
constructing or arranging for the construction of the building or dwelling.
(Ord. 64 § 5, 1963; Ord. 46 § 1 (part), 1962; prior code § 6704).
12.04.060 Fund created.
   (a)    All funds received by the city pursuant to Section
12.04.050 shall be deposited in a special trust fund, denominated the "curb,
gutter, sidewalk, and paving special fund." All sums so deposited shall be kept
separate and apart from all other funds or accounts of the city. Funds
deposited in the special fund may be expended only to improve public streets or
rights-of-way by the construction of curbs, sidewalks, gutters, or paving at
the property or parcel for which the sums or amounts were paid into the fund.
   (b)   In the event that after all improvements have been made as to an
individual parcel, and funds still remain on deposit therefor, the balance
shall be forthwith paid to the person initially making the deposit. Further, in
the event any deposit is unused or partially unused at the expiration of
fifteen years after such deposit has been made, any and all sums remaining
shall be forthwith paid to the person initially making the deposit. No sums on
deposit with the city shall be deemed to accrue interest, nor shall the city be
liable to pay to any person any interest charge or other charges.

and evaluation, that the tree is so diseased or damaged that it is no longer
viable or it is a threat to property or to other trees;
   (3)   Where the tree is so poorly formed due to stunted growth that its
preservation would not result in any substantial benefit to the community;
   (4)   Where the tree interferes with utility services, or any street or
highway, and no reasonable alternative exists other than removal or trimming of
the tree;
   (5)   Where the tree is a potential safety hazard due to the risk of it
falling and its structural instability cannot be remedied, or where any other
risk to persons or property is presented;
   (6)   Where the tree is causing damage to improvements including, but not
limited to, any building foundation, retaining wall, roadway/driveway, patio,

plant material from or adjacent to the trunk of any parkway tree.
(Ord. 556 § 2 (part), 2000).
12.08.070 Development activity--Tree plans.
All parkway trees planted in a new subdivision shall be in accordance with the
parkway tree guidelines and shall be paid for by the subdivider, unless
otherwise provided by the city council. The city council may require any
subdivider to pay all costs of proper parkway tree planting along the streets
of any new subdivision before approving any subdivision map.
(Ord. 556 § 2 (part), 2000).
12.08.080 Injuring trees prohibited.
No person shall injure or destroy any parkway tree by any means, including, but
not limited to the following:
   (1)   Constructing a concrete, asphalt, brick or gravel sidewalk or
otherwise filling up the ground area around any tree so as to substantially
shut off air, light or water from its roots;
   (2)   Piling building equipment, material or any other substance around any
tree so as to cause injury;
   (3)   Pouring, spraying or depositing any deleterious substance on or around
any tree or on the surrounding ground, lawn or sidewalk;
   (4)   Posting any sign, poster, notice or other object on any tree, tree
stake or guard, or fastening any guy wire, cable, rope, nails, screws or other
device to any tree, tree stake or guard;
   (5)   Causing any wire charged with electricity to come in contact with any

   (6)   Causing any fire or burning near or around any tree.
(Ord. 556 § 2 (part), 2000).
12.08.090 Requirements for tree protection during construction.
The director shall determine during the project review process whether and to
what extent conditions or measures will be required to protect parkway trees
during construction. This decision shall be based upon the proximity of the
construction activity to parkway trees. The conditions and protective measures
include, but are not limited to, the following:
   (1)   The parkway trees shall be enclosed by chain link fencing with a
minimum height of five feet or by another protective barrier approved by the
director prior to the issuance of a grading or building permit and prior to
commencement of work.
   (2)   Barriers shall be placed at least five feet outside the drip line of
parkway trees. A lesser distance may be approved by the director if appropriate
to the species and the adjacent construction activity.
   (3)   No grade changes shall be made within the protective barriers without
prior approval by the director. Any roots greater than two inches in diameter
which are damaged or exposed shall be cleanly saw cut and covered with soil in
conformance with industry standards.
   (4)   Excavation or landscape preparation within the protective barriers
shall be limited to the use of hand tools and small hand-held power tools and
shall not be used at a depth that could cause root damage to the parkway tree.
   (5)   No attachments or wires other than those of a protective or non-
damaging nature shall be attached to a parkway tree.
   (6)   No equipment or debris of any kind shall be placed within the
protective barriers. No fuel, paint, solvent, oil, thinner, asphalt, cement,
grout or any other construction chemical shall be stored or allowed in any
manner to enter within the protective barrier.
   (7)   If access within the protective barrier around a parkway tree is
required during the construction process, the route shall be covered in a six-
inch mulch bed in the drip line area, and the area shall be aerated and
fertilized at the conclusion of the construction.
   (8)   When the existing grade around a parkway tree is to be raised, drain
tiles shall be laid over the soil to drain liquids away from the trunk, as
determined by the director. The number of drains shall depend upon the soil
material. Lighter sandy soils and porous gravelly material require fewer drains
than heavy non-porous soils like clay. Dry wells shall be large enough to allow
for maximum growth of the tree trunk. Dry well walls shall be constructed of
materials that permit passage of air and water.
   (9)   When the existing grade around a parkway tree is to be lowered, either
by terracing or a retaining wall, a combination may be used to lower grade, as
determined by the director. With either method, the area within the drip line
shall be left at the original grade. The retaining wall shall be porous to
allow for aeration.
   (10)   Parkway trees that have been destroyed or that have received major
damage during construction shall be replaced prior to final inspection and
subject to the director's approval as to size, variety and species.
(Ord. 556 § 2 (part), 2000).
12.08.100 Removal of tree for construction or renovation.
If any private individual or entity has a need to remove a parkway tree in the
course of upgrade, renovation or new construction, they shall first obtain a
permit issued by the director and adhere to the requirements and conditions set
forth in the parkway tree guidelines and other conditions imposed by the
director.
(Ord. 556 § 2 (part), 2000).
12.08.110 Permits required.
Except as provided herein, no person shall cut, trim, prune, plant, remove,
injure or interfere with any parkway tree or plant without a permit.
(Ord. 556 § 2 (part), 2000).
12.08.120 Permit application requirements.
   (a)   Each application for a permit to trim, prune, or remove any parkway
tree or plant shall be filed with the director on a form provided for such
purpose. The application shall clearly show by diagram, plot plan or
photograph, the location, species and size of each parkway tree or plant sought
to be removed, the name and address of the property owner and applicant, and
such other information as indicated on the form provided or as required by the
director. The director will consider an application complete when all necessary
application forms, materials and exhibits, as established by the director, have
been provided and accepted as adequate and all necessary fees established by

This chapter shall be known as the city of La Mirada Stormwater Management and
Discharge Control Ordinance.
(Ord. 671 § 1, 2014).
13.12.020 Findings.
   (a)   The federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1251, et seq.,)
provides for the regulation and reduction of pollutants discharged into the
waters of the United States by extending National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System ("NPDES") requirements to stormwater and urban runoff
discharge into municipal storm drain systems;
   (b)   Stormwater and urban runoff flows from individual properties onto
streets, then through storm drains passing through the city and finally into
the waters of the United States;
   (c)   The city is a co-permittee under the "Waste Discharge Requirements for
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System ("MS4") discharges within the Coastal
Watersheds of Los Angeles County, except those discharges originating from the
city of Long Beach MS4, which also serves as a NPDES permit under the federal
Clean Water Act (NPDES No. CAS614001), as well as waste discharge requirements
under California law (the "municipal NPDES permit") and, as a co-permittee
under the municipal NPDES permit, the city is required to adopt ordinances and
implement procedures with respect to the entry of non-stormwater discharges
into the municipal stormwater system;
   (d)   Part III, Section A of the municipal NPDES permit requires the city to
effectively prohibit non-stormwater discharges from within its boundaries, into
that portion of the MS4 which it owns or operates and into watercourses, except
where such discharges are:
      (1)   In compliance with a separate individual or general NPDES permit,
or
      (2)   Identified and in compliance with Part III. A (non-stormwater
discharges) of the municipal NPDES permit, or
      (3)   Originate from federal, state or other facilities which the city is
preempted from regulating, and further provides that compliance with the terms
of the municipal NPDES permit through the development and implementation of the
programs described in the municipal NPDES permit will constitute compliance
with the discharge prohibition in the municipal NPDES permit;
   (e)   Part VI, Section A.2 of the municipal NPDES permit requires the city
to establish and maintain the legal authority necessary to control discharges
to and from those portions of the MS4 over which it has jurisdiction, so as to
comply with the municipal NPDES permit and to specifically prohibit certain
discharges identified in the municipal NPDES permit;
   (f)   The Municipal NPDES Permit contemplates the development of a Watershed
Management Program in which the city will participate, which will in turn
require the development and the implementation of programs for, among other
things, the elimination of illicit connections and illicit discharges,
development planning, development construction, and public information and
education requirements, and which may require the later adoption of additional
legal authority to implement such programs as they are developed by the
permittees and approved by the Regional Board;
   (g)   In order to control, in a cost-effective manner, the quantity and
quality of stormwater and urban runoff to the maximum extent practicable, the
adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter is essential.
(Ord. 671 § 1,2014)
13.12.030 Purpose and intent.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety and
general welfare of the citizens of the city and the water quality of the
receiving waters of the county of Los Angeles and surrounding coastal areas by:
      (1)   Reducing pollutants in stormwater discharges to the maximum extent
practicable;
      (2)   Regulating illicit connections and illicit discharges and reducing
the level of contamination of stormwater and urban runoff in the municipal
stormwater system; and
      (3)   Regulating non-stormwater discharges to the municipal stormwater
system.
   (b)   The intent of this chapter is to protect and enhance the quality of
watercourses, water bodies, and wetlands within the city in a manner consistent
with the federal Clean Water Act, the California Porter-Cologne Water Quality
Control Act and the municipal NPDES permit.
   (c)   This chapter is also intended to provide the city with the legal
authority necessary to control discharges to and from those portions of the
municipal stormwater system over which it has jurisdiction as required by the
municipal NPDES permit, and fully and timely comply with the terms of the
municipal NPDES permit while the Watershed Management Program is being
developed by the permittees under the municipal NPDES permit, and in
contemplation of the subsequent amendment of this chapter or adoption by the
city of additional provisions of this chapter to implement the subsequently
adopted Watershed Management Program, or other programs developed under the
municipal NPDES permit.
   (d)   This chapter also sets forth requirements for the construction and
operation of certain commercial development, new development and redevelopment
and other projects (as further defined herein) which are intended to ensure
compliance with the stormwater mitigation measures prescribed in the current
MS4 permit. This chapter authorizes the director to define and adopt applicable
best management practices and other stormwater pollution control measures, as
provided herein, to carry out all inspections including entering entities
discharging to the MS4, conduct surveillance, conduct monitoring, cite
infractions and to impose fines pursuant to this chapter. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the director shall administer, implement and enforce the
provisions of this section.
   (e)   The city council shall approve and enter into interagency agreements
as deemed necessary by the city council to control the contribution of
pollutants of the shared MS4.
(Ord. 671 §1, 2014)
13.12.040 Definitions.
   Except as specifically provided herein, any term used in this chapter shall
be defined as that term is defined in the current municipal NPDES permit, or if
it is not specifically defined in the municipal NPDES permit, then as such term
is defined in the federal Clean Water Act, as amended, or the regulations
promulgated thereunder. If the definition of any term contained in this section
conflicts with the definition of the same term in the current municipal NPDES
permit, then the definition contained in the municipal NPDES permit shall
govern. The following words and phrases shall have the following meanings when
used this chapter:
   "Area susceptible to runoff" means any surface directly exposed to
precipitation or in the path of runoff caused by precipitation which path leads
off the parcel on which the surface is located.
   "Automotive service facilities" means a facility that is categorized in any
one of the following Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) and North
American Industry Classification System (NAICS)codes. For inspection purposes,
permittees need not inspect facilities with SIC codes 5013, 5014, 5541, 7532-
7534, and 7536-7539 provided, that these facilities have no outside activities
or materials that may be exposed to stormwater.
   "Best management practices (BMPs)" means practices or physical devices or
systems designed to prevent or reduce pollutant loading from stormwater or non-
stormwater discharges to receiving waters, or designed to reduce the volume of
stormwater or non-stormwater discharged to the receiving water. Examples of
BMPs may include public education and outreach, proper planning of development
projects, proper cleaning of catch basin inlets, and proper sludge- or waste-
handling and disposal, among others.
   "Biofiltration" means a LID BMP that reduces stormwater pollutant discharges
by intercepting rainfall on vegetative canopy, and through incidental
infiltration and/or evapotranspiration, and filtration. Incidental infiltration
is an important factor in achieving the required pollutant load reduction.
Therefore, the term "biofiltration" as used in this chapter is defined to
include only systems designed to facilitate incidental infiltration or achieve
the equivalent pollutant reduction as biofiltration BMPs with an underdrain
(subject to approval by the Regional Board's Executive Officer). Biofiltration
BMPs include bioretention systems with an underdrain and bioswales.
   "Bioretention" means a LID BMP that reduces stormwater runoff by
intercepting rainfall on vegetative canopy, and through evapotranspiration and
infiltration. The bioretention system typically includes a minimum two-foot top
layer of a specified soil and compost mixture underlain by a gravel-filled
temporary storage pit dug into the in-situ soil. As defined in this chapter, a
bioretention BMP may be designed with an overflow drain, but may not include an
underdrain. When a bioretention BMP is designed or constructed with an
underdrain it is regulated by the municipal NPDES permit as biofiltration.
   "Bioswale" means a LID BMP consisting of a shallow channel lined with grass
or other dense, low-growing vegetation. Bioswales are designed to collect
stormwater runoff and to achieve a uniform sheet flow through the dense
vegetation for a period of several minutes.
   "City" means the city of La Mirada, California.
   "Clean Water Act (CWA)" means the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
enacted in 1972, by Public Law 92-500, and amended by the Water Quality Act of
1987. The Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of pollutants to waters of
the United States unless the discharge is in accordance with an NPDES permit.
   "Commercial development" means any development on private land that is not
heavy industrial or residential. The category includes, but is not limited to:
hospitals, laboratories and other medical facilities, educational institutions,
recreational facilities, plant nurseries, car wash facilities, mini-malls and
other business complexes, shopping malls, hotels, office buildings, public
warehouses and other light industrial complexes.
   "Commercial malls" means any development on private land comprised of one or
more buildings forming a complex of stores which sells various merchandise,
with interconnecting walkways enabling visitors to easily walk from store to
store, along with parking area(s). A commercial mall includes, but is not
limited to: mini-malls, strip malls, other retail complexes, and enclosed
shopping malls or shopping centers
   "Construction" means any construction or demolition activity, clearing,
grading, grubbing, or excavation or any other activity that result in land
disturbance. Construction does not include emergency construction activities
required to immediately protect public health and safety or routine maintenance
activities required to maintain the integrity of structures by performing minor
repair and restoration work, maintain the original line and grade, hydraulic
capacity, or original purposes of the facility. See "Routine Maintenance"
definition for further explanation. Where clearing, grading or excavating of
underlying soil takes place during a repaving operation, state general
construction permit coverage by the State of California general permit for
storm water discharges associated with industrial activities or for stormwater
discharges associated with construction activities is required if more than one
acre is disturbed or the activities are part of a larger plan.
   "Control" means to minimize, reduce, eliminate, or prohibit by
technological, legal, contractual or other means, the discharge of pollutants
from an activity or activities.
   "Development" means any construction, rehabilitation, redevelopment or
reconstruction of any public or private residential project (whether single-
family, multi-unit development); industrial, commercial retail and other
nonresidential projects, including public agency projects; or mass grading for
future construction. It does not include routine maintenance to maintain
original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, or original purpose of facility,
nor does it include emergency construction activities required to immediately
protect public health and safety.
   "Directly adjacent" means situated within two hundred feet of the contiguous
zone required for the continued maintenance, function, and structural stability
of the environmentally sensitive area.
   "Director" means the city's director of community development or his or her
designee.
   "Discharge" means when used without qualification the discharge of a
pollutant.
   "Discharge of a pollutant" means any addition of any pollutant or
combination of pollutants to waters of the United States from any point source
or, any addition of any pollutant or combination of pollutants to the waters of
the contiguous zone or the ocean from any point source other than a vessel or
other floating craft which is being used as a means of transportation. The term

         a.   Comply with the requirement;
         b.   Comply with a time schedule for compliance; and
         c.   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action to prevent the

be on the person who is the subject of such action to establish that the
reduction or elimination of the discharge to the maximum extent practicable has
been accomplished through compliance with the best management practices
available, including applicable monitoring, notifications and reporting
requirements.
   (h)   Remedies. Remedies under this chapter are in addition to and do not
supersede or limit any and all other available remedies, civil or criminal. The

such other public body, officer, or official employee, authorized or designated
to enforce this chapter, or to act as superintendent of streets;

permittee proposing to excavate in any highway shall make a search of available
record of underground facilities and shall notify owners or operators known to
have such facilities in the vicinity of the proposed excavation by telephone or
other acceptable means of communications at least forty-eight hours prior to
time of proposed excavation, exclusive of weekends or legal holidays. At such

territory of Los Angeles County, Permittee shall notify those owners or
operators who are members of the System by notifying the System by telephone at
least forty-eight hours prior to time of proposed excavation, exclusive of
weekends or legal holidays. The permit shall not be valid until permittee

which number permittee shall enter upon the face of the permit. Said
notification is an additional method to be used in determining underground
facilities and does not relieve permittee from the responsibility to assure
that owners or operators of such facilities are notified. Any permittee shall
likewise notify nonmembers of the System who are owners or operators of
facilities in the vicinity of the proposed excavation. Any person receiving
notice pursuant to this ordinance shall, not less than one working day in

and reasonable;
   (4)   The City Council finds that such variance or modification is necessary
in order that the property and business of the applicant will not suffer undue
hardship and severe difficulties.
   In case in granting a variance or modification under this section, the City
Council may impose such conditions and limitations on the property and business
of the applicant as it deems necessary or convenient. (Added by Ordinance 292 -

   (f)   Section 801 of Ordinance No. 3597 is amended to read:
Section 801. The provisions of this Chapter apply to permits for the making, or
causing to be made, in any highway, of excavations, and for the placing,
constructing, testing, repairing, changing, monitoring, removing or abandoning
of facilities or encroachments. The provisions of this chapter also apply to
written emergency plans for owners or operators of pipelines used to convey
toxic, corrosive or flammable liquids and mandatory membership in a "One Call
Notification System".

used or to be used to carry toxic, corrosive or flammable liquids, such
pipeline shall be subject to a hydrostatic pressure test as provided herein
before it is placed in operation. The duration of the hydrostatic test for this
purpose shall not be less than twenty-four (24) hours.
   After repair or replacement of any pipeline used or to be used to carry
toxic, corrosive or flammable liquids, made necessary to repair leaks or
breaks, or replacements made necessary for changes required by improvements
within the roadway, the affected portion of the pipeline shall be subjected to
a hydrostatic pressure test as provided herein before placing in operation. The
duration of the hydrostatic test for this purpose shall be not less than
twenty-four (24) hours. However, no such test is required for a minor repair
which does not require removal of the pipeline from operation. If the affected
section is isolated and tested hydrostatically, pressure test of the tie-in
welds is not required; however, tie-in welds shall be examined by radiographic
means.
   No pipeline subject to this Ordinance used or to be used to carry toxic,
corrosive or flammable liquids and over ten (10) years of age, shall be
operated beyond the successive ensuing 12-month period of time unless retested
annually by a hydrostatic pressure test or other test means acceptable to the
Commissioner. The duration of the periodic test for this purpose shall be less
than four (4) hours.
   Each pressure test, either initial or retest shall be in accordance with the
American National Standard Institute's Code for Pressure Piping, Liquid
Petroleum Transportation Piping Systems (ANSI B 31.4) in its latest revision.
The Commissioner may authorize the use of a liquid petroleum that does not
vaporize rapidly (i.e., flash point over 150°F or 66°C) as a test medium.
Pressure tests after initial installation of pipelines and before they are
placed in operation shall show no unexplained loss. Annual or retest pressure
tests shall not show an hourly loss, for each section of the pipeline under
test at the time, in excess of either ten (10) gallons, or the sum of one (1)
gallon and an amount computed at a rate in gallons per mile equivalent to one-
tenth (1/10) of the nominal internal diameter of the pipe.
   The Commissioner may grant administrative waiver or other relief to an owner
or operator under this Ordinance as to the periodic pressure testing of any
pipelines as herein provided if owner or operator can demonstrate that such
testing will cause the unreasonable unscheduled shutdown of plants, terminals,
refineries, or other facilities of which such pipelines constitute an integral
part.
   In addition to the foregoing requirements, any pipeline authorized by this
Ordinance and subject to pressure testing shall be subjected to a pressure test
by the owner or operator at any time as may be required by the Commissioner in
the interest of public safety.
   Within thirty days after completion of any test made pursuant to the
provisions of this Ordinance, the owner or operator shall submit a certified
report of such test for the Commissioner's review. The report shall show the
date of test, description or portion of pipeline tested identified with respect
to County highways, and the test data. The report shall be sufficient in detail
to permit analysis of test results and determination of compliance with the
applicable provisions of this Ordinance or any other applicable Ordinance, rule
or regulation. The report shall also contain any other test information as may
be specifically requested by the Commissioner.
   (i)   Section 802.3 is added to Ordinance No. 3597 to read:
Section 802.3 Block valves shall be installed on each new main line at
locations along the pipelines system that will minimize damage from accidental
product discharge. Said location shall be appropriate for the terrain and the
population density of the area.

Section 802.4. As provided in the American National Standard Institute's Code
for Pressure Piping, Liquid Petroleum Transportation Piping Systems (ANSI B
31.4) in its latest revision, a cathodic protection system shall be installed
for all new ferrous pipelines used to carry toxic, corrosive or flammable
substances other than utility gases in order to mitigate corrosion
deterioration that might result in structural failure. The cathodic protection
system for all new ferrous pipelines carrying utility gases shall be installed
in accordance with General Order No. 112-C of the Public Utilities Commission
of the State of California. A test procedure shall be developed by the owner or
operator to determine whether adequate cathodic protection has been achieved
and submitted to the Commissioner for approval. Reports of cathodic protection
evaluation in accordance with said approval procedure shall be made available
annually for review by the Commissioner.
   (k)   Section 802.5 is added to Ordinance No. 3597 to read:
Section 802.5. Each owner or operator of a pipeline used or to be used to
convey toxic, corrosive or flammable liquids shall have a written emergency
plan approved and on file with the County Forester and Fire Warden. The plan
shall be in accordance with the American National Standard Institute's Code for
Pressure Piping, Liquid Petroleum Transportation Piping Systems (ANSI B 31.4)
in its latest revision.
   The plan shall include but not be limited to the following elements: (1) A
"liaison" element for intercommunications between public agencies and pipeline
owners or operators to provide for prompt coordinated remedial action, and the
dissemination of information as to the location and ownership identification of
pipelines based on the best available records and plans. (2) A "spill
contingency" element to limit the extent of accidental product discharge by
which pipeline owners or operators shall involve themselves in a cooperative
pipeline leak notification emergency action system. (3) A "leak detection"
element by which the pipeline owners or operators can monitor the flow of their
product and can divert, reduce or stop the flow of said product at the first
indication of a product leak. (4) A "first on the scene emergency containment"
element in cooperation with other pipeline owners or operators to be utilized
until arrival of the affected pipeline owners' or operators' personnel. "First
on the scene" costs shall be borne by the owner or operator of the facility and
shall be reimbursed to the organization effecting the emergency containment.
   (l)   Section 810 of Ordinance No. 3597 is amended to read:
   Section 810. Each applicant for a permit to abandon in place or remove any
facility or encroachment in the highway shall do so under terms and conditions
prescribed by the Commissioner. The permit application shall include a plat or
other suitable means describing the facility or encroachment to be abandoned or
removed and indicated its exact location. Permission to abandon a facility or
encroachment without removing shall be subject to removal within one year after
the effective date of the abandonment if the facility or encroachment may
interfere with a present or future public improvement. If it is determined that
the facility or encroachment should be removed, the permittee or its successor
in interest shall remove it at its expense or pay County for the cost of such
removal. Permittee shall leave any abandoned facility or encroachment in a safe
condition.
   In addition to the foregoing, abandonment in place of a pipeline used to
convey toxic, corrosive or flammable liquids will be subject to the following
requirements. The pipeline shall be thoroughly purged of liquids and vapors and
filled with an inert material that will remain in a solid or semi-solid state
if any portion of the pipeline is cut or removed in the future. The permittee

flowing at velocities less than those necessary to produce serious scour;
      (7)   "Ponding of local storm water" means the standing of water in local
depressions. As distinguished from "sheet overflow" this water originates on or
in the vicinity of the property and due to the condition of the ground surface
is unable to reach a drainage channel or conduit.
   (b)   Runoff design shall be made for the frequency of occurrence
hereinafter stipulated in these standards of modified rational method using

to contain a ten-year frequency of occurrence runoff, including undefined
overflow originating within the tract or adjacent thereto.
   (d)   Storm waters within street areas shall be placed in closed conduits
when the maximum depth of in-gutter runoff computed in accordance with the
provisions of the supplemental design standards in the specifications exceeds
desirable depths in relationship to the velocity, as determined by the city
engineer.
   (e)   Proposed subdivision shall not cause inundation or flood hazard
conditions of existing inhabited areas.
   (f)   Drainage shall be accomplished by gravity without surcharge into catch
basins or manholes except by design.
   (g)   Catch basins shall have inlets of varying lengths so designed that the
water is diverted into the catch basin without a reversed direction of the flow
of the water. The inlets shall be designed in accordance with Standard Detail
No. A-3.
   (h)   Drainage channels, conduits and appurtenances shall conform in all
respects to good engineering practice.

on all streets which primarily serve residential dwellings shall be such as to
furnish not less than 0.075 foot candle or more than 0.6 foot candle over any
portion of the street right-of-way. The average illumination as determined by
the superintendent of streets shall be approximately 0.2 foot candle.
   (d)   Wherever existing trees or other plants are to be preserved within the
street right-of-way, street lighting standards shall be carefully located in
such a manner as to receive minimum interference from such trees or plants.

This section establishes regulations for Urban Lot Splits, including a Primary
Dwelling Unit (PDU) and a Secondary Dwelling Unit (SDU) in residential zoning
districts, in accordance with Cal. Gov‘t Code Sections 65852.21 and 66411.7,
also commonly known as Senate Bill 9. The implementation of this section is
designed to expand housing opportunities within existing single-family
neighborhoods by permitting the development of up to two residential units on a
single-family zoned parcel. These regulations aim to provide diverse housing
options while preserving the residential character of neighborhoods, ensuring
consistency with the General Plan, and adhering to the zoning designations of
the parcel. The section seeks to balance the growing demand for additional
housing with the preservation of neighborhood integrity, efficient land use,
and the protection of environmental and infrastructure resources.

21.16.030 Zoning district boundaries.
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any zoning districts shown on
the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply.
   (1)   Where a zoning district’s boundaries approximately follow a lot,
alley, or street line, such lot lines and street and alley centerlines shall be
construed as the district boundaries; otherwise, such boundaries shall be
determined by use of the scale appearing on the zoning map unless dimensions
are specifically indicated.
   (2)   Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the
property encompassed by said street or alley shall be included within the
zoning district or districts of the adjoining properties. If the adjoining
properties are in different zoning districts, the boundary lines shall be the
centerline of the former street or alley and the extension of the side yard
lines of the abutting properties. In the event such street, alley, or right-of-
way was a boundary between two or more different zoning districts, the new
zoning district or zone boundary shall be the property line that is created by
such vacation.
   (3)   Areas annexed to the city shall come into the city at their existing
zone designation. If there is no prior designation, the city council shall
determine the nearest comparable zone for the area. The zoning map shall then
be amended to show the new city limits and zone.
   (4)   In the event of any other uncertainty regarding zone boundaries, the
city council, by written decision, shall determine the location of the zone
boundary. (Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025; Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.16.040 Conformance with zoning district regulations.
   (a) Except as otherwise provided in this title, development shall conform
with zoning district regulations specified below. Every department, official,
and employee of the city having the authority to issue any permit or license
required by law shall comply with the provisions of this title. Any license or
permit issued in conflict with the provisions of this title shall be void and
of no effect.
   (b)   Except as provided by this title, conformance with this title shall be
required as follows:
      (1)   No building or structure shall be erected and no existing building
shall be moved, altered, added to, or enlarged, nor shall any land, building,
or premises be used or designated for any purpose or in any manner other than
is permitted in the zoning district in which such building, land, or premises
is located.
      (2)   No building shall be erected, reconstructed, or structurally
altered to exceed the height limit, lot area, yard setback provisions, or lot
coverage designated in this title for the zoning district in which such
building is located.
      (3)   No yard or other open space abutting any building and provided for
the purpose of complying with the provisions of this title shall be considered
as providing a yard or open space for any other building on any other building
site.
      (4)   Uses or structures that do not conform shall comply with the
provisions of Article IX of this title. (Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025; Ord. 612
Exhibit A (part), 2008).

   (a)   Three residential zoning designations are established to implement the
low density residential (LDR), medium density residential (MDR), and high
density residential (HDR) land use designations of the general plan.
Residential zoning districts are as set forth in the following paragraphs.
   (b)   Single-family Residential (R-1) Zoning Districts. The R-1 districts
are established to designate areas for single-family dwellings (primarily
detached) and similar and related compatible uses. Except as otherwise provided
in Article VI,
Chapter 21.50, one dwelling is permitted on each lot in this district. This
district is further subdivided into five individual single-family categories,
with the suffix indicating the minimum lot size permitted as follows:
      (1)   R-1-6,000 (minimum lot size is 6,000 square feet);
      (2)   R-1-7,500 (minimum lot size is 7,500 square feet);
      (3)   R-1-8,000 (minimum lot size is 8,000 square feet);
      (4)   R-1-10,000 (minimum lot size is 10,000 square feet); and
      (5)   R-1-15,000 (minimum lot size is 15,000 square feet).
   (c)   Medium Density Residential (R-3) Zoning District. The R-3 zoning
district is established to designate areas for detached and attached
residential housing types at a maximum density of fifteen units per acre, and
related compatible uses.
   (d)   High Density Residential (R-4) Zoning District. The R-4 zoning
district is established to designate areas for all housing types at a maximum
density of twenty-eight units per acre, and related compatible uses. (Ord. 736,
§ 5 (part), 2025; Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.18.020 Permitted land uses.
   (a) Table 21.18.020 identifies permitted uses, uses permitted as an
accessory use, uses subject to conditional use permit approval, and prohibited
uses in all residential zoning districts, subject to compliance with all other
provisions of this title. Uses not listed in Table 21.18.020 are prohibited.
   (b)   Accessory use provisions are addressed in Article VI, Chapter
21.42.

Notes:
1.   In the R-1 zoning districts, the setback standards apply to the first
floor only. See Section 2.18.030(B) regarding second story setback
requirements.
2.   In the R-3 and R-4 zoning districts, the required rear yard area may be
used for parking, carports, or garages.
3.   Within 50 feet of a single-family residential property, the building
height shall not exceed 35 feet.
4.   Within 35 feet of any dwelling unit and 25 feet of any residential
property line, no barn, pen, coop, or other structure or area containing exotic
animals, livestock, or poultry shall be maintained. See Chapter
21.30.
5.   For the open space requirements for the R-3 and R-4 zoning districts, up
to 75% of the required open space can be provided in a common, usable
recreation area. Such common recreational area may include indoor recreation
facilities. Also, balconies of minimum dimensions 10 feet long and 6 feet deep
may be credited toward the open space requirement.
(Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025; Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.18.040 Floor-area ratio standards for R-1 districts.
A two-tier regulatory scheme for floor-area ratio standards applies to the
development of new residential structures, as well as additions to existing
structures, in all R-1 zoning districts. These standards are set forth in Table
21.18.040. The first standard indicates the maximum floor-area ratio permitted
by right for various lot sizes in each of the R-1 zones. The second standard
represents a greater maximum floor-area ratio that may be permitted, subject to
certificate of compatibility review pursuant to this title.

21.18.050 Objective design standards for R-1 Districts.
Existing zoning regulates building height, setbacks, density, among other
requirements, while objective design standards regulate criteria such as site
layout, building orientation, architectural elements, pedestrian connections,
among others, to ensure that new housing, room additions, exterior remodels
maintain a design quality reflective of the City of La Mirada.
   (a)   Site design. Site design refers to the arrangement of layout and
relationships between – buildings, parking areas, pedestrian connection and
overall design. The site design standards in this chapter address site layout
and building placement, vehicular surface parking and access, pedestrian
circulation and access. A project application shall follow objective
requirements of the base zone it is located in, such as setbacks and building
height.
      (1)   Pedestrian circulation and access. Pedestrian walkways must be at
least four feet wide along their entire length, ensuring connections throughout
the site and to the entrances of dwelling unit.
         (A)   Pedestrian walkways shall connect public sidewalks, building
entrances, and vehicle parking areas.
         (B)   Materials. Walkways shall be constructed of firm, stable and
slip-resistant materials, such as poured-in-place concrete (including stamped
concrete), permeable paving, decomposed granite, or concrete pavers.
         (C)   Maintenance. Pedestrian walkways shall be maintained in good
condition for the life of the project and shall not be allowed to fall into
disrepair so as to constitute a nuisance or hazard to the public.
         (D)   Enhanced paving for building entrances. Primary building
entrances shall provide decorative and accent paving that contrast in color and
texture from the adjacent walkway paving. Grasscrete is prohibited.
   (b)   Building form, massing, and articulation.
      (1)   Building form and vertical hierarchy. Buildings two stories or less
shall include a defined base and a top, cornice, or parapet cap. All buildings
shall achieve this effect through at least two of the following:
         (A)   Color, texture, or material changes.
         (B)   Variations, projections, or reveals in the wall plane.
         (C)   Variations in fenestration size or pattern.
         (D)   Decorative architectural details, such as cornices and columns.
      (2)   Wall plane variation. Building façades visible from the primary
street shall not extend more than 20 feet in length without either an
architectural element or a two-foot variation in depth in the wall plane.
Building entrances, front porches, upper-story setbacks, projections, and
recessions, such as stoops, bay windows, overhangs, and trellises, count
towards this requirement.
      (3)   All-sided architecture. Buildings shall be designed and articulated
with common details, articulation, materials, and elements on all facades.
      (4)   Roof line variation. Roof lines shall not extend more than a length
of 30 feet without at least one prominent change as described below:
         (A)   Roof forms shall be used to manage apparent size of additions.
         (B)   Variation in architectural elements, such as, dormers,
projections, or roof orientation.
         (C)   Variation of roof height of at least 18 inches (as measured from
the highest point of each roof line).
         (D)   The roof style and pitch should be designed to match that of the
primary/existing residence.
   (c)   Dwelling unit entrances. Ensure that entries to dwelling units are
clearly defined.
   (d)   Visibility of entrances. If a dwelling unit is visible from the
primary street, provide a paved pathway connecting the public-right-of-way to
the front door. The pathway should have a minimum width of four feet. The unit
address and location must be identified by either an address plaque or by other
signage that is clearly legible from the public right-of-way. The plaque or
other signage must be clearly indicated on a site plan submitted with the
building-permit application. The site plan must also show how the unit will be
accessed by fire and safety personnel.
      (1)   Entrance to the primary residence shall be located on the ground
floor with direct access from the primary street right-of-way. Additionally, a
primary building entrance shall incorporate at least one of the following:
         (A)   Entrance recessed within an arch or cased decorative opening
with a minimum depth of 18 inches.
         (B)   Entrance emphasized by a change in roofline of at least 12
inches, or a tower or similar break in the wall façade.
         (C)   Entrance covered by an awning at least three feet in size.
   (e)   Balconies and decks.

         (A)   On lots that utilize the urban lot split: No more than two
dwelling units of any kind may be constructed or maintained on a lot that
results from an urban lot split. For purposes of this subdivision, the two-unit
limitation applies to any combination of primary and secondary dwelling units,
accessory dwelling units, and junior accessory dwelling units.
         (B)   On lots that have not utilized an urban lots split: The lot is
allowed up to four units that comprise of a primary and secondary dwelling
units, accessory dwelling unit, and junior accessory dwelling units.
   (d)   Building official determinations. The city may deny a proposed two-
unit development if the building official makes a written finding, based upon a
preponderance of the evidence, that the proposed housing development project
would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined and determined in paragraph
(2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon public health and safety or the
physical environment and for which there is no feasible method to
satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific, adverse impact.

    (a)    Introduction.
      (1)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of the design standards of this
chapter is to provide the public, building and design professionals, and
decision-makers with objective criteria for eligible new residential and mixed-
use development in the city. The intent is to provide clear design direction
that enhances La Mirada's residential character, allows for design flexibility,
and ensures a high-quality living environment. It is in alignment with the
goals of the city and state to address the housing affordability in this
community.
      (2)   Applicability. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to multi-
family and mixed-use residential development in all zoning districts that
qualify for streamlined, ministerial processing pursuant to California
Government Code Section 65913.4, as well as any other multi-family or mixed-use
development project that qualifies for objective, ministerial review pursuant
to State housing law.
         (A)   This chapter provides objective design standards required for
use in the review of "housing developments" of two or more residential units
governed by California Government Code Section 65913.4 (Streamlined Ministerial
Approval Process) and "housing development projects" as governed by California
Government Code Section 65589.5 (Housing Accountability Act). These sections
detail the review processes required for projects that provide, generally,
either affordable or market rate multi-family housing development projects with
at least two units or mixed-use development projects with at least two thirds
square footage designated for residential uses.
         (B)   These objective design standards are intended to apply
exclusively to multifamily and mixed-use residential developments streamlined
by State housing laws. These objective design standards do not apply to any
other land development type, including detached single-family dwelling units.
Developments proposing detached dwelling unit product types or any other land
development types are subject to the applicable objective standards found in
other relevant regulatory documents and sections of code.
         (C)   Modification or expansion of an existing conforming structure
used for multi-family housing or mixed-use development that includes attached
units is also eligible to use applicable standards of the Multi-family Housing
and Mixed-Use Development Objective Design Standards Manual.

21.20.010 District purposes.
Four commercial zoning districts are established to implement the commercial
(C) land use designation of the general plan. Commercial zoning districts are
as follows:
   (1)   Administrative office district (C-O). The CO district provides areas
suitable for the location of offices for professional services - including
medical and dental services - and for business activities which involve a
relatively low volume of direct consumer contact.
   (2)   Neighborhood commercial (C-1) district. The C-1 district provides
areas suitable for low-intensity retail and service commercial activities
oriented to serving nearby residential areas. Typical uses include small
pedestrian-oriented commercial activities that have minimal impact on adjacent
uses through application of good site design, access and parking arrangements,
landscaping, and lighting standards.
   (3)   General commercial (C-4) district. The C-4 district provides areas
appropriate for a wide range of retail and service uses to meet the present and
prospective needs of the community as a whole. Regulations are intended to
prevent the impairment of safe and efficient movement of traffic and to
encourage attractive development that is compatible with adjacent residential
land uses.
   (4)   Freeway commercial (C-F) district. The C-F district provides areas
appropriate for intense regional-serving commercial and business uses abutting
freeways. (Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025; Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.20.020 Permitted land uses.
Table 21.20.020 identifies permitted uses, permitted accessory uses, uses
permitted subject to conditional use permit approval, and uses prohibited in
all commercial zoning districts, subject to compliance with all other
provisions of this title. Uses not listed in Table 21.20.020 are prohibited.
Chapter
21.42  contains additional regulations regarding accessory uses.

21.32.010 Purpose.
The flood hazard overlay (F) zoning district is established to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable
regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and
privately owned land within flood-prone, mudslide (i.e. mudflow) or flood-
related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted
areas caused by flood damage;
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
   H.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008; Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.32.020 Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008).
21.32.030 Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   “A zone.” See “special flood hazard area.”
   “Accessory structure” means a structure that is either:
      1.   Solely for the parking of no more than two cars; or
      2.   A small, low cost shed for limited storage, less than one hundred
fifty square feet and one thousand five hundred dollars in value.
   “Accessory use” means a use that is incidental and subordinate to the
principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   “Alluvial fan” means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or
fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been
eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on
the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows,
debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.
   “Apex” means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the
flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and
alluvial fan flooding can occur.
   “Appeal” means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   “Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH zone on the flood
insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet;
a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   “Area of special flood hazard.” See “special flood hazard area.”
   “Base flood” means a flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year (also called the “one hundred year flood”). Base
flood is the term used throughout this chapter.
   “Base flood elevation (BFE)” means the elevation shown on the flood
insurance rate map for zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1-V30 that indicates the
water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent or
greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade - i.e.,
below ground level - on all sides.
   “Building.” See “structure.”
   “Development” means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   “Encroachment” means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth,
fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a
floodplain that may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   “Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home
park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either
final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before July
13, 1985 pursuant to Ordinance 365.
   “Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   “Flood, flooding, or flood water” means:
      1.   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and
      2.   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.
   “Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM)” means the official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.
   “Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones
applicable to the community.
   “Flood insurance study” means the official report provided by the Federal
Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate
map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of
the base flood.
   “Floodplain or flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being
inundated by water from any source. See “flooding.”
   “Floodplain administrator” is the community official designated by title to
administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.
   “Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and
enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but
not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain
management regulations, and open space plans.
   “Floodplain management regulations” means this chapter and the zoning
ordinance, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special
purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application
of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof, which
provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
   “Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet
floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.
   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
Also referred to as “regulatory floodway.”

“regulatory floodway” where encroachment may be permitted.
   “Fraud and victimization” as related to Sections
21.32.210 through
21.32.230 (Variance) of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not
cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement,
the planning commission will consider the fact that every newly constructed
building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the
community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years
to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property
and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience,
danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition,
future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to
potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance
rates.
   “Functionally dependent use” means a use, which cannot perform its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The
term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for
the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship
repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related
manufacturing facilities.
   “Governing body” is the local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality
that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   “Hardship” as related to Sections
21.32.210 through
21.32.230 (Variance) of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would
result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The variance shall be
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
   “Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      1.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      2.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      3.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of Interior; or
      4.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or
directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
   “Levee” means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed
and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain,
control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   “Levee system” means a flood protection system, which consists of a levee,
or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices,
which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including
basement. (See “basement” definition).
      1.   An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor
that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an
area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor
provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements,
including, but not limited to:
         a.   The flood openings standard in Section
21.32.150C.3;
         b.   The anchoring standards in Section
21.32.150A;
         c.   The construction materials and methods standards in Section
21.32.150B; and
         d.   The standards for utilities in Section
21.32.160.
      2.   For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are
prohibited as they are considered to be basements. (See “basement” definition).
This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas.
   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”
   “‘Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous
parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or
sale.
   “Market value” is defined in the Los Angeles County substantial damage/
improvement procedures. See Section
21.32.120B.1.
   “Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance
Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations
shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are referenced.
   “New construction,” for floodplain management purposes, means structures for
which the “start of construction” commenced on or after July 13, 1985, and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   “New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after July 13,
2007.
   “Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation,
channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel,
refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or
projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.
   “One hundred year flood” or “100-year flood.” See “base flood.”
   “Program deficiency” means a defect in a community’s floodplain management
regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation
of those floodplain management regulations.
   “Public safety and nuisance” as related to Section
21.32.210 through
21.32.230 (Variance) of this chapter, means that the granting of a variance
must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire
community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully
obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable
lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle that is:
      1.   Built on a single chassis;
      2.   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      3.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty
truck; and
      4.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters or recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   “Regulatory floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one
foot.
   “Remedy a violation” means to bring the structure or other development into
compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is
not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may
be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from
flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal
financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
   “Riverine” means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, and the like.
   “Sheet flow area.” See “area of shallow flooding.”
   “Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area in the floodplain subject
to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown
on a FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or, AH.
   “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the
date of the permit. The “actual start” means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the “actual start of construction” means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building that is principally above
ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
   “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   “Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
      1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      2.   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic
structure.
   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter
which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by
this chapter.
   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance
required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   “Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of
1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the
floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
   “Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or
other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
“Watercourse” includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.
(Ord. 622-U §2 (part), 2008).
21.32.040 Applicability.
This chapter shall apply to all properties within the flood hazard overlay (F)
zoning district.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008).
21.32.050 Basis for establishing the flood hazard overlay (F) zoning district.
The flood hazard overlay (F) zoning district designation applies to special
flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
in the “Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Los Angeles County and Incorporated
Areas” dated September 30, 2005, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps
(FIRMs) and flood boundary and floodway maps (FBFMs), dated September 28, 2008,
and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference
and declared to be a part of this chapter. The FIS and attendant mapping is the
minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by
studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which
are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. The study,
FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at city clerk’s office in city hall located at
13700 La Mirada Boulevard, La Mirada, California.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008).
21.32.060 Compliance.
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards) shall constitute a misdemeanor.
Nothing herein shall prevent the city council from taking such lawful action as
is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008).
21.32.070 Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another chapter, ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008).
21.32.080 Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
   A.   Considered as minimum requirements;
   B.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   C.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008).
21.32.090 Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of city council, any officer or employee
thereof, the State of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008).
21.32.100 Severability.
This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable.
Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be
unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared
to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 622-U §2 (part), 2008).
21.32.110 Designation of the floodplain administrator.
The city manager or his or her designee is hereby appointed to administer,
implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying site plan reviews in
accord with its provisions.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008).
21.32.120 Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator.
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include,
but not be limited to the following:
   A.   Permit Review. Review all site plan reviews to determine:
      1.   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including
determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing
structures;
      2.   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;
      3.   The site is reasonably safe from flooding;
      4.   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the City of La Mirada; and
      5.   All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are
approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not
be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved
CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land
preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.
   B.   Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage
Procedures.
      1.   Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions about
Substantially Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for identifying
and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial
damage, to include defining “market value.”
      2.   Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions
and implemented by community staff.
   C.   Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 21.32.050, the
floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or
other source, in order to administer Section
21.32.150 through
21.32.200.
      NOTE: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods
from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in
Approximate Zone A Areas – A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year)
Flood Elevations” dated July 1995.
   D.   Notification of Other Agencies.
      1.   Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:
         a.   Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of
Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;
         b.   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency; and
         c.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.

         b.   All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the
issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on
conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow
construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as
specified in the “start of construction” definition. Such submissions are
necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting
flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements
are based on current data.

(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008).
21.32.150 Standards of construction.
In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:
   A.   Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements of
structures, including manufactured homes, shall be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
   B.   Construction Materials and Methods. All new construction and
substantial improvements of structures, including manufactured homes, shall be
constructed:
      1.   With flood resistant materials, and utility equipment resistant to
flood damage for areas below the base flood elevation;
      2.   Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      3.   With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding; and
      4.   Within zones AH or AO on the community’s flood insurance rate map,
so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide
flood waters around and away from proposed structures.

facilities, below the elevation recommended under Section
21.32.150C.1, so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water;
         b.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
         c.   Be certified by a registered civil engineer or architect that the
standards of Sections
21.32.150C.2(a) and (b) are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to
the floodplain administrator.
      3.   Flood openings. All new construction and substantial improvements of
structures with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding
basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must meet the
following minimum criteria:
         a.   For non-engineered openings:
            (1)   Have a minimum of two openings on different sides having a
total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding;
            (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade;
            (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwater; and
            (4)   (A)   Buildings with more than one enclosed area must have
openings on exterior walls for each area to allow flood water to directly
enter; or
               (B)   Be certified by a registered civil engineer or architect.
      4.   Manufactured homes. See Section
21.32.180.

            (1)   A garage attached to a residential structure, constructed
with the garage floor slab below the BFE, must be designed to allow for the
automatic entry of flood waters. See Section
21.32.150C.3. Areas of the garage below the BFE must be constructed with flood
resistant materials. See Section
21.32.150B.
            (2)   A garage attached to a nonresidential structure must meet the
above requirements or be dry floodproofed. For guidance on below grade parking
areas, see FEMA Technical Bulletin TB-6.
         b.   Detached garages and accessory structures.
            (1)   Accessory structures used solely for parking (two-car
detached garages or smaller) or limited storage (small, low-cost sheds), as
defined in Section
21.32.030, may be constructed such that its floor is below the base flood
elevation (BFE), provided the structure is designed and constructed in
accordance with the following requirements:
               (A)   Use of the accessory structure must be limited to parking
or limited storage;
               (B)   The portions of the accessory structure located below the
BFE must be built using flood-resistant materials;
               (C)   The accessory structure must be adequately anchored to

(Ord. 622-U §2 (part), 2008; Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.32.160 Standards for utilities.
   A.   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall
be designed to minimize or eliminate:
      1.   Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and
      2.   Discharge from the systems into flood waters.
   B.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them, or contamination from them during flooding.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008).
21.32.170 Standards for subdivisions and other proposed development.
All new subdivisions proposals and other proposed development, including
proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than fifty lots
or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall:
      1.   Identify the special flood hazard areas (SFHA) and base flood
elevations (BFE).
      2.   Identify the elevations of lowest floors of all proposed structures
and pads on the final plans.
      3.   If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the following
as-built information for each structure shall be certified by a registered
civil engineer or licensed land surveyor and provided as part of an application
for a letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) to the floodplain
administrator:
         a.   Lowest floor elevation.
         b.   Pad elevation.
         c.   Lowest adjacent grade.
            A.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall
be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
            B.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall
have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
            C.   All subdivisions and other proposed development shall provide
adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008; Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.32.180 Standards for manufactured homes.
   A.   All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, on
sites located: (1) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (2) in a
new manufactured home park or subdivision; (3) in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or (4) in an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has incurred substantial
damage as the result of a flood, shall, within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the
community’s flood insurance rate map, be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the
base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
   B.   All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH,
and AE on the community’s flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the
provisions of Section
21.32.180A will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so
that either the:
      1.   Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood
elevation; or
      2.   Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than
thirty-six inches in height above grade. Upon the completion of the structure,
the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a
registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and verified by the
community building inspectors to be properly elevated. Such certification and
verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008; Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.32.190 Standards for recreational vehicles.
All recreational vehicles placed in zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s
flood insurance rate map will either:
   1.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days; or
   2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is
ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has
no permanently attached additions; or
   3.   Meet the permit requirements of Section
21.32.130 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
manufactured homes in Section
21.32.180A.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008; Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.32.200 Floodways.
Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood
waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the
following provisions apply:
   A.   Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction,
substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be
permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community’s flood insurance rate
map, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point
within the City of La Mirada.
   B.   Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the City of La Mirada shall
prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil
engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not
result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
   C.   If subsections A and B of Section
21.32.200 are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and
other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of Section
21.32.150.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008; Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.32.210 Variance.
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only.
Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk
and will not be modified by the granting of the variance.
   The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general
principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are
not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with
physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of
this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the
surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property
and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain
to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property
owners.
   It is the duty of the planning commission to help protect its citizens from
flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure is built below flood level are so serious that variances
from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite
rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008).
21.32.220 Conditions for variances.
   A.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-
half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of Sections
21.32.110 through
21.32.200 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
   B.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures” (as defined in Section
21.32.030 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
   C.   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   D.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
“Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the planning commission need not grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation
the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the planning
commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this
chapter. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
      1.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance
coverage, and
      2.   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by
the floodplain administrator in the Office of the Los Angeles County Recorder
and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of
the affected parcel of land.
   E.   The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008).
21.32.230 Appeal board.
   A.   In passing upon requests for variances, the planning commission shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and the:
      1.   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others;
      2.   Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      3.   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      4.   Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
      5.   Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      6.   Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are
not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      7.   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      8.   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      9.   Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      10.   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
      11.   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.
   B.   Variances shall only be issued upon a:
      1.   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
      2.   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      3.   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary
public expense, create a nuisance (see “public safety and nuisance”), cause
fraud and victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
         a.   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections
21.32.220 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does
not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
         b.   Upon consideration of the factors of Section
21.32.210A and the purposes of this chapter, the planning commission may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this chapter.
(Ord. 622-U § 2 (part), 2008).

OIL DRILLING OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICT
Sections:
   
21.36.010   District purpose.
   
21.36.020   Applicability.
   
21.36.030   Permit requirements.
   
21.36.040   Special application requirements.
   
21.36.050   Development and operational standards.
21.36.010 District purpose.
The oil drilling (-O) overlay zoning district is established to protect the
health, safety, public welfare, and physical environment of the city by the
reasonable regulation of oil and gas production facilities and operations.
Provisions herein are intended to supplement the regulations of the State
Division of Oil and Gas.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.36.020 Applicability.
This overlay district is permitted in combination with all underlying zoning
districts with the exception of residential zoning districts or any zoning
district which allows residential use (for example, planned unit development).
This overlay district may only be applied to properties containing a minimum of
forty acres, but not more than one hundred sixty acres in gross area.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.36.030 Permit requirements.
A zoning code amendment is required to rezone a property with the oil drilling
(-O) overlay designation, and a conditional use permit is required for
development and operation of an oil drilling facility.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.36.040 Special application requirements.
In addition to the standard permit processes listed in Article VIII, the
following special requirements shall apply to all applications for oil drilling
facilities and operations.
   (1)   Application submittal requirements. The application shall contain a
statement that the applicant has proprietary or contractual authority to drill
for and produce oil, gas and other hydrocarbon substances under the surface of
at least seventy-five percent of the property to be included in the overlay
district. If authority is contractual, the contract shall be provided with the
application. The application shall also include a report from a state-licensed
geologist confirming that the production of oil from beneath the proposed
district would not, in his or her opinion, result in any noticeable subsidence.
   (2)   Public notice. Standard public hearing notice requirement for property
owners within three hundred feet of the subject parcel shall be extended to
five hundred feet.
   (3)   Staff review. The staff report to the designated approving authorities
(planning commission and ultimately city council) shall include discussion of
whether or not exploration for oil, gas, and other hydrocarbon substances is
geologically justified in the district.
   (4)   Findings and conditions. Any action of the city council to approve an
application for oil drilling and production shall include the standard findings
for all requested entitlements and compliance with all applicable provisions
herein. In addition to the development standards set forth in Section
21.36.050, the city council may impose additional conditions to protect the
public health, safety, welfare, and physical environment of La Mirada.
   (5)   Term of conditional use permit. As identified in
Chapter 21.106, the conditional use permit is a limited term permit and must be
exercised within a specified period or become null and void. The conditional
use permit term limit for oil drilling facilities and operation shall be ten
years. Additionally, the permit shall become null and void if the approval is
not exercised within one year from the effective date of the permit. Oil
drilling facilities abandoned for a period of one year shall become null and
void.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.36.050 Development and operational standards.
The following minimum development and operational standards shall apply to all
oil drilling and production facilities. Applicable standards shall be
incorporated into project conditions of approval.
   (1)   Not more than one controlled drill site shall be permitted for each
forty acres of land.
   (2)   Unless the city council determines that closer spaces are necessary
for efficient oil field development, the minimum separation distance between
controlled drill sites shall be one thousand three hundred twenty feet.
   (3)   Within one year from the effective date of district and permit
approval, the lessee or developer shall execute an offer in writing giving to
each record owner or property located in the oil drilling district who has not
executed the lessee's or developer's lease or other authorization to drill the
right to share in the proceeds of production from wells bottomed in the
district, upon the same basis as those property owners who have by lease or
other legal consent granted to the lessee or developer the right to drill for
and product oil, gas or other hydrocarbon substances from the subsurface of the
district. The offer shall remain open for acceptance for a period of five years
from the effective date. During the period the offer is in effect, the owner/
developer shall impound all royalties to which the owners or any of them may
become entitled and pay to the record owners of property in the district who
had not signed the lease at the time of such effective date, but who accept
such offer in writing within the five-year period. Any such royalties impounded
at the time the offer expires, which are not due or payable as hereinabove
provided, shall be paid pro rata to those owners who, at the time of such
expiration, are otherwise entitled to share in the proceeds of such production.
   (4)   In the case of properties under lease to a lessee who has not been
permitted to drill and produce within an established oil drilling overlay
district, the city council shall require that the lessee or developer who is
authorized to drill and produce hydrocarbons from the district shall offer a
consolidation agreement to the lessee who has not been permitted to drill and
produce. Such consolidation agreement shall contain an offer in writing, open
for acceptance for one hundred eighty days, giving such other lessee the choice
of: assigning his or her leases to the district operator subject to terms and
conditions agreed upon, or a consolidation agreement providing that each such
lessee shall contribute to the cost of drilling, producing, or otherwise
developing hydrocarbons within the district and shall share in the proceeds of
production from the district either in the proportion that the area of his or
her leasehold bears to the total area of the district, or in accordance with
some other formula agreed upon.
   (5)   If circumstances do not permit the construction of controlled drill
sites in adjoining or closely spaced districts in compliance with the
requirements of this chapter, or if good zoning practice would be best served
by consolidating competitive drilling and producing operations, the city
council shall require competing lessees or developers of such district to enter
into joint operations for the conduct of a unit plan of development of
hydrocarbon reserves.
   (6)   Prior to commencement of operations, each lessee or developer shall
post a group surety bond for one hundred thousand dollars in favor of the city
to ensure compliance with conditions, provisions, restrictions, and
requirements of this chapter to the satisfaction of the city attorney. The
surety shall remain in effect for the life of the permit. This requirement may
not be modified, waived, or extended.
   (7)   The designated approving authority determines that oil drilling and
production activities have caused or may cause subsidence in the elevation of
the ground within the district or within the immediate vicinity (based on
expert data), the approving authority shall require the lessee or developer to
take corrective action, including re-pressurizing the oil producing structure
or cessation of oil drilling and production.
   (8)   The drilling of the wells shall be conducted in accordance with good
oil field practice. Blow-out prevention equipment shall be installed and
maintained in connection with the drilling of any well. Down-hole shut-off
valves shall be installed on completed wells to guard against the danger of
blow-outs.
   (9)   Producing wells that are required to be pumped shall be equipped with
subsurface hydraulic units. All surface pumps and compressors shall be located
within acoustically designed enclosures, adequately soundproofed. Wells shall
be serviced with portable type equipment only.
   (10)   All oil and gas produced from the wells on the property shall be
transported from the drill site by means of underground pipeline connected
directly with the producing pump or with tanks or treating facilities by a
completely closed system without venting products to the atmosphere at the
production site, and in no event shall there be any storage or treatment
facilities on the property other than necessary to conform production to
pipeline requirements. LACT (lease automatic custody transfer) procedures shall
be adopted wherever practical, but in no event shall more than three-day
storage or two one thousand-barrel tanks (whichever is greater) be erected or
maintained on the property. Furthermore, the production tanks and production
equipment shall be so placed and located with respect to enclosing fixtures
surrounding the site as to not be visible to persons on adjacent public streets
or from adjacent residential property having approximately the same ground
level elevation as the average ground level surrounding the drill site.
   (11)   No refining process or any process for the extraction of products
from natural gas shall be carried on at the drill site, except for such minor
process as necessary to make natural gas acceptable for delivery in the city
gas mains.
   (12)   All tools, pipe, and other equipment in connection with the drilling
and production activities shall be stored and kept on the drill site within a
walled and landscaped enclosure.
   (13)   Drilling procedures shall be conducted efficiently for the purpose of
removing and discontinuing derrick and drilling operations in the shortest
possible time period.
   (14)   All drilling work shall be insured with limits as required by the
public works director, and in no event less than two million dollars, against
liability in tort and public liability and property damage, and against
pollution liability damage in such amount as may be required by the public
works director with respect to drilling or production, or activities or
operations incident thereto. Each such policy shall be conditioned or endorsed
to cover such agents, lessees, or representatives of the owner, lessee or
permittee as may actually conduct drilling, production, or incidental
operations permitted. The insurance policy shall be reviewed and kept with the
city attorney. A certificate of insurance carrier and its address and a sworn
statement that such insurance will be maintained in full force and effect, and
shall be submitted to the city attorney prior to issuance of required permits.
   (15)   The drill site and approaches thereto shall at all times be kept in a
clean, free from weeds and debris, other than necessary and incidental drilling
equipment and supplies, and shall be effectively landscaped and maintained as
required and conditioned. Special attention shall be paid to the accumulation
of oil/oil products/equipment which might cause fumes or odors detrimental to
the adjoining property. Furthermore, upon completion of the drilling
operations, all equipment and supplies, except those actually necessary in
production work and as specified on plans for the installation of the various
production facilities and devices, shall be removed from the property, so that,
as far as practicable, there be no evidence above the ground of the presence of
the oil producing facilities in the pits and cellars heretofore specified.
   (16)   All pumping units established in the district shall be installed in
pits so that no part thereof will be above the surface of the ground.
   (17)   Adequate fire fighting apparatus and supplies, approved by the fire
department shall be maintained on the drilling site at all times during
drilling and production operations.
   (18)   All production equipment shall be constructed and operated so that no
noise, vibration, dust, odor or other harmful or annoying substances shall ever
be permitted to result from production operations carried on at any drill site.
Structures on the site shall not be permitted to become dilapidated, unsightly
or unsafe. If capable of reducing factors of nuisance or annoyance, proven
technological improvements in methods of production shall be adopted as they
become available.
   (19)   All permanent equipment shall be painted and kept in neat condition.
All production operations shall be as free from noise as possible with modern
oil operations.
   (20)   In compliance with safety and clearance requirements, all equipment
used in connection with the flowing or pumping of wells shall be properly
screened.
   (21)   When drilling is completed on a well, the site shall be free of
debris, landscaped with planting of shrubbery so as to screen from public view,
and permanent equipment kept in good condition.
   (22)   An internal combustion engine or electrical equipment may be used in
the drilling or pumping operations of the well, and if an internal combustion
engine is used, mufflers shall be installed on the engine to reduce noise.
Muffler installation shall be to the satisfaction of the fire department.
   (23)   All waste substances used or produced in connection with oil drilling
production or operations shall be retained in watertight receptors from which
they may be piped or hauled for terminal disposal in a dumping area
specifically approved for such disposal by the Los Angeles Regional Water
Pollution Control Board.
   (24)   Drilling, pumping and other power operations shall use electrical
power generated off-site.
   (25)   Drilling operations shall be conducted in connection with only one
well at a time in any one district, and such well shall be completed before
operations for the drilling of another well are commenced; provided, however,
that the city may permit the drilling of more than one well at a time after the
discovery well has been completed.
   (26)   All oil drilling and production operations shall be conducted in such
a manner as to eliminate, as far as practicable, dust, noise, vibration or
noxious odors, and shall be in accordance with the best accepted practices
incident to drilling for and production of oil, gas and other hydrocarbon
substances.
   (27)   All parts of the derrick above the derrick floor not reasonably
necessary for ingress and egress, including the elevated portion thereof used
as a hoist, shall be enclosed with fire resistive soundproofing material
approved by the county fire department, and the same shall be painted or
stained so as to render such material as unobtrusive as practicable.
   (28)   All tools, pipe and other equipment used in connection with any
drilling or production operations shall be screened from view, and all drilling
operations shall be conducted or carried on behind a solid fence, which shall
be maintained in good condition at all times, and be painted or stained so as
to render such fence as unobtrusive as practicable.
   (29)   Materials, equipment, tools or pipe used for drilling or production
operations shall be delivered to or removed from the controlled drilling site
between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. daily. Special approval from the
city planner is required for delivery and removal outside of specified hours.
With the exception of drilling and production operations, no work shall be
conducted on the property between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.,
Sundays, or state holidays.
   (30)   No earthen sumps shall be used.
   (31)   No oil, gas or other hydrocarbon substances may be produced from any
well hereby permitted unless all equipment necessarily incident to such
production is completely enclosed. Enclosures shall be approved by the building
and fire departments, shall be permanent in nature, and shall be designed to be
compatible with surrounding development. The architectural treatment of the
enclosure's exterior shall also be subject to planning commission approval.
   (32)   No oil, gas or other hydrocarbon substances may be produced from any
well located within a one-half mile radius of any residential property or use,

facility, and for training, counseling, and treatment programs for residents.
      4.   The site shall be kept free of rubbish and debris at all times.
      5.   The operator may provide a storage area for the temporary storage of
personal items of the clients. This storage area shall not be visible from the
right-of-way.

21.44.060   Development and operational standards.
21.44.010 Purpose and intent.
The intent of these regulations is to prevent problems of blight and
deterioration which can be brought about by the concentration of adult
entertainment businesses in close proximity to incompatible uses such as
schools, churches, parks, recreational centers, and residentially zoned
districts or in proximity to other adult uses. The city council finds that it
has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of adult
entertainment businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the
area, and an increase in crime, and can cause other businesses and residents to
move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of these regulations to establish
reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of adult
business establishments or their proximity to incompatible uses, while
permitting such adult business establishments in certain areas.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).

21.46.010 Purpose.
   (a)   The purpose of the regulatory provisions set forth in this chapter is
to establish development standards for the installation and maintenance of
antennas and wireless antenna facilities within specified areas of the city.
These standards are intended to ensure that the design and location of those
antennas and facilities are consistent with previously adopted policies of the
city, to promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general
welfare of the city's residents, and to enhance the aesthetic quality and
appearance of the city by maintaining architectural and structural integrity
and by protecting views and vistas from obtrusive and unsightly accessory uses
and facilities.
   (b)   In adopting and implementing the regulatory provisions of this
chapter, it is the intent of the city council to further the objectives
specified above in subsection (a) without unnecessarily burdening the federal
interests in ensuring access to satellite services, in promoting fair and
effective competition among competing communications service providers, and in
eliminating local restrictions and regulations that, with regard to antennas,
preclude reception of an acceptable signal quality or unreasonably delay,
prevent, or increase the cost of installation, maintenance, or use of those
antennas.
   (c)   With regard to the regulatory requirements set forth herein, the city
council expressly finds and determines that they are necessary, desirable, and
in the best interests of the community to protect public safety. The city
council further finds and determines that these regulatory requirements are
applicable to the proposed installation of satellite earth station antennas or
fixed wireless antenna facilities that are not permitted accessory uses and
that, because of legitimate safety-related concerns, do not meet the criteria
for exemption from local regulation established by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) under the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
   (d)   The regulatory provisions set forth in this chapter are not applicable
to any of the following:
      (1)   City-owned antennas or antenna facilities, including those used for
emergency communications and public safety purposes, that are located or
proposed to be located on either publicly owned or privately owned property.
      (2)   Privately owned antenna or antenna facilities that are located or
proposed to be located on city-owned property or within the public rights-of-
way; provided, however, that owners of such devices must obtain a right-of-way
use permit pursuant to the Municipal Code.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
DIVISION I. REGULATION OF ANTENNA AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES
21.46.020 Mandatory compliance with code requirements.
In addition to complying with all applicable safety-related development
standards set forth in this chapter, the installation of all antenna and
telecommunications facilities must comply with all applicable building codes,
fire codes, and electrical codes. In particular, electrical service must be
properly grounded and rated fire walls may not be penetrated.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.46.030 Permit requirements by zoning district.
   (a)   Permit Required. Unless otherwise exempt from permit requirements
pursuant to Section
21.46.040, each wireless communication facility requires a permit in accordance
with Table 21.46.030.
   (b)   Permit Processing. Permits shall be processed in accordance with
applicable provisions of Article VIII for each of the specific permits listed
in Table 21.46.030.
   (c)   Conditions. The designated approving authority for each of the listed

the potential visual or other impact of the proposed facility.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.46.040 Devices measuring one meter or less in diameter.
The following antennas and telecommunications facilities may be installed as
permitted accessory uses in land use zones where residential and nonresidential
uses are authorized without zoning clearance/plan check and without obtaining a
building permit:
   (1)   An antenna located in any zoning district that is designed for the
following purposes and that meets the specified dimensions and height
limitations:
      (A)   An antenna that is designed to receive direct broadcast satellite
service, including direct-to-home satellite services, provided that such
antenna is one meter (39.37 inches) or less in diameter and is either building-
mounted or ground- mounted and elevated by a mast.
      (B)   An antenna that is designed to receive video programming services
by means of multipoint distribution services, including multi-channel
multipoint distribution services, and such antenna is one meter (39.37 inches)
or less in diameter or diagonal measurement and is either building-mounted or
ground-mounted and elevated by a mast.
      (C)   Antennas referenced above in subsections (A) and (B) above may not
exceed the following height limitations:
         (i)   The height limit for ground-mounted antenna is ten feet.
         (ii)   Building-mounted antenna may not project above the eave of the
pitched roof or top of the parapet wall or cornice.
         (iii)   Roof-mounted antenna shall not extend more than five feet
above the highest (peak) point of the roofline, parapet wall, or other roof
screen.
         (iv)   Exceptions to these height limits may be granted by the city
planner where the applicant can demonstrate that additional height is necessary
to obtain a useable quality signal.
   (2)   An antenna, located in any zoning district, which is designed solely
to receive television broadcast signals, and such antenna, whether building-
mounted or ground-mounted, is limited to that height which is reasonably
necessary to ensure the reception of television broadcast signals of an
acceptable quality.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.46.050 Devices measuring greater than one meter in diameter.
   (a)   The following antenna and telecommunications facilities may be
installed in any zoning district where commercial or industrial uses are
generally permitted, provided that a building permit is first obtained, that
the antenna/facility receives required zoning clearance/plan check or
conditional use permit approval pursuant this title, and that the installation
complies with all applicable safety-related development standards set forth in
this chapter.
      (1)   A satellite earth station antenna that is designed to receive video
programming services, and the diameter or diagonal measurement of that antenna
exceeds one meter (39.37 inches) but does not exceed two meters (78.74 inches).
Such antenna may be either building-mounted or ground-mounted and elevated by a
mast, but it may not exceed the following height limitations:
         (A)   The height limit for ground-mounted antenna is ten feet.
         (B)   Building-mounted antenna may not project above the eave of the
pitched roof or top of the parapet wall or cornice.
         (C)   Roof-mounted antenna shall not extend more than five feet above
the highest (peak) point of the roofline, parapet wall, or other roof screen.
   (b)   A fee may be imposed by the city for the issuance of any building
permit that is required under this section.
   (c)   The city council finds and determines that the building permit
requirement imposed by this section is in the public interest and is justified
by the following facts and circumstances:
      (1)   Satellite earth station antennas that exceed one meter in diameter
or diagonal measurement but do not exceed two meters may reasonably be expected
to be of a size, weight, and bulk substantially in excess of the smaller
satellite earth station antennas that are permitted accessory uses and
therefore generate legitimate safety concerns of a greater magnitude.
      (2)   Satellite earth station antennas having a diameter or diagonal
measurement between one meter and two meters that are proposed to be located in
commercial or industrial zoning districts have the potential to adversely
affect the public safety due to the concentration of substantial numbers of
employees and customers in commercial and industrial buildings.
   (d)   The city council further finds and determines that the building permit
requirement imposed by this section is no more burdensome than is necessary to
enable the city to achieve the following safety-related objectives and thereby
reduce the potential for bodily injury, death, and property damage:
      (1)   To verify the proper mounting of these larger antennas on buildings
or masts within commercial and industrial land use zones in order to reduce
potential safety hazards resulting from faulty installations, including
detachments attributable to windstorms, earthquakes, or other natural causes.
      (2)   To minimize the potential for fire-related hazards by verifying
compliance with all applicable requirements of the city's electrical code,
including those pertaining to wiring and electrical connections, grounding, and
clearance from adjacent power lines.
      (3)   To ensure that the installation is completed in compliance with all
applicable building code and fire code requirements, particularly in those
circumstances where fire-rated walls or the roof of a structure will be subject
to drilling or alteration.
      (4)   To ensure that no antenna, nor any of its component parts or
accessory facilities, encroaches into the public rights-of-way, thereby
compromising public safety.
      (5)   To ensure that a licensed structural or civil engineer certifies
engineering calculations for all footings that may be required for the
installation of a ground-mounted antenna.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.46.060 Safety-related development standards for antenna and
telecommunications facilities.
   (a)   The safety-related development standards set forth in this section
apply in all zoning districts to the siting, construction, and operation of the
following antenna and telecommunications facilities:
      (1)   Satellite earth station antennas that are permitted accessory uses.

Chapter 21.72.
   (2)   If a support structure, or an antenna array affixed to a building or
to a support structure, becomes inoperable or ceases to be used for a period of
six consecutive months, the permittee or the property owner must give written
notice of such inoperability or nonuse to the public works director. The
antenna array and, if applicable, the support structure, must be removed within
a ninety-day period. If that removal does not occur, the city may remove the
antenna array and, if applicable, the support structure, at the expense of the
permittee or the owner; provided, however, that if other antenna arrays owned
or operated by other service providers are affixed to the same support
structure, then only the antenna array that has become inoperable or has ceased
to be used is required to be removed, and the support structure may remain in
place until all service providers cease to use it.

housing development or condominium conversion shall include only one of the
following requirements and satisfy all other applicable provisions of this
Zoning Code:

(Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025).
21.49.040 General requirements.

with this section that results in fractional units, including base density and
bonus density, shall be rounded up to the next whole number.
   (b)   Mixed income development. If a housing development qualifies for a
density bonus under more than one income category, as senior housing, or as

in the application. Density bonuses from more than one category may not be
combined.

in and of itself, shall not be interpreted as requiring a General Plan
amendment, Zoning Map amendment, or other discretionary approval.

interpreted to require or limit the city from providing direct financial
incentives, including the provision of publicly owned land or the waiver of
fees or dedication requirements.

cumulative total of base units allowed by the underlying zone and the density
bonus units allowed by Sections 21.49.050 and 21.49.052. Incentives,

density.
   (f)   Reduced density. An applicant for a density bonus may elect to provide
a lesser percentage of density increase than what is authorized by Section
21.49.050 including, but not limited to, no increase in density, but shall
remain eligible for concessions or incentives, waivers of development
standards, and eligible parking requirements provided the project meets the
eligibility requirements of this section.
   (g)   When calculating a density bonus granted that includes shared housing
building, "unit" means one shared housing unit and its pro rata share of
associated common area facilities. (Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025).
21.49.050 Determining allowed base density.
Density shall be determined using dwelling units per acre and shall be the
maximum number of units allowed by the zoning code, specific plan, or general
plan that is applicable to the project site. However, if the applicable zoning
ordinance, specific plan, or land use element of the general plan does not
provide a dwelling-units-per-acre standard for density, then the local agency
shall calculate the number of units using both of the following:
   (a)   Estimating the realistic development capacity of the site based on the
objective development standards applicable to the project, including, but not
limited to, floor area ratio, site coverage, maximum building height and number
of stories, building setbacks and step-backs, open space requirements, minimum
percentage or square footage of any nonresidential component, and parking
requirements. Parking requirements shall include considerations regarding
number of spaces, location, design, type, and circulation.
   (b)   Maintaining the same average unit size and other project details
relevant to the base density study, excepting those that may be modified by
waiver or concession to accommodate the bonus units, in the proposed project as
in the study.
(Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025).
21.49.060 Allowed density bonuses.
A housing development that meets one of the eligibility levels in Section
21.49.030 is entitled to a density bonus as provided herein.
   (a)   Density bonus for very low-, low-, and moderate-income households. A
housing development that is eligible for a density bonus pursuant to Section
21.49.030(a)(1) through (a)(4) is entitled to a density bonus calculated as
follows:

21.49.090 Parking requirements in density bonus projects.
   (a)   Applicability. For a housing development that meets one of the
eligibility levels in Section
21.49.030, the applicant may request application of the parking requirements
set forth below. An applicant may request additional parking incentives beyond
those provided in this section in compliance with Sections
21.49.060 and
21.49.070.
   (b)   Number of parking spaces required.
      (1)   Parking ratios. At the request of the applicant, the following
minimum parking ratios may apply to the housing development:

2 to 3 bedrooms     1.5 spaces
4 or more bedrooms  2.5 spaces
 
      (2)   Within one-half mile of major transit stop. Notwithstanding
subsection (b)(1) of this section, if a housing development provides at least
20% low-income units or 11% very low-income units and is located within one-
half mile of a major transit stop with unobstructed access, then, upon the
request of the developer, the city may not impose a vehicular parking ratio,
inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, that exceeds 0.5 spaces per
bedroom.
      (3)   Zero parking. Notwithstanding subsection (b)(1) of this section, if
a housing development consists solely of rental units affordable to lower-
income families, then upon the request of the developer, the city may not
impose a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking,
if either of the following criteria are met:
         (A)   The housing development is located within one-half mile of a
major transit stop with unobstructed access from the housing development;
         (B)   The housing development is a for-rent housing development for
individuals who are 62 years of age or older that meet the definition in
Sections 51.2 and 51.3 of the Civil Code and the housing development has either
paratransit service or unobstructed access within one-half mile of a fixed bus
route that operates at least eight times per day; or
         (C)   The housing development is either a special needs housing
development, as defined in Section 51312 of the Health and Safety Code, or
supportive housing development as defined in Section 50675.14 of the Health and
Safety Code, and the housing development has either paratransit service or
unobstructed access within one-half mile of a fixed bus route that operates at
least eight times per day.
      (4)   Notwithstanding subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the
city may impose the parking ratio set forth in subsection (b)(1) of this
section, if the city or an independent consultant has conducted an areawide or
jurisdiction-wide parking study within the past seven years that demonstrates a
higher parking ratio is necessary based upon an analysis of parking
availability, differing levels of transit access, walkability access to transit
services, the potential for shared parking, the effect of parking requirements
on the cost of market-rate and subsidized developments, and the lower rates of
car ownership for low-income and very low-income individuals, including seniors
and special needs individuals.
      (5)   Location of parking. For purposes of this section, a housing
development may provide on-site parking through uncovered or tandem on-site
parking.

makes a request for an incentive or concession, the review authority shall
grant the request unless one or more of the following findings is made:
      (1)   The incentive or concession is not required in order to provide
affordable housing costs or for rents for the targeted units to be set as
specified in Section
21.49.130(b);
      (2)   The incentive or concession would have a specific adverse impact
upon public health and safety, or on any real property listed in the California
Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to
satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering
the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households; or
      (3)   The incentive would be contrary to State or Federal law.
   (b)   Number of incentives or concessions. Except as provided in subsection
(a) of this section, the review authority shall grant the following number of
incentives or concessions:
      (1)   One incentive or concession for a housing development that includes
at least 10% of the total units for low-income households, at least 5% of the
total units for very low-income households, at least 20% of the total units for

total units for moderate-income households in a for-sale housing development.
      (4)   Four incentives or concessions for housing development that include
at least 16% of the units for very low-income households or at least 45% for
persons and families of moderate income in a housing development in which the
units are for sale.
      (5)   Five incentives or concessions for projects that meet the criteria
of Section
21.49.030(a)(4). If the housing development is located within one-half mile of
a major transit stop with unobstructed access or is located in a very low
vehicle travel area, the housing development is eligible for a height increase
of up to three additional stories, or 33 feet.
   (c)   Type of incentive or concession. For the purposes of this chapter,
"incentive" or "concession" means any of the following:
      (1)   A reduction in the development standard(s) as that term is defined
in Section
21.49.020, that results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual
cost reductions;
      (2)   A mixed-use project in conjunction with the housing development, if
the nonresidential portion of the mixed-use project will reduce the cost of the
housing development, is compatible with the residential portion of the housing
development, and is compatible with adjacent existing or planned development;
      (3)   A reduction or waiver of any city imposed fee or dedication of
land, which shall be at the sole discretion of the City Council; and/or
      (4)   Other regulatory incentives that will result in identifiable,
financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.
(Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025).
21.49.110 Waivers or reductions of development standards.
In addition to requesting an incentive or concession, an applicant for a
density bonus may also submit a proposal to the city to waive or reduce an
unlimited number of development standards that would otherwise preclude or
inhibit construction of the housing development at the densities or with the
incentives permitted by this chapter.
   (a)   When an applicant makes a request for a waiver, the review authority
shall grant the request unless any of the following findings are made:
      (1)   The waiver or reduction of development standards would have a
specific adverse impact upon public health or safety, and for which there is no
feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse
impact.
      (2)   The waiver or reduction of development standards would have an
adverse impact on any real property listed in the California Register of
Historical Resources.
      (3)   The waiver or reduction of development standards would be contrary
to State or Federal law.
   (b)   Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a housing development
that is eligible for no cap on density pursuant to Section 21.49.060(a) shall
only be eligible for a waiver or reduction of development standards as provided
in Section
21.49.030(a)(4).

      (1)   An amount of residential floor area equal to or greater than the
floor area of the childcare facility; or
      (2)   An incentive that contributes to the economic feasibility of the
childcare facility as provided in Section
21.49.100(c).
      (3)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city shall not be required to
provide a density bonus for a childcare facility if it finds that the community
has adequate childcare facilities.

density bonus units are required to remain affordable in compliance with
Section
21.49.130; and
      (2)   Of the children who attend the childcare facility, the children of
very low-income, low-income, or moderate-income households shall equal a
percentage that is equal to or greater than the percentage of dwelling units
that are required for very low-income, lower-income, or moderate-income
households in compliance with Section

of equivalent financial value provided:
      (1)   The applicant agrees to pay for the reasonably necessary
administrative costs, including, but not limited to, staff costs, consultant
fees, photocopy costs, and mailing fees, incurred by the city; and
      (2)   The city places such reasonable conditions on the granting of a
density bonus or other incentives of equivalent financial value as it finds
appropriate, including, but not limited to, conditions which assure continued
affordability of units to subsequent very low-, low- and moderate-income
households.
   (b)   Replacement units. All units within the condominium conversion shall
meet the replacement requirements in Section
21.49.150.
   (c)   Ineligible requests. Apartments which are proposed for conversion to
condominiums shall be ineligible for a density bonus or other incentive under
this section if the apartments were previously granted a density bonus,
concession, incentive, or waiver or reduction of development standards. (Ord.
736, § 5 (part), 2025).
21.49.140 Design and distribution of affordable units.
Affordable units shall be designed and distributed within the housing
development as follows:
   (a)   Number of bedrooms. Affordable units shall reflect the range of
numbers of bedrooms provided in the residential development project as a whole;
   (b)   Comparable quality and facilities. Affordable units shall be
constructed to the same quality and exterior design as the market-rate housing
units. Additionally, the affordable units shall include the same laundry,
recreation, and other facilities that are made available to the market-rate
housing units;
   (c)   Access. In mixed-income multi-unit structures, the occupants of the
affordable units shall have the same access to common entrances and any common
areas including parking areas in that structure as the occupants of the market-
rate housing units;
   (d)   Size. Affordable units may be smaller and have different interior
finishes and features than the market-rate units; and
   (e)   Location. Affordable units shall be distributed within the residential
development, unless clustering is allowed by the review authority.
Notwithstanding, in a mixed-income multi-unit structure, affordable units shall
not be isolated to a specific floor or an area of a specific floor.
(Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025).
21.49.150 Replacement units.
An application for a density bonus on any property with existing rental
dwelling units or rental dwelling units that were vacated or demolished within
the five years preceding the application; and are, or were, subject to a
recorded covenant that restricts rents to very low- or low-income households;
or are, or were, occupied by very low- or low-income household(s) shall be
subject to all of the following requirements:
   (a)   Occupied units. For rental dwelling units that are occupied on the
date of the application, the housing development shall provide at least the
same number of affordable units of equivalent size at affordable rent or
affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons or families in the same or
lower-income category as the existing occupants.
   (b)   Vacant or demolished units. For rental dwelling units that have been
vacated or demolished within the five years preceding the application, the
housing development shall provide at least the same number of affordable units
of equivalent size as existed at the highest occupancy point for those units in
the five years preceding the application at affordable rent or affordable
housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower-
income category as the persons or families that occupied the units immediately
preceding the vacancy or demolition.
   (c)   Unknown household income. If the income of the existing occupants or
occupants within the past five years is unknown to the city or the applicant,
it shall be rebuttably presumed that the rental dwellings units were occupied
by low-income and very low-income renter households as determined by the most
recently available data from the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development's Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy database. (Ord. 736,
§ 5 (part), 2025).
21.49.160 Continued availability.
The units that qualified the housing development for a density bonus and other
incentives shall continue to be available as affordable and/or senior units in
compliance with the following requirements:
   (a)   Duration of availability. The applicant shall record a covenant on the
property that the units that qualified the housing development for a density
bonus and other incentives are restricted as affordable units for at least 55
years, or a longer time if required by the construction or mortgage financing
assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program.
   (b)   Affordable costs. The rents and owner-occupied costs charged for the
housing units shall not exceed the following amounts during the period of

(Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025).
21.49.170 Occupancy and resale of ownership units.
A housing development that includes for-sale units that are restricted and
affordable to moderate-income households shall limit the occupancy and resale
of the units as set forth in this section.
   (a)   Initial occupancy. A for-sale unit, which qualified the applicant for
the award of the density bonus, shall meet either of the following
requirements:
      (1)   The unit is initially sold to and occupied by a very low-, low-, or
moderate-income household, offered at an affordable housing cost as defined in
Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code, and subject to an equity sharing
agreement.
      (2)   If the unit is not purchased by an income-qualified buyer within
180 days after the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the unit may be
purchased by a qualified nonprofit housing corporation pursuant to a contract
that is recorded on the property, and all of the following are satisfied:
         (A)   The qualified nonprofit housing corporation is organized
pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3); and has received a welfare
exemption under Revenue and Taxation Code Section 214.15 for properties
intended to be sold to low-income households who participate in a special no-
interest loan program;
         (B)   A contract is included in the initial purchase that includes a
repurchase option that requires a subsequent purchaser of the property that
desires to sell or convey the property to offer the qualified nonprofit
corporation the right to repurchase the property prior to selling or conveying
that property to any other purchaser; and
         (C)   Affordability restrictions on the sale and conveyance of the
property that ensure that the property will be preserved for lower-income
housing for at least 45 years for owner-occupied housing units and will be sold
or resold only to very low-, low-, or moderate-income households.
   (b)   Resale. As part of the affordable housing agreement required pursuant
to Section
21.49.180, the applicant shall enter into an equity sharing agreement with the
city for the resale of affordable common interest units, unless it would be in
conflict with the requirements of another public funding source or law. In lieu
of an equity sharing agreement, the housing project could sell the units to a
nonprofit housing corporation pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The following requirements apply to the equity sharing agreement:
      (1)   Upon resale, the seller of the unit shall retain the value of any
improvements, the down payment, and the seller's proportionate share of

share of appreciation, which shall then be used within five years for any of
the purposes described in Health and Safety Code Section 33334.2(e) that
promote home ownership. For the purposes of this section:
         (A)   The city's initial subsidy shall be equal to the fair market
value of the home at the time of initial sale, minus the initial sale price,
plus the amount of any down payment assistance or mortgage assistance. If upon
resale the market value is lower than the initial market value, then the value
at the time of the resale shall be used as the initial market value;
         (B)   The city's proportionate share of appreciation shall be equal to
the ratio of the initial subsidy to the fair market value of the home at the
time of initial sale; and
         (C)   The initial subsidy shall include any incentives granted by the
city and shall be equal to the monetary equivalent of the incentives. (Ord.
736, § 5 (part), 2025).

not to exceed one month's rent.
            vi.   When a tenant occupying an affordable unit no longer
qualifies under the income requirements, verified through the monitoring
program required as part of the affordable housing agreement, that tenant may
then be charged market rate rent. If this occurs, any currently vacant unit of
similar type to the affordable unit in question shall then be designated as an

accordance with this chapter. The owner is required to maintain at all times
during the use restriction the minimum number of affordable units identified in
the affordable housing agreement.

Notes:
1.   If a permanent structure is located within a utility easement community
development director authorization is required prior to issuance of a building
permit.
2.   Accessory structures which are enclosed and solid-roofed shall be included
in the calculation of maximum lot coverage.
3.   The minimum setback distance shall be consistent with the minimum setback
distance for the main structure in the applicable zoning district. Structures
are not permitted in the required front yard area.
4.   If located within the street-side yard of a corner lot abutting a key lot,
the setback distance from the street shall be equal to the minimum front yard
setback for the key lot.
5.   Detached garage structures with access from an adjacent alley shall be
located a minimum of 25 feet from the opposite side of the alley.
6.   Minor structures that are part of a landscape plan may be located in the
required front yard area if otherwise in compliance with the minimum landscape
requirements of this title.
7.   The minimum distance between structures is required if one or both
structures are combustible.
8.   In accordance with uniform code requirements adopted by the city, pools
shall be set back a minimum of 10 feet from any sliding glass door opening.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.60.050 Canopy structures.
   (a)   Reasons for Regulating Canopy Structures. The use of temporary
canopies, carports, and similar, portable and pre-manufactured structures has
proliferated throughout the city. Such structures are inherently lightweight
and unstable, rendering them capable of causing injury or damage during high
winds. These structures are often placed in required setback areas or areas
required to be unobstructed. Furthermore, these structures are often allowed to
deteriorate and become unsightly, thereby detracting from the overall
appearance of residential properties within the city. For these reasons, the
city has deemed it appropriate to regulate the placement and use of canopy
structures.
   (b)   Use and Maintenance of Portable Canopy or Tarp. No portable canopy or
tarp shall be placed, maintained, installed, or located in or upon any parcel
used for residential purposes, in any residential district of the city, except
within an "approved area". For purposes of this section, "approved area" means
and includes an area that is enclosed by a solid fence or other permanent
structure on all sides, that is not less than six feet high, and not located
within any required setback or other area of a parcel required to be
unobstructed. Each portable canopy or tarp permitted by this section shall be
securely anchored to the ground or other structure, in conformance with the
building code of the city, so as to prevent movement during high winds.
   (c)   Penalty for Violation of Provisions. Violation of this section
constitutes a misdemeanor and is punishable as provided in
Chapter 1.08 of this Code. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm,
partnership or corporation to violate any provision, or to fail to comply with
any of the requirements of this section. Any person, firm, partnership, or
corporation violating any provision of this section, or failing to comply with
any of its requirements, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon
conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand
dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding six months, or by both such fine and
imprisonment. Each such person, firm, partnership or corporation shall be
deemed guilty of a separate offense for each and every day or any portion
thereof during which any violation of this section is committed, continued, or
permitted by such person, firm, partnership or corporation, and shall be deemed
punishable as provided in this section.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).

21.62.010 Purpose.
This chapter sets forth standards for the construction and maintenance of
fences and walls to ensure that such features can provide for privacy and
safety without obstructing views, and without creating a public safety hazard
or nuisance.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.62.015 Definitions.
Notwithstanding the provisions of
Chapter 21.200 of this code, for purposes of this chapter, the following
definitions shall apply:
   (1)   “Arterial wall” is any fence or wall, including retaining wall, which
is immediately adjacent to or abuts a major/minor arterial roadway.
   (2)   “Electrified fence” means a fence or similar barrier that has
electricity running through it to deter animals and people from crossing a
boundary.
   (3)   “Fence” means a solid or open barrier, other than a wall, located
above ground and intended to enclose or mark a boundary.
   (4)   “Major/minor arterial roadways” means a roadway designated a major or
minor roadway on the city's General Plan.
   (5)   “Retaining wall” means a wall designed to resist lateral earth and/or
fluid pressures, including any surcharge, in accordance with accepted
engineering practice.
   (6)   “Slope” means an inclined ground surface, the inclination of which is
expressed as a ratio of horizontal distance to vertical distance.
   (7)   “Structural compromise” is when a building or structure has been
potentially compromised. The owner shall cause a structural inspection of the
building or structure to be performed by a certified engineer when a structure
is deemed to be compromised.
   (8)   “Structural failure” refers to loss of the load-carrying capacity of a
component or member within a structure or of the structure itself. Structural
failure is initiated when the material is stressed to its strength limit, thus
causing fracture or excessive deformations. A licensed engineer shall review
and determine when a retaining wall or wall show signs of structural failure.
   (9)   “Surcharge” is a vertical load imposed on the retained soil that may
impose a lateral force in addition to the lateral earth pressure of the
retained soil.
   (10)   “Wall” means a physical barrier constructed largely of masonry,
brick, concrete, stucco, concrete block, or any combination thereof and
intended to mark a boundary.
(Ord. 710, § 6, 2019; Ord. 650, § 6, 2012).
21.62.020 Permit requirements.
   Unless otherwise exempt per Section
21.62.030, the construction, installation, or modification of any fence or wall
shall require planning approval and a building permit to ensure compliance with
applicable regulations of this chapter and title.
(Ord. 650, § 7, 2012; Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.62.030 Exemptions.
The following fences and walls are exempt from obtaining a building permit.
   (1)   Fences and walls less than thirty-six inches in height.
   (2)   Retaining walls less than four feet in height, as measured from the
bottom of the footing to the top of the wall, unless supporting a surcharge.
(Ord. 710, § 7, 2019).
21.62.040 Height and location provisions.
   (a)   Fence and Wall Height. Table 21.62.040 sets forth the maximum
permitted heights for fences and walls in required areas.
 
Table 21.62.040
Maximum Height for Fences and Walls in Required Yard Areas
Location                    Maximum Height
Front yard                  42 inches
Interior yard and rear yard 7 feet1, 2
                            42 inches in the required front yard area and 7
Street side yard            feet behind the front yard setback to the rear of
                            the lot
 
Notes:
1.   For commercial and industrial development, the designated approving
authority may approve a fence or wall up to a maximum height of 10 feet in
compliance with location and clear vision requirements of this title.
2.   A protective fence enclosing any public property or an open area for games
or a swimming pool shall not be subject to the limitations if constructed of
wire or steel mesh capable of transmitting at least 90 percent of the light
shining onto it.
   (b)   Measurement of Fence or Wall Height.
      (1)   For the purposes of this chapter, fence and wall height shall be
measured as the vertical distance from the ground elevation or finished grade
of the property on which the fence or wall is erected to the highest point of
the fence or wall. However, the height of retaining walls shall be measured
from the bottom of the footing to the top of the retaining wall. To allow for
variation in topography, the height of a fence or a wall may vary up to six
inches.
      (2)   Where there is a difference in the ground elevation or finished
grade between two adjoining parcels of less than two feet, the height of any
fence or wall constructed along the common property line shall be determined by
using the finished grade of the highest contiguous parcel. When there is a
difference in the ground level between two adjacent parcels of two feet or
more, the height of a fence or wall shall be determined by the community
development director. The community development director shall consider the
physical and visual fence height impact on abutting properties.

21.62.050 Sight clearance requirements.
To safeguard against vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian collisions caused by
visual obstructions at street intersections, a clear cross-visibility area
shall be maintained at the intersection of the public rights-of-way,
unobstructed by any fence or wall taller than forty-two inches above the street
grade. See Figure 21.62.050.
   (1)   On any corner lot: a triangular area at the street intersection
measuring fifteen feet along each street property line (or the projections
thereof parallel to the centerlines of the streets) from the point of
intersection of such property lines (or the projections thereof);
   (2)   At the intersection of an alley with a street, or at the intersection
of two alleys: a triangular area measuring fifteen feet along each street or
alley property line from the point of intersection of the property lines;
   (3)   At any driveway entrance from or exit to a street: triangular areas on
each side of the driveway measuring fifteen feet along the street property line

HEIGHT MEASUREMENT AND EXCEPTIONS
Sections:
   
21.64.010   Purpose.
   
21.64.020   Height measurement.
   
21.64.030   Exceptions to height limits.
21.64.010 Purpose.
This chapter establishes the method for measuring the height of structures in
compliance with the height limits set forth in this title, and specifies
exceptions to height limits.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.64.020 Height measurement.
   (a)   Structure height shall be measured as the vertical distance between
the lowest ground elevation or finished grade and the highest point of the
subject building or structure. The highest point shall be the coping of a flat
roof, deck line of a mansard roof, or peak of the highest gable of a pitch or
hip roof, exclusive of vents, air conditioners, chimneys, and the like.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4325.jpg]
 
   (b)   For sloped lots or buildings with varied floor elevations, the height
shall be measured as the vertical distance from the average level of the ground
under the building to the top-most point of the roof. The average level of the
ground is determined by adding the elevations of the lowest and highest points
of the part of the lot covered by a building, and dividing by two.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.64.030 Exceptions to height limits.
The following exceptions to height limits are allowed, provided compliance is

Notes:
1.   No less than 50 percent of the required front yard area of any single-
family lot shall be maintained with a pervious surface.
2.   If a solid 6-foot-high fence encloses the street side yard of a single-
family lot, this requirement shall not apply.
   (b)   Street Trees.
      (1)   Street trees shall be required on all city streets. The number of
street trees shall be determined by dividing the length of property frontage,
including driveway width, by forty, with the resultant number being the
required number of trees. Fractional numbers shall be rounded up to the next
whole number.
      (2)   Additional tree planting may be required as part of a subdivision
or project condition of approval.
   (c)   Landscape of Unused and Undeveloped Portions of a Site. All areas of a
site not intended for a specific use or purpose in conjunction with a current
application, including vacant or undeveloped pad sites in shopping centers held
for future development, shall be fully landscaped and irrigated with an
automatic irrigation system. Landscaping shall include a combination of trees,
shrubs, ground cover, turf, and/or approved decorative landscape materials, as
approved by the community development director and public works director.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.66.050 Planting type, size, and location.
   (a)   Plant Type. Landscape planting shall emphasize drought-tolerant and
native species (especially along natural or scenic corridors), shall complement
the architectural design of structures on the site, and shall be suitable for
the soil and climatic conditions of the site.
   (b)   Planting Size and Spacing. To achieve an immediate effect of a
landscape installation and to allow sustained growth of planting materials,
minimum plant material sizes and plant spacing shall be as follows:
      (1)   Trees. The minimum plant size for trees shall be fifteen gallons.
Trees planted within ten feet of a street, sidewalk, paved trail, or walkway
shall be a deep-rooted species or shall be separated from paved surfaces by a
root barrier to prevent physical damage to public improvements. A minimum
distance of fifteen feet is required between the center of trees to street
light standards and fire hydrants.
      (2)   Shrubs. The minimum plant size for shrubs shall be five gallons.
      (3)   Ground cover. Ground cover (including turf) shall be planted in a
manner to provide one hundred percent coverage within two years of initial
planting.
   (c)   Clear Sight Distance Maintained. To safeguard against vehicle,
bicycle, and pedestrian collisions caused by visual obstructions at street
intersections, a clear cross-visibility area shall be maintained at the
intersection of the public rights-of-way, unobstructed by any landscape
material taller than forty-two inches above the street grade. At any corner
formed by the intersection of two streets, the required clear cross-visibility
area shall be a triangle having two sides fifteen-feet long extending along the
curb line of each street (see previous Figure
21.62.050).
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.66.060 Water-efficient landscaping.
   (a)   Consistent with the purposes of California Government Code Section
65591 (Water Conservation in Landscaping Act), all new development shall comply
with the following water-conserving landscape requirements. Exceptions to these
requirements include single-family and duplex residential development and
cemeteries.
   (b)   To the greatest extent possible, landscape material shall consist of
drought-tolerant plants. Low-water-use plants shall be used in at least fifty
percent of the total planted area. Plant material selected shall be suitable
for the given soil and climate conditions. Plant selection shall take into
consideration water conservation through appropriate use and groupings of
plants that are well adapted to particular sites and to particular watering
needs, climatic, geological, and topographical conditions.
   (c)   The maximum area permitted for turf shall be fifty percent of the
total area landscaped on the site. Higher percentages may be permitted when sod
is an essential part of the development such as playing fields for schools or
parks and residential model units. Turf usage shall only be permitted for
highly visual and functional use areas. Turf shall not be permitted in areas
difficult to irrigate, such as sidewalk strips, slopes over fifteen percent, or
narrow pathways.
   (d)   Decorative water features such as pools, ponds, and waterfalls used in
landscaped areas shall incorporate recycling of water, and where, available,
use of reclaimed water. Decorative water features shall be designed to minimize
water loss.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.66.070 Landscape irrigation and maintenance.
   (a)   Irrigation.
      (1)   All required landscaped areas shall be provided with an approved
irrigation system. Irrigation systems shall be designed to avoid runoff,
excessive low-head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where water
flows or drifts onto adjacent property, non-irrigated areas, walks, roadways or
structures.
      (2)   All landscaped areas, with the exception of systems for single-
family residences, shall be provided with an automatically timed-controlled
sprinkler system.
   (b)   Maintenance of Landscaped Areas.
      (1)   All landscaped areas shall be permanently maintained by watering,
clearing of debris and litter, weeding, pruning, insect control, and
replacement of plant materials and irrigation equipment as needed to preserve
the health and appearance of plant materials.
      (2)   All trees, shrubs, and plants that due to accident, damage,
disease, or other cause fail to show a healthy growth, shall be replaced, in
kind, pursuant to the approved landscape plan within thirty days from the
identified damage date.
      (3)   All landscaping shall be maintained in such a manner that does not
restrict pedestrian access by overhanging into the public right-of-way or other
designated pedestrian path.
       (4)   Any tree, shrub, or part thereof on private property that
overhangs any street so that it endangers life, safety, or public property
shall be removed, trimmed, or cut off within ten days after written notice from
the city.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.66.080 Planting and overhead utility lines.
In keeping with the purposes of this chapter, the city encourages planting
within overhead utility corridors. However, landscape planting near overhead
utility lines and abutting utility support structures has the potential of
creating a public safety hazard by causing physical damage, disrupting service,
and obstructing access. Therefore, within twenty feet of any overhead utility
lines, planting restrictions are as follows:
   (1)   Tree species at full growth shall not encroach within a ten-foot
radial line clearance of all overhead electric utility distribution or
transmission lines. Unless ground clearance is greater than thirty feet, mature
tree height shall not exceed twenty feet.
   (2)   A minimum ten-foot clearance shall be maintained around all poles and
ground structures to ensure necessary firebreaks and unobstructed access.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).

and hazards to motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians;
   (2)   Provide off-street parking in proportion to the needs generated by
different land uses;
   (3)   Ensure access to projects by emergency response vehicles; and
   (4)   Ensure that parking areas are designed and operate compatible with
surrounding land uses. (Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025; Ord. 710, § 9 (part), 2019)
21.68.020 Applicability.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided, these off-street parking provisions
shall apply to new development and the establishment of a new use.
Specifically, for all buildings or structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of this chapter, parking facilities shall
be provided as required by this section.
   (b)   These off-street parking provisions shall apply to the expanded area
(only) of non-residential uses/structures.
   (c)   Residential properties that do not comply with these off-street
parking provisions shall be required to comply with these provisions when
proposing an expansion/addition of habitable area that increases the original
square footage of the subject residence by more than 300 square feet.
   (d)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to limit the power of the
planning commission, or of the city council on appeal, to require parking of
different numbers, types, and layout as part of the conditions required to be
met for approval of a development or use. (Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025; Ord.
710, § 9 (part), 2019)
21.68.030 Permit requirements.
   (a)   New Parking Lots. New parking lot design not otherwise exempt shall be
reviewed in conjunction with the building permit and any other land use or
development permit required for the project. Wherever four or more spaces are
required for new development, a site plan of the premises shall be required.
The site plan shall be submitted to the community development department and
shall include sufficient detail to determine compliance with the provisions of
this chapter.
   (b)   Modification of Existing Lots. Modification or improvement to an
existing parking lot which impacts the parking space layout, configuration, or
number of stalls shall require approval of a Zoning Clearance Application
pursuant to
Chapter 21.96 to authorize the modification.
   (c)   Resurfacing and Restriping. Resurfacing, slurry coating, and/or
restriping of a parking area shall require approval of a Zoning Clearance
Application pursuant to
Chapter 21.96 to authorize the work. (Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025; Ord. 710, § 9
(part), 2019)
21.68.040 Exemptions.
The following parking lot improvements shall be considered minor in nature in
that the number or configuration of parking stalls is not altered. Such
improvements shall be exempt from permit requirements.
   (1)   Repair of any defects in the surface of the parking area, including
holes and cracks.
   (2)   Repair or replacement of damaged planters and curbs in the same
location. (Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025; Ord. 710, § 9 (part), 2019)
21.68.050 Off-street parking space requirements.
   (a)   Off-street Parking Requirements. Table 21.68.050 sets forth off-street
parking requirements for number of spaces. Except as otherwise specifically
stated, the following rules apply to Table 21.68.050:
      (1)   "Square feet" means "gross square feet" and refers to total
building floor area unless otherwise specified.
      (2)   Where parking spaces are required based on a per-employee ratio,
this shall be construed to be the total number of employees on the largest
working shift. A certified list of all employees on each shift shall be
provided to the community development department within ten days of written
request.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating parking requirements, dens, studies,
or other similar rooms that may be used as bedrooms shall be considered
bedrooms.
      (4)   Where the number of seats is listed to determine required parking,
seats shall be construed to be fixed seats. Where fixed seats provided are
either benches, bleachers or other, each twenty-four linear inches of the
bench, bleacher or other shall be considered a seat.
   (b)   Minimum/Maximum Parking Requirements. Unless off-street parking
reductions are permitted pursuant to provisions herein, the number of off-
street parking spaces required by Table 21.68.050 shall be considered the
minimum necessary for each use. In conjunction with discretionary development
permits, the designated approving authority may increase or decrease these
parking requirements if it is determined that these requirements are inadequate
or unnecessary for a specific project.
   (c)   Uses Not Listed. The number of parking spaces required for uses not
specifically listed in Table 21.68.050 shall be determined by the community
development director based on common functional, product, or compatibility
characteristics and activities. Such determination is considered a formal
interpretation of this title and shall be decided and recorded as such.
   (d)   Calculation/Rounding of Quantities. When the calculation of the
required number of off-street parking spaces results in a fraction of a space,
the total number of spaces shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.
   (e)   Mixed-use/Multiple Tenants. Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, for each separate use, a site with multi-tenants, or a combination of
principal uses in any one facility, the development shall provide the aggregate
number of parking spaces required for each separate use. For multiple tenant
development/integrated centers, with no residential component, required parking
shall not be reserved for a specific business or person, unless the reserved
spaces are in excess of the number required by these off-street parking
provisions.
   (f)   The use of valet parking services shall not be grounds for reducing
the number of parking spaces required by these off-street parking provisions.
When valet parking is offered, the service shall be at no charge, shall not
obstruct drive aisles/vehicle circulation with parked vehicles, and valeted
vehicles shall be parked on the subject site only, unless a shared parking
agreement is granted by the city.
   (g)   Designated parking spaces for low-emitting, fuel-efficient and
carpool/van pool vehicles shall be provided and marked as required by the
California Green Building Standards Code.
   (h)   Parking spaces for Electric Vehicles (EV) and/or EV charging equipment
shall be provided as required by the California Green Building Standards Code.

21.68.100 Shared parking.
   (a)   Purpose. This section establishes criteria for shared parking
agreements by commercial, office, industrial, and other nonresidential uses.
   (b)   Authority. The community development director shall be the designated
approving authority for the review and approval of shared parking agreements.
   (c)   Circumstances for allowing shared parking agreements. Where it can be
demonstrated that two or more land uses can effectively share common parking
facilities due to the nature of the uses (for example, an office building with
largely weekday use and religious facility with predominantly weekend use),
then an application may be filed for consideration by the community development
director for a shared parking agreement. Such application shall include a
parking study that identifies the parking demand of all subject land uses and
that clearly demonstrates how and why parking facilities can be shared.
   (d)   Findings for granting shared agreements. To grant a request for shared
parking, the director shall make the following findings:
      (1)   There is clear and convincing evidence that peak-hour parking
demand from all uses does not coincide and/or the uses are such that the hours
of operation are different for various portions of the business.
      (2)   The adjacent or nearby properties will not be adversely affected by
the proposed reduction in parking.
   (e)   Conditions. The following conditions shall be required for all shared
parking agreement:
      (1)   A legal agreement shall be signed by all parties sharing parking
facilities, and shall constitute a mutual covenant running with the land. Such
agreement shall be approved by the city attorney and community development
director, shall be recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder, and shall
continue to be valid upon change of ownership. Such agreement may only be
terminated with the prior, written consent of the community development
director.
      (2)   The uses sharing the parking facilities must be located on
contiguous lots.
(Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025; Ord. 710, § 9 (part), 2019)
21.68.110 Compact parking spaces.
   (a)   General Provisions. Subject to the approval of a Zoning Clearance
Application pursuant to
Chapter 21.96 , parking lots containing twenty or more parking spaces may
substitute standard spaces with compact spaces for up to thirty percent of the
total parking spaces required.
   (b)   Designation. Each compact space shall be clearly labeled "COMPACT".
   (c)   Location. Compact spaces shall be dispersed evenly throughout the
parking lot. For developments characterized by distinct, segmented parking
areas, the maximum permitted percentage of compact spaces shall apply to each
area or segment of the parking lot. Compact spaces shall not be located
adjacent to retaining walls or other formidable barriers which prevent adequate
vehicle overhang.
   (d)   Compact spaces cannot be used to fulfill the off-street parking
requirements of residential developments/uses as established by these parking
provisions. Except, compact spaces may be used for up to thirty percent of the
total required guest parking when more than ten guest parking spaces are
required.
(Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025; Ord. 710, § 9 (part), 2019)
21.68.120 Development standards and maintenance for off-street parking.
   (a)    Surfacing of Parking Spaces and Lots. Required parking and
circulation areas shall be paved with a surface approved by the city. The
surfacing required for temporary lots shall be as determined by the designated
approving authority.
   (b)   Maintenance of Required Parking and Loading Areas. All parking
facilities, including curbs, directional markings, handicapped symbols,
landscaping, pavement, signs, striping, and wheel stops, shall be permanently
maintained by the property owner/tenant in good repair, free of litter and
debris, potholes, obstructions, and stored material.
   (c)   Marking and Signs. With the exception of striping for ADA parking
spaces and other required designated parking spaces, parking spaces shall be
delineated with white, four inch wide striping. Drive aisles, approach lanes,
and maneuvering areas shall be marked and maintained with directional arrows
and striping to expedite traffic movement. Any area not intended for parking
shall be signed as such, or in areas where curb exists, the curb may be painted
red in lieu of signs. All signing and striping installations shall be in
conformance with the city's current standards or as otherwise deemed necessary
by the community development director to ensure safe and efficient traffic flow
in or about any parking facility.
   (d)   Vehicle Access/Driveways/Circulation.
      (1)   Accessibility and usability. Driveways shall not be used for any
purpose that would prevent vehicles from accessing parking spaces, or inhibit
circulation or emergency service response.
      (2)   Access to adjacent roadways. Parking spaces within a designated
parking lot shall be designed to provide suitable maneuvering room so vehicles
can enter an abutting street in a forward direction (alleys may be used for
maneuvering space). Parking lots shall be designed to prevent access at any
point other than at a designated driveway(s).
      (3)   Circulation. Within a parking lot, circulation shall be such that a
vehicle entering the parking lot need not enter the street to reach another
aisle and that a vehicle shall not enter a public street backwards. Speed bumps
or similar devices designed to control vehicle speed within parking lots may be
required as determined by the designated approving authority.
      (4)   Visibility at driveways. Driveways shall be designed and located in
such a manner so as to ensure proper visibility to on-street traffic. Driveway
design shall take into consideration slopes, curvature, speed, and conflicting
turning movements in the area. Clear visibility shall be maintained from the
driveway by keeping the designated clear vision triangle free of obstacles such
as signs, landscaping, and structures. See
Article X for a description of the clear vision triangle.
   (e)   Pedestrian Access and Circulation. All multi-family and non-
residential developments shall be designed with a minimum of one designated
pedestrian path from each abutting street to the primary entrance(s) to such
use. Access shall be distinct from the vehicle access, visibly delineated, and
designed to be safe and convenient. Specifically, internal pedestrian walkways
shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of raised
sidewalks, special pavers, bricks, or scored/stamped concrete.
   (f)   Drainage. Drainage facilities shall be provided in all public parking
areas capable of handling and maintaining the drainage requirements of the
subject property and surrounding properties. Drainage facilities shall be
designed to dispose of all surface water consistent with regional water quality
control board standards, and to alleviate the creation of flooding and drainage
problems.
   (g)   Curbing. Areas containing plant materials shall be bordered by a
concrete curb at least six inches high and six inches wide. Alternative barrier
design to protect landscaped areas from damage by vehicles may be approved by
the community development director.

vehicles and large expanses of pavement as set forth in the following
paragraphs.
   (b)   Parking Lot Shade. Trees shall be planted and maintained in all
parking lots at a ratio of one tree for every ten parking spaces. The trees
shall be placed throughout the parking lot in a manner that will ensure that
all portions of the lot receive tree shade. Trees shall be of varieties that
provide a broad canopy.
   (c)   Parking Lot Screening. Landscaping within the perimeter planter
between parking lot and street right-of-way shall be designed and maintained
for partial screening of vehicles to a minimum height of thirty inches,
measured from the finished grade of the parking lot. Screening materials may
include any combination of plant materials, earthen berms, solid masonry walls,
raised planters, or other screening device deemed by the community development
director to comply with the intent of this requirement.
   (d)   Percent Coverage. A minimum of ten percent of the parking lot area
shall be landscaped. Parking lot landscaping shall not count toward required
landscape coverage otherwise required for the zoning district in which a
project is located.
   (e)   Screening of Drive-through Aisles. To screen vehicles in a drive-
through and associated headlights from view of abutting street rights-of-way, a

21.72.010 Statement of need.
   (a)   Property values and the general welfare of the community are founded,
in part, upon the appearance and maintenance of private property. Within La
Mirada, owners and occupants of some properties have permitted visual blight,
including but not limited to deteriorated buildings, overgrowth of vegetation,
damaged and deteriorated fencing and other structures, and the accumulation of
broken or discarded property. The city finds that the existence of such
conditions is injurious to the public health, safety, and general welfare of
residents of and visitors to La Mirada, and contributes to the deterioration of
residential and nonresidential areas.
   (b)   Abatement of these conditions is in the best interest of the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of La Mirada. A city-wide minimum set of
standards for property maintenance can provide benefits to the community that
can protect the livability, appearance, and social and economic stability of La
Mirada; contribute to the appreciation of property values; improve the physical
character of residential, commercial and industrial zones; attract capital
investors; increase commercial trade and industrial productivity; and increase
in the tax base of the city. Minimum property maintenance standards can also
benefit the community by reducing the risks to health, safety, and general
welfare that exist due to deterioration, dilapidation, and blight.
   (c)   The uses and abuses of property described in this chapter and the
property maintenance standards provided herein relate to the proper exercise of
police power to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.72.020 Purpose and intent.
   (a)   This chapter promotes the health, safety, and general welfare of the
public by prescribing standards applicable to the maintenance and use of
property within the city which will protect the livability, appearance, and
social and economic stability of La Mirada, and which will also protect the
public from the health and safety hazards.
   (b)   The provisions of this chapter are not intended to regulate artistic,
cultural, or religious expression.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.72.030 Relationship to other laws.
In the event of any inconsistency between this chapter and any other provisions
of this title or other sections of the Municipal Code, or in the event that
this chapter conflicts with laws of the state or other city ordinances, the
higher standard - the standard that provides for a higher level of property
maintenance - shall prevail, unless otherwise specified. This chapter shall

Notes:
1.   Where more than one building attached sign is permitted, the maximum
allowable sign area shall include the combined sign area of all non-exempt
signs.
2.   A monument sign is permitted only for multi-family developments consisting
of more than 4 units.
3.   Signs shall be either non-illuminated or externally illuminated.
4.   Maximum height as measured from ground surface to the top of the sign
structure.
5.   For building-attached signs, the sign area shall be limited to the lesser
of the following: maximum sign area or 35% of the wall area to which the sign
is attached.
6.   The minimum street frontage for the installation of a monument sign shall
be 135 linear feet and the minimum street frontage for the installation of a
pylon sign shall be 150 linear feet.
7.   For an integrated development, monument and pylon signs may only be
considered when included as part of an approved comprehensive sign program that
is agreed upon by all affected property owners.
8.   The minimum parcel frontage for the installation of any sign shall be 200
linear feet. Parcels with less than 200 linear feet of frontage shall comply
with the C-4 zoning district’s sign regulations.
9.   Parcels shall have a minimum land area of six acres to install a pylon
sign. Separate but continuous parcels may combine to reach the minimum land
area provided a recorded agreement, in a form approved by the city, is executed
by the affected property owners.
10.   Parcels that meet the requirements for a pylon sign may have either a
pylon sign or a monument sign along the affected frontage; however, both types
of signs on the same frontage shall not be permitted.
11.   Buildings with 500 linear feet or more of building frontage and more than
400,000 square feet of gross floor area shall be allowed more than one sign
provided the total combined sign area does not exceed the maximum permitted
sign area.

shall constitute one sign. When the installation of more than one sign
conflicts with an approved Sign Program, the deviation shall be allowed without
having to amend the Sign Program, with the written authorization of the
property owner or property management company.
   (b)   Allowable Sign Area Calculation. The allowable sign area shall be
calculated in one of two ways: 1) the sign area assigned to a particular use,
or 2) the sign area as a ratio of the length of the primary building frontage
for a particular use. Building-attached and freestanding sign area allowances
are listed separately. For the purpose of the calculation, building-attached
signs shall include all non-exempt wall, canopy, and projecting signs,
including non-exempt flags. Similarly, monument signs shall include non-exempt
monument signs and freestanding flagpoles with non-exempt flags. Unless
otherwise specified, the maximum allowable sign area shall include the combined
sign area of all non-exempt signs.

21.76.140.
(Ord. 722, § 9, 2022; Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.76.140 Electronic billboards.
Electronic billboards are recognized as a legitimate form of commercial use in
the city. However, the size, number, location and illumination of billboards
can have significant influence on the city's visual environment, and can,
without adequate control, create or contribute to blighted conditions. The
purpose of this section is to provide reasonable electronic billboard control,
recognizing that community appearance is an important factor in protecting the
general welfare of the community. This section contains the entirety of the
city's zoning regulations with respect to electronic billboards within the
Freeway Commercial (C-F) Zoning District (C-F Zoning District). In the event of
any conflict between any provision contained in this section and any other
provision contained elsewhere in this code, the provisions contained in this
section shall govern.
   (1)   Use regulations. Electronic billboards are only allowed in the C-
F Zoning District and only after a development agreement, pursuant to
Government Code Section 65864 et seq., has been approved. A development
agreement shall be entered into prior to the issuance of a building permit for
any project involving construction of a new electronic billboard, expansion or
modification of an electronic billboard, or conversion of a non-electronic
billboard to an electronic billboard. Any such development agreement shall
include compensation to be paid to the city as a result of the installation and
operation of the electronic billboard, and to administer such development
agreement for the term thereof.
   (2)   Application. A site plan review application is required for each
individual proposal to construct a new electronic billboard, modification of an
electronic billboard, or conversion of a non-electronic billboard to an
electronic billboard, which shall be considered a separate application, and
each application shall be separately and individually subject to the provisions
and requirements of this Section. Multiple sites, even if located on one
parcel, shall not be combined into one application.
   (3)   Findings. The Community Development Director shall not approve any
electronic billboard project unless a development agreement has previously been
executed between the applicant and the City of La Mirada, and it is determined
by the Director that the electronic billboard will not constitute a hazard to
the safe and efficient operation of vehicles upon a street or freeway.
   (4)   Locations allowed. Electronic billboards are only allowed in the C-
F Zoning District adjacent to the freeway.
   (5)   Prohibited installation locations. Electronic billboards shall not be
installed in any of the following locations:
      (A)   On any roof of a building or projecting over the roof of a
building.
      (B)   On any wall of a building or otherwise attached or integrated to or
suspended from a building.
      (C)   Within or encroaching over the public right-of-way.
      (D)   Any location which would result in a violation of any applicable
federal or state law.
   (6)   Landscape segment relocation credits. No new electronic billboard
shall be constructed or installed within the city through utilization, in whole
or in part, of credits given by the California Department of Transportation or
State for relocation of billboards located in landscaped freeway segments. This
shall include credits for billboards located either within the city or in other
jurisdictions.
   (7)   Development standards.
      (A)   Maximum area. The maximum area of electronic billboards shall be
seven hundred square feet (700 sq. ft.) per sign face (e.g., 14 feet x 48
feet).
      (B)   Maximum height. The maximum height of electronic billboards shall
be fifty feet (50'), measured from the finished grade at the base of the sign
to the highest projection.
      (C)   Maximum number of signs. No property (defined as a single parcel or
two or more contiguous parcels under common ownership) shall have more than two
double-sided electronic billboards.
      (D)   Minimum distance from another billboard on the same parcel. The
minimum distance from another billboard on the same property shall be one
thousand feet (1,000') as measured from the vertical centerline of each
billboard.
      (E)   Minimum distance from another billboard on the same side of the
freeway. The minimum distance from one electronic billboard to another
electronic billboard not on the same property but on the same side of the
freeway shall be one thousand feet (1,000'), as measured from the vertical
centerline of each electronic billboard. The minimum distance of an electronic
billboard from existing non-electronic billboards shall be five hundred feet
(500'), as measured from the vertical centerline of each billboard.
      (F)   Minimum setback. The minimum setback distance of the electronic
billboard column support post shall be at least twenty-five feet (25') from any
property line and at least twenty-five feet (25') from any building.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no portion of an electronic billboard shall
project beyond the subject site's property line onto or over a neighboring
property, street, highway or other public right-of-way.
      (G)   Minimum size of property. The minimum size of any property on which
an electronic billboard can be located shall be three acres.

CHAPTER 21.78
YARD REQUIREMENTS AND EXCEPTIONS
Sections:
   
21.78.010   Purpose.
   
21.78.020   Required yard areas by zoning district.
   
21.78.030   Setback measurements.
   
21.78.040   Allowed encroachments and projections into required yards.
21.78.010 Purpose
This chapter establishes standards for setback measurement, required yard
areas, and permitted encroachments. These provisions, in conjunction with other
applicable provisions of this title, are intended to ensure open areas around
primary structures; maintain clear visibility for traffic safety and pedestrian
access; buffer incompatible land uses; and establish natural and visual light
and air space for privacy, landscaping, and recreation.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.78.020 Required yard areas by zoning district.
The required yard area (front, interior side, street side, and/or rear) of a
lot is the horizontal area between the property line and the minimum setback
distance required for the specific zoning district in question. Except as
otherwise specified in this title, required yard areas shall be kept free of
buildings and structures.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.78.030 Setback measurements.
   (a)   General. Except as otherwise specified in this section, all setback
distances shall be measured at right angles from the designated property line,
and the setback line shall be drawn parallel to the designated property line at
the required setback distance.
   (b)   Front Yard Setbacks. The front yard setback is a line parallel to the
front property line abutting the street, at a minimum distance measured at
right angles from the front property line, except as follows:
      (1)   Corner Lots. The front yard setback shall be measured from the
street right-of-way toward which the primary entrance of the main building is
directed. Upon approval of a Zoning Clearance Application pursuant to
Chapter 21.96, an alternate street right-of-way may be utilized to measure the
front yard setback. Approval of the application shall be subject to the
following conditions:
         (A)   The application shall be executed by the property owner(s) of
record.
         (B)   The application submittal shall include three copies of a fully
dimensioned and detailed site plan.
         (C)    The approval to use an alternate street right-of-way to measure
the front yard setback shall not create a non-con forming condition. When legal
non-conforming conditions exist, the approval to use an alternate street right-
of-way may be approved if it is determined that it will reduce the more
intensive legal nonconformity.
Figure 21.78.030
Front Yard Setbacks

      (2)   Flag lots. Regardless of the orientation of the main building, the
measurement shall be taken from a parallel line established where the access
strip meets the buildable area of the parcel closest to the public street or
right-of-way.
      (3)   A building on a lot between two lots on which existing buildings
extend into the required front yard may have a front yard setback that is not
less in depth than the average of that provided on the adjacent lots.
   (c)   Rear Yard Setbacks. The rear yard setback is a line parallel to the
rear property line, at a minimum distance measured at right angles from the
rear property line, which extends between the side yards, except as follows
(see Figure 21.78.030.C):
      (1)   The rear yard setback on the street side of a double frontage lot
is a line parallel to the rear property line abutting the street. However, if
an access easement or street right-of-way line extends into or through a rear
yard, the minimum rear yard setback distance shall be measured at right angles
from the access easement or right-of-way line.
      (2)   Where the side lot lines converge to a point with two or three
lines, the rear yard setback shall be measured from an imaginary line drawn
parallel to the front property line from a distance of five feet from the point
at which the lines converge.
      (3)   In the event five or more lines bound a lot, only the two interior
lines that intersect a street shall be deemed side lot lines. All other
interior lines shall be deemed rear lot lines, with setback measurement
representing the converging boundaries of parallel lines drawn from each of the
rear lot lines.

takes final action on a conditional use permit. However, when processed in
conjunction with a development agreement, the conditional use permit shall be
reviewed and acted upon by the city council in conjunction with the other
application request(s). The planning commission provides recommendations to the
city council on both entitlement requests. (Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025; Ord.

into project modifications or conditions of approval to ensure conformance with
all provisions of the municipal code and other adopted policies and plans.
   (b)   Staff Determinations, Recommendations, and Reports.
      (1)   For administrative permits, the community development director
shall create a written record of action to approve, conditionally approve, or
deny the permit.
      (2)   For quasi-judicial and legislative actions, the community
development director shall prepare a staff report that analyzes the proposed
land use and development application for compliance and consistency with the
provisions of this title, other applicable sections of the city's Municipal
Code, the general plan, any applicable planned unit development, and applicable
state law. The staff report shall include recommendations on the approval,

Whenever an application or portion of an application has been denied or revoked
and the denial or revocation becomes final, no new application for the same or
similar request may be accepted within one year of the date of the action to
deny or revoke, unless the community development director determines that a new
application is warranted due to a substantial change in land use on properties
in the vicinity, improved infrastructure in the vicinity, altered traffic
patterns, or any such similar change resulting in a changed physical
environment.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).

after the date of action, immediately following expiration of the ten-day
appeal period. However, where the last of the specified number of days falls on
a weekend or city holiday, the time limit of the appeal shall extend to the end
of the next working day.
      (2)   Legislative actions of the city council normally become effective
thirty days from the date of final action and may not be appealed. Therefore,
administrative and quasi-judicial permits that are processed in conjunction
with (or that are contingent upon) a legislative action shall not be acted upon
until the effective date of the required legislative action. Permit(s) shall
not be issued until the effective date of required permit.
   (b)   Effect of Permit. The approval of a land use or development permit
authorizes the applicant to proceed with the proposed project upon the
effective date of the permit, subject to all conditions or restrictions imposed
by the approving authority. However, all other permits, licenses, certificates
and other grants of approval to which the proposed development project is
subject must be secured before the development or use may commence.

expiration date of the permit, along with appropriate fees and necessary
submittal materials pursuant to
Chapter 21.84.
   (b)   The term of a temporary use permit may not be extended.
   (c)   The approval of an extension extends the expiration date for one year
from the original permit date. No additional extensions shall be granted for a
permit which has been active for a period of two years, unless otherwise
provided for in the conditions of approval or by this title.
   (d)   The permit, as extended, may be conditioned to comply with any
development standards that may have been enacted since the permit was initially
approved.
   (e)   The extension may be granted only when the designated approving
authority finds that the original permit findings can be made and that there
are changing circumstances or that there has been diligent pursuit to exercise
the permit that warrants such extension.
   (f)   Extensions related to the terms of nonconforming uses and structures
are governed by Article X,
Chapter 21.130 and by Article VIII,
Chapter 21.114.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.90.050 Exercising permits.
   (a)   The exercise of a permit occurs when the property owner has performed
substantial work and incurred substantial liabilities in good faith reliance
upon such permit(s). Unless otherwise provided by law, such exercise of a
permit constitutes the vested right to complete the work authorized by the
permit. A permit may be otherwise exercised by a condition of the permit or
corresponding legal agreement that specifies that other substantial efforts or
expenditures constitutes exercise of the permit.
   (b)   Unless otherwise provided, permits that have not been exercised prior
to a zoning code amendment which makes the approved use or structure of the
permit nonconforming shall automatically be deemed invalid on the effective
date of the zoning code amendment.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.90.060 Phased construction.
For projects that involve construction in phases, the time periods for the
phases may be stated in the conditions of the permit to avoid a lapse of
progressive development following the completion of the first or preceding
phase.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.90.070 Permit to run with land.
   (a)   Rule. Land use and development permits and approvals granted pursuant
to the provisions of this chapter shall be transferable upon a change of
ownership of the site, business, service, use or structures, provided that the
use and conditions of the original permit or approval are fully complied with,
and the project is not modified or enlarged/expanded.
   (b)   Exception. The home occupation permit is personal to the resident
named on the permit and valid only for the occupation to be conducted by the
resident at the location stated on the permit. The home occupation permit is
not transferable to another person or site and shall not run with the land.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.90.080 Permit on site during construction.
A copy of all land use and development permits (including all corresponding
stamped-approved plans) authorizing construction shall be kept on site at all
times during construction.

21.106.040   Record of use interpretations.
21.106.010 Purpose and intent.
The zoning ordinance use interpretation process is established to provide a
means to clarify any ambiguity in the use regulations of this title, and to
ensure consistent interpretation and application of this title. The planning
commission has the authority for the interpretation of use provisions.
Interpretation authority and procedures for all other regulations of this title
are listed in
Chapter 21.94.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.106.020 Applicability.
It is recognized that every conceivable use cannot be identified in this title
and that new uses will evolve over time. Therefore, when a use is not
specifically listed in this title, the use may be permitted if the planning
commission determines that the use is similar to other uses listed.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.106.030 Determination/required findings.
In determining the similarity of a proposed use that is not listed in this
title, the planning commission will compare a proposed use and measure it
against those uses that are identified in the applicable zoning district(s). In
order to grant a zoning ordinance use interpretation for a use that is not
listed, the planning commission shall make all of the following findings:
   (1)   The proposed use meets the intent of, and is consistent with the
goals, policies, and objectives of the general plan;
   (2)   The proposed use meets the stated purpose and general intent of the
zoning district in which the use is proposed to be located;
   (3)   The proposed use will not adversely impact the public health, safety,
and general welfare of the city's residents; and
   (4)   The proposed use shares characteristics common with, and is not of
greater intensity, density, or environmental impact, than those uses listed in
the land use zoning district in which it is to be located.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.106.040 Record of use interpretations.
In addition to the standard noticing requirement in Section
21.84.090, all similar use determinations of the planning commission shall be
recorded and filed with the planning department. The record of the official
interpretation shall cite the specific use and required findings. All recorded
interpretations shall be provided to the city's planning agencies and
applicable city departments within thirty days of the determination.

21.108.050   Conditions.
21.108.010 Purpose and intent.
California Government Code Section 65906 establishes the authority of the city
to grant exception to the development standards and provisions of this title in
cases where, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, the
strict application of this title deprives such property of privileges enjoyed
by other property in the vicinity and under identical land use zoning
districts.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.108.020 Applicability.
   (a) A variance application shall be filed whenever any deviation from the
provisions of this title is proposed, except those minor deviations that
qualify for an Administration Adjustment pursuant to Section
21.102 of this Code.
   (b)   Variances may not be approved for uses or activities not otherwise
expressly authorized by this title. A variance is not a substitute for a zone
change, zone text amendment, or conditional use permit.
   (c)   Financial hardship in and of itself does not represent grounds on
which to file a variance application.
(Ord. 618 § 7, 2008; Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.108.030 Proceedings.

21.108.040 Required findings.
The planning commission may approve and/or modify any variance application in
whole or in part, with or without conditions, only if the applicant can
demonstrate to the planning commission that the circumstances of the particular
case can justify making all of the following findings:
   (1)   That there are special circumstances applicable to the property
including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, which do not
generally apply to other property in the same district;
   (2)   That the granting of the minor variance does not constitute a grant of
special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in
the vicinity and zone in which the property is situated.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.108.050 Conditions.
The planning commission may impose conditions for the variance to ensure
compliance with this section and other applicable provisions of this title.

intensity, or size, require special review to determine if the use proposed, or
the location of that use, is compatible with surrounding uses, or through the
imposition of development and use conditions, can be made compatible with
surrounding uses. The conditional use permit is provided for this purpose.
   (b)   To ensure compatibility with zoning regulations and surrounding
properties, conditional uses require special consideration. The planning
commission is empowered to grant and deny applications for conditional use
permits and to impose reasonable conditions upon the granting of such permit.
   (c)   Applications for conditional use permits may be submitted only for
those uses specified as allowable conditional uses in the applicable zone
district. A conditional use permit is not a substitute for a change of zone or
zoning ordinance text amendment.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.110.020 Proceedings.
Conditional use permit applications shall be processed in accordance with the
standard quasi-judicial permit processing provisions of this article.

constitute approval of the permit. Such permit shall only become valid after
the designated ten-day appeal period has expired.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.110.070 Permit must be continuously used.
Uses operating pursuant to an approved conditional use permit that are
abandoned or otherwise determined to be idle for a period of one hundred eighty
continuous days shall be automatically subject to permit revocation procedures
pursuant to the provisions of this title.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).

   (2)   Upon resolution of the planning commission.
   (3)   Upon application by a property owner or owners of any parcel subject
to the general plan.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.122.030 Frequency of general plan amendment.
Pursuant to Government Code Section 65358, no mandatory element of the general
plan may be amended more frequently than four times during any calendar year.

CHAPTER 21.126
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION
Sections:
   
21.126.010   Purpose and authority.
   
21.126.020   Requesting reasonable accommodation.
   
21.126.030   Application requirements.
   
21.126.040   Approval authority; Notice; Decision.
   
21.126.050   Grounds for reasonable accommodation.
   
21.126.060   Findings.
21.126.010 Purpose and authority.
It is the City of La Mirada's policy to provide individuals with disabilities
reasonable accommodation in regulations and procedures to ensure equal access
to housing, and to facilitate the development of housing. The purpose of this
chapter is to provide a procedure under which a disabled person may request a
reasonable accommodation in the application of zoning requirements. This
chapter is based on requirements of the federal and state fair housing laws,
and implements the housing element of the City of La Mirada's general plan. It
is distinct from the requirements for a variance set forth in Government Code
Section 65906 and
Chapter 21.108 of this code. (Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025; Ord. 661 § 9 (part),
2012).
21.126.020 Requesting reasonable accommodation.
   (a)   Request. A disabled person may request a reasonable accommodation in
the application of the City of La Mirada's land use and zoning regulations.
Such a request may include a modification or exception to the requirements for
the siting, development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that
would eliminate regulatory barriers. A reasonable accommodation cannot waive a
requirement for a conditional use permit when otherwise required or result in
approval of uses otherwise prohibited by the city's land use and zoning
regulations.
   (b)   Availability of information. Information regarding this reasonable
accommodation procedure shall be prominently displayed at the public
information counters in the city hall, advising the public of the availability
of the procedure for eligible applicants.
   (c)   Balancing rights and requirements. The City of La Mirada will attempt
to balance (1) the privacy rights and reasonable request of an applicant for
confidentiality, with (2) the land use requirements for notice and public
hearing, factual findings and rights to appeal, in the city's requests for
information, considering an application, preparing written findings and
maintaining records for a request for reasonable accommodation. (Ord. 736, § 5
(part), 2025; Ord. 661 § 9 (part), 2012).
21.126.030 Application requirements.
   (a)   Application. The applicant shall submit a request for reasonable
accommodation on a form provided by the community development department.
   (b)   Review with other land use applications. If the project for which the
reasonable accommodation is being requested also requires some other
discretionary approval, then the applicant shall submit the reasonable
accommodation application first for a determination by the community
development department, before proceeding with the other applications.
   (c)   Fee. The fee for an application for reasonable accommodation shall be
established by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025;
Ord. 661 § 9 (part), 2012).
21.126.040 Approval authority; Notice; Decision.
The procedures for the approval and noticing of new development that is subject
to this chapter are detailed in Chapter 21.86 of this code. (Ord. 736, § 5
(part), 2025; Ord. 661 § 9 (part), 2012).
21.126.050 Grounds for reasonable accommodation.
The following factors shall be considered in determining whether to grant a
requested accommodation:
   (a)   Is the requested accommodation necessary to afford a disabled person
an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling? To determine whether the
accommodation is necessary, the director may consider, among other things: The
nature of the disability including the special needs created by the disability,
the physical attributes and setting of the property and structures, the
potential benefit that can be accomplished by the requested accommodation, and
alternative accommodations that may provide a comparable level of benefit.
   (b)   Is the requested accommodation reasonable? A requested accommodation
is not reasonable if it would impose an undue financial or administrative
burden on the City. It is also not reasonable if it would fundamentally alter a
City program, such as the City's zoning scheme.
      (1)   In considering the financial or administrative burden on the City,
the director may consider, among other things, the extent to which the City
would have to dedicate resources, such as staff time and funds, to grant the
request and other requests like it.
      (2)   In considering the potential alteration to a City program, such as
the City's zoning scheme, the director may consider, among other things,
whether granting the request would be consistent with the City's General Plan,
with the purpose and nature of the particular zoning district, and with nearby
uses. The director may also consider whether the requested accommodation would
potentially have adverse external impacts on properties in the vicinity. (Ord.
736, § 5 (part), 2025).
21.126.060 Findings.
The written decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny a request for
reasonable accommodation shall be based on the following findings, all of which
are required for approval. In making these findings, the director may approve
alternative reasonable accommodations which provide an equivalent level of
benefit to the applicant.
   (a)   The requested accommodation is requested by or on the behalf of one or
more individuals with a disability protected under the fair housing laws.
   (b)   The requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more
individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
   (c)   The requested accommodation will not, under the specific facts of the
case, result in a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or
substantial physical damage to the property of others.
   (d)   The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental
alteration in the nature of the City's zoning program. The City may consider,
but is not limited to, the following factors in determining whether the
requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of
the City's zoning program:
      (1)   Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the
character of the neighborhood.
      (2)   Whether the accommodation would result in a substantial increase in
traffic or insufficient parking.
      (3)   Whether granting the requested accommodation would substantially
undermine any express purpose of either the City's general plan or an
applicable specific plan.
      (4)   Whether the requested accommodation would create an
institutionalized environment due to the number of and distance between
facilities that are similar in nature or operation.
      (5)   Any other factors that would cause a fundamental alteration in the
city's zoning program, as may be defined in the Fair Housing Law. (Ord. 736, §
5 (part), 2025).

21.128.050   Findings.
21.128.010 Purpose.
An affordable housing implementation plan (AHIP) provides a process to review
and grant density bonuses, concessions, incentives, and development standard
waivers in compliance with Government Code Section 65915 et seq. and Chapter
21.49. (Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025).
21.128.020 Applicability.
Any development project which requests a density bonus, concession/incentive,
and/or development standard waiver shall apply for an Affordable Housing
Implementation Plan. (Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025).
21.128.030 Application requirements.
An application for an affordable housing implementation plan shall include the
following information:
   (a)   A legal description of the project site where the target dwelling
units will be located including a statement of present ownership and present
and proposed zoning.
   (b)   A letter signed by the present owner stating what specific density
bonus, incentives or concessions, waivers or modifications in development
standards are being requested from the City and if reduced parking pursuant to
Section 21.49.060 is being requested.
   (c)   A detailed vicinity map showing the project location and such details
as the location of the nearest commercial retail, transit stop, potential
employment locations, park or recreation facilities or other social or
community service facilities.
   (d)   Site plans, floor plans, and building elevations, which shall
designate the total number of units proposed on the site, including the number
and location of target dwelling units and density bonus dwelling units, and
supporting plans per the application submittal requirements.
   (e)   If the project site contains existing dwelling units, a description of
the existing dwelling units. This shall include the number of units, whether
owner-occupied or rentals, the number of bedrooms in each of the units, and
evidence to household income of occupants for the previous five years.
   (f)   In the case of a request for any incentive or concession, evidence
that the request will result in identifiable and actual cost reductions.
   (g)   In the case of a request for a waiver or reduction of development
standards, evidence that the development standard being waived or reduced will
have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the development at
the densities proposed.(Ord. 736, § 5 (part), 2025).
21.128.040 Review authority.
The review authority for affordable housing implementation plans shall be as
follows:
   (a)   For requests for increases in density and parking reductions, the
Director shall be the final action authority, subject to appeal to the Planning
Commission.
   (b)   For concessions/incentives, excluding financial incentives, or
development standard waivers/reductions, the Planning Commission shall be the
final action authority, subject to appeal to the City Council.
   (c)   For financial incentives, fee waivers, and waivers to dedication
requirements, the City Council shall be the final action authority. (Ord. 736,
§ 5 (part), 2025).
21.128.050 Findings.
The review authority shall approve the affordable housing implementation plan,
unless it adopts one of the following findings:
   (a)   The project would have a specific, adverse impact on the health and
safety of the public and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate
or avoid the specific, adverse impact without rendering the development
unaffordable to low-income and moderate-income households.
   (b)   The project would have a specific, adverse impact on any real property
that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and there is
no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific, adverse
impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low-income and
moderate-income households.
   (c)   A proposed concession/incentive does not result in identifiable and
actual cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs or rents for the
targeted units.
   (d)   Approval of the affordable housing implementation plan would be
contrary to state or federal law.
   (e)   Approval of the financial incentives, fee waiver, or waivers to
dedication requirements would not result in a public benefit. (Ord. 736, § 5
(part), 2025).

DIVISION I: GENERAL NONCONFORMING PROVISIONS
21.130.010 Intent and purpose.
Within the zoning districts established by this zoning ordinance or amendments
that may later be adopted, there exists or will exist lots, structures, and
uses of land and structures which were lawful before the adoption or amendment
of this zoning ordinance, but which no longer comply. The intent of this
article is to permit those nonconformities to continue until they are removed
or required to be terminated, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses
and structures are declared to be incompatible with permitted uses, structures,
and standards in the zoning districts involved, and it is intended that they
shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, nor be used as grounds for
adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zone, except
as may be expressly permitted in this article.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.130.020 Establishment of legal nonconforming status.
   (a)   The provisions of this article shall regulate the continuation,
termination, and modification of lots, structures, and uses which were lawfully
established, but which no longer conform to the provisions of this title due to
a change in zoning district boundaries or a change in the regulations for the
zoning district in which it is located. A mere change in ownership or tenancy
without any change in use, occupancy, or development shall not affect any of
the legal nonconforming rights, privileges, and responsibilities provided under
this chapter.
   (b)   Lots, structures, and uses not having previously acquired proper
permits are illegal and subject to immediate abatement.
   (c)   Any nonconforming situation that becomes specifically authorized under
the terms of some approval pursuant to this title, other than approval of an
extension, expansion, change, or early termination of nonconformity, shall
henceforth be governed by the terms of such approval and shall no longer be
considered to be a nonconformity unless and until such approval expires or is
revoked.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.130.030 Continuation and maintenance.
   (a)   Continuation. Except as otherwise provided herein, any lot, structure,
or use legally in place on the effective date of this zoning ordinance may
continue as a legal nonconforming lot, structure, or use, respectively.
Likewise, any lot, structure, or use approved and exercised prior to the
effective date of this zoning ordinance shall be permitted.
   (b)   Maintenance. Routine maintenance and repairs of lots and structures
which do not increase the nonconformity may be performed.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.130.040 Continuation of incidental nonconformity.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, when a nonconformity
exists incidental to a nonconforming use, that nonconformity may continue until
the time specified for the termination of the nonconforming use, provided such
nonconformity is brought into compliance with the regulations that would be
applicable to the use if it were located in the most restrictive zone which
automatically permits such use.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.130.050 Determination, extension, and abatement procedures.
   (a)   Purpose. This section sets forth provisions for the abatement of lots,
structures, and uses deemed to be nonconforming and subject to abatement
pursuant to the provisions of this article.
   (b)   Authority. The community development director shall be the designated
approving authority for determining that a lot, structure, or use is
nonconforming, and the planning commission shall be the designated approving
authority for action on the abatement procedures and extensions of the
nonconforming lots, structures, or uses.
   (c)   Notice and Hearing. Once the community development director has
determined that a lot, structure, or use is nonconforming, the director shall
provide required notice for hearing and action by the planning commission. The
purpose of the hearing is to determine whether the nonconformity should be
abated, given a specific term prior to abatement, or granted a time extension.
Notice and hearing shall be performed and conducted pursuant to
Chapter 21.86.
   (d)   Decision and Findings. The commission shall base its decision as to
the length of the permitted amortization period on any competent evidence
presented, included but not limited to the depreciation schedule attached to
the owner's latest federal income tax return. Findings shall be made as to
whether or not the balancing of the public interest and the request by the
owner for continuance, alteration, or expansion of the nonconformity of the
subject property requires a deviation from the city's development standards.
Findings shall be made in writing and provided to the property owner within ten
days after the decision is rendered.
   (e)   Appeal. Actions taken by the planning commission may be appealed to
the city council in accordance with provisions of
Chapter 21.88.
   (f)   Extension of Time. The approving authority, at its discretion, may
grant an extension of time for the abatement of a nonconformity where it finds
that an unreasonable hardship would otherwise be imposed on the property owner.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.130.060 Revocation of nonconforming use or structure.
The city may revoke the right to continue a nonconforming use or structure.
Revocation procedures, including notice and hearing, shall be in accordance
with provisions of
Chapter 21.92.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.130.070 No reversion to nonconformance.
When any nonconformity is eliminated or brought into conformance with the
current regulations of this title, the nonconforming rights and privileges with
respect to that nonconformity are terminated and shall not be restored.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
DIVISION II: NONCONFORMING LOTS
21.130.080 Continuation of legal nonconforming lots.
Any lawfully created lot which becomes nonconforming with regard to lot area,
street frontage, lot width, lot depth, or accessibility may continue
indefinitely with such nonconformity and may be developed and used as if it
were a conforming lot. However, any property proposed for development with
multi-family dwellings shall be fully conforming as to lot area and lot width.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.130.090 Modification of legal nonconforming lots.
Legal nonconforming lots may not be modified in any manner that increases the
degree of nonconformity.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
DIVISION III: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
21.130.100 Continuation of legal nonconforming structure.
   (a)   Continuation of Structure. Any legally established nonconforming

DIVISION V: ABATEMENT/EXTENSION OF NONCONFORMING USES/STRUCTURES
21.130.200 Purpose and intent.
The abatement/extension of nonconforming uses/structures process is established
to provide a means by which to establish the period within which a
nonconforming use or structure must comply with current regulations of this
title, and to allow for the extension of such abatement period.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.130.210 Applicability/permit requirement.
All uses and structures determined by the community development director to be
nonconforming shall require a hearing before the planning commission to
establish the appropriate abatement period. Abatement periods may be extended
by the planning commission. Early termination of a nonconformity may be
initiated by order of the planning commission or city council for public
health, safety, and welfare purposes. Such actions shall be processed pursuant
to standard procedures in this article and
Chapter 21.130.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.130.220 Required findings.
   (a)   Abatement. In establishing the amortization period for a nonconforming
use and/or structure, the planning commission shall consider competent
financial data such as the depreciation schedule attached to the owner's latest
federal income tax return. Findings shall be made as to whether or not the
balancing of the public interest and the request by the owner for continuance,
alteration, or expansion of the nonconformity requires a deviation from the
city's development standards.
   (b)   Extension. To grant an extension to the abatement period for a
nonconformity, the planning commission shall find that an unreasonable hardship
would otherwise be imposed on the property owner if such an extension were not
granted.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.130.230 Conditions.
The planning commission may impose conditions to ensure maintenance of an
equitable balance of the public interest and the interests of the property
owner.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
DIVISION VI. MISCELLANEOUS NONCONFORMING PROVISIONS
21.130.240 Nonconforming environmental effects.
   (a)   Off-site Impacts. Any nonconformity with respect to environmental
effects upon surrounding property (such as lighting or noise) shall be made
conforming within two years after the date of becoming nonconforming.
   (b)   On-site Impacts. Any nonconformity with respect to an environmental
effect upon the premises where the source of the effect is located may continue
indefinitely.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.130.250 Nonconformities not requiring capital expenditure or loss to
conform.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any nonconformity which
can be made conforming without requiring that a capital expenditure be made or
a capital loss incurred shall be made conforming within one hundred twenty days
after the date of becoming nonconforming.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).

clear visibility triangle, including landscaping, fencing, walls, signage,
artwork, and similar features but specifically excluding except buildings,
shall be removed or made conforming within five years after the date of
becoming nonconforming.
   (b)   Access. Nonconforming driveways or other vehicular access arrangements
may continue indefinitely, except that with any expansion or intensification of
use, the access serving such expansion or intensification shall be made fully
conforming.
   (c)   Parking or Loading Spaces. Any nonconformity with respect to parking
or loading areas, spaces, or improvements may continue indefinitely, except
that with any change, expansion, or intensification of use, the additional
parking and loading areas and spaces required for such change, expansion, or
intensification shall be fully conforming.
   (d)   Parking Lot Landscaping. Upon a review for any expansion,
intensification, or reconfiguration of an existing parking lot, the designated
approving authority may require that any nonconformity with respect to interior
landscaping and landscaped yards along streets and alleys for parking lots be
made conforming to the fullest extent feasible.
(Ord. 612 Exhibit A (part), 2008).
21.130.270 Nonconformities regarding fencing materials.
All legal nonconforming fencing materials shall be abated within five years of
the date that such materials were rendered nonconforming. However, any legal
nonconforming chain-link fencing in residential zones shall be subject to
abatement within ten years of the date that such materials were rendered
nonconforming.
