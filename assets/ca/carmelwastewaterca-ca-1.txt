§ 10.046 SUMMARY OF SUBCHAPTER.
   An ordinance establishing an enforcement mechanism for violations of Carmel
Area Wastewater District rules and regulations ("regulations"), including
without limitation, the sanitary sewer standard plans and specifications, the
pretreatment ordinance and the uniform plumbing ordinance. These procedures are
in addition to any other procedures or legal remedies available to address
violations of CAWD regulations. The Board of Directors finds that the
enforcement of CAWD regulations is an important public service and is vital to
the protection of the public's health, safety and quality of life. CAWD's
comprehensive code enforcement system uses a combination of judicial and
administrative remedies to gain compliance with regulations. A true and
certified copy of the full text of the ordinance codified herein and the
incorporated Exhibit A are on file and available for inspection at the District
offices.
(Ord. 2024-03, passed 9-26-2024)
§ 10.047 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   These administrative penalties procedures (“procedures”), adopted as
authorized by Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 53069.4 and 54951, establish an enforcement
mechanism for violations of Carmel Area Wastewater District (“CAWD”) rules and
regulations (“regulations”), including without limitation the sanitary sewer
standard plans and specifications and the pretreatment ordinance and the
uniform plumbing ordinance. These procedures are in addition to any other
procedures or legal remedies available to address violations of CAWD
regulations. The Board of Directors finds that the enforcement of CAWD
regulations is an important public service and is vital to the protections of
the public’s health, safety and quality of life. CAWD’s comprehensive code
enforcement system uses a combination of judicial and administrative remedies
to gain compliance with regulations.
(Ord. 2024-03, passed 9-26-2024)
§ 10.048 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION. An official notification, on a form meeting the
criteria of these procedures, of a violation of any provision of CAWD
regulations. ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS require correction of the violations they
identify and impose penalties on the responsible person(s).
   COMPLIANCE ORDER. An official notification, on a form meeting the criteria
of these procedures, of violations of any provision of CAWD regulations.
COMPLIANCE ORDERS require correction of the violations they identify.
   ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. Any person appointed by CAWD to implement the
provisions of these procedures.
   RESPONSIBLE PERSON. Any person that an enforcement officer determines is
responsible for the causing, maintaining, committing, or allowing a violation
of CAWD regulations. A RESPONSIBLE PERSON includes without limitation anyone
who exercises legal or physical control over a property or business premises in
the city, such that the RESPONSIBLE PERSON is capable of preventing or
correcting violations of CAWD regulations.
(Ord. 2024-03, passed 9-26-2024)
§ 10.049 ADMINISTRATION.
   The CAWD General Manager shall administer these procedures, and may
establish appropriate rules, forms, and process for administration, consistent
with the requirements of these procedures. The CAWD General Manager may
appoint, or may designate another CAWD official to appoint, one or more
enforcement officers to issue compliance orders and administrative citations.
(Ord. 2024-03, passed 9-26-2024)
§ 10.050 COMPLIANCE ORDER ISSUANCE.
   (A)   When an enforcement officer observes a correctable, continuing
violation of CAWD regulations creating no immediate danger to health or safety,
the enforcement officer may issue a compliance order to any responsible person.
   (B)   Each compliance order shall be in writing and shall include, without
limitation, the following information:
      (1)   The date of the violation(s) and the date of service of the
compliance order;

      (4)   A description of the violation(s), including citation to the
sections(s) of CAWD regulations;

person(s) regarding the violations. If all violations(s) specified in the
compliance order are not corrected with the time set forth in the compliance
order, the enforcement officer may issue an administrative citation to the
responsible person(s). Issuance of an administrative citation does not alter
the obligation to comply fully with the compliance order.
(Ord. 2024-03, passed 9-26-2024)
§ 10.051 ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION ISSUANCE.
   (A)   When an enforcement officer observes a violation of the CAWD
regulations other than a continuing, correctable violation of CAWD creating no
immediate danger to health or safety, or when all violation(s) in a compliance
order have not been corrected within the time set forth in that compliance
order, the enforcement officer may issue an administrative citation to any
responsible person.
   (B)   Each administrative citation shall be in writing and shall include,
without limitation, the following information:
      (1)   The date of the violation(s) and the date of service of the
administrative citation;
      (2)   The address or a definite description of the location where the
violation(s) was observed;
      (3)   The name, address, and other identifying information of the
responsible person(s);
      (4)   A description of the violation(s), including reference to the
section(s) of the CAWD regulations violated;
      (5)   An order prohibiting the continuation or repeated occurrence of the
violation;
      (6)   The fine schedule for the violation;
      (7)   A description of how, when, and where the fine must be paid;
      (8)   A brief description of the administrative citation hearing process,
including a statement that the responsible person has the right to contest the
administrative citation by requesting a hearing within ten calendar days of the
date of service of the administrative citation in accordance with this section,
and a statement that anyone aggrieved by the decision of the administrative
hearing officer may petition for review by the Monterey County Superior Court
within the applicable time frame and pursuant to other applicable requirements;
and
      (9)   The name and signature of the enforcement officer.
   (C)   Each and every violation of CAWD regulations shall constitute a
separate violation and shall be subject to all remedies and enforcement
measures authorized by CAWD. Any recurring or continuing violation of the CAWD
regulations after the expiration of any correction period set forth in a
compliance order may be assessed fines for each day such violation continues.
(Ord. 2024-03, passed 9-26-2024)
§ 10.052 NOTICES.
   All notices, including compliance orders and administrative citations,
required per these procedures shall be served on the responsible person(s) in
accordance with the following provisions:
   (A)   Notices may be personally served on a responsible person. When an
enforcement officer issues a compliance order or an administrative citation in
the presence of a responsible person, that a responsible person shall be asked
to sign the compliance order or administrative citation to acknowledge receipt.
A responsible person’s failure or refusal to sign a compliance order or an
administrative citation shall not affect the validity of that compliance order
or administrative citation, and a responsible person’s signature on any
administrative citation shall not constitute an admission of responsibility.
   (B)   (1)   Notices may be mailed to the responsible person by certified
mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. Simultaneously, the same
notice may be sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid. If a notice sent by
certified mail is returned unclaimed, service by first- class mail shall
nevertheless be effective if that mail is not returned.
      (2)   If the violation consists of a condition of real property or
otherwise affects real property, such notice shall be addressed to the
responsible person at the property’s address, unless the enforcement officer
knows or has reason to know that the United States Postal Service does to
deliver mail to that property. In addition, if the enforcement officer’s
reasonable investigation reveals a different home or business address for the
responsible person, a copy of the notice shall also be sent to his alternate
address by first-class mail, postage prepaid.
   (C)   If after good faith attempts to serve a responsible person notice has
not been served, a copy of that notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place
on the property where the alleged violation has been observed.
   (D)   If a compliance order or administrative citation is issued for
violation of CAWD regulations by a business or other organization, and if the
responsible person cited is not the sole owner of that business or other
organization, a copy of the compliance order or administrative citation and of
any other notices required in connection with that administrative citation
shall also be personally delivered or shall be sent by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, to the owner or director of that business or other
organization, as may be determined by the enforcement officer’s investigation.
   (E)   If a compliance order or administrative citation is issued for a
violation of cawd regulations existing on real property, and if the responsible
person cited is not shown in the official records of the CAWD as the sole owner
in fee simple of the real property, a copy of the compliance order or
administrative citation and of any other notices required in connection with
that administrative citation shall also be personally delivered or shall be
sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to any owners of interests in that
property that may be affected by the violation, at the address shown on the
last equalized county assessment roll, and at such other address as may be
determined by the enforcement officer’s investigation.
   (F)   If the enforcement officer does not succeed in serving the responsible
person personally, and if the enforcement investigation reveals no home or
business address for the responsible person, and if the violation does not
consist of any condition of real property, the enforcement officer shall cause
the notice to be published once a week for four successive weeks in a local
newspaper published at least once per week.
   (G)   Service of any notice in accordance with these requirements may be
proven by declaration or affidavit. Service is complete upon personal delivery,
upon deposit with the United States Postal Service, upon posting on property or
upon completion of publication according to provisions of this section. Failure
of any person with an interest in the compliance order or administrative
citation to receive properly served notice shall not affect the validity of any
proceedings under these procedures.
(Ord. 2024-03, passed 9-26-2024)
§ 10.053 ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION HEARINGS.
   (A)   Any responsible person may contest an administrative citation by
requesting a hearing within ten calendar days from the date of service of the
administrative citation. The hearing request must be in writing on a form
furnished by CAWD, specifying in detail the basis for contesting the
administrative citation. The responsible person requesting the hearing shall
deposit with CAWD either the amount of the fine or an application for hardship
waiver.
   (B)   CAWD shall hold a hearing within 30 days of receiving a hearing
request that complies fully with division (A) of this section. The responsible
person requesting the hearing, as well as any other persons upon whom the
administrative citation was served shall be notified of the time and place of
the hearing at least ten days before the hearing date. Either the responsible
person or CAWD official may request a continuance of the hearing to a mutually
agreeable date, but in no event may the hearing begin later than 60 days after
CAWD receives a hearing request, accompanied by either deposit of the fine or a
completed hardship waiver application.
   (C)   CAWD shall designate a hearing officer to hear and decide appeals of
administrative citations. This hearing officer may, but need not, be an
employee of CAWD. The employment, performance evaluation, compensation, and
benefits, if any, of a hearing officer shall not be directly or indirectly
conditioned upon the number of administrative citations or the amount of
administrative fines upheld by the hearing officer.
   (D)   Failure to file a timely appeal request in accordance with this
section shall constitute a waiver of the responsible person’s right to contest
all matters set forth in the administrative citation.
(Ord. 2024-03, passed 9-26-2024)
§ 10.054 HARDSHIP WAIVER.
   (A)   Any responsible person who requests a hearing to contest an
administrative citation and who is financially unable to deposit the
administrative fine may request a hardship waiver.
   (B)   This request shall be filed with the hearing request. The request
shall be accompanied by an affidavit, and any other relevant supporting
materials, demonstrating the responsible person’s inability to deposit the fine
in advance of the hearing.
   (C)   The CAWD General Manager or his or her designee shall decide within
ten days of receipt of the hardship waiver request whether to issue a hardship
waiver. The decision shall be in writing and shall be served upon the
responsible person requesting the waiver. The decision shall be final.
   (D)   If the CAWD General Manager or his or her designee decides that a
hardship waiver is unwarranted, the responsible person shall deposit the full
amount of the fine within ten days of service of the written decision, or
within ten days from the date of the administrative citation, whichever is
later. If the responsible person fails to deposit this fine before the due
date, the responsible party shall be deemed to have failed to file an appeal,
and therefore to have waived the right to contest all matters set forth in the
administrative citation
(Ord. 2024-03, passed 9-26-2024)
§ 10.055 HEARING PROCEDURE.
   (A)   On the date and at the time and place set forth in the notice of
hearing, the hearing officer shall conduct an orderly hearing and shall accept
evidence on which persons commonly would rely in the conduct of their business
affairs. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply.
   (B)   The responsible person contesting the administrative citation shall
have the opportunity to testify and to present evidence, including witnesses,
concerning the alleged violation. Any other interested party, including without
limitation the property or business owner, employees, or neighbors, may also
present evidence. The hearing officer shall limit the evidence to that which is
relevant to establishing or refuting the violation alleged in the
administrative citation.
   (C)   Failure of a responsible party or other interested person to attend a
scheduled hearing shall constitute a waiver of the right to present evidence in
the matter.
   (D)   The administrative citation and any other reports submitted by the
enforcement officer shall constitute evidence that upon initial examination,
and unless rebutted, supports the facts stated in those documents.
   (E)   The hearing officer may take the matter under consideration, may
continue the hearing, and may request additional information from the
enforcement officer or from the responsible person or others.
   (F)   Based on preponderance of the evidence, the hearing officer shall
determine whether to affirm or dismiss the administrative citation. The hearing
officer may not reduce, waive, or conditionally reduce the fines established by
these procedures.
   (G)   The hearing officer shall make findings based on the record of the
hearing and shall issue a final written decision based on those findings. The
written decision shall be served upon the responsible person along with notice
regarding the right to further appeal.
   (H)   If the hearing officer affirms the administrative citation, CAWD shall
retain any fine deposited by the responsible person. If the hearing officer
affirms the administrative citation and the fine has not yet been deposited
because of an approved hardship waiver, the hearing officer shall specify in
the written decision a payment schedule for the fine, including the date upon
which the fine will be overdue. If the hearing officer dismisses the
administrative citation, any fine deposited with CAWD shall be promptly
refunded.
(Ord. 2024-03, passed 9-26-2024)
§ 10.056 JUDICIAL REVIEW.
   Any person aggrieved by an administrative decision of a hearing officer may
obtain review of that decision by filing a petition for review in the Monterey
County Superior Court, according to requirements of Cal. Gov’t Code § 53069.4.
(Ord. 2024-03, passed 9-26-2024)
§ 10.057 ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION COLLECTION.
   (A)   Fines for violation of requirements of §
36.052, Grease interceptors, shall be as follows:
      (1)   Failure to have any drainage fixture within a commercial kitchen or
restaurant kitchen connected to a grease interceptor or trap will result in
fines of $100 for each day that a violation continues after the expiration of
any correction period set forth in a compliance order.
      (2)   Failure to have a properly sized, properly installed, or properly
functioning grease interceptor or trap installed to serve drainage fixtures in
a commercial kitchen or restaurant kitchen will result in fines of $100 for
each day that a violation continues after the expiration of any correction
period set forth in a compliance order.
   (B)   Fines for violation of the requirements of §
36.032, Unlawful disposal, will result in fines of $100 for each day that a
violation continues after the expiration of any correction period set forth in
a compliance order.
   (C)   For any violation of CAWD regulations for which no other specific
penalty is established, the fine imposed by an administrative citation for that
violation shall be $50 for each day that a violation continues after the
expiration of any correction period set forth in a compliance order.
   (D)   Fines for administrative citations shall be payable directly to CAWD
and are due immediately upon service of the administrative citation. Such fines
constitute a debt owed to CAWD.
   (E)   Payment of the fine associated with any administrative citation shall
not excuse the violation, nor shall it bar other or further enforcement
activity by CAWD.
   (F)   Any fine paid for an administrative citation shall be refunded if it
is determined after a hearing under these procedures that the violation charged
in the administrative citation did not exist or occur, and therefore that the
administrative citation was dismissed.
   (G)   If payment of a fine is not received by CAWD within 30 days of its due
date, the fine is overdue unless a timely hearing request including an
application for a hardship waiver has been filed. If a hardship waiver
application is denied, the fine is overdue unless the full amount is deposited
within ten days of service of the written decision denying the hardship waiver,
or within 30 days from the date of the administrative citation, whichever is
later. If the hardship waiver is granted and the hearing office affirms the
administrative citation the hearing officer shall set forth a payment schedule
for the fine that shall specify the date on which the fine becomes overdue. In
such case, the fine shall be overdue on that date, unless a timely appeal from
the hearing officer’s determination is filed with CAWD. If any such appeal is
dismissed, or if the decision of CAWD is to affirm the administrative citation,
the fine shall be overdue ten days after service by CAWD of entry of judgment
or of dismissal, or 20 days after the entry of judgment or of dismissal,
whichever is first. A late penalty equal to 50% of the total fine shall be
assessed for any overdue fine.
   (H)   (1)   If the fine is overdue, and if the violation of CAWD regulations
for which the fine was assessed occurred on or was a condition of real
property, the outstanding fine and late penalty shall constitute a lien against
that real property. The enforcement officer shall prepare and file with CAWD a
report stating the amount due and owing.
      (2)   CAWD may record notice of this lien after a hearing before CAWD
Board of Directors to consider any protest or objection to the lien. The
enforcement officer shall serve notice of the hearing upon the owner of record
of real property, based on the last equalized assessment roll or the
supplemental roll, whichever is more current. The notice of hearing shall
include the time, date, and place of hearing and the amount of the lien to be
imposed and shall be served accordingly.
      (3)   If CAWD determines that the lien should be imposed, the CAWD
General Manager may cause notice of the lien to be recorded by the County
Recorder. Once recorded, the lien shall have the force and effect and priority
of a judgment lien governed by Cal. Code of Civil Procedure § 697.340 and may
be extended as provided in §§ 683.110 to 683.220, inclusive, of that Code.
   (I)   The remedies set forth in this section are not exclusive. CAWD may
collect past due fines for administrative citations, and penalties for late
fines, using small claims court or by any other legal remedy.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 21.001 POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR BOARD MEMBERS.
   (A)   Representation of the Board of Directors by any individual Board
member before any legislative body, commission or agency of any state, county,
municipality or other public entity shall occur only after the approval of or
appointment to the same by the President of the Board or by action of the Board
of Directors.
   (B)   Individual members of the Board shall not interfere with the daily
work routine of any District employee unless authorized by the General Manager
or the Board of Directors.
   (C)   Individual members of the Board of Directors who recommend changes or
offer suggestions as to the operation of the District treatment plant facility
shall do so only through the General Manager.
   (D)   Individual members of the Board shall not use District letterhead
stationary, materials, supplies or staff time when corresponding with other
public agencies or members of the public unless the Board of Directors consents
to the opinion or statement made in the correspondence.
   (E)   Board members shall not, either individually or collectively, be
involved in the consultant selection process outside of a public Board meeting.
      (1)   Adjournments. The legislative body may adjourn any regular,
adjourned regular, special or adjourned special meeting to a time and place
specified in the order of adjournment. Less than a quorum may adjourn such
meetings and, if all members are absent, the Clerk or Secretary of the
legislative body may declare the meeting adjourned. Written notice of the
adjournment must be provided in the same manner as notice for special meetings.
A copy of the order or notice of adjournment must be conspicuously posted on or
near the door of the place where the meeting was held within 24 hours of the
adjournment. When a regular or adjourned regular meeting is adjourned, the
resulting adjourned meeting is a regular meeting for all purposes. If the order
of adjournment fails to state a specific hours for the next meeting, the
meeting must be held at the hour designated for regular meetings.
      (2)   Special meetings. Special meetings are meetings called by the
presiding officer or a majority of the legislative body and may be held at any
time subject to a 24-hour notice requirement. Such written notice must be
delivered to each member of the legislative body (unless waived, in writing, by
that member) and to each local newspaper of general circulation, and to each
radio and television station that has requested such notice in writing. Only
the business set forth in the notice may be considered at the meeting.

DISTRICT POLICIES; GENERAL
§ 23.035 ADOPTING FEDERALLY REQUIRED ALCOHOL AND DRUG TESTING POLICY.
   The Board of Directors hereby approves the drug and alcohol testing policy
attached to the resolution incorporated herein, ratifies the General Manager’s
previous action to issue said policy as a safety regulation, and adopts said
policy as that of the District for all purposes effective upon its promulgating
by the General Manager.
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE AND ALCOHOL MISUSE
1.0   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
   The Carmel Area Wastewater District is and will stay a drug free workplace.
The policy of the District is to minimize health and safety risks to its
employees and the public. Alcohol or drug abuse poses a serious threat to the
health and safety of employees and the public. It is, therefore, the policy of
the District to prevent alcohol and substance abuse from adversely affecting
the workplace. Every employee has the right to work in an alcohol and drug-free
environment and to work with coworkers who are free from the effects of illicit
drugs and alcohol abuse. Employees who abuse alcohol or use illicit drugs at
the workplace pose a serious danger to themselves, their coworkers and the
public.
2.0   USE OF ALCOHOL OR DRUGS
   Controlled Substances - District employees are prohibited from using alcohol
or drugs (controlled substances) on District time, District property or in a
District vehicle. Should an employee appear to be intoxicated while in the work
place, Management may require that the employee see a doctor (of the District’s
choosing and at the District’s expense) to determine if the employee is capable
of performing his/her normal duties in a safe, capable manner. Prompt
disciplinary action will be taken against any employee found intoxicated while
on District time, District property or operating a District vehicle.
Disciplinary action will follow the District’s Discipline Policy currently in
effect.
   Off-the-job illegal substance use which adversely affects an employee’s job
performance or which jeopardizes the safety of other employees, the public, or
Agency equipment shall be proper cause for administrative or disciplinary
action up to and including termination of employment.
   Prescription Drugs - Employees on prescription drugs who suffer side effects
that affect the employee’s safe performance of duties may be requested to
return home. The employee should notify his or her physician of the side
effects. If necessary, transportation will be provided for the employee. It is
an employee’s responsibility to notify his or her supervisor of any known side
effects from prescription drugs which may interfere with the employee’s safe
and effective performance of duties.
   It should be noted that it is a violation of California State Law for any
person to sell or give prescription drugs to another person for whom the
prescription was not intended.
   Found Substances - Any employee finding a questionable substance believed to
be drugs or other controlled substance on District property or in a District
vehicle is to report it immediately to their supervisor. Employees are to
cooperate with the local authorities in any ensuing investigation.
   Possession - Any employee found selling, buying or in possession of
controlled substances on District time or District property is subject to
immediate disciplinary action. Should another District employee witness such
activity, he/she is not to intervene, but is to report immediately such to
their supervisor or management.
   Any employee who is arrested for drug activity may be considered to be in
violation of the controlled substance and alcohol misuse policy. In deciding
its course of action, management will take into consideration the nature of the
charge, the employee’s assignment, the record of the employee with the District
and other such factors relative to the impact that the employee’s arrest has
upon the District.
3.0   PERSONS AFFECTED BY THIS PROGRAM
   All District employees are affected by this policy. However, only employees
who are required by the District to obtain a commercial driver’s license for
the performance of their assigned job functions, or employees who hold A or B
licenses, must comply with the District’s compliance with the Federal Highway
Administration Mandatory Testing for Alcohol and Controlled Substances Policy.
   Visitors, vendors, and contracted employees are governed by this policy
while on District premises, and they will not be permitted to conduct business
if found to be in violation of this policy.
   All Supervisors and managers who directly supervise persons subject to the
testing procedures of this policy are required to comply with this policy as it
pertains to the exercise of their supervisory authority.
   The District is dedicated to assuring fair and equitable application of this
Substance Abuse Policy. Therefore, supervisors are required to administer all
aspects of the policy in an unbiased and impartial manner. Any supervisor who
knowingly disregards the requirements of this policy, or who is found to
deliberately misuse the policy with respect to his/her subordinates shall be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
4.0   EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITY ON THE JOB
   Duty - Any employee while on assigned duty is to refrain from becoming
intoxicated. Any employee found to be intoxicated on duty shall be subject to
disciplinary action. An employee is considered intoxicated when his or her
blood alcohol concentration level is 0.04 or greater.
   Emergency Call Out - Should an emergency arise requiring the call out of
additional non-duty personnel or personnel not assigned to call out duty, and
should a called employee be intoxicated, the employee is not to respond to the
call out. The non duty employee is not subject to disciplinary action for
failing to respond to the call out. If an employee responds to a call out while
intoxicated, they will not be allowed to remain on the job site. The supervisor
is to provide transportation home for the employee via another employee, or a
cab will be called at the affected employee’s expense.
   Impaired/Not Fit for Duty - Any employee who is reasonably suspected of
being impaired, under the influence of a prohibited substance, or not fit for
duty shall be removed from safetysensitive job duties and be required to
undergo a reasonable suspicion controlled substance or alcohol test. Employees
failing to pass this reasonable suspicion controlled substance or alcohol test
shall remain off duty and be referred to a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP).
5.0   DRUG TESTING - Drug testing is not regularly or routinely required for
District employees with the exception of those requirements under the
District’s compliance with the Federal Highway Administration Mandatory Testing
for Alcohol and Controlled Substances Policy. However, an employee may be
subject to a drug test, if, in the opinion of his supervisor/supervisors, he or
she indicates symptoms of drug abuse on District property or in a District
vehicle.
   Reasonable Suspicion Testing - All employees will be subject to urine and/or
breath testing when there is a reason to believe that controlled substances or
alcohol use is adversely affecting job performance. A reasonable suspicion
referral for testing will be made on the basis of documented objective facts
and circumstances which are consistent with the effects of substance abuse.
Examples of reasonable suspicion include, but are not limited to, the
following:
   1.   Adequate documentation of unsatisfactory work performance or on-the-job
behavior.
   2.   Physical signs and symptoms consistent with prohibited substance use.
   3.   Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident that may have
been caused by human error.
   4.   Fights (to mean physical contact), assaults and flagrant disregard or
violations of established safety, security, or other operational procedures.
   Reasonable suspicion determinations will be made by a supervisor who is
trained to detect the signs and symptoms of controlled substance and alcohol
use, and who reasonably concludes that an employee may be adversely affected or
impaired in his/her work performance due to prohibited substance abuse or
misuse.
   Pre-employment Physical
   A drug test may be incorporated into the pre-employment physical. The
results of the entire physical will be considered in the acceptance of the
applicant for employment. Management may require a drug test as a result of a
serious vehicle or equipment accident if circumstances surrounding the accident
indicate intoxication may have been a factor. Results of the testing will be
considered in any pending disciplinary action.
   Confidentiality of Results - Results of all screening shall be kept
confidential and only those with a strict need to know shall have access to
those records. All records to such screening shall be stored in a manner to
restrict such access.
   Help - Any employee having a problem with drugs or alcohol may request
assistance from the District. This request should be made directly to the
General Manager (or Human Resources?). This request will be kept in the
strictest of confidence with information passed only on a need-to-know basis.
Upon request, the District will do whatever it legally can through scheduling,
insurance, etc. to assist the employee. An employee requesting assistance shall
not be subject to reprisal or disciplinary action for revealing a drug or
alcohol problem. Likewise, should an employee make such a request after
disciplinary action has already been contemplated, the request for help does
not absolve the disciplinary action. Requests for help will be handled on a
case by case basis by Management, making every effort to preserve the
employee’s status, dignity and privacy. As necessary, legal counsel will be
consulted to ensure any assistance offered does not compromise the District.
6.0   DISTRICT FUNCTIONS - Alcoholic beverages will not be provided by the
District at District functions (retirement parties, picnics, etc.). District
employees are not permitted to bring their own alcohol to such functions.
(Res. 1996-26, passed 8-15-1996)
§ 23.036 ESTABLISHING THE DISTRICT ILLNESS AND INJURY PREVENTION PLAN.
   The Board of Directors hereby adopts an illness and injury prevention plan
and directs the General Manager to implement said plan in conformance with
state law.
(Res. 1991-23, passed 7-25-1991)
§ 23.037 ADOPTING SMOKING POLICY.
   The Board of Directors, for the reasons specified hereinbelow, does hereby
adopt the following District smoking policy:
SMOKING POLICY
Findings and Purpose. The District Smoking Policy is enacted pursuant to
Monterey County Ordinance No. 3210. Numerous studies have found that tobacco
smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution. Reliable studies have
also shown that breathing second-hand smoke is a significant health hazard for
several population groups. Health hazards induced by breathing second-hand
smoke include lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased exercise tolerance,
decreased respiratory function and allergies, all of which can cause forced
sick leave because of adverse reactions to smoke.
The objectives of this policy are to protect employee health and to maintain a
balance between those who smoke and the needs of non-smokers to breathe smoke-
free air, and to recognize that when these needs conflict, the need to breathe
smoke-free air shall have priority.
The District considers this policy to include any and all smoking materials or
substitute smoking materials including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars,
pipes, e-cigarettes, and vaporizers.
If you wish to smoke, you may do so, outside, on your designated breaks, and
beyond any safety zones that specify “no smoking.”
No Smoking Areas Designated. Smoking of any kind shall be prohibited at all
times on District premises, in District vehicles, or in the presence of
District clients or constituents.
Enforcement of Smoking Policy. Because of the serious concerns about the health
and safety aspects of smoking in and around wastewater conveyance and treatment
facilities, as well as the impact of smoke on non-smokers in the immediate area
where smoking is taking place, strict adherence to the provisions of this
Smoking Policy will be enforced. Employees violating this Smoking Policy will
be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.
Notice of Policy. This Smoking Policy shall be communicated to all District
employees within three weeks of its adoption, and annually thereafter. A
written copy of this Smoking Policy shall be provided to any prospective
employee who so requests.
(Res. 1991-26, passed 9-19-1991)
Editor's Note: Smoking Policy is available for viewing in PDF: POLICY. This
policy will be updated in the future.
§ 23.038 CONTRACT NEGOTIATING GROUND RULES.

(Res. 2018-01, passed 1-25-2018; Res. 2019-47, passed 9-26-2019)
§ 23.039 WORKPLACE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING POLICY.
   The Board of Directors, which is convinced by the staff report on February
23, 2023 that this policy has merit, hereby authorizes the General Manager to
approve the following electric vehicle charging policy:
Work Place Electric Vehicle Charging Policy
Parking spaces with electric vehicle (EV) charging stations for plug in EVs are
available on a first come, first served basis for all employees in accordance
with the following use policy.
Use policy:
•   Employees who utilize the EV charging stations must limit charging to no
more than four hours per day for level two charging stations.
•   When your charge is complete, move your vehicle so other employees can use
the charging station.
•   By using the EV charging stations, the EV owner consents for the vehicle to
be unplugged when the EV charging station indicates that the vehicle is fully

•   Energy consumption for the EV charging will be tracked and billed to the
employee on a quarterly basis for the energy consumed at the cost of
electricity.
•   Employees who utilize the EV charging system must register their vehicle
with the District.
•   The District EV chargers are limited to use by employees and not available
to vendors or contractors or the general public.

§ 23.040 ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT POLICY.
   (A)   Definition of ADU.
      ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT (ADU) (aka granny flat, in-law unit, second
unit). 
      (1)   One permanent attached or detached residential dwelling unit, which
provides complete independent living facilities for one or more persons and is
accessory to one existing or proposed single-family dwelling (SFD). It includes
permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation. An
accessory dwelling unit also includes:
         (a)   An efficiency unity, as defined in Cal. Health and Safety Code,
§ 17958.1.
         (b)   A manufactured home, as defined in Cal. Health and Safety Code,
§ 18007.
      (2)   An ADU may be created by constructing a new accessory structure or
an addition, or by converting the existing permitted interior space of a
single-family residence or accessory structure into an ADU. In 2018, state law
expanded the definition of accessory structure to include converted garages,
carports or covered parking structures.
      (3)   Cal. Gov’t Code, § 65852.2 requires local government to ease local
requirements for ADUs and expedite local permitting processes associated with
ADUs.
   (B)   Summary of recent changes to State of California ADU laws.
      (1)   Changes in ADU laws effective January 1, 2021 further reduce
barriers, better streamline approval processes, and expand capacity to
accommodate the development of ADUs. (Cal. Gov’t Code, § 65852.150).
      (2)   ADUs are allowed only on lots where adequate water and sewage
disposal systems are or can be made available. Shared water and sewage disposal
systems between the primary unit and the ADU is permissible.
      (3)   A local agency, special district or water corporation shall not
consider ADUs as a new residential use for the purpose of calculating
connection fees or capacity charges for utilities, including water and sewer
services. However, these provisions do not apply to ADUs that are constructed
concurrently with a new single-family home (Cal. Gov’t Code, §§ 65852.2(f), and
66000).
      (4)   An ADU is exempt from incurring impact fees from local agencies,
special districts, and water corporations if less than 750 square feet. Should
an ADU be 750 square feet or larger, impact fees shall be charged
proportionately in relation to the square footage of the ADU to the square
footage of the primary dwelling unit. Agencies may waive impact and other fees
for ADUs.
      (5)   ADUs converted from existing space and Junior Accessory Dwelling
Unit (JADUs) shall not be considered by a local agency, special district or
water corporation to be a new residential use for purposes of calculating
connection fees or capacity charges for utilities, unless constructed with a
new single-family dwelling. The connection fee or capacity charge shall be
proportionate to the burden of the proposed ADU, based on its square footage or
plumbing fixtures as compared to the primary dwelling.
      (6)   A (JADU), or conversion of existing space that is contained
entirely within an existing or proposed SFR is not considered a separate or new
dwelling unit.
      (7)   State ADU law does not cover monthly user charge fees (Cal. Gov’t
Code, § 65852.2(f).
   (C)   Carmel Area Wastewater District (CAWD) Policy.
      (1)   CAWD will follow all applicable state regulations as regards to
ADUs, unless we go beyond state requirement as indicated below.
      (2)   Sewer connection fees: Sewer connection fees shall not be charged
for ADUs unless additional sewer connection(s) to a lot is required due to
insufficient capacity or at the request of the property owner. In such cases,
an equivalent number of additional connection fees will be applied or
proportionately charged.
      (3)   Sewer user fees: excluding JADUs, a user fee shall be assessed as
calculated in the annual rate model for a residential unit.

CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL RESERVES.
   The Board of Directors does hereby elect to:

Improvement Reserve;
   (B)   Amend the Reserve Policy to delete the Rate Stabilization Reserve; and
   (C)   Amend the Reserve Policy to add the Defend or Managed Retreat
Restricted Reserve.
Reserve Policy
The purpose of the Carmel Area Wastewater District’s (CAWD) Reserve Policy is
to ensure that the District will at all times have sufficient funding available
to meet its operating, capital, and debt service cost obligations. Reserves
will be managed in a manner that allows the District to fund costs consistent
with its annually updated Capital Improvement Program and Long-Term Financial
Plan, as well as other long-term plans while avoiding significant rate
fluctuations due to changes in cash flow requirements. Operating reserves will
be maintained at a minimum level of twelve months of budgeted operating costs
or consistent with the currently approved Operating Budget (less Reclamation).
This policy establishes the level of reserves necessary for maintaining the
District’s credit worthiness and for adequately providing for:
•   Infrastructure replacement;
•   Economic uncertainties and other financial hardships;
•   Loss of significant revenue sources, such as property tax; receipts or
connection fees;
•   Local disasters or catastrophic events;
•   Future debt or capital obligations;
•   Cash flow requirements; and
•   Unfunded mandates, including regulatory requirements.
The Reserve Policy covers all reserve funds of the District. At the end of each
fiscal year compliance with the Reserve Policy will be reported to the
District’s Board of Directors as part of each Fiscal Year-End Financial Report.
Reserve Fund Types
There are three major types of reserve funds:
•   Legally Restricted Reserves – have restrictions imposed by an outside
source, such as bond covenants, contractual obligations, etc.
•   Board Designated Reserves – are set aside for a specific purpose as
determined by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has the authority
to redirect the use of these reserves as the needs of the District change.
•   Unrestricted Reserves – are planned for use in each update of the Capital
Improvement Program and Long-Term Financial Plan to assist in providing for
minimal orderly rate adjustments consistent with the Board’s Rate Setting
Policy
CAWD Reserve Fund Specific Purposes
Legally Restricted Reserves
•   Bond Reserve Fund: This fund is governed by legal bond covenants for the
District’s Highlands Project bonds (CSCDA Water & Wastewater Revenue Bonds
Series 2004A). Bond covenants require that this fund be maintained at
$238,822.50, or the amount required equal to the maximum annual Installment
Payment payable on said bond.
These funds are held by the bond trustee during the term of the bonds and are
to be used in the event that the District is unable to meet its required semi-
annual debt service obligation. The Reserve account, according to covenants,
must be available only to cover a deficiency in the Installment Payments under
the Installment Purchase Agreement.
Board Designated Reserves
•   Capital Improvement Reserve: This fund is to fund capital projects as
planned in the Capital Improvement Program and capital budget. This fund is
applied to the Long-Term Financial Plan and Replacement Cost Plan. All
connection fees, property taxes and interest income revenue is presently
deposited into this fund. A key objective for accumulating capital reserves is
to minimize external borrowing and interest expense.
Annually an amount equal to current year capital budget is transferred from
this fund to the Capital Fund.
Recommendation: This fund will accumulate sufficient funds to cover District’s
Long-Range Financial Plan.
•   Compensated Accrual Reserve: This fund is used to pay the District’s
accrued vacation liability. District policy allows employees to accrue a
maximum of 320 hours vacation time. Vacation accruals are paid to employee upon
separation.
Recommendation: This fund will be sufficient to cover compensated absences
liability as reported in annual financial statement.
•   Defend or Managed Retreat Restricted Reserve: created in 2017 to address
the future needs of the District in response to potential sea level rise
issues. The Board determined that the Budget Committee would review annually
and make a recommendation as part of the budget process to the full board as to
funding.
Resolution 2017-09 refers to a funding goal of $15M over 15 years.
Unrestricted Undesignated Reserves
•   Capital Fund: Will be drawn down annually to pay for budgeted capital
expenditures. It is replenished annually in amount equal to capital budget to
meet the next year budgeted capital requirements.
Recommendation: This fund will maintain a balance in funds equals to or
sufficient to cover current year capital budget. Any funds in excess of current
year capital budget will be transferred to the Capital Improvement Reserve
annually, unless prior Board action is given to utilize for other purposes.
•   O&M Fund: This fund contains all operating and non-operating revenues not
specifically allocable to other funds which may be used for general purposes of
the District. All operating and non-operating expenses identified in the budget
are financed from this fund.
Recommendation: Maintain a minimum balance of approximately 100% of the total
annual operating budget. This balance will fluctuate from month to month.
However, the year-end objective is to achieve a balance that at a minimum is
100% of upcoming year operating budget. Any funds in excess of 100% of said
operating budget will be transferred to the Capital Improvement Reserve
annually, unless prior Board action is given to utilize for other purposes.
The policy requires coverage of a minimum of 100% of the total annual operating
budget because (a) the District utilizes the property tax rolls to bill for
sewer service and therefore is only able to submit rate changes once a year,
and (b) covering 100% of the annual operating budget is a conservative position
and ensures that, should the District need to borrow, lenders will look
favorably on its operating position.
One-time and Unpredictable Revenues
One-time revenues, except when immaterial, should be allocated to the source of
the revenue or refunded expenditure or, if not directly allocable, to the rate
stabilization fund. Nonrecurring revenues shall not be used to initiate new
programs which result in ongoing expenditures without specific notification to
and approval by the Board of Directors.
Reserve Fund Transfers
Non-emergency Reserve transfer requested must be submitted to the Board of
Directors prior to any expenditure. Reserve transfers will be controlled by
specific Board resolutions or identified as part of the approved annual Budget.
Emergency Reserve Expenditures
As referenced in the District’s Purchasing Policy,
“An emergency is defined as a breakdown in machinery or equipment or disaster,
including but not limited to a flood, storm or other disaster resulting in the
interruption of an essential service, or a distinct threat to public health,
safety, or welfare. In the case of an emergency requiring the immediate
purchase of supplies, materials, equipment or contractual services, the General
Manager may authorize his designee to secure in the open market, at the lowest
obtainable price, any supplies, materials, equipment, or contractual services
required, regardless of the amount of the expenditure.
During an emergency, the using department may purchase any supplies, materials,
equipment, or contractual services. This may be done only after the Department
Head has concluded that the purchase is essential to prevent delays which may
affect the health or safety of citizens. The head of the using department
shall, as soon as possible, provide a completed purchase requisition to the
Finance Department.
In the case of a disaster, nothing contained in this document shall limit the
authority of the General Manager to make purchases and take such other
emergency steps as are, or may be, necessary to maintain operations. The
General Manager shall report to the Board of Directors all actions taken on an
emergency basis after the fact, preferably at the next Board meeting.”
In addition to reporting on actions taken during an emergency, said report will
include comments as to impact on reserve levels and plan to replenish or
recover said reserves if necessary.
Procedures for Monitoring Reserve Levels
The Reserve levels are reported monthly to the Board of Directors as part of
the Cash Report. In addition, there shall be a report made:
•   Board of Director’s deliberation of budget (annual or bi-annual)
•   Board of Director’s deliberation of a service charge rate increase (annual
or bi-annual)
•   When a major change in conditions threatens the Reserve levels established
within this policy

23.071 ADOPTING DEBT MANAGEMENT POLICY.
   The Board of Directors hereby adopts the following debt management policy.
The debt management policy may be amended by the Board of Directors as it deems
appropriate, from time to time, in the prudent management of the debt of the
District.
Debt Management Policy
I.   Purpose
The purpose of this debt management policy (“policy”) is to organize and
formalize debt issuance and management related policies and procedures for the
Carmel Area Wastewater District (the “District”). The debt policies and
procedures of the District are subject to and limited by applicable provisions
of the State of California (“state”) and federal law and to prudent debt
management principles.
II.   Scope
This policy is intended to comply with Cal. Gov’t Code, § 8855(i), which became
effective on January 1, 2017, and will apply to all future debt considerations
and issuances by the District and any entities for which the District Board of
Directors (“Board”) acts as the legislative body.
III.   Objective
The primary objectives of the District’s debt and financing related activities
are to:
-   Maintain cost-effective access to the capital markets through prudent
fiscal management policies and practices;
-   Judicious debt service commitments will be made through effective planning
and cash management;
-   Ensure compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws;
-   Achieve the highest practicable credit ratings within the context of the
District’s financing needs and financing capabilities;
-   Ensure that all debt is structured in order to protect both current and
future taxpayers, ratepayers and constituents of the District; and
-   Ensure that the District’s debt is consistent with the District’s planning
goals and objectives and capital improvement program or budget, as applicable.
IV.   Assignment of Responsibility
This policy will be reviewed and updated periodically as necessary. Any changes
to the policy will be approved by the Board of Directors. The Board of
Directors is responsible for overall policy direction of this policy, as well
as the authorization of each debt financing. The General Manager will be
responsible for implementation of the policy, as well as its day-to-day
administration.
The District recognizes that, while this policy provides guidance and structure
for the decisions and management of the District’s debt, changes in capital
markets, District programs and other unforeseen circumstances may arise that
are not addressed in this policy. In these cases, flexibility is appropriate,
and modifications or exceptions to this policy may be necessary to achieve the
District’s goals. Minor modifications or exceptions may be made by the General
Manager without approval by the Board of Directors. Significant modifications
or exceptions will be approved by the Board of Directors.
V.   Debt Issuance
a.   Purpose of Debt Issuance
The District’s debt management program will consider debt issuance in cases
where public policy, generational equity and economic efficiency provide a
benefit to the residents of the District.
The District will utilize debt obligations, and will give due consideration to
all available funding sources, including available cash reserves, available
current revenues, potential future revenue sources, potential grants and all
other financing sources legally available to be used for such purposes.
Bond proceeds are expected to fund major, non-recurring expenditures/expenses,
including, but not limited to: the financing of costs related to capital
project planning and design, environmental, land acquisition, real property and
equipment acquisition, the construction or renovation of buildings and
permanent structures, financing costs related to debt issuance, capitalized
interest, necessary or financially prudent debt service reserves or other costs
as permitted by law.
Refunding or refinancing existing debt obligations in order to produce debt
service savings or to realize the benefits of a debt restructuring are
acceptable uses of bond proceeds.
b.   Types of Debt
The District will evaluate the use of appropriate financing tools available as
permitted by the California Constitution and applicable state statutes. These
financing tools will be considered in order to secure the most cost
advantageous financing available while limiting the District’s risk exposure.
Types of debt may include, but are not limited to:
-   Wastewater revenue bonds or certificates of participation;
-   Land-secured financing, such as special tax revenue bonds issued under the
Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982, as amended, and limited obligation
bonds issued under applicable assessment statutes;
-   Lease revenue bonds or certificates of participation;
-   Refunding/refinancing existing debt obligations;
-   Short-term notes, including notes to provide financing for the District’s
operational cash flows;
-   Lease-purchase and installment sale transactions; and
-   Letters of credit and revolving credit.
The District will also consider the advantages of a negotiated or competitive
bond sale, and recognizes that a standard, all-purpose approach to debt
financing does not serve the best interest of the District. The District will
consider the unique combination of factors, such as the type of debt needed,
funding stream, market conditions and District programs to structure each debt
issuance.
c.   Debt Structuring Practices
The weighted average maturity of the debt (or the portion of the debt allocated
to the project) will not exceed the average useful life of the project to be
financed by more than 20%. Capitalized interest and deferral of principal may
be considered but not required during construction of a debt-funded project.
Fixed rate debt is preferred, but the District may consider the appropriateness
of variable rate debt when considering financial market conditions and risk
factors.
d.   Financing Options
In general, debt may be issued to fund new projects or to refinance existing
debt.
-   New Debt:
New long-term debt issuances are used to generate funding for capital projects.
These funds will be used for necessary land acquisitions, capital construction,
equipment, related financing costs and other necessary costs that would deliver
a project for the District.
-   Refinancing Existing Debt:
A periodic review of the District’s outstanding debt will be undertaken by the
Administration Department of the District to determine refunding opportunities.
Refunding bonds are issued to retire all or a portion of an outstanding bond
issue, typically to secure lower interest rates and to reduce overall debt
service. Alternatively, some refunding is undertaken for reasons other than to
achieve cost savings, such as to restructure debt service payments, to change
the type of debt instruments being used or to eliminate undesirable covenants.
A present value savings analysis will be prepared to identify the economic
effects of any refunding being considered by the District. The savings from any
refunding candidate shall generally be at least 3% of the refunded principal
amount, net of all transaction expenses. This 3% target may be waived by the
District upon finding that such a refunding is in the District’s best overall
financial interest, and shall not be applicable for refunding transactions that
are not solely undertaken to achieve cost savings.
e.   Integration with District Capital Improvement Plan and Budgets
The District is committed to long-term financial planning; maintaining
appropriate reserves levels; and employing prudent practices in governance,
management and budget administration.
In addition, the District maintains a multi-year capital improvement program
(“CIP”) to establish and monitor priorities for projects. If debt is selected
as a funding mechanism for a capital purpose, the District would integrate its
debt issuances with the goals of the CIP by timing the issuance of debt to
ensure that projects are available when needed in furtherance of the District’s
public purposes and in a timely manner to avoid having to make unplanned
expenditures for capital improvements or equipment from its general fund
budget.
Debt issuances will be for the purposes stated in this policy and to implement
policy decisions incorporated through the District’s annual operations budget
as well as the CIP.
 VI.   Policy Goals
The District is committed to long-term financial planning; maintaining
appropriate reserves levels; and employing prudent practices in governance,
management and budget administration. It is a policy goal of the District to
protect taxpayers, ratepayers and constituents by utilizing conservative
financing methods and techniques so as to obtain the highest practicable credit
ratings (if applicable) and the lowest practical borrowing costs.
The District will comply with applicable state and federal law as it pertains
to the maximum term of debt and the procedures for levying and imposing any
related taxes, assessments, rates and charges.
 VII.   Consultants
The District will, when appropriate and given the specific requirements of the
financing, secure the services of independent municipal advisors, underwriters,
disclosure counsel, bond counsel, appraisal services and other service
providers.
VIII.   Investment of Bond Proceeds
Bond proceeds will be invested according to the District’s investment policy or
the indenture of fiscal agent management, if applicable. The District will not
invest bond proceeds in derivatives unless the District adopts a separate
comprehensive derivatives policy.
IX.   Ongoing Administration of Internal Controls
When issuing debt, in addition to complying with the terms of this policy, the
District will comply with any other applicable policies regarding initial
disclosure, continuing disclosure, post-issuance compliance and investment of
bond proceeds.
The District will accurately account for all debt-related activity to ensure
that debt proceeds are directed to their intended use. These records will also
be designed to ensure that the District maintains compliance with all debt
covenants, as well as state and federal laws. The District will maintain a
system of reporting interest earnings that relates to and complies with
Internal Revenue Code requirements relating to rebate, yield limits and
arbitrage.
X.   Compliance
a.   Initial Disclosure
In accordance with Cal. Gov’t Code, § 8855 (“§ 8855”), the District will submit
a report of final sale to the State Debt and Investment Advisory Commission,
not later than 21 days following the sale of debt.
A copy of the final official statement shall accompany the report of final sale
for publicly offered debt. In the event that the official statement has not yet
been finalized, the District will provide documentation to satisfy the
requirements of § 8855, as necessary.
b.   Ongoing Disclosure
The District will maintain compliance with the regulations set forth in § 8855
and Rule 15(c)2-12 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The District will file an annual report and annual financial information with
the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board’s Electronic Municipal Market Access
System (“EMMA”). The reports will be made timely and in accordance with the
District’s continuing disclosure undertakings.
The District will submit an annual report for any issue of debt whose final
sale occurred on or after January 21, 2017.
The annual report will cover the reporting period of July 1 through June 30 and
will be submitted no later than seven months following the end of the reporting
period.
XI.   Adoption by Legislative Body
In accordance with § 8855, the District adopted this policy. In implementing
this policy from time to time, interpretations and variations may be made at
the discretion of the general manager or principal accountant, without approval
of the Board of Directors, as determined by such person to be in the best
interests of the District or its constituents, and/or for purposes of
administrative efficiency or convenience or to comply with new applicable
federal, state or local law.

REIMBURSEMENT FEES; EXCESS SEWER CAPACITY
§ 31.015 APPROVAL.
   This subchapter, entitled “Reimbursement Fees; Excess Sewer Capacity”, is
hereby approved and adopted to govern reimbursement requirements and procedures
for required sewer capacity exceeding the needs attributable to a sewer
facilities installation.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.016 CEQA APPROVAL.
   Approval of this subchapter does not involve any activity included in the
definition of PROJECT in the CEQA, and, therefore, is not subject to review
under CEQA.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.017 POLICY STATEMENT, FINDINGS, DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   It is the policy of the District, that as to public sewage facilities
(PSF) designed and installed at the expense of the owner of the property first
served, to provide wastewater utility service to the District treatment plant.
The costs for such facilities shall be fairly and equitably distributed among
those customers who will use the facilities.
   (B)   The Board of Directors finds:
      (1)   That it is in the public interest for the District to require
installers to design and construct PSF having capacity that exceeds the need
attributable to and reasonably related to development of property; as to avoid
replacement or construction of additional parallel PSF to serve properties not
provided capacity when the PSFs are first constructed, as such replacement or
additional construction results in:
         (a)   Increased District capital, additional expense for operations
and maintenance staff;
         (b)   Public inconvenience;
         (c)   Reduction in the efficiency of collection system operations; and
         (d)   Potential public health hazards.
      (2)   That construction of PSF sized and designed to provide wastewater
utility service to properties other than those owned or to be developed by the
installer is necessary for orderly and proper extension of wastewater utility
service to all such properties which could reasonably be served;
      (3)   That it is therefore necessary to require installers to design and
construct PSFs having capacity that exceed the need attributable to and
reasonably related to development of a property; and
      (4)   That the cost of PSF should be fairly and equitably distributed
among those properties that will ultimately use the facilities, so that the
incremental costs to size and design properly such facilities do not prevent
the installation of proper PSF consistent with the policies, findings and
purposes stated in this section.
   (C)   The purpose of this subchapter is to require that PSF have adequate
capacity and are configured to handle the sewage flow from the property that
could reasonably be served by the facilities, and to provide for fair and
equitable distribution of the costs of such facilities through a reimbursement
program to the District. The rules and procedures for establishment of
reimbursements, and the collection and disbursement of reimbursement funds are
governed by this subchapter and §§
32.040 through
32.052 and
32.999.
   (D)   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   INSTALLER. A property owner or developer that is financially
responsible for installation of PSF, the capacity of which exceeds the need
attributable to and reasonably related to development of his or her property.
      (2)   PUBLIC SEWAGE FACILITY. Public main, local street and collector
sewers, public trunk sewers, interceptor sewers, pumping stations, that require
ordinary, special and/or unconventional installation techniques and/or
appurtenances, such as manholes and rodding inlets, tunnels, creek or channel
crossings requiring bridges, trestles, culverts and/or channel modifications.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.018 ELIGIBILITY TO ESTABLISH REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNTS.
   (A)   The installer of a PSF may apply to establish a reimbursement account
for the facility by making the post-construction submittals set out in this
subchapter. Alternatively, the installer may apply for early reimbursement to a
reimbursement account by completing all of the pre-construction submittals set
out in this subchapter, including, without limitation, estimates of the costs
of engineering, right-of-way, construction, completion bonds and labor and
materials bonds acceptable to the General Manager. In the case of such early
establishment, the installer shall also complete post-construction submittal of
contracts and receipts set out in this subchapter documenting to the
satisfaction of the General Manager the actual costs of engineering, right-of-
way, construction and bonds for the PSF required by this subchapter, no later
than six months after the District’s acceptance of a PSF, to remain eligible to
receive reimbursements under this subchapter.
   (B)   (1)   The General Manager will determine whether establishing a
reimbursement account is justified by evaluating submittals from the installer.
If the General Manager determines that properties other than those owned or to
be developed by the installer could reasonably be physically connected directly
to or reasonably served by the PSF, the installer shall be eligible to
establish a reimbursement account.
      (2)   In addition, the installer of a PSF shall be eligible to establish
a reimbursement account prior to construction when properties that could
reasonably be served by the PSF in the future receive interim service through
use of temporary facilities.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.019 INSTALLER SUBMITTALS.
   (A)   Pre-construction submittals. To provide for evaluation and approval of
reimbursements for a PSF prior to construction, the installer shall submit all
of the following to the General Manager:
      (1)   Reimbursement account application;
      (2)   Appropriate account setup fees;
      (3)   An engineer’s report providing the analysis used to determine
proposed reimbursement fees;
      (4)   A scale map delineating the PSF, as well as a list of all parcels
that could reasonably be served by the PSF, including each owner’s name,
address, county assessor parcel number and current zoning;
      (5)   A statement disclosing any agreements regarding the sharing of the
PSF costs that exist between the installer and any other party or parties; and
      (6)   (a)   Estimates satisfactory to the General Manager of the costs of
engineering, right-of-way, construction and bonds for the PSF.
         (b)   A copy of the agreement with the engineering firm providing
construction management and inspection services that is acceptable to the
General Manager for inspection services to be conducted during construction of
the PSF.
   (B)   Post-construction submittals. No later than six months after the
District’s acceptance of a PSF, the installer shall submit all of the following
to the General Manager:
      (1)   A copy of approved job plans;
      (2)   Reimbursement account application;
      (3)   Appropriate account setup fees;
      (4)   A statement disclosing any agreements regarding the sharing of the
standard facility costs which exist between the installer and any other party
or parties;
      (5)   Contracts and receipts documenting, to the satisfaction of the
General Manager, the actual costs of engineering, right-of-way, construction
and bonds for the PSF;
      (6)   Copies of the maps, parcel lists and statement regarding existing
agreements for the sharing of the PSF submitted pursuant to preconstruction
submittal requirements, updated to show any changes;
      (7)   Copies of the construction inspection report and construction as-
built plans demonstrating that the PSF was constructed in accordance with the
approved plans and specifications; and
      (8)   Additional information requested by the General Manager required to
satisfy requirements of this subchapter.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.020 REIMBURSEMENT FEES AND AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   All reimbursements for installers, pursuant to this subchapter,
shall be set forth in a written agreement between the installer and the
District. Such agreements shall be signed by the installer at or about the time
of the creation of a reimbursement account. Reimbursement fees will be
calculated by dividing the sum of all allowable costs of the PSF by the total
number of connections or residential unit equivalents that could reasonably be
physically connected directly to the PSF or could reasonably be served by the
PSF.
      (2)   Reimbursement fees will be determined based on consideration of the
following:
         (a)   Costs that are allowable to include in the calculation of
reimbursement fees are those which are directly related to the planning, design
and construction of the PSF, including payments to contractors and engineers,
security bonds and acquiring right-of-way for the project. Ineligible costs
include, but are not limited to, attorneys’ fees, financing costs and the
installer’s overhead and office expenses related to the coordination and
supervision of contractors engaged to perform project work; and
         (b)   The total number of connections or residential unit equivalents
that could reasonably be physically connected directly to the PSF or could
reasonably be served by the PSF will be determined considering zoning
regulations of the agency having jurisdiction for determining land use policy
in the area to be served, the configuration of the District’s existing sewage
facilities, the character of development adjacent to the reimbursement area and
site topography.
   (B)   The Board of Directors recognizes that the above listed factors may
not be the only basis for determining reimbursement fees in every case, and,
therefore, authorizes the General Manager to exercise his or her judgment in
determining the actual reimbursement fee that applies when, in his or her
opinion, modifications are justified.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.021 ADOPTION OF REIMBURSEMENT FEES BY ORDINANCE.
   The District Board of Directors shall adopt reimbursement fees for
individual PSF, from time to time, by ordinance, upon a 60% or 80% vote, after
having conducted a properly noticed public hearing, at which oral or written
presentations can be made, as part of a regularly scheduled meeting.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.022 NOTICE TO AFFECTED PROPERTY OWNERS.
   (A)   At least 14 days prior to the public hearing to receive comments
regarding the adoption of reimbursement fees, the District shall notify:
      (1)   Anyone filing a request for notice; and
      (2)   The property owner or owners of record of the properties to which
such reimbursement fees will be applicable, as identified on the last equalized
assessment roll, by U.S. mail of the time and place of the public hearing.
   (B)   The notice shall include a general description of the District’s
reimbursement fee program, a description of the PSF installed or to be
installed which give rise to the particular reimbursement fee proposed and the
initial amount of the proposed fee. At least ten days prior to the public
hearing, the District shall make available to the public the cost, or estimated
cost, required to provide the service for which the fees are charged and all
revenue sources anticipated to provide the service, including the General Fund.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.023 EFFECTIVE DATE OF REIMBURSEMENT FEES.
   The reimbursement fees for a particular PSF shall become effective as
provided in the ordinance adopting the fees.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.024 COLLECTION OF REIMBURSEMENT FEE DEPOSITS.
   (A)   To ensure that all property owners pay their fair and equitable share
of the cost of PSFs, the General Manager may establish reimbursement fee
deposit accounts, determine reimbursement fee deposit amounts and collect such
reimbursement fee deposits from property owners that apply to connect their
property directly to a PSF, prior to adoption of a reimbursement fee for the
PSF.
   (B)   The amount of the reimbursement fee deposit shall be determined by the
General Manager by the method at §
31.021, substituting estimates of the costs of engineering, right-of-way,
construction and bonds for the PSF in place of the actual costs therefor, when
the reimbursement fee applicable to the PSF is adopted by the Board of
Directors, the reimbursement fee deposit shall be used to pay the reimbursement
fee applicable to the property. Any portion of the deposit, including interest
calculated in accordance with Cal. Gov’t Code, § 53079, remaining after payment
of the applicable reimbursement fee shall be returned to the property owner. If
the applicable reimbursement fee exceeds the deposit, the property owner shall
be invoiced by U.S. mail for the difference, and shall pay such amount to the
District within 60 days of receipt of such invoice. If no applicable
reimbursement fee is adopted within one year of the date of the district’s
acceptance of the PSF, the deposit, including interest calculated in accordance
with Cal. Gov’t Code, § 53079, shall be returned to the property owner.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.025 ADMINISTRATION CHARGES.
   The Board may, from time to time, adopt reimbursement program administration
charges payable to District, including, but not limited to, personnel and other
charges for the creation of reimbursement accounts and transaction fees and
other fees for tasks related to this subchapter.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.026 APPORTIONMENT OF REIMBURSEMENT FUNDS WHEN MORE THAN ONE INSTALLER.
   Where there is more than one installer of a PSF, reimbursement funds
collected shall be disbursed as set forth in the agreement between the
installer and the District.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.027 FUNDS AND ACCOUNTS.
   (A)   Funds collected by the District under this subchapter shall be placed
in segregated accounts for each project for which reimbursement fees or
deposits are established. When funds are collected, the District shall send a
written notice to the installer’s last known address. The District shall
disburse funds only upon written request of the installer.
   (B)   Regardless of whether funds are collected, the District will annually
review such account and send an account statement to the last known address of
the installer. If a request or claim for disbursement of funds is not received
from the installer within three years, after reasonable efforts by the District
to provide notice of the existence of such funds, the funds shall become the
property of the District in accordance with general law. The District will
close the reimbursement account and deposit said funds in the District’s Sewer
Construction Fund. Said notice and deposit dissolves any and all claims the
installer may have had to the reimbursement funds, and the District’s
collection of reimbursement fees for the PSF shall cease.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.028 ADJUSTMENT OF REIMBURSEMENT FEES.
   (A)   If, at any time, the General Manager determines that the allowable
costs or the total number of connections or residential unit equivalents which
could reasonably be physically connected or reasonably served by a PSF the
determinations used in calculating the reimbursement fees deviate from
determinations/calculations regarding amount of fees in place, the General
Manager may recalculate the reimbursement fees to be collected from future
connectors. If reimbursement fees are recalculated, future connectors may pay a
reimbursement fee different from that paid by earlier connectors. In the case
of such recalculation, the District will not be responsible for collecting
additional reimbursement fees from or refunding excess reimbursement fees to
previous connectors.
   (B)   The General Manager shall review reimbursement fees, from time to
time, by considering the increase or decrease in the value of a PSF over time.
The Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index shall be the basis for any
adjustment and no other interest component will be considered.
   (C)   District shall also apply a straight-line depreciation adjustment for
depreciation based on the useful life of a PSF. The useful life of standard or
special facilities for purposes of this adjustment shall be 75 years for sewers
and 40 years for pumping stations.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.029 TIMING FOR PAYMENT OF REIMBURSEMENT FEES AND DEPOSITS.
   Payment of applicable reimbursement fees and deposits shall be made prior to
the time of the District’s issuance of a contractor’s or homeowner’s permit to
connect to a public sewer.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.030 EXPIRATION OF REIMBURSEMENT FEES.
   Each reimbursement fee adopted pursuant to this subchapter shall
automatically expire on the twentieth anniversary of the date of the District’s
acceptance of the PSF for which the reimbursement fee was established. The
District’s collection of reimbursement fees shall cease on the expiration date.
Any funds remaining in an account as of the fee’s expiration shall be processed
pursuant to §
31.027, and the reimbursement account shall be closed.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.031 DISTRICT NOT LIABLE.

§ 31.032 EFFECT OF THIS SUBCHAPTER.
   This subchapter, or any action taken pursuant hereto, does not create any
right, title or interest in real or personal property. The Board may change or
repeal any portion of this subchapter at any time. No property right becomes
vested by operation of this subchapter and the District is not liable for
damage of any kind related to any change or repeal of any portion of this
subchapter.

fees are being imposed and collected for a particular project, and for a period
following as may be required by law.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
§ 31.034 CUSTOMER REIMBURSEMENT OF DISTRICT INSTALLATION COSTS.
   (A)   In certain cases, the public interest and public safety may require
the District itself to design and construct a PSF for an existing or proposed
development. In order to comply with applicable law concerning use of District
revenues, the District shall adopt a reimbursement fee structure to provide for
full reimbursement of any and all costs associated with installation of local
street sewers.
   (B)   Reimbursement fees to reimburse the District for other PSFs may also
be imposed. Reimbursement fees for District costs shall be calculated in the
same or similar manner set forth in this subchapter for installers in order to
provide for full recapture of strict costs. Such costs shall be placed in
reimbursement accounts, pursuant to the same provisions required for
installers.
(Ord. 2021-01, passed 3-25-2021)
CONNECTION FEES
§ 31.045 SEWER CONNECTION FEES.
   (A)   Pursuant to the provisions of the Cal. Health and Safety Code, § 5474,
there is hereby established and levied upon all persons, firms or corporations
making connection to a public sewer in the District, or a sewer flowing into a
public sewer in the District a sewer connection fee, the exact sum of which
shall be determined annually, or more frequently if this Board of Directors
deems it appropriate, pursuant to the following formula:
 
Formula:
C=(A/F) x D x R
 
 
Where:
C = Connection fee per equivalent residential unit
A = Total current local share value of all District assets (not including
collection system pump stations and pipelines)
F = District’s share (i.e., 2/3) of authorized flows (gpd)
D = Average daily flow per capita (gpd)
R = Capita per residential unit
 
   (B)   (1)   The connection fee prescribed herein shall be waived for those
subordinate residential units receiving permits pursuant to the City of Carmel-
by-the-Sea Ordinance 91-14 § 17.24.130.
      (2)   Nothing herein shall be construed to be a waiver of any other fee
due the District, including, but not limited to, sewer user fee and any other
fee authorized by law or District ordinance or to be a waiver of sewer
connection fees for any other party making a connection to a public sewer in
the District, or a sewer flowing into the District.
   (C)   The sewer connection fees are $5,293.30 per equivalent residential
unit or per acre of vacant land, commencing July 1, 2025 and continuing until
revised by further action of the Board.

§ 31.046 COMPUTATION OF FLOW AND UNITS.
   (A)   The General Manager shall, from time to time, make a determination as
to:
      (1)   The current value of District assets;
      (2)   The average daily flow per capita; and
      (3)   The capita per residential unit, based upon information available
to him or her (e.g., the present information from the wastewater treatment
facility design criteria and the County Planning Department, which would now
indicate that the average daily flow per capita is 100 gpd, that the average
number of persons per residential unit is 2.35 and that, therefore, the average
daily flow per residential unit is 235).
   (B)   Equivalent residential units, as the basic unit for determining the
applicable connection fee, shall be as follows:
Use or Type of Improvement Equivalent Residential Unit
Use or Type of Improvement               Equivalent Residential Unit
All other uses                           1 unit per each 24 fixture units
                                         (Uniform Plumbing Code)*
Cocktail lounge or bar                   1 unit per each 30 seats*
Guest house (without kitchen or kitchen  0.4
facilities)
Hotel, motel or rental unit with kitchen 0.5
facilities
Hotel, motel or rental unit without      0.4
kitchen facilities
Restaurants and other eating             1 unit per each 20 seats*
establishments
Single-family residence, apartment,
townhouse or condominium unit, or other  1.0
dwelling unit, as defined by the Uniform
Building Code
Theater and meeting rooms                1 unit per each 50 seats*
*(Note: Above the initial unit, the fee shall be determined proportionately.)
 
   (C)   Whenever, in the opinion of the District Manager, the application of
the above-described method of determining sewer connection fees are grossly
unreasonable or inappropriate, he or she may calculate an appropriate sewer
connection fee, taking into account the anticipated wastewater flow and
strength characteristics for the structure in question.
(Ord. 1985-02, passed 6-20-1985)
§ 31.047 SPECIAL ASSET FEE.
   In addition to the above fee or charge for the privilege of connecting to
the District’s sewerage facilities, whenever a person, firm or corporation
connects to or conveys sewage through a designated special asset of the
District, paid for by or specially serving only a limited or designated area
within the District boundaries, then a special asset fee, multiplied by the
number of equivalent residential units being connected, shall also be charged
as part of the sewer connection fee, as follows:
 
Special Asset            Fee
Carmel Valley trunk line $450
Carmel Views trunk line  Varies per Resolution 796
 
(Ord. 1985-02, passed 6-20-1985)
§ 31.048 CREDIT FOR ANNEXATION FEES.
   Credit shall be allowed on the foregoing connection (including the special
asset fee) fees for the sum of any equivalent (i.e., relating to the same
items) annexation fee payments previously made to the District at the time the
property in question was annexed to the District, as provided in §§
31.060 through
31.063.
(Ord. 1985-02, passed 6-20-1985)
§ 31.049 CONNECTION CREDITS.
   (A)   Credits.
      (1)   Upon written application by the property owner and verification by
the District, credit will be issued to properties where the sewage burden is
reduced and said credit will be applied at a future date in the event of an
increase in the burden. The credit will be a dollar value based upon the
reduction in fixture units or other basis (e.g., seats in the case of
restaurants), translated to an equivalent residential unit (ERU) value and then
applying the ERU sewer connection fee rate in effect at the time the credit is
issued. The reduction in fixture units or other basis and calculation of the
ERU shall be in accordance with §
31.046(B).
      (2)   Credits may be used at any time; however, as with annexation
credits, applicants must pay the difference between the credited amount and the
prevailing connection fee at the time of reconnection.
      (3)   Credits are applied to properties, identified by the Assessor’s
Parcel Number (APN), as assigned by the County Assessor’s office. The credit
remains with the property and is not issued to individuals or corporations.
   (B)   Transfer of credits.
      (1)   Upon written application by a property owner, credits may be
transferred to another property under the same ownership as the parcel with a
credit. Proof of ownership to the satisfaction of the General Manager shall be
required.
      (2)   Credits may be transferred only between commercial or industrial
connections. Transfers between residential connections are not permitted.
   (C)   Fees. The issuance of a credit or a transfer of a credit shall each be
processed as plumbing permit and shall each be assessed such a fee.

ANNEXATION FEES
§ 31.060 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION.
   The Board of Directors does hereby find and determine the following.
   (A)   Through user fees and connection charges, users of the District
wastewater collection and treatment system have made and will continue to make
substantial investment in capital facilities of the District, and, upon future
annexations of territory to the District, an amount should be paid to equalize
the territory to be annexed with that which is already within the District.
   (B)   It is therefore necessary and proper to impose a fee upon territory or
properties which are sought to be annexed to the District in order to equalize
the financial burden and spread the capital investment in the District’s
facilities over all the area and users that will benefit from the same.
(Ord. 1985-02, passed 6-20-1985)
§ 31.061 ANNEXATION FEES.
   For any territory or properties sought to be annexed to the District, an
annexation fee shall be imposed and paid, or satisfactory arrangements made for
payment of same, prior to said annexation, with the fee for any given
annexation to be determined and comprised as follows.
   (A)   Connection fee component.
      (1)   For unimproved land annexed to the District, there shall be a
charge equal to the then-current District connection fee, as provided
hereinabove in this chapter, determined at the rate of equivalent residential
unit for each acre or portion thereof of unimproved land sought to be annexed.
      (2)   For improved land annexed to the District, the charge will be the
same as the then- current connection fee for each type of improvement which is
annexed, including any applicable special asset fee.
   (B)   Administration and processing costs. In addition to the foregoing, the
annexation fee, as required herein, shall also include all administration and
processing costs, including legal fees, of the District, as may be established
from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. The property owner
seeking annexation shall also be responsible for all fees and charges due to
other public agencies in connection with the annexation proceedings, including
those of the Local Agency Formation Commission and the State Board of
Equalization.
   (C)   Revised annexation fee. Whenever, in the opinion of the District
Manager, the application of the above-described method of determining
annexation fees is grossly unreasonable or inappropriate, he or she may
calculate a proposed revised annexation fee and submit it to the Board of
Directors for its review and approval.
   (D)   Connection and annexation fees. Based upon the revised information now
presented to it, that the District’s sewer connection and annexation fees are
hereby specified by resolution from time to time.

§ 31.063 FINDINGS.
   The Board of Directors does hereby find, as follows.
   (A)   The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea has, by its Ordinance 91-14, defined
SUBORDINATE RESIDENTIAL UNITS and enacted a procedure whereby existing units
could receive a permit during a specified period.
   (B)   The purpose of Ordinance 91-14 is to permit a limited number of
subordinate residential units as a source of affordable housing.
   (C)   After extensive discussion at its May and June1992 meetings, this
purpose is one which this Board of Directors should support.
   (D)   This Board of Directors is authorized by existing law to waive its
connection fees when the circumstances warrant.
   (E)   This Board of Directors is not authorized, due to state grant
conditions, to waive its user fees.

be easily removed for maintenance of the sanitary sewer system may be allowed
at the discretion of the District and shall be removed at the owner’s expense
when notified, in writing, by the District.
            2.   No trees may be planted in a public sanitary sewer easement
without first obtaining approval of the District. Trees may be allowed to the
extent that damage to the sanitary sewer does not occur from root intrusion and
adequate access can be provided for maintenance and repair vehicles. Any repair
work by the District requiring the removal of trees or other vegetation planted
by the owner or by prior property owners shall be at the expense of the present
owner.
   (E)   Quitclaim requirements. When a sanitary sewer easement is to be
quitclaimed, a quitclaim deed shall be prepared and submitted to the District.
After the document is reviewed by the District and accepted by the District
Board of Directors, it will be recorded by the District at the County Recorder.
   (F)   Field changes. Two sets of plans and one digital copy in accordance
with §
33.080 showing field changes proposed must be submitted to the District for
approval prior to the work being started.

   (A)   Construction staking. All main sewers and laterals shall be staked in
the field in accordance with the requirements of the CAWD. The grades and
alignment of the sewer staked shall be approved by the Engineer prior to start
of sewer construction. (See §§
33.041 and
33.332.)
   (B)   Allowable deviation of alignment and grade. The horizontal deviation
of the sewer from the line shown on the plans shall be not more than three
inches. The sewer grade shall not deviate from the profile shown on the plans,
and the grade shall be maintained during and after backfilling operations.
Sewer grades with deviations exceeding one-half inch shall be removed and
replaced at the contractor’s expense. If deviations less than one-half inch
from the design grade occur, pipe joints may be deflected to bring the invert
back to grade. Grade corrections shall be made gradually to prevent sags in the
pipe invert at low spots. Pipe shall be installed to be free draining (no sags)
between any two points. No reverse (adverse) grade will be allowed.
   (C)   Lasers.
      (1)   When laying main sewers, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer,
the contractor shall use a commercial laser grade setting system.
      (2)   The following requirements and conditions must be met:
         (a)   The contractor shall have the responsibility of providing an
instrument operator who is qualified and trained in the operation of the laser
and said operator shall adhere to the provisions of the State Construction
Safety Orders, issued by the Division of Industrial Safety. Attention is
particularly directed to §§ 1514, 1800 and 1801 of said orders for applicable
requirements.
         (b)   The laser shall be connected firmly to a tripod, set firmly on
compacted soil. The laser height of instrument shall be taken from one offset

consistent readings or until readings coincide. This shall be done every time
the laser is set up or disturbed.
         (c)   The laser and level instruments shall be properly calibrated
within six months prior to use. A laser or level instrument found to be out of
calibration, or without records showing it has been calibrated within the last
six months, shall be removed from the job site until it has been properly
calibrated.
   (D)   Grade line.
      (1)   When laying pipe for laterals, in lieu of a laser grade setting
system, the contractor may use a grade line. When laying the pipe, except where
vertical curves are shown on the plans or otherwise authorized by the Engineer,
the contractor shall use a grade line with at least two adjacent runs in place
at all times in order to detect any variation from a straight grade.
      (2)   The grade line must be established over the center of the trench in
vertical trenches and over the center of the pipe in V-type trenches during the
laying operations and grade line shall be maintained until the pipe grade is
checked by the Engineer.
      (3)   The grade line shall be accurately and securely fastened at each
staked station to securely erected batter boards and be kept taut at all times.
      (4)   The measuring pole shall be a solidly constructed straight pole
with a metal foot at one end at right angles to the pole. The batter board
construction, string line and measuring pole construction shall be approved by
the Engineer prior to start of sewer pipe laying.

practicable, and when so authorized by the Engineer, the pipe must be checked
by surveying instruments under the direction of a registered civil engineer or
land surveyor who shall accept the responsibility for the pipe being installed
on the proper grade.
   (E)   Sewer pipe plugs. Sewer pipe stubs, or other open ends, which are not
to be connected immediately, shall be plugged or capped with standard
watertight plug or cap as approved by the Engineer for use in the particular
installation. The plugs or caps may only be removed when so authorized by, and
in the presence of, the Engineer.
   (F)   Joint deflections and minimum radius. When approved by the Engineer,
curved sewers shall be in conformance with the following requirements.
      (1)   Rigid pipe: no deflection of rigid pipe will be allowed.
      (2)   Flexible pipe: horizontal curves shall be achieved only with
approval of the District Engineer and with the use of fused pipe. The minimum
allowable bending radius is shown in the following table, which follows the
equation radius equals 300 multiplied by pipe diameter. Smaller radii may be
approved by the Engineer.

be uncovered and checked for location and elevation prior to submitting cut
sheets. Discrepancy between the plans and field information shall be reported
immediately to the Engineer.
   (H)   Commencement of new sewer pipe line. Unless otherwise authorized by
the Engineer, the laying of the pipe in finished trenches shall be commenced at
the lowest point of the project, with the spigot ends abutting and pointing in
the direction of the flow. The joints shall be carefully centered so that when
laid to proper grade and alignment, as designated on the plans, they will form
a sewer with a uniform invert.
   (I)   Sewer pipe line through manholes. Sewers shall be laid continuously
through proposed manhole locations on all straight runs and at angle points. A
minimum drop of 0.1 feet is required for mains of the same size. When mains on
the upstream and downstream connections to the manhole are different size
pipes, the upstream and downstream pipe crowns should be at the same elevation.
When excavation is made below the pipe for manhole construction, care must be
taken that the pipe spanning this area is firmly supported.
   (J)   Flexible couplings at manholes. For all pipes, a flexible pipe
coupling, such as Gripper Gasket Max Adapter coupling, shall be installed at a
point one to three feet outside of the manhole base block on both upstream and
downstream sides. In all cases, the flexibility of the coupling must be
maintained by keeping all concrete away from the joint or coupling. A bell
joint is not acceptable for this requirement.
   (K)   Placement of fill/grading. Grading of fill in order to change the
grade of a parcel shall be placed up to three feet above where the outside of
the pipe would be and laterally to a width of the pipe outside diameter plus
six feet centered on where the pipe would be and compacted prior to trenching
for sewer lines. The compaction requirements, as specified by the agency
governing the fill, shall be considered adequate, except that not less than 90%
relative compaction per ASTM D-1557 “Modified Proctor” shall be achieved.

joined shall be cleaned, dried, primed or otherwise prepared as called for in
these specifications. The interior of all pipe shall be kept free from all dirt
and foreign matter as the work progresses.
      (2)   At the close of each day’s work, and at such other times when the
pipe is not being laid, the ends of all open pipes shall be closed with a
watertight plug or cap. Any modification of this requirement must be approved
by the Engineer.   (M)   Field cutting pipe. Unless otherwise permitted by the
Engineer, pipes that must be cut in the field shall be cut with mechanical
cutters or as recommended by the pipe manufacturer.
(Ord. 2019-02, passed 4-25-2019)
§ 33.151 SPLICE.
   (A)   When a pipe is to be spliced into an existing sewer, the existing
sewer shall be exposed and then mechanically cut at right angles to the pipe
barrel, with sufficient length removed so that a pipe section with plain ends
can be joined to the cut pipe with approved couplings to form an airtight
joint. All work shall be done in the presence of the Engineer. Care must be
taken to fill all voids under and around the pipe splice with Type “B” to
properly support the new pipe and prevent any settlement of the spliced
section.
   (B)   The point of connection of the new pipe to the existing sewer shall be
plugged to ensure that no materials from the construction activities involved
in the installation of the new sewer enters the existing system.

specific location being proposed for installation. The contractor is completely
responsible for all elements of the pipe-bursting installation, including
safety of installation, conflicts or damage to utilities, property
improvements, sidewalks, driveways, curbs, gutters, pavement and equipment, or
installation problems caused by existing private sewer pipe materials,
subsurface conditions or access restrictions.
   (B)   Description. Pipe-bursting rehabilitation consists of splitting and
expanding the existing pipe and simultaneously pulling, or pushing, a new high-
density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe into the resulting void. The method requires
the excavation of two pits. The insertion pit shall be used to insert the pipe
splitting device followed by the new pipe. The exit pit shall be used to
receive the splitting device and new pipe through the existing private sewer.
After insertion, a cleanout to grade shall be installed at the property line,
and the new pipe shall be connected to the existing pipe.   (C)   Submittals.
Minimum pipe-bursting experience requirements include as follows:
      (1)   The contractor shall have completed a minimum of two pipe-bursting
projects within the last two years. Submit short project descriptions and
references (name and phone numbers of property owners or construction
inspectors) for two projects;
      (2)   A letter signed by the property owner authorizing the installation
of the private sewer using the pipe-bursting method. The letter must also
acknowledge that the pipe-bursting procedure and limitations have been
explained to the property owner by the contractor; and
      (3)   The contractor shall inspect the private sewer using a CCTV camera
and provide a DVD-format video and inspection report for each private sewer.
The video shall show the footage of the camera and shall include the complete
length of the private sewer to be replaced. Prior to television inspection, the
existing pipe must be clean of all debris, and must be wet so that sags can be
easily detected. The television inspection shall be completed in the presence
of the District representative. If approved by the Engineer, the television
inspection may be completed without a District representative if the inspection
video adequately documents the location of the work.
   (D)   Post-rehabilitation television inspection. The television inspection
shall be completed in the presence of the District representative. If approved
by Engineer, the television inspection may be completed without a District
representative if the inspection video adequately documents the location of the
work.

§ 33.159 EQUIPMENT.
   The pipe-bursting equipment may be either hydraulic, pneumatic or the cone
cracking type. The bursting head shall be designed to force its way through the
existing pipe materials by fragmenting the pipe and compressing the old pipe
section into the surrounding soil as it progresses. The head shall be designed
to produce a maximum opening dimension of one inch (diameter) larger than the
outside diameter of the new HOPE pipe. The pipe-bursting system shall be used
to replace the existing private sewer with the same nominal size pipe. The
system shall not be used to increase the size of the private sewer.
   (A)   Pipe. The HOPE pipe shall be as specified in §
33.116.
   (B)   Utilities. At least 48 hours prior to excavation, the contractor shall
call Underground Services Alert (USA) at 811. The contractor shall request
utility markings for the entire reach of the proposed pipe burst. The
contractor shall pothole all utilities crossing the proposed pipe burst to
determine the clear distance between each utility and the existing private
sewer. Utilities with less than 12 inches of clearance or water mains and
services with less than 24 inches of clearance shall be left exposed during the
pipe-bursting installation.
   (C)   Installation. After coordinating with the property owner and
residents, the contractor shall plug the existing private sewer or provide by-
pass pumping system to prevent sewage spills. Dumping or free flow of sewage
within the excavation or on public or private property, gutters, streets and
storm drain facilities is prohibited.
      (1)   The insertion pit shall be large enough so that HOPE pipe can be
installed without exceeding the minimum bending radius. The minimum bending
radius shall be 20 times the outside diameter of the pipe or as recommended by
the pipe manufacturer, whichever value is larger.
      (2)   After installation, the contractor shall allow a minimum of four
hours for relaxation due to tensile stressing and to allow the pipe to
thermally acclimate with the soil prior to installing final connections to main
sewer or private sewer. Temporary connections can be installed sooner to
reinstate sewage flows.
      (3)   Any installed pipe which has cuts or abrasions in the pipe wall
exceeding 10% of the wall thickness shall be cut out and removed from the site.
      (4)   After final cleaning of the private sewer, water shall be
introduced into the new pipe section and the post-rehabilitation television
inspection shall be completed. The video shall be submitted to the District for
approval.
   (D)   Connections. A cleanout to grade, including box and cover, shall be

§ 33.160 REHABILITATION OF PRIVATE SEWERS USING CURED IN PLACE PIPE (CIPP)
LINING.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The CIPP process will renovate an existing pipeline from the inside
by the installation of an interior pipe that fits tightly to the inside of the
existing pipe. The process will be accomplished through the use of existing
access, such as maintenance holes or other existing openings, and is to be done
with minimal excavation. The new interior pipe, called a CIPP liner, is
provided in sufficient thickness to address the deterioration situation of the
existing pipeline. Typical thickness ranges from 4.5mm to 50mm depending on the
size, condition and depth of the existing pipe. Liner thickness shall be
submitted to the Engineer for review and approval based on the project-specific
situation.
      (2)   Restoration of existing sanitary sewers by installation of a resin
impregnated flexible felt tube into the existing sewer line utilizing a
vertical inversion standpipe and hydrostatic head and curing by circulating hot
water or steam/air mixture to produce a hard, impermeable pipe during the cure
process.
      (3)   The finished pipe liner in place shall be fabricated from materials
which, when complete, are chemically resistant to, and will withstand internal
exposure to, domestic sewage having a pH range of 6 to 9 and temperatures up to
150°F.
   (B)   Description. CIPP rehabilitation consists of inserting CIPP liner into
the existing pipe in a soft, flexible and expandable configuration containing
thermosetting resin in a viscous liquid state. A resin absorbent carrier tube
called a felt bag will be used to carry, properly position and uniformly
distribute the liquid resin within the existing pipe. Upon final positioning
and expanding of the carrier tube against the inside surface of the existing
pipe, the resin will be transformed to a solid state by a thermosetting
process. The thermoset process will be initiated by applying heat to the resin
that was previously catalyzed before its absorption into the carrier tube. The
methods used to introduce the required heat will be by internally circulating
heated water or by a flow through of steam/air mixture.
      (1)   The process of absorbing the catalyzed resin into the carrier tube
is called resin impregnation or wet-out of the carrier tube. The process of
installing the resin impregnated liner tube into the existing pipe is called
inversion or pull-in, depending on the specific insertion method used and type
of carrier tube. The process to make the liquid resin in the carrier tube
transform to a solid by the thermostatic reaction is called curing.
      (2)   Following the cure of the CIPP liner, the closed ends of the liner
at manholes or other accesses will be removed and the pipeline made available
for flow. Incoming connections, such as service laterals, will be reinstated
into the pipeline by cutting corresponding openings in the cured CIPP liner.
For non-human entry sized pipeline, CCTV monitored robot cutters will be used.
For all other pipe, reinstatement may be done by human entry.
      (3)   The CIPP lining installation process will include the cleaning and
preparation of the existing pipeline to a suitable state, and the provision of
flow bypass when necessary. The CIPP rehabilitation is completed with CCTV
inspection of the finished liner.
   (C)   Submittals. The following shall be submitted by the contractor to the
District:
      (1)   The contractor shall have completed a minimum of 50,000 feet in
wastewater collection systems construction within five years of the project
bid. Contractor shall submit short project descriptions and references (name
and phone numbers of property owners or construction inspectors) for five
projects;
      (2)   Shop drawings, catalog data and manufacturer’s technical data
showing complete information on material composition, physical properties and

for system proposed.
   (D)   Materials. The materials for CIPP shall be as specified in §
33.116.
   (E)   Installation. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to
coordinate with the District to locate and designate all manhole access points
open and accessible for the work and provide rights-of-access to these
locations. If a street must be closed to traffic because of the orientation of
the sewer, the contractor shall take all actions necessary to provide access
for the mutually agreed time period. The contractor must coordinate with the
District for access to water hydrants for cleaning, installation and other
process related work items requiring water.
      (1)   Cleaning of sewer lines. The contractor, when required, shall
remove all internal debris out of the sewer line that will interfere with the
installation of CIPP. The contractor shall dispose of all debris removed from
the sewers during the cleaning operation at an acceptable facility.
      (2)   Bypassing sewage. The contractor, when required, shall provide for
the flow of sewage around the section or sections of pipe designated for
repair. Plugging the line at an existing upstream manhole and pumping the flow
into a downstream manhole or adjacent system shall make the bypass. The pump(s)
and bypass line(s) shall be of adequate capacity to accommodate the sewage
flow. The District may require details of the bypass plan to be submitted that
include, at a minimum, 24-hour backup pumping equipment/generator, emergency
contact numbers, qualified personnel to provide continuous supervision of
bypass pumping system, traffic control, surface pipe restrictions and the like,
adequate to accomplish the bypass pumping operation.
      (3)   Inspection of pipelines. Inspection of pipelines shall be performed
by experienced personnel trained in locating breaks, obstacles and service
connections using closed circuit television (CCTV) inspection techniques. The
pipeline interior shall be carefully inspected to determine the location of
conditions that may prevent proper installation of CIPP. These shall be noted
and corrected. A video and suitable written log for each line section shall be
produced for later reference by the District.
      (4)   Line obstructions. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor
to clear the line of obstructions, such as solids and roots, that will prevent
the insertion of CIPP.
      (5)   Public notification.
         (a)   The contractor shall make every effort to maintain sewer service
usage throughout the duration of the project. In the event that a connection
will be out of service, the longest period of no service shall be eight hours.
A public notification program shall be implemented, and shall, as a minimum,
require the contractor to contact each home or business connected to the
sanitary sewer, inform them of the work to be conducted and when the sewer will
be off-line.
         (b)   The contractor shall also provide the following:
            1.   Written notice delivered to each home or business the day
prior to the beginning of work on the section and a local telephone number of
the contractor to discuss the project or any potential problems; and
            2.   Personal contact with any home or business that cannot be
reconnected within the time stated in the written notice.
      (6)   Confirmation of locations. The contractor shall be responsible for
confirming the locations of all branch service connections prior to installing
the CIPP.

conditions of the job site, including safety of all persons and property during
performance of the work. This requirement shall apply continuously, and not be
limited to normal working hours. Safety provisions shall conform to U.S.
Department of Labor (OSHA), the California Occupational Safety and Health Act
(CalOSHA) and all other applicable federal, state, county and local laws,
ordinances, codes, including, but not limited to, the requirements set forth
below, and any regulations that may be detailed in other parts of these
standard specifications. In the event of conflicting requirements, the most
stringent requirement pertinent to the contractor’s safety responsibility shall
be followed by the contractor.
   (C)   The excavation shall be made to enable the sewer to be laid to the
grade and alignment designed on the plans.
(Ord. 2019-02, passed 4-25-2019)
§ 33.176 OPEN TRENCHING.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   The excavation for sewers shall be made by open trenching,
except where tunneling is necessary. Existing pavement shall be saw cut and
replaced in accordance with §§
33.205 through
33.208. The walls of the sewer trench shall be vertical in the region between
the bottom of the trench and the top of the sewer pipe.
         (b)   In this region:
            1.   At least six inches clearance on each side shall be maintained
for sewers eight inches and smaller;
            2.   Nine inches clearance on each side shall be maintained for
sewers less than 18 inches; or
            3.   As approved by the Engineer for sewers 18 inches and larger.
      (2)   A minimum of six-inch and not more than 12-inch clearance shall be
maintained between the outer wall of the pipe barrel and the embankment or
shoring unless otherwise approved by the Engineer.
      (3)   The trench shall be excavated to a level section and to such
elevation as will give a uniform bearing and true flow line elevation when the
sewer pipe is laid. All loose dirt in the bottom of the trench must be removed.
   (B)   (1)   Mud or other soft or spongy material.
         (a)   Where mud or other soft or spongy material incapable of proper
pipe support is encountered, it shall be excavated to a minimum depth of 12
inches below sewer subgrade. Limits of the material to be removed shall be
designated by the Engineer in the field. However, this does not relieve the
contractor of the requirements of these specifications, including, but not
limited to, allowable deviation of alignment and grade.
         (b)   When so directed by the Engineer, the trench shall be extended
below the pipeline grades to permit the placement of ballast for the pipe
foundation. All areas of over excavation, to remove unsuitable material or for
any other reason, shall be brought to grade with approved ballast material and
compacted.
      (2)   Rock. Where rock is encountered, the trench shall be excavated to a
minimum depth of three inches below the sewer subgrade and backfilled to sewer
subgrade with approved import material, thoroughly compacted to grade before
the sewer pipe is laid.
      (3)   Over-excavated areas. Over-excavated areas in the trench bottom
where approved trench foundation material will be placed shall be restored to
sewer subgrade with imported backfill materials, thoroughly compacted before
the sewer pipe is laid.
      (4)   Compaction. In all the above situations, compaction shall be
achieved by mechanical means. Water settling, flooding, jetting and other water
consolidation methods are expressly prohibited.
      (5)   Bracing and shoring. The contractor shall, at all times, furnish,
install and maintain sufficient bracing and shoring in trenches to ensure
safety of the workers and to protect and facilitate the work. When practical,
all such bracing and shoring shall be removed from the trench as the
backfilling proceeds. Whenever an on-site designee of the District warrants
sufficient cause to suspect that an unsafe condition exists or that existing
shoring is inadequate, the District reserves the right to direct all workers
involved to terminate work until the condition is remedied. Any direction given
to a contractor or the employees of such for unsafe conditions shall be at the
sole expense of the contractor. The District will not reimburse expenses
incurred if a District employee issues a stop work command for unsafe
conditions.
      (6)   Blasting. In the event that blasting is necessary in excavation,
special permission, in writing, must be obtained from the agency having
jurisdiction over the issuance of blasting permits before any blasting will be
permitted. Such permission shall in no way relieve the contractor of the
responsibility for obtaining any permits or licenses required by state law or
local ordinance.
      (7)   Sewer subgrade. The sewer subgrade shall be kept dry at all times
and precautions shall be taken that no storm water is allowed to enter the
excavation prior to backfilling. The contractor shall, at all times, have on
the job, sufficient pumping machinery for immediate use. Water shall be
disposed of in accordance with the requirements of the agency having local
jurisdiction, and in such a manner as to cause no damage to public health or
safety, or to public or private property. The contractor shall control surface
runoff to prevent entry or collection of water in excavations.
      (8)   Excavation material. Material excavated within streets and roadways
may only be reused per approval of the city or county. Any such material shall
be laid alongside the trench and kept trimmed up to minimize inconvenience to
public travel.
         (a)   Free access must be provided to all fire hydrants, water gates,
meters and private drives, and means shall be provided so that water can flow
in the gutters uninterruptedly.
         (b)   All materials excavated in streets and roadways not permitted
for backfill shall be immediately removed and properly disposed of at an
approved facility by the contractor. No surplus material shall be dumped on
private property.
      (9)   Open trench permitted.

any one time. In general, the length of trench open at any time shall be
limited to 100 feet in business area; 250 feet or one block (whichever is less)
in residential area; and 1,000 feet in undeveloped areas.
         (b)   No trench shall be allowed to remain open outside of work hours
and/or outside of immediate work area. At the end of a work day, the trench
shall be backfilled or secured with steel plates.
      (10)   Contractor’s responsibility. It shall be the responsibility of the
contractor to conform to all the requirements of all permits obtained from all
agencies, and to make the construction site safe against injury to people and/
or livestock by erection of adequate posted barricades and/or temporary fences.
      (11)   Groundwater. The contractor shall keep excavations free from water
during construction. Groundwater shall be controlled to prevent sloughing or
erosion of trench walls, softening of the bottom of excavations or formation of
“quick” conditions where effective stress is reduced due to upward movement of
flow of water. The static water level shall be drawn down to a sufficient depth
below the bottom of excavations to maintain the undisturbed state of natural
soils and allow the placement of any fill to the specified density. Dewatering
systems shall not remove natural soils.
         (a)   Dewatering and shoring plans should be approved by a licensed
geotechnical engineer, as necessary, to verify subsurface soil and groundwater
conditions and adequate handling of field conditions to facilitate
construction.
         (b)   The contractor shall obtain any and all permits required in
conjunction with the installation and removal of the dewatering system and
shall meet all permit requirements.
         (c)   The contractor shall contact the local drainage authority for
discharge requirements.
         (d)   The contractor shall dispose of water from dewatering operations
so as not to cause injury or damage to adjacent property and shall, at all
times, remain in compliance with the requirements of the local drainage
authority.

TESTING
§ 33.220 TESTING MAIN SEWERS.
   The contractor shall, in the presence and under the direction of the
Engineer, test the airtightness of all main sewer lines. The test will be made
between each adjacent structure and between the most upstream structure and
dead end. The air test will be made only after all other utilities and the curb
and gutter have been installed and before any street base rock has been oiled.
The Engineer shall be present during installation of plugs prior to air
testing.
   (A)   When tested.
      (1)   In areas to be left unpaved, the air test shall be made after the
backfill is satisfactorily compacted.
      (2)   In areas to be paved, per improvement plans, when the outside top
of the sewer is less than three feet below the top of backfill, the air test
shall be made after the “base rock” portion of the paving is satisfactorily
compacted and before any street base rock has been oiled.
      (3)   (a)   In areas to be paved, per improvement plans, when the outside
top of the sewer main is three feet or more below top of backfill, the air test
shall be made after all other utilities and the curb and gutter have been
installed and the “sub-base” material portion of the paving is satisfactorily
compacted.
         (b)   The air test as noted in divisions (A)(1), (A)(2) or (A)(3)
above is considered the “official test”. However, preliminary air testing is
strongly recommended and may be conducted by the contractor at any time prior
to the “official test”.
      (4)   As directed by the Engineer, the contractor shall conduct a
preliminary air test if the Engineer has reason to believe that the
contractor’s means and methods have impacted the condition of the system. The
preliminary test will not be considered the “official test”.
   (B)   Equipment. The contractor shall furnish all necessary equipment for
conducting the test, including, but not limited to, an air compressor, air
hoses, blank plug, liquid-filled test gauge, test plug, stopwatch and
personnel.
   (C)   Air test procedure.
      (1)   Air testing sewer mains, particularly larger diameter mains, can be
very dangerous due to the very large forces developed. The contractor shall be
fully responsible and take all precautions necessary to ensure the safety of
their workers. All plugs shall be adequately braced and restrained to support
the full load developed. No workers shall be allowed in the excavation or
manhole while the line is under pressure. The contractor shall make provisions
for reading the pressure at the ground surface, and for safely releasing the
air pressure without entering the manhole or excavation.
      (2)   The following procedure shall be used for air testing:
         (a)   Prior to testing, clean pipe to be tested by propelling a snug
fitting inflated rubber ball through the pipe with water and remove any debris;
         (b)   Plug all pipe outlets with suitable test plugs. Brace each plug
securely;
         (c)   If the pipe to be tested is submerged in groundwater, insert a
pipe probe by boring or jetting into the backfill material adjacent to the
center of the pipe, and determine the pressure in the probe when air passes
slowly through it. This is the backpressure due to groundwater submergence over
the end of the probe. All gauge pressures in the test shall be increased by
this amount;
         (d)   Add air slowly to the portion of the pipe being tested until the
internal pressure is raised to 4.0 psi greater than the average back pressure
of any groundwater that may submerge the pipe;
         (e)   Check exposed pipe and plugs for abnormal leakage by coating
with a soap solution. If any leakage is observed, bleed off air and make
necessary repairs;
         (f)   After an internal pressure of 4.0 psig is obtained, allow at
least two minutes for air temperature to stabilize, adding only the amount of
air required to maintain pressure;
         (g)   After the two-minute period, disconnect the air supply. When
pressure decreases to 3.5 psig, start stopwatch. Determine the time in seconds
that is required for the internal air pressure to reach 2.5 psig. The minimum
allowable time in seconds shall be based on the diameters and lengths of pipe
under test;
         (h)   The pipeline shall be considered acceptable when the total time
interval for the pressure drop from 3.5 to 2.5 psi meets or exceeds the
calculated test time based on the following table. This table is based on a
rate of 0.0015 cubic feet per minute per square foot of internal pipe surface
when tested per ASTM F-1417. At the inspector’s option, the test may be
conducted for a pressure drop of 3.5 to 3.0 psi and one-half of the time shown;
and
         (I)   If the pipe installation fails to meet these air test
requirements, the contractor shall determine the source or sources of leakage,
and he or she shall repair or replace all defective materials or workmanship in
accordance with these specifications and in the presence of the Engineer. The
completed pipe installation shall meet the requirements of this test.

approved mandrel or deflectometer through the portion of the pipe specified by
the Engineer. This section of pipe will have pipe embedment fully in place and
compacted per these specifications plus at least four feet of backfill in place
with a minimum of 85% relative compaction per ASTM D-1557. This shall be a
preliminary test only to ensure the integrity of the pipe at the time of
installation. The mandrel test for acceptance shall be performed after the air
test as described in division (C) above, but before final paving is installed.
(Ord. 2019-02, passed 4-25-2019)
§ 33.221 TESTING PRIVATE SEWER LATERALS.
   The contractor shall, in the presence and under the direction of the
Engineer, test the airtightness of all private sewer laterals. The test will be
made between the cleanout to grade at the property line, “test-wye” or manhole
and the most upstream dead-end at a point not more than two feet outside the
building line (see division (A)(2) below for exception). Note that actual
connection of the private sewer to the building plumbing will not be permitted
until the main sewer to which it connects has been accepted for use by the
District and the herein described testing has been satisfactorily completed.
Entry into “live” District manholes requires District approval.
   (A)   When tested.

is any facility that prepares or serves food to non-family members. Without
limitation, this includes full-service restaurants, fast food restaurants,
take-out restaurants, recreation facilities, cafeterias for employees, church
kitchens, school cafeterias and grocery store take-out facilities.
      (1)   All restaurants shall be equipped with grease interceptors and/or
grease traps designed to limit the discharge of grease and oil to the
District’s sewer system. The size and type of restaurant shall dictate the size
of the grease trap or grease interceptor required. The minimum sizes specified
are subject to review by the engineer and sized and installed according to
criteria in the current UPC.
      (2)   A plumbing permit shall be obtained from the District prior to the
installation of a grease trap or grease interceptor.
      (3)   A detailed pretreatment ordinance adopted by resolution of the
Board of Directors shall supersede this section.
   (B)   Grease interceptors. All restaurants or food service facilities shall
have an outside grease interceptor located on private property only and be
installed per the requirements of the current edition of the UPC and the
District’s pretreatment ordinance (incorporated in
Chapter 35).
      (1)   Designation as a grease intensive restaurant shall be as determined
by the District Engineer. Grease interceptors shall be two-compartment
interceptors with sampling box as shown in the standard plans and shall be
manufactured by Jensen Precast, or approved equal.
      (2)   All new construction for restaurants shall have grease
interceptors. Grease interceptors are not allowed within the public right-of-
way. If this is found to be unworkable, the owner must apply from the city or,
if outside the city limits, the County Planning Department for an encroachment
within the public right-of-way.
      (3)   Grease interceptors shall be located outside buildings unless a
finding is made by the District Engineer, or authorized representative, that
the location of the building on the site or some other aspect of the use
prevents an outside location and that placement within a building is not
hazardous to public health and safety.
   (C)   Grease traps.
      (1)   The District may also allow the use of a grease trap in lieu of a
grease interceptor in tenant improvement projects where it is not feasible to
install a grease interceptor or food service facilities with limited cooking
that do not contain deep fryers, grills or other cooking equipment. The
District Engineer shall determine if a grease trap shall be allowed. Grease
traps shall be sized and installed per the current edition of the UPC.
      (2)   Grease traps shall have two compartments with an acid resistant
coated interior and an exterior fabricated steel device as shown in the
standard plans. Other mechanical grease traps may be approved by the District
Engineer.
   (D)   Connections.
      (1)   All kitchen area pot sinks, prep sinks (not vegetable prep sinks)
and three-compartment sinks shall be connected to the grease trap or
interceptor. All kitchen mop sinks, floor drains and dishwashers shall be
connected to the interceptor.
      (2)   Toilets, lavatories and other sanitary fixtures shall not be
connected to any grease trap, grease interceptor or comparable device.
      (3)   All discharging fixtures shall be individually trapped and vented
in accordance with the CAWD Plumbing Code (incorporated in
Chapter 36).
   (E)   Dishwashers. Dishwashers shall not be connected to any grease trap but
shall be connected to a grease interceptor which has been sized appropriately
for the service volume.
   (F)   Garbage disposals. The installation and use of garbage grinders (food
waste disposals) in commercial food establishments is prohibited, except where
a grease interceptor is in use.
   (G)   Other requirements. Grease interceptors shall also be required at
commercial trash compactors, trash enclosures and at other commercial and
industrial establishments as deemed necessary by the District.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 35.001 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect
discharges into the wastewater system for District and enables the District to
comply with all applicable state and federal laws required by the Clean Water
Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40
C.F.R. part 403).
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To comply with the laws of the state and of the United States
relating to the protection of the environment, control of water pollution,
disposal of hazardous wastes and pretreatment of industrial discharges to
publicly owned treatment works (POTW);
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of wastes into the District wastewater
system, which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate
the resulting biosolids;
      (3)   To protect the District’s wastewater system and operating
personnel, and to prevent the introduction of wastes into the District
wastewater system which will pass through the system inadequately treated and
into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the
system and to prevent introduction of toxic substances to the District
wastewater system which could reach the environment in toxic amounts;
      (4)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
biosolids from the system and prevent the introduction of waste into the system
which may affect the District’s ability to dispose of its biosolids or other
residuals;
      (5)   To provide the equitable distribution of the costs of the
operation, maintenance and improvements of the District wastewater system;
      (6)   To prevent the introduction of wastes that may be inadequately
treated by District facilities and may adversely affect the environment or may
cause a violation of the District’s national pollutant discharge elimination
systems (NPDES) permit or may contribute to the need for modification of the
District’s NPDES permit;
      (7)   To prevent a public hazard or public nuisance arising from the
collection, treatment and disposal of wastes through the District system; and
      (8)   To prevent the introduction of wastes to sewers connected to the
District system that could result in the District being classified as a
hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facility under the laws of the
state or the United States.
   (C)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
discharges to the wastewater system through the issuance of permits to certain
non-domestic users and through enforcement of general requirements for the
other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user
reporting, assures that existing customer’s capacity will not be preempted and
provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs
resulting from the program established herein.
   (D)   This chapter shall apply to the District and the persons outside the
District who are, by contract or agreement with the District, users of the
District publicly owned treatment works (POTW), except as otherwise provided
herein, the General Manager shall administer, implement and enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Manager shall
administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any duties
granted to or imposed upon the General Manager may be delegated by the General
Manager to a duly authorized employee of the District wastewater system.

REGULATIONS
§ 35.020 PERMISSIBLE DISCHARGES.
   Wastewater may be discharged into public sewers for collection, treatment
and disposal by the District provided that such wastewater discharge is in
compliance with this chapter and the conditions of any industrial wastewater
permit and/or permit contract; and further provided that the user pays all
applicable District sewer fees and charges including any penalties or charges
assessed under this chapter. The District has the authority to deny or
condition new or increased contributions of pollutants, or changes in the
nature of pollutants, to the District by industrial users where such
contributions do not meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements or
where such contributions would cause interference for the District, or cause
the District to violate its NPDES permit, either individually or in combination
with other discharges.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.021 GENERAL DISCHARGE PROHIBITION.
   (A)   No user shall contribute, or cause to be contributed, any pollutant or
wastewater which will pass through the District’s facilities or interfere with
the operation or performance of the POTW. This prohibition includes any type of
pollutant or wastewater as set forth in the prohibition sections of this
chapter. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or
not the user is subject to national pretreatment standards or any other
national, state or District pretreatment standards or requirements.
   (B)   A user shall have an affirmative defense in any enforcement action
brought against it alleging a violation of the general prohibitions, including
a violation of the specifically prohibited effects or characteristics, where
the user can demonstrate:
      (1)   That the user did not know, or have reason to know, that its
discharge, alone or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other
sources, would result in a violation of this chapter, including a prohibited
effect or prohibited characteristic; and
      (2)   The user was in compliance with the existing limits for each
pollutant in its discharge that resulted in a violation, or if there were no
such existing limits, the user’s discharge directly before and during the
violation did not change substantially from the user’s prior discharges which
occurred when the District remained in compliance with its NPDES permit and
with applicable requirements for sewage biosolids use or disposal.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.022 PROHIBITED EFFECTS.
   (A)   A user may not discharge, or cause to be discharged, wastewater into
the POTW if it contains substances or has characteristics which, either alone
or by interaction with other wastewater, cause or threaten to cause:

ADMINISTRATION
§ 35.050 WASTEWATER DISCHARGES.
   It shall be unlawful to discharge without a District permit or permit
contract to the POTW any wastewater, except as is authorized by the provisions
of this chapter.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.051 RESPONSIBILITY OF USER.
   (A)   It shall be the responsibility of the user and/or discharger to comply
with all of the provisions of this chapter. The omission to act by the District
and/or the failure of the District to take observation of the nature of the
operation of the user and/or the properties of the user’s wastewater shall not
relieve the user of responsibility to comply with the conditions of this
chapter, including, but not limited to, such requirements regarding permitting,
pretreatment, monitoring and reporting.
   (B)   It shall be the responsibility of the user to make determinations as
to the nature of its operation and wastewater flow and to take such actions as
may be required under this chapter prior to any discharge of wastewater,
whether or not the user has been informed by the District of the requirements
which may apply to the user regarding its discharge.
   (C)   All industrial users who meet the definition of class I or II and who
are currently connected or contribute to the District POTW, or who propose to
connect or contribute to the District facilities, shall make application for a
wastewater discharge permit. This application shall be made before connecting
to or contributing to the District’s facilities, or within 90 days after the
enactment of this chapter in the event the user is currently connected and not
currently permitted. All existing industrial users connected to or contributing
to the District’s facilities and having a current wastewater discharge permit
shall be required to obtain a new permit or permit contract upon the expiration
of their existing permit.
   (D)   All class III industrial users may be required to receive a permit in
order to connect to the District facilities or to continue to discharge to
District facilities. At such time as the District undertakes such a program to
permit class III users, existing class III users will be required to apply for
a permit within 90 days of notice to said users by personal service, mail or
publication. Thereafter, it shall be the responsibility of all class III users
prior to connection to obtain a permit.
   (E)   Industrial user permits may be issued to mobile service providers that
operate in the District’s service area in order to ensure that the wastewater
generated is managed and discharged in compliance with this chapter and
applicable state and federal requirements. The classification of the mobile
service provider will be determined by evaluating the quantity and quality of
the wastewater discharged.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.052 CLASSES OF USERS.
   (A)   The District will classify all users in accordance with the principal
activity conducted on the premises where the discharge occurs. The purpose of
the classification is to facilitate regulation of discharges to District
facilities on the basis of each user’s waste quality, quantity and flow.
   (B)   The classification shall further provide a means of imposing an
appropriate level of oversight, control and enforcement according to the source
of the discharge. The classification system will also allow equitable recovery
of District capital and operating costs for the pretreatment program. As set
forth in the §
35.003, there are two categories of users: to wit, domestic users and
industrial users. Industrial users are categorized as class I, II, III or IV.
   (C)   All users are subject to the prohibitions set forth in this chapter,
with such federal and state statutes and regulations as may apply, and the
specific pollutant limitations as may be promulgated by the Board of Directors
by ordinance.
   (D)   Domestic users under normal circumstances will not be required to
apply for or receive a wastewater discharge permit, as defined in this chapter,
providing that said domestic user discharges only that wastewater which is
consistent with the definition of domestic wastewater set forth herein.
   (E)   Industrial users may be subject to wastewater discharge permit
requirements depending on the volume, characteristics and origin of their
wastewater discharge. Industrial users may be required to supply such
information and data concerning their processes, including discharge samples
and wastes generated, as may be necessary for the District to determine whether
such user should be designated as class I, II, III or IV. Industrial users
must, if requested, provide such other information regarding the nature of the
entity, its operations, storage and use of chemicals, and storage and use of
hazardous substances, as may be reasonably necessary to make such determination
as to the classification of said user and whether a wastewater discharge permit
is needed. The District may also require information relating to potential for
accidental discharges to a District facility of hazardous or prohibited
substances. Such inquiries may include information regarding the current
disposal procedures of the user with regard to chemicals and/or substances that
are not in the ordinary course of the user’s operations discharge to a District
facility.
   (F)   The determination by the District regarding the designation of an
industrial user as a class I user may be based on the unusual character of the
wastewater due to its volume, strength, composition or its derivation from a
hazardous waste or substance, or the potential variability in the character of
the wastewater, or on the potential for increased administrative cost to the
District due to the unusual character of the waste. Any additional
administrative costs to be considered may include increased potential for the
administrative oversight by federal, state and local agencies as well as the
potential for increased liability exposure and associated legal costs. The
District may also take into consideration difficulties in enforcement of this
chapter under a wastewater discharge permit and the enforcement violation and
compliance history of the user with the District, as well as other regulatory
agencies.
   (G)   The determination of the District regarding the designation of an
industrial user as a class II user may be based on whether the discharge of the
wastewater is equal to or greater than 25,000 gallons per average work day
flow, or whether the discharge has in its waste hazardous pollutants, or
whether the discharge is subject to national pretreatment standards, or whether
it has in its untreated wastewater, pollutants which are in excess of any
pretreatment standard or requirement, including any pretreatment standard or
requirement identified in this chapter or local limit set by this chapter, or
whether it may, in the opinion of the District, have a significant impact,
either singularly or in combination with other contributing industries, on the
District’s ability to meet the objectives of this chapter.
   (H)   A determination by the District regarding the designation of an
industrial user as a class III user may be based on the standards set forth in
the definition of a class III industrial user in this chapter.
   (I)   This determination may include, but not be limited to, the issue of
whether the user stores and/or uses hazardous substances in such quantities in
its industrial or commercial processes as may, in the determination of the
District, have the potential to be discharged to District facilities by
accident or through a slug discharge, causing a measurable increase in the
amount of hazardous substances entering the District’s facilities. Non-
significant categorical users shall be classified as class III industrial users
and shall operate under a class III industrial user permit.
   (J)   Class IV industrial user shall include all industrial users who are
not determined by the District to be class I, II or III industrial users. Class
IV industrial users shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter.

      (2)   (a)   The wastewater discharge permit contract shall incorporate
the provisions of this chapter by reference including all requirements and
standards as may be set forth herein or promulgated by the Board of Directors
by ordinance. The wastewater discharge permit contract may contain all of the
permit provisions set forth in division (C) above.
         (b)   In addition, the permit contract may contain additional
provisions, including, but not limited to, the following:
            1.   a.   Provisions for liquidated damages for discharges in
violation of the discharge prohibitions and limitations of this chapter and/or
of such special prohibitions or limitations as may be set forth in the permit
contract; and
               b.   These liquidated damages provisions may be proposed without
regard to proof of pass-through, damage to the environment or interference with

violation of the noted provisions;
            2.   Requirements for providing proof of insurance, indemnification
of the District and bonding in order to adequately protect the District, in its
judgment, from the potential of the increased exposure to liability due to the
user’s discharge;
            3.   Provisions for termination of the permit contract and
wastewater sewer service for violation of this chapter or other wastewater
permit contract conditions; and
            4.   Any and all other conditions as may be deemed appropriate by
the District to ensure compliance with all provisions of this chapter and the
objectives set forth herein.
   (F)   Permit modifications.
      (1)   When a new national categorical pretreatment standard is
promulgated, the wastewater discharge permit or permit contract of users
subject to such standard shall be revised to require compliance with such
standard within the time for compliance prescribed by such standard or within
90 days, whichever is shorter. However, when the time for compliance prescribed
by such standard is longer than 90 days, the users subject to such standard may
apply to the General Manager, or his or her designee, for an extended time for
compliance in a wastewater discharge permit or permit contract. The General
Manager, or his or her designee, may grant such an extension up to the time for
compliance set forth in the national categorical pretreatment standards.
      (2)   Where a user, subject to a national pretreatment standard, has not
previously submitted an application for a wastewater discharge permit as
required by §
35.054(B), the user shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit within 180
days after the promulgation of the applicable national pretreatment standard.
      (3)   In addition, the user with an existing wastewater discharge permit
or permit contract shall submit to the General Manager within 180 days after
the promulgation of an applicable federal pretreatment standard the information
required by division (A) above.
      (4)   In the event the District determines that it is necessary in order
to comply with the objectives of the chapter to impose more stringent
limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW than are set forth in an
existing permit (for reasons other than issuance of a new national pretreatment
standard), the District shall have the right to require such reasonable
modifications of an existing permit to incorporate such more stringent
limitations or requirements. In the event such permit modification is required,
the user shall be provided with reasonable time to make such modifications to
its processes or procedures as may be required to meet the more stringent
limitations and requirements. After consultations with the user, a compliance
schedule agreement shall be issued which would set forth a reasonable schedule
for the user to comply with the more stringent standards. If the permit
modification will require construction or acquisition of equipment related to
pretreatment, the compliance schedule agreement will provide for up to 180 days
to comply; however, this period may be extended for a period not to exceed an
additional 180 days upon determination by the General Manager and/or the
District Engineer that good cause exists for an additional period.
      (5)   To the extent that the user remains in compliance with the permit
conditions in effect prior to amendment during the compliance period, the user
shall not be liable pursuant to the terms of this chapter for non-compliance
with the more stringent standards or requirements during the period of the
compliance schedule agreement; provided that the user is also complying with
the terms of said compliance schedule agreement.
   (G)   Permit and contract transfer. Wastewater discharge permits and
wastewater discharge permit contracts are issued to a specific user for a
specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or
transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises or a new or
changed operation without the prior approval of the District. However, nothing
in this section shall be construed to prevent the application of the terms and
conditions of this chapter, including enforcement penalties, from applying to a
succeeding owner, successor in interest or other assigns of an existing
contract of permit holder.

of the emergency notification procedure.
   (B)   Prior notification of change in volume or character of wastewater. All
users shall promptly notify the District, in writing (except in emergencies
where telephone notification is acceptable), prior to:
      (1)   Any new or increased discharge or any change in nature of their
discharge which discharge does not meet pretreatment standards or requirements
or has the reasonable potential to cause the District to violate its NPDES
permit or to cause problems to the District wastewater system; and
      (2)   Any substantial change in volume or character of pollutants in
their discharge, including listed or characteristic hazardous wastes.
   (C)   Baseline report.
      (1)   All class I and II industrial users, subject to national
categorical pretreatment standards, shall submit to the District a baseline
report within 180 days of the effective date of a national categorical
pretreatment standard or 180 days after final decision on a category
determination by EPA or the state, whichever is earlier. The baseline report
shall contain the information specified in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b).
      (2)   The information required for application for a permit under §
35.053(A) and/or for modification of a permit under §
35.053(F) may fulfill the requirements of the baseline report. If, in
submitting information to apply for or modify a permit, the user also intends
to fulfill the requirements for the baseline report, the user shall so state.
   (D)   Compliance report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or, in the
case of a new user, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater
into the POTW, any class I, II or IV user subject to pretreatment standards or
requirements shall submit to the District a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process
which are limited by pretreatment standards or requirements, the average and
these process units. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional operational and maintenance changes and/or pretreatment is necessary
to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the industrial user and a certified qualified professional. Filing of this
compliance report cannot relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or
other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law or
failure to meet the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements
subsequent to the date for final compliance with such applicable standard.
Class III users may be required to complete a pretreatment survey of best
management practices.
   (E)   Periodic compliance reports.
      (1)   (a)   Class I and II industrial users shall submit a report to the
District twice a year or more frequently as specified in the permit or permit
contract.
         (b)   Class III industrial users may be required to submit periodic
compliance reports depending on the nature of their discharge. Periodic
compliance reports shall be submitted within 45 days of collection of the
wastewater samples or by the due date specified in the permit.
         (c)   The compliance report shall contain such information as may be
deemed by the District to be necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions
of this chapter.
         (d)   Compliance reports shall, at a minimum, contain the following:
            1.   The nature and concentration of pollutants which are limited
by pretreatment standards or requirements or which are specified in the permit
or permit contract for each regulated waste stream;
            2.   A record of average daily flow for the reporting period for
each regulated waste stream;
            3.   Such other wastewater effluent data as the user has obtained
since the last compliance report, whether or not that data is specifically
required by the user’s permit or permit contract;
            4.   Methods utilized by the user in collecting the wastewater
sample for analysis, including, but not limited to, the sampling device(s)
used, the sampling period, the amount of each sample collected, sample handling
and preservation techniques used and date of sample delivery to the laboratory
for analysis; and
            5.   In the event a sample from a periodic compliance report
indicates that a constituent is in violation of the allowable concentration
levels as set forth in the user’s permit or permit contract, the user shall
inform the District within the next business day, repeat the sampling and
pollutant analysis for the parameter in violation, and submit in writing the
results of this second analysis within 30 days of the discovery of the first
violation. The initial sampling and analysis report shall be submitted within
45 days of the initial sampling date with a cover report setting forth the
causes of the violation, the remedial actions taken to date in regard to the
violation and the scheduled additional actions which will be implemented to
prevent a reoccurrence.
      (2)   The District may also at any time require a signed statement by the
user setting forth management practices and/or material usage practices which
have been an effect on the nature, volume and quality of the wastewater
discharge and/or which potentially will affect the ability to comply with
pretreatment standards requirements.
      (3)   (a)   The District may impose mass limitations on users where the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. In such cases, the report
required under division (A) above shall indicate the mass of pollutants
regulated by pretreatment standards or requirements in the effluent of the
user.
         (b)   These reports shall contain the results of all sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow, concentration and mass of
pollutant regulate by the applicable pretreatment standard or requirement.
         (c)   The user shall provide the actual average production rate of the
regulated processes during the reporting period.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.056 MONITORING.
   (A)   Monitoring requirements.
      (1)   Any user may be required to provide wastewater sampling and/or
monitoring results or to submit to monitoring by the District to assist the
District in establishing the appropriate class of the user and/or to evaluate
compliance with the standards and requirements of this chapter. Any wastewater
sampling and/or monitoring results shall be based upon data obtained through
appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the
report.
      (2)   Such data shall be representative of conditions occurring during
the reporting period. Sampling will be paid by the industrial user.
         (a)   Classification sampling. All industrial users may be required to
sample and analyze their waste stream(s) to determine the appropriate class of
the user. Classification sampling shall be at the District’s request. The
number and type of samples and pollutants analyzed shall be as specified by the
District in order to adequately characterize the users’ wastewater discharge
(s).
         (b)   Baseline sampling. All class I and II industrial users shall
sample and analyze their regulated waste stream(s) as part of a permit
application or modification of a permit as specified in §§
35.053(A) and
35.053(F). In addition, all class I and II industrial users required to submit
baseline reports, as specified in §
35.054(B), shall sample and analyze their regulated waste stream(s) in
accordance with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b). Samples shall be
analyzed for constituents or characteristics, including, but not limited to,
those mentioned in §§
35.020 through
35.036 and/or in applicable state pretreatment standards or requirements or
national pretreatment standards or as otherwise required by the District.
         (c)   Initial compliance sampling. All class I and II industrial users
shall sample and analyze their regulated waste stream(s) for the compliance
report as specified in §
35.054(C) Samples shall be analyzed for those pollutants regulated in the
applicable pretreatment standard or requirement or as otherwise required by the
District.
         (d)   Periodic compliance sampling.
            1.   All class I and II industrial users shall sample and analyze
their regulated waste stream(s) to evaluate compliance with the user’s permit
or permit contract. Periodic compliance monitoring shall be conducted at least
twice each year unless specified more frequently in the user’s permit or permit
contract or in the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard.
            2.   Less frequent self-monitoring can be established in the user’s
permit or permit contract as allowed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(e).
         (e)   If required, class III industrial users shall sample and analyze
their regulated waste stream(s) to evaluate compliance with the user’s permit.
         (f)   1.   Samples shall be analyzed for those pollutants regulated in
the applicable pretreatment standard or requirement or as otherwise required by
the District. Categorical industrial users may request to forgo monitoring for
constituents with a categorical pretreatment standard provided that the
requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(e)(2) are met. For industrial users not
subject to categorical pretreatment standards, the District shall specify the
constituents to be monitored in the user’s permit or permit contract which may
exclude parameters that are not expected to be present in the process discharge
at levels of concern.
            2.   The District may allow industrial users to use an approved
total toxic organic (TTO) management plan to establish operational procedures
to control discharges of TTO constituents so that monitoring for TTO compounds
is not required in a user’s self-monitoring program.
         (g)   Confirmation sampling. Whenever sampling results indicate that
the user’s regulated waste stream(s) is in violation of any pretreatment
standard or requirement, the user shall collect a second sample to assess the
degree of violation. For the second sample, the user need only analyze for the
pollutant(s) found to be in violation. The user shall provide the District with
the results from the confirmation sampling within 30 days of the date the
violation was discovered.
         (h)   Sampling and evaluation program. If confirmation sampling
indicates a second violation, then the District may initiate a sampling and
evaluation program (SEP). The SEP will be conducted by the District and may
include collection of from three to five samples. The SEP will establish
whether there is continued non-compliance by the user. Samples collected during
the SEP may be analyzed for other pollutants in addition to the pollutant(s) in
violation.
         (I)   Other compliance sampling.
            1.   All class I, II and III industrial users may be required by
the District to conduct compliance sampling in addition to those described
above.
            2.   This could include, but is not limited to, sampling required
by the District in an enforcement compliance schedule agreement.
         (j)   District sampling.
            1.   The District may collect and analyze samples on its own or
request the user to split samples to evaluate compliance with this chapter or
the user’s permit or permit contract. The District also reserves the right to
conduct all sampling and analysis for the user with all costs to be paid by the
user.
            2.   In the event that data obtained by the District differs from
data provided by the user, the District’s data shall be presumed accurate
unless and until the user provides substantial evidence otherwise. In the event
that the District performs the sampling, whether announced or unannounced, the
user may request that the District split its samples and provide one of the
split samples for the user’s independent analysis.
   (B)   Sampling procedures.
      (1)   All sampling and testing undertaken for the purpose of compliance
with the sampling and reporting requirements of this chapter shall be
undertaken in the manner set forth herein. Except as otherwise provided in this
section or as otherwise agreed in writing by the District, samples for pH,
cyanide, sulfide, phenols, oil and grease and volatile organics shall consist
of grab samples. A minimum of four grab samples shall be taken for the
referenced constituents throughout the entire process discharge period. The
grab samples for each of the referenced constituents shall be individually
preserved and kept separate, and shall be subsequently composited by the
testing laboratory prior to analysis.
      (2)   For all other pollutants, composite samples shall be taken through
flow proportional composite sampling techniques or time proportional composite
sampling, as specified in the permit or permit contract, unless the permit or
permit contract specifically authorizes alternative grab or composite grab
techniques. Time proportional composite sampling shall occur with a sampling
frequency of at least one sample each half hour throughout the entire process
discharge period, or a 24-hour period as required by the District. Each
regulated waste stream shall be sampled and analyzed separately unless the
user’s permit or permit contract allows for sampling and analyzing the combined
waste streams.
      (3)   The methods of obtaining the sample shall be specified by the
District in the user’s permit or permit contract. As an alternative, a sampling
program proposed by the user shall be submitted to the District for review
prior to initiating said program. The District may state special sampling
requirements as needed to ensure compliance with this chapter
   (C)   Analytical procedures. All samples shall be preserved and analyzed in
accordance with the procedures for the analysis of water/wastewater presented
in the 40 C.F.R. part 136 (Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for the
Analysis of Pollutants). Unless approved otherwise by the District in writing,
all analyses shall be performed by a laboratory(s) certified by the state for
the specific pollutants and matrix to be analyzed.
   (D)   Sampling records. For each sampling event, the user shall record and
maintain the following information:
      (1)   The date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the names of
the person or persons taking the samples;
      (2)   Sample preservation used;
      (3)   The dates analyses were performed;
      (4)   Chain of custody of sample;
      (5)   Who performed the analyses;
      (6)   The analytical techniques/methods used; and
      (7)   The results of such analyses.
   (E)   Monitoring facilities.
      (1)   The District may require to be provided and to be operated at the
user’s own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and
flow measurement of regulated discharge.
      (2)   The monitoring facility shall be accessible to District staff at
all times and should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the
District may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship
on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or
sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or
parked vehicles.
      (3)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. The
District may require the sampling equipment be secured to prevent tampering
with and/or removal.
      (4)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the District
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications.

   (C)   Those portions of the information shall also be available for use by
the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the user furnishing the information. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.
   (D)   Information and data requested from a user which the user believes to
be proprietary and the release of which to the public would substantially
impair the operations of the user may alternatively be provided to the District
for its review at the facility of the user rather than provided to the District
for its keeping, at the discretion of the District.
   (E)   The burden will be on the user to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the District that such information is proprietary and that this alternative
procedure is necessary or appropriate and will not prevent the District from
properly carrying out the objectives of this chapter.
   (F)   In any event, information accepted by the District as confidential
shall not be transmitted to anyone, except the Environmental Protection Agency,
the State Water Quality Control Board and/or the Regional Water Quality Control
Board, until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the user.

ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
§ 35.075 ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS.
   The enforcement mechanisms available to the District for violations of the
provisions of this chapter, applicable District resolutions and permit or
permit contract provisions include the following:
   (A)   Informal administrative action (including notice of violations and
warning notices);
   (B)   Administrative orders;
   (C)   Institution of sampling and evaluation programs, enforcement
compliance schedule agreements and related administrative orders;
   (D)   Assessment of charges for obstruction or damage to District facilities
or operations;
   (E)   Suspension or termination of services;
   (F)   Administrative complaints for administrative civil penalties;
   (G)   Civil action; and
   (H)   Criminal action
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.076 INFORMAL ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS.
   (A)   District staff may, on an informal basis, take action against a
discharger for minor violations or technical or clerical shortcomings of a user
or a user’s compliance submittals.
   (B)   These informal administrative actions may include:
      (1)   A verbal warning informal notices (i.e., telephone calls or on-site
verbal communication to the user’s representative) and informal meetings;
      (2)   A letter of warning (informal warning letters). These informal
administrative actions may establish a compliance schedule for the discharger
to follow in order to document compliance. Such action will not prevent a
subsequent or concurrent imposition of other enforcement mechanisms;
      (3)   A written notice of violation (NOV); and
      (4)   A written notice of violation (NOV) with fines and or assessed
costs.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.077 ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS AND COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES.
   (A)   When the District finds that a user has violated the prohibitions or
requirements of this chapter or the provisions of a wastewater discharge permit
or wastewater discharge permit contract, the District may issue an
administrative order directed at those users not complying with such
prohibitions, limitations, requirements or provisions to:
      (1)   Cease to discharge immediately (suspension of service);
      (2)   Comply with requirements immediately; or
      (3)   Make such changes to their pretreatment facility and procedures
immediately as to insure full compliance.
   (B)   At its discretion, the District may later issue, after the issuance of
the administrative order set forth above, an additional administrative order
containing a compliance schedule or a time schedule setting forth dates by
which specific corrective actions must be completed.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.078 SAMPLING AND EVALUATION PROGRAMS.
   (A)   Grounds for instituting sampling and evaluation programs.
      (1)   In addition to those grounds set forth in §
35.055(A), grounds for instituting a sampling and evaluation program include
compliance sampling or District sampling indicating a significant non-
compliance (SNC). The sampling and evaluation program may consist of District
sampling of the discharger’s wastewater at the first opportunity convenient to
the District, upon which daily samples may be taken for up to five days.
      (2)   The District or an outside laboratory will analyze these samples
for the violating constituents and provide notice to the discharger in regard
to the results of said sampling. Violations which may occur during the sampling
and evaluation program shall constitute subsequent violations under this
chapter or under any applicable law.
   (B)   Sampling and evaluation program revealing non-compliance. If the
sampling and evaluation program reveals non-compliance by the user with the
prohibitions or specific pollutant limitations specified in this chapter or in
the users permit or permit contract.
      (1)   The user shall be assessed all costs incurred during the sampling
and evaluation program for sampling and analysis, including labor, equipment,
materials, outside services and related overhead.
      (2)   The District may place the user on a compliance schedule or
undertake another sampling and evaluation program. The compliance schedule
shall provide for minimum required actions to be undertaken by the discharger
to alleviate the violation and a schedule for completion of said actions. The
compliance schedule may include interim constituent level maximums. All
violations of constituent maximums or other requirements set forth in the
compliance schedule, including failure to meet schedule dates shall constitute
violations of this chapter and other applicable laws, and each day a discharger
fails to meet a schedule date shall constitute a separate violation. Any
constituent limit violation during the compliance schedule period shall provide
grounds for the institution of an additional sampling and evaluation program.
      (3)   The District may amend an existing permit through an enforcement
compliance schedule agreement (ESCA). This may be done after consultation with
the user when the user has shown good faith in trying to comply but requires
additional time for construction and/or acquisition of equipment related to
pretreatment. The permit may be amended with the ESCA for a period of up to 180
days; however, this period may be extended for a period not to exceed an
additional 180 days upon determination by the General Manager and/or District
Engineer that good cause exists for an additional period. No further extensions
shall be granted except upon approval of the Board of Directors.
      (4)   Any other enforcement mechanism set forth in this chapter or other
applicable law may be commenced.
   (C)   Continued non-compliance after sampling and evaluation program or
ESCA. If a discharger remains in non-compliance because corrective action is
not taken within a reasonable time after completion of a sampling and
evaluation program or the expiration of an ESCA, an administrative order may be
issued. Any of the other enforcement mechanisms set forth in this chapter or
applicable laws may also be commenced.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.079 ASSESSMENT OF CHARGES FOR OBSTRUCTION OR DAMAGE TO DISTRICT FACILITIES
OR OPERATIONS.
   (A)   When a user’s discharge, whether due to negligence, accident, spill or
otherwise, causes an obstruction, damage or any other impairment to the
District’s operation or facilities, the District may impose a charge on the
user for the cost to clean or repair the facility, or costs incurred to resume
normal operations.
   (B)   An administrative service fee of 25% of the District’s costs may be
added to these charges. The total amount shall be paid within 45 days of
invoicing by the District.
   (C)   If it can be shown that the user’s discharge caused or significantly
contributed to the District violating its discharge requirements or incurring
additional expenses or suffering loss or damage to the operation or facilities,
then the user shall be responsible for any costs or expenses, or a prorated
portion of such expenses, including assessments or penalties imposed by other
agencies or the court on the District.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.080 SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Suspension of service.
      (1)   The District may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a
wastewater discharge permit or permit contract by issuance of a cease and
desist order when the District makes the determination that such suspension is
necessary. A suspension shall be justified in order to prevent an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of individuals or the environment, causes
or may cause interference to the treatment plant or other District operations
or causes or may cause the District to violate any condition of its NPDES
permit. Additionally, a permit may be suspended for any of the conditions set
forth justifying revocation of permit or termination of permit contract as set
forth in division (B) below. Nothing in this section will limit the rights of
the District to suspend or terminate service pursuant to specific permit or
permit contract conditions which may be more stringent.
      (2)   Any industrial user notified of a suspension of service and/or the
wastewater discharge permit or permit contract shall immediately stop or
eliminate the discharge.
      (3)   In the event of a failure of the user to comply voluntarily with
the administrative order, the District shall take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW or endangerment to persons
or the environment.
      (4)   The District may reinstate the wastewater discharge permit, permit
contract and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination
of the non-complying discharge.
   (B)   Revocation of permit/termination of permit contract. Any user who
violates the following conditions is subject to having its permit revoked or
permit contract terminated:
      (1)   Any user who knowingly gives or provides a false statement,
representation, record, report, plan or other document to the District or
falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device
or method required under this chapter;
      (2)   Failure of a user to factually and completely report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose
of inspection or monitoring;
      (5)   Failure of a user to notify the District immediately of an
accidental discharge and/or take appropriate corrective action to prevent a
reoccurrence;
      (6)   Failure of a user to file a periodic compliance report or periodic
compliance report in such time and in such manner as is required by this
chapter;
      (7)   Significant violation(s) of the permit or permit contract
requirements or conditions and/or violation of this chapter. Any violation of
the discharge standards where a constituent concentration is determined to be
five times the concentration standard set forth in Exhibit “A” or any series of
three or more violations of the same constituent within a one-year period,
shall constitute a significant violation; and
      (8)   Failure to pay fees and charges or penalties established pursuant
to this chapter.
   (C)   Immediate termination of discharge. In the case of an actual or
threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present an imminent danger to
the health or welfare of persons, the environment or the District or its
employees or contractors, the District may, after reasonably attempting to
informally notify the user, take all necessary steps to halt or prevent such
discharge, including, but not limited to, plugging or physically disconnecting
the user’s access to the District wastewater system.

§ 35.081 ADMINISTRATIVE CIVIL PENALTIES.
   (A)   Pursuant to the authority of Cal. Gov’t Code, §§ 54739 to 54740.6, the
District or District staff may issue administrative complaints, conduct
administrative hearings and/or impose civil penalties in accordance with the
procedures set forth in these sections for violation of the District’s
requirements relating to pretreatment of industrial waste or the prevention of
the entry of industrial waste into the District’s collection system or
treatment works.
   (B)   These penalties shall be as follows (see Appendix B):
      (1)   In an amount which shall not exceed $75 for an initial failure to
adhere to a schedule to attain compliance set forth in a notice of violation
(NOV);
      (2)   In an amount which shall not exceed $150 for a second failure
within a 12-sequential month period to adhere to a schedule to attain
compliance set forth in the NOV and failing or refusing to timely comply with
any compliance schedule established by the District;
      (3)   In an amount which shall not exceed $500 for a third failure within
a 12-sequential month period to adhere to a schedule to attain compliance set
forth in the same NOV; and
      (4)   In an amount which shall not exceed $500 per violation for receipt
of a subsequent NOV for a repeat violation of the same provision of this
chapter within 12 months of the issuance of an administrative citation for
failure to adhere to the compliance schedule in the prior NOV.
   (C)   A penalty for delinquent accounts shall be charged. If the violation
fee has not been paid by the thirty-first day after the NOV, a penalty of 1.5%
of the base invoice amount will be applied, not to exceed a maximum of $1,000.
If the violation fee has not been paid by the sixtieth day after the NOV, an
additional penalty of 10% of the base invoice amount shall be applied, not to
exceed $4,000.
   (D)   Any invoice outstanding and unpaid for 90 days after the NOV shall be
cause for immediate initiation for permit revocation.
   (E)   As to court actions authorized by divisions (A) through (D) above,
District Counsel, or other special counsel designated by the Board, shall
institute appropriate actions to affect statutorily authorized remedies, upon
order of the Board.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.082 CIVIL ACTION.
   The Board of Directors may direct District Counsel or other special counsel
to bring such civil actions as may be available at law or in equity in any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this chapter and
to recover such charges, fees, penalties and/or damages as may be assessed or
may be incurred under the provisions of this chapter.
   (A)   Injunction. Whenever a discharge of wastewater is in violation of the
provisions of this chapter, the District may petition the Superior Court for
issuance of a preliminary of permanent injunction, or both, as may be
appropriate in restraining the continuance of such discharge.
   (B)   Civil actions for penalties.
      (1)   Any user who violates any provision of this chapter, permit
condition or permit contract condition, or who violates any cease and desist
order, prohibition or effluent limitation, shall be liable civilly for a
penalty not to exceed $10 for each day in which such violation occurs pursuant
to Cal. Gov’t Code, § 54740. Pursuant to the authority of the Clean Water Act,
33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq., any user committing a violation of any provision of
this chapter, which is also a violation of a pretreatment standard, effluent
standard or limitation or other applicable provision of the Clean Water Act
shall be liable civilly for a sum not to exceed $10 per violation for each day
in which such violation occurs.
      (2)   District Counsel, or other special counsel designated by the Board,
upon order of the Board, shall institute such actions as may be appropriate in
the appropriate court to impose, assess and recover such sums.
   (C)   Other civil actions. The District may require compliance with permit
conditions or limitations by issuing administrative orders, including cease and
desist orders and compliance schedules. Said orders are enforceable in the
state court of general jurisdiction. The District, however, may directly
undertake any court action available at law or equity, including, but not
limited to, a civil action for penalties without first seeking an
administrative order or making use of a compliance schedule, and it may
concurrently undertake such administrative and court actions as deemed
appropriate.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.083 CRIMINAL ACTION.
   (A)   (1)   General criminal penalties.
         (a)   Any person who violates any provision of this chapter, permit or
permit contract, or who violates any administrative order, prohibition or
effluent limitation, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, is
punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than 30
days in the county jail, or both.
         (b)   Each day a violation occurs may constitute a new and separate
offense and may subject the violator to an additional full measure of penalties
as set forth herein.
      (2)   Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false
statements, representations or certification in any application, record,
report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to
this chapter, or wastewater discharge permit, wastewater discharge permit
contract or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this chapter, shall upon conviction
be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than
30 days, or both. Each separate act of falsification, tampering or knowingly
rendering inaccurate any device or method, shall constitute a new and separate
offense and shall be subject to the penalties contained herein.

wastewater discharge permit contract or any prohibition, limitation or
requirements contained herein, the District may serve upon such person a
written notice stating the nature of the violation.
      (2)   Within 30 days of the date of this notice, a plan for the
satisfactory correction of the violation shall be submitted to the District by
the user. Whenever the District assesses a penalty or other form of enforcement
action under the provisions of this subchapter, the District shall serve upon
such user a written notice stating the nature of the enforcement action being
taken.
   (B)   Notification to District. When a user discovers that it has violated
or is violating a provision of the chapter, its wastewater discharge permit,
its wastewater discharge permit contract or any prohibition, limitation or
requirement contained therein, including a violation as may be caused by
accidental discharge or spill, the user shall immediately notify the District
upon discovery of such violation. Thereafter, within five days following the
accidental discharge or discovery of a violation, the user shall submit to the
District a detailed written report, describing the accidental discharge or
violation and the measures taken by the user to prevent similar future
occurrences. This written report regarding the violation may be included as a
part of a periodic compliance report, or other report as may be required under
this chapter, as long as the written report is provided within the five days of
discovery, which notification shall not relieve the user of any expense,
penalty, fee or other liability which may be incurred as a result of the
violation.

§ 35.085 ENFORCEMENT COSTS.
   (A)   All costs associated with the District’s undertaking of enforcement
actions pursuant to this chapter, including attorney’s fees for civil actions
undertaken, shall be paid by the user.
   (B)   These costs may include, but not be limited to, the costs for
termination of service, reinstitution of service, compliance sampling and
analysis and administrative activities undertaken by the District.
   (C)   However, if the user prevails in an appeal to the Board of Directors
or a civil action taken to nullify an enforcement action pursued by the
District under this chapter, the user shall not be responsible for the costs
incurred by the District in pursuing said enforcement action.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.086 RESPONDING TO SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   Any violation of pretreatment standards or requirements (limits,
sampling, analysis, reporting and meeting compliance schedules and regulatory
deadlines) is an instance of non-compliance for which the industrial user is
liable for enforcement including penalties. However, the District is required
to identify violations or patterns of violations by industrial users that are
deemed to be instances of significant non-compliance (SNC). To the extent that
a violation or pattern of violations is determined to be significant non-
compliance, the District shall give additional priority to enforcement actions
with regard to that industrial user. Additionally, the determination of
significant non-compliance shall be used as the basis for reporting the same to
the regulatory authorities and publishing of the list of significant non-
compliers as may be required of the District by law.
      (2)   For purposes of this provision, a significant industrial user or
any industrial user that violates the enforcement sections of this chapter, is
in significant non-compliance if its violation meets one or more of the
following criteria.
   (B)   Violations of wastewater discharge limits.
      (1)   Chronic violations. Violations in which 66% or more of all the
measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period
exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement,
including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 403.3(l).
      (2)   Technical review criteria violations. Violations in which 33% or
more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a
six-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment
standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40
C.F.R. § 403.3(l), multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS,
fats, oil and grease and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).
      (3)   Other effluent limit violations. Any other violation of a
pretreatment standard or requirement, as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 403.3(l) (Daily
Maximum, Long-term Average, Instantaneous Limit or Narrative Standard), that
the District determines has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference (e.g., slug loads) or pass-through (including adverse
effect on any toxicity testing), or endangered the health of the sewage
treatment personnel or the public.
      (4)   Danger to human health or welfare. This criterion includes any
discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health,
welfare or to the environment and has resulted in the POTW’s exercise of its
emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
   (C)   Violation of compliance milestones. A failure to meet, within 90 days
after the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a
District permit or administrative order for starting construction, completing
construction or attaining final compliance.
   (D)   Failure to provide proper data. A failure to provide, within 45 days
after the due date, required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-
day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on
compliance with compliance schedules.
   (E)   Failure to accurately report non-compliance. A failure of a user to
accurately and promptly report any non-compliance. Any attempt to circumvent
the reporting requirements or otherwise withhold non-compliance data from the
District shall be subject to SNC status.
   (F)   Other violations. Any other violation or group of violations, which
may include a violation of best management practices, that the District
determines may adversely affect its operations or the accomplishment of the
objectives of this chapter.

WASTE HAULER PROGRAM
§ 35.130 PERMISSIBLE WASTE HAULER DISCHARGE.
   The Board of Directors finds that it is in the best interest of the citizens
of the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea and the county within the District’s
boundaries, generally and in the best interests of the health and sanitation of
the constituents of the District, that the District receives certain trucked-in
wastes at the POTW for disposal. It is the intent of the Board of Directors
that the POTW shall only be used for the disposal of wastes which are
compatible with the POTW process and the continued operation of the treatment
plant as a non-RCRA or nonhazardous POTW. Therefore, it is the intent of this
chapter to prohibit the discharge from waste haulers of any hazardous waste as
may be defined by either federal or state statue and regulation, whichever is
more stringent; and, further, to prohibit all such wastes as are prohibited
within §§
35.020 through
35.036 when such wastes are trucked to the District and discharged pursuant to
the District’s waste hauler program.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.131 WASTE HAULER DISCHARGE PERMIT.
   (A)   The Board of Directors finds that, in order to properly administer the

the requirements of the District’s grease interceptor program.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
GREASE, OIL AND SAND INTERCEPTOR PROGRAM
§ 35.150 INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.
   (A)   All non-domestic users shall be required to install and maintain a
grease, oil and sand interceptor when the General Manager and/or District
Engineer, or his, her or their designee, finds that it is necessary for the
proper handling of:
      (1)   Liquid waste containing grease;
      (2)   Flammable wastes; and
      (3)   Sand.
   (B)   Any other harmful constituents that may be properly eliminated from
the sewerage system by use of an interceptor or trap. An interceptor is not
required for a building used solely for residential purposes so long as there
is no common food preparation facility. An interceptor shall be required when
the wastewater flow from the building is anticipated to contain grease,
flammable substances, sand or other harmful ingredients in amounts or
concentrations which would be in violation of a pretreatment standard or, in
the discretion of the District, present the possibility of causing or
contributing to the fouling of or the blockage of or other damage to the
District sewerage system.
(Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-31-2022)
§ 35.151 ADMINISTRATION OF INTERCEPTOR PROGRAM.
   (A)   The District shall administer an interceptor program, which is
intended to prevent grease, sand, flammable liquids and other substances that
are likely to block or create a hazard within the sewerage system, from
entering the system.
   (B)   (1)   The District may require any non-domestic user to install an
interceptor or trap according to the guidelines set forth in the District’s
standard specifications or other program prior to connection to the District or
at any time after connection to the District if the District discovers or
determines subsequent to the connection that the building, facility or
operation of that user produces a waste with characteristics that would require
installation of a trap or interceptor pursuant to this chapter. The
installation of a proper interceptor or trap device shall be the responsibility
of the parcel owner and the entity which applies for the connection or
industrial user permit, and the owner/proprietor of the business or entity
whose operations cause or contribute to the necessity for an interceptor or
trap.
      (2)   The District shall determine whether a grease trap, grease
interceptor or other interceptor is required on a case-by-case basis based on
an evaluation of objective criteria including but not limited to factors such
as those listed below:
         (a)   The type of facility (food service facility (see definition in §
35.003), gas station, lube facility and the like);
         (b)   The volume of the user’s business or operation (such as number
of meals served, number of seats, hours of operation);
         (c)   Size and nature of facilities (including kitchen facilities)
based on size, type, number of fixtures and type of processing or cooking
equipment used;
         (d)   The type of service provided or operation undertaken (such as
dine-in meal service versus carry-out meal service);
         (e)   The type of foods or other materials used in the cooking,
processing or manufacturing operations carried on within the user’s facility;
         (f)   The overall potential for grease-laden, flammable or sand-laden
discharges;
         (g)   The existence of devices, procedures or processes which are
designed to minimize the amount of grease, sand, oil or other flammable liquids
from entering the sewer system; and
         (h)   1.   The design, location and procedures for operation of a
required interceptor or trap shall be approved by the District. In the event of
new construction or remodel, such approval shall be obtained prior to the
user’s connection of the facility to the District’s sewerage system. In
instances where a user has already connected and the District determines that
an interceptor or trap must be installed, the user shall promptly provide for
the installation of the interceptor or trap within a reasonable time frame (as
may be set by the District), including providing such design plans and
operational plans as may be required.
            2.   The installation of an interceptor or trap, as required by
this chapter, on an existing user facility shall occur within reasonable time
not to exceed 100 days after the user has been provided notice of the
requirement that an interceptor or trap be installed.
            3.   This 100-day limit may only be extended by written agreement
of the District.

I.   FINDINGS - ORDER NO. R3-2014-0012 NPDES NO. CA0047996
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Coast Region
(hereinafter the Central Coast Water Board) finds:
   A.   Legal Authorities. This Order serves as Waste Discharge Requirements
(WDRs) pursuant to article 4, chapter 4, division 7 of the California Water
Code (commencing with § 13260). This Order is also issued pursuant to § 402 of
the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and implementing regulations adopted by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and chapter 5.5, division 7 of the
Water Code (commencing with § 13370). It shall serve as a National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for point source discharges from
this facility to surface waters.
   B.   Background and Rationale for Requirements. The Central Coast Water
Board developed this Order’s requirements based on information submitted in the
application, through monitoring and reporting programs, and other available
information. The Fact Sheet (Attachment F), which contains background
information and rationale for the Order’s waste discharge requirements, is
hereby incorporated into this Order and constitutes part of the Findings for
this Order. Attachments A through E are also incorporated into this Order.
   C.   Provisions and Requirements Implementing State Law. The provisions/
requirements in subsections II.B, II.C, and III.B, of this Order are included
to implement state law only. These provisions/requirements are not required or
authorized under the federal CWA; consequently, violations of these provisions/
requirements are not subject to the enforcement remedies that are available for
NPDES violations.
   D.   Notification of Interested Parties. The Central Coast Water Board has
notified the Discharger and interested agencies and persons of its intent to
prescribe WDRs for the discharge and has provided them with an opportunity to
submit their written comments and recommendations. Details of the notification
are provided in the Fact Sheet accompanying this Order.
   E.   Consideration of Public Comment. The Central Coast Water Board, in a
public meeting, heard and considered all comments pertaining to the discharge.
Details of the Public Hearing are provided in the Fact Sheet of this Order.
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this Order supersedes Order R3-20080007
except for enforcement purposes, and, in order to meet the provisions contained
in division 7 of the Water Code (commencing with § 13000) and regulations
adopted thereunder and the provisions of the CWA and regulations and guidelines
adopted thereunder, the Discharger shall comply with the requirements in this
Order. This action in no way prevents the Central Coast Water Board from taking
enforcement action for past violations of the previous Order. If any part of
this Order is subject to a temporary stay of enforcement, unless otherwise
specified, the Discharger shall comply with the analogous portions of the
previous Order, which shall remain in effect for all purposes during the
pendency of the stay.

VIII.   Public Participation
The Central Coast Water Board considered the issuance of waste discharge
requirements (WDRs) that serve as a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit for the Carmel Area Wastewater District Wastewater
Treatment Facility. As a step in the WDR adoption process, Central Coast Water
Board staff developed tentative WDRs. The Central Coast Water Board encouraged
public participation in the WDR adoption process.
   A.   Notification of Interested Parties
The Central Coast Water Board notified the Discharger and interested agencies
and persons of its intent to prescribe waste discharge requirements for the
discharge and provided them with an opportunity to submit written comments and
recommendations. Notification was provided through publication in the local
newspaper, the Monterey Herald, posting at the Facility and Discharger offices,
and/or publication on the Discharger’s and Water Board’s website.
   B.   Written Comments
Staff received two written comments solely from the Monterey Bay National
Marine Sanctuary on March 3, 2014. Those comments are summarized, along with
staff’s response to the comments, as follows:
1.   The MBNMS requested improvements to the map on page B-1.
Staff Response: Improvements were made to the map on page B-1.
2.   The MBNMS requested that CAWD immediately notify the MBNMS office in the
event spills enter ocean waters.
Staff Response: A requirement for CAWD to notify the MBNMS office in the event
spills enter ocean waters is included on page E-17.
C.   Public Hearing
The Central Coast Water Board held a public hearing on the tentative WDRs
during its regular Board meeting on the following date and time and at the
following location:
Date:      May 22, 2014
Time:      8:30 a.m. 
Location:   Central Coast Water Board
895 Aerovista Place, Suite 101
San Luis Obispo, CA 93401
Interested persons were invited to attend. At the public hearing, the Central
Coast Water Board placed this permit on the consent calendar, as there was no
objection by the Discharger or the public.
      D.   Reconsideration of Waste Discharge Requirements
Any person affected by the action of the Central Coast Water Board to adopt
this Order may petition the State Water Resources Control Board (State Water
Board) to review the action in accordance with Water Code § 13320 and
California Code of Regulations, title 23, § 2050. Information for filing a
petition will be provided upon request to the State Water Board. Any person
affected by this Order may also request the Central Coast Water Board to
reconsider the Order. To be timely, such request must be made within 30 days of
the date of this Order. Note that even if reconsideration by the Central Coast
Water Board is sought, filing a petition with the State Water Board within the
time is necessary to preserve the petitioners legal rights. If the Discharger
chooses to request reconsideration of this Order or file a petition with the
State Water Board, the Discharger must comply with the Order while the request
for reconsideration and/or petition is being considered. The petition must be
submitted within 30 days of the Central Coast Water Board’s action to the
following address:
