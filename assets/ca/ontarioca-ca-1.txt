Sec. 1-2.01. Punishment for violation.
   (a)   It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or to
fail to comply with any of the requirements or provisions of this Code
heretofore or hereafter enacted or the provisions of any Code adopted by
reference by this Code, or any condition of any permit, license, or other
entitlement issued pursuant to this Code. Any person violating any such
provision or failing to comply with any of the mandatory requirement of this
Code, or any Code adopted by reference by this Code, shall be guilty of an
infraction, unless the citing official or the prosecuting attorney determines
that it would in the interests of justice to prosecute the offense as a
misdemeanor. All violations or failures to comply that are specifically
declared to be misdemeanors elsewhere in this Code, or any Code adopted by
reference by this Code, shall be prosecuted as misdemeanors unless the citing
official or the prosecuting attorney determines that it would be in the
interests of justice to prosecute the offense as an infraction.
   (b)   Any person convicted of an infraction under the provisions of this
Code, or any Code adopted by reference by this Code, shall be punished by:
      (1)   A fine not exceeding One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for a first
violation;
      (2)   A fine not exceeding Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) for a second
violation of the same provision within one (1) year; and
      (3)   A fine not exceeding Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) for each
additional violation of the same provision within one (1) year.
   (c)   Any person convicted of a misdemeanor shall be punished by a fine of
not more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), or by imprisonment in the
County jail for a period not exceeding six (6) months, or by both such fine and
imprisonment.
   (d)   Each such person shall be guilty of a separate offense for each and
every day during any portion of which any violation of or failure to comply
with any provision of this Code, or the provisions of any Code adopted by
reference by this Code, is committed, continued, or permitted by such person
and shall be punishable accordingly.
   (e)   In addition to the penalties provided by this section, or elsewhere in
this Code, or in any Code adopted by reference by this Code, any condition
caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this
Code, or the provisions of any Code adopted by reference by this Code, shall be
deemed a public nuisance and may be abated by the City, and each day such
condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense.
   (f)   A prevailing party in any judicial action, administrative proceeding,
or special proceeding to abate, or cause the abatement of, a violation of this
code or any public nuisance, or in any appeal or other judicial action arising
therefrom, is entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees. Attorney's fees
are not recoverable by any party as a prevailing party unless the City elects
in writing to seek recovery of the city's attorney's fees at the initiation of
that individual action or proceeding. Failure to make such an election
precludes any entitlement to, or award of, attorneys' fees in favor of any
party. Unpaid attorney's fees shall constitute a debt that is collectible in
any manner allowed by law.
   (g)   Any person who violates any provision or fails to comply with any
requirement or provision of this Code heretofore or hereafter enacted or any
provision of any Code adopted by reference by this Code shall be liable for a
civil penalty not to exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for each
violation. Where the conduct constituting a violation is of a continuing
nature, each day of such conduct is a separate and distinct violation. In
determining the amount of the civil penalty, the court shall consider all
relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of the harm
caused by the conduct constituting a violation, the nature and persistence of
such conduct the length of time over which the conduct occurred, the assets,
liabilities and net worth of the person, whether corporate or individual, and
any corrective action taken by the defendant. The civil penalty prescribed by
this subsection shall be assessed and recovered and a civil action brought by
the City Attorney in any court of competent jurisdiction. The civil penalty
prescribed by this section may be sought in addition to injunctive relief,
specific performance or any other remedy; provided, however, that a civil
penalty shall not be sought for any violation for which a criminal prosecution
has been commenced.
(§ 1, Ord. 2094, eff. August 14, 1980, as amended by § 1, Ord. 2274, eff. May
31, 1984, § 1, Ord. 2468, eff. July 5, 1990, § 1, Ord. 2469, eff. July 5, 1990,
§ 1, Ord. 2843, eff. November 19, 2006, § 2, Ord. 3230, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 1-2.02. Prohibited acts.
   Wherever in this Code any act or omission is made unlawful, it shall include
causing, permitting, aiding, abetting, suffering, or concealing the fact of
such act or omission.
Sec. 1-2.03. Imposition of penalties.
   The provisions of this Code which declare certain crimes to be punishable as
therein mentioned devolve a duty upon the court authorized to pass sentence to
determine and impose the punishment described.
Sec. 1-2.04. Determination of punishment.
   Wherever in this Code the punishment for a crime is left undetermined
between certain limits, the punishment to be inflicted in a particular case

limits as may be prescribed by this Code.
Sec. 1-2.05. Place of confinement.
   Every person found guilty of violating any of the provisions of this Code
and sentenced to imprisonment shall be imprisoned in the County Jail.
Sec. 1-2.06. Fees, charges, and taxes made a civil debt.
   The amount of any fee, service charge, utility charge, license, or tax of
any nature whatsoever imposed by any provision of the Municipal Code shall be
deemed a civil debt owing to the City. The City may assign any debt older than
sixty (60) days to a collection agency. Any fees or interest charged by the
collection agency will be added to the debt and become part of the total due.
An action may be commenced in the name of the City in any court of competent
jurisdiction for the collection of the amount of any such delinquent or unpaid
fee, service charge, utility charge, license, or tax, together with any
penalties applicable thereto as prescribed by this Code. The remedy prescribed
by this section shall be accumulative, and the use of an action to collect such
an amount as a debt by civil action shall not bar the use of any other remedy
provided by this Code or by law for the purposes of enforcing provisions
thereof.
(Amended by § 3, Ord. 2785, eff. November 16, 2003)
Sec. 1-2.07. Late charges on delinquent accounts receivable.
   (a)   Any fee, service charge, or other charge of any nature whatsoever,
imposed by any provision of the Municipal Code, which is not paid by the date
the obligation becomes past due shall be deemed a delinquent account
receivable. Any person obligated to pay a delinquent account receivable to the
City shall also pay, as a late charge, a sum equal to ten percent (10%) of the
amount of the delinquent account receivable for the first month delinquent, and
said late charge may be collected in the manner provided in §
1-2.06 of the Municipal Code. In addition to the late charge, the City will
charge a penalty of one-half of one percent (0.5%) per month on all obligations
older than thirty (30) days from the past due date. This is in accordance with
Cal. Gov’t Code § 54348.
   (b)   Any utility charge imposed by any provision of the Municipal Code,
which is not paid by the date the obligation becomes past due, shall be deemed
a delinquent account receivable. Any person obligated to pay a delinquent
account receivable to the City shall also pay, as a late charge, a sum equal to
ten percent (10%) of the amount of the delinquent account receivable for the
first month delinquent, and said late charge may be collected in the manner
provided in §
1-2.06 of the Municipal Code. In addition to the late charge, the City will
charge a penalty of one and one-half of one percent (1.5%) per month on all
obligations older than thirty (30) days from the past due date. This is in
accordance with Cal. Health and Safety Code § 5473.10.
   (c)   Nothing contained in this section shall limit, restrict or otherwise
affect the imposition of greater late charges, interest, penalties or other
charges for late payments as provided for by other sections of the Municipal
Code, or by the laws of the State of California, it being the purpose of this
section to establish a minimum late charge.
(§ 1, Ord. 2461, eff. January 18, 1990; as amended by § 3, Ord. 2785, eff.
November 16, 2003)
Sec. 1-2.08. Charges for checks and credit cards unpaid.
   (a)   Any check presented as payment that is returned unpaid by any
financial institution is subject to a service fee in the amount set forth in
the current Citywide Fee Schedule.
   (b)   Any credit card payment that is stopped by the card user is subject to
a services fee in the amount set forth in the current Citywide Fee Schedule.
(§ 4, Ord. 2785, eff. November 16, 2003, as amended by § 2, Ord. 3211, eff.
July 1, 2022)
Sec. 1-2.09. Collection, lien.
   Any authorized utility fees which remain unpaid for a period of six (6) or
more months after the date upon which they were billed may be collected
thereafter by the City as provided as follows:
   (a)   The City Council shall cause a report of delinquent utility fees to be
prepared periodically. The City Council shall fix a time, date and place for
hearing the report and any objections or protests thereto;
   (b)   The City Council shall cause notice of the hearing to be mailed to
property owners listed on the report not less than fourteen (14) calendar days
prior to the date of the hearing;
   (c)   At the hearing the City Council shall hear any objections or protests
of property owners liable to be assessed for delinquent fees. The City Council
may make such revisions or corrections to the report as it deems just, after
which, by resolution, the report shall be confirmed; and
   (d)   The delinquent fees set forth in the report as confirmed shall
constitute special assessments against the respective parcels of land and are a
lien on the property for the amount of such delinquent fees plus late charges
and cost of lien. A certified copy of the confirmed report shall be filed with
the City Clerk, or auditor appointed by the City Council, for the amount of the
respective assessments against the respective parcels of land as they appear on
the current assessment role. The lien created attaches upon recordation, in the
office of the San Bernardino County Recorder, of a certified copy of the
resolution of confirmation. The assessment may be collected at the same time
and in the same manner as ordinary City ad valorem property taxes are collected
and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in
case of delinquency as provided for such taxes. All laws applicable to the
levy, collection and enforcement of City ad valorem property taxes shall be
applicable to such assessment.
(§ 4, Ord. 2785, eff. November 16, 2003)
Sec. 1-2.10. Civil penalties.
   (a)   The Council finds that there is a need for alternative methods of
enforcement of the Ontario Municipal Code and applicable state codes in
addition to the penalties provided by §
1-2.01. The Council further finds that the assessment of civil penalties is a
necessary alternative method of code enforcement. The administrative assessment
of civil penalties established in this section is in addition to any other
remedies established by law which may be pursued to address Municipal Code or
state law violations.
   (b)   Civil penalties may be assessed against a responsible party for
continued violations of the Municipal Code or applicable state codes, whether
of the same section or any combination, that reflect a continuing disregard for
the requirements of such laws. The Code Enforcement Director or his or her
designee may issue a notice to the responsible party stating the violation,
including a description of the conditions that give rise to the violation, and
assessing a civil penalty pursuant to this section. The civil penalty shall not
begin to accrue until thirty (30) days after the date of the notice. The notice
shall state the City's intention to assess a civil penalty and the amount of
such penalty. The civil penalty may be enforced as a lien or special assessment
pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. The imposition of civil penalties
authorized under this section may be combined with other notices issued under
this Code in the discretion of the City.
   (c)   Notwithstanding subsection (b), the City may provide less than thirty
(30) days' notice to remedy a condition before imposing a civil fine if the
City determines that a specific condition of the property threatens public
health or safety and provided that notice of that determination and time for
compliance is given.
   (d)   Civil penalties may be assessed at a daily rate not to exceed One
Thousand Dollars ($1,000) per day. The actual amount assessed, up to One
Thousand Dollars ($1,000) per day, shall be set by the Code Enforcement
Director, based upon a civil penalties schedule set by the City Manager. In
determining the amount to be imposed on a daily rate, or the actual final
amount to be assessed, the Code Enforcement Director or his or her designee
shall consider the following factors:
      (1)   Duration of the violation.
      (2)   Frequency or occurrence of the violation or other similar
violations.
      (3)   Seriousness of the violation in relation to its threat or impact
upon public health, welfare, or safety.
      (4)   History of violations.
      (5)   Activity taken by the responsible party to obstruct or interfere
with correction of the violation.
      (6)   Good faith or bad faith efforts by responsible party to comply.
      (7)   The impact of the violation on the surrounding property and
community.
      (8)   The financial ability of the responsible party to have corrected
the violation in a timely fashion.
   (e)   Civil penalties, as confirmed by resolution of the City Council, shall
constitute a special assessment against the property to which it relates, and
after its recording, as thus made and confirmed, the same shall constitute a
lien on the property in the amount of such assessment. The notices of such
special assessment, and any other notice required by this section, shall be
provided to the owner by certified mail, as determined from the County
Assessor's or County Recorder's records. The assessment shall be collected at
the same time and in the same manner as ordinary city taxes are collected, and
shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case
of delinquency as provided for ordinary city taxes. All laws applicable to the
levy, collection and enforcement of city taxes shall be applicable to the
special assessment. If any real property to which the cost of abatement relates
has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a
lien of a bona fide encumbrance for value has been created and attaches
thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would
become delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien
against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured
roll for collection. The City may conduct a sale of vacant residential
developed property for which the payment of such assessment made pursuant to
this subdivision is delinquent. Notices or instruments relating to the
abatement proceeding or special assessment may be recorded.
   (f)   Appeals. Upon request by the owner, lessee, occupant, or person having
charge of the affected premises and if received by the Code Enforcement
Director within ten (10) days after mailing the final notice and order or
notice of violation, which includes the imposition of civil penalties to be
assessed, the City Manager or his or her designee shall hold a hearing, which
shall be open to the public. The City Manager or his or her designee shall hear
and consider objections and/or protests from any owner, lessee, occupant,
person having charge of the affected premises, or other interested persons
relative to the accrual of civil penalties. The City Manager or his or her
designee shall hear and receive all relevant evidence and testimony relative to
the violations upon which the civil penalties are based and shall consider all
of the factors listed in subsection (d) of this section. This hearing may be
continued from time to time. Upon or after the conclusion of the hearing, the
City Manager or his or her designee shall determine the amount of civil
penalties to be assessed. This decision shall be final.
   (g)   Unpaid civil penalties may be assessed against the affected premises
as specified in §
1-4.05.
   (h)   Fines and penalties collected resulting from enforcement of this
section shall be placed in the general fund and used solely for the purpose of
the code enforcement program in order to ensure and maintain the character and
well-being of the City.

1-4.04   Hearings
   
1-4.05   Appeal hearing for special assessments
Sec. 1-4.01. Right to appeal.
   Except where an appeals procedure is otherwise specifically provided in this
Code, any person excepting to the denial, suspension, or revocation of a permit
applied for or held by him pursuant to any of the provisions of this Code, or
to any administrative decision made by any official of the City, if the denial,
suspension, or revocation of such permit or the determination of such
administrative decision involves the exercise of administrative discretion or
personal judgment exercised pursuant to any of the provisions of this Code, may
appeal in writing to the Council by filing with the City Clerk a written notice
of such appeal, setting forth the specific grounds.
   No appeal may be taken to any such administrative decision made by an
official of the City pursuant to the provisions of this chapter unless such
decision to appeal has been first taken up with the department head concerned.
   No right of appeal to the Council from any administrative decision made by
an official of the City pursuant to any of the provisions of this Code shall
exist when such decision is ministerial and thus does not involve the exercise
of administrative discretion or personal judgment exercised pursuant to any of
the provisions of this Code, whether the administrative decision involves the
denial, suspension, or revocation of a permit or any other administrative
decision.
Sec. 1-4.02. Time limit for filing.
   (a)   The appellant shall file a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within
fourteen (14) days after service of the notice of the administrative decision

appeal.

      (1)   The full name, mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone
number of the appellant;
      (2)   A description of the specific action or decision being appealed,
including the date of the action; and

officer to understand the nature of the controversy.
   (c)   If the City Clerk does not receive a timely notice of appeal, if the
notice of appeal is incomplete, or if the notice of appeal does not comply with
all of the requirements set forth in this section, the right to appeal the
action is waived. In this event, the action is final and binding. A failure to
file a timely or proper notice of appeal also constitutes a failure to exhaust
administrative remedies.
(§ 3, Ord. 3230, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 1-4.03. Hearings: Notices.
   Upon receipt of the filing of the notice of appeal in proper form, the City

immediately, the Council shall set the matter for hearing at the next regularly

be as specified in this section.
   (a)   Notice. The notice of assessment shall be served, by certified mail,
to the property owner, if the property owner’s identity can be determined from
the County Assessor’s or County Recorder’s records. The notice of assessment
shall specify that the property may be sold after three or more years by the
tax collector for unpaid delinquent assessments, in accordance with state law
or San Bernardino county ordinance. The notice of assessment shall also provide
that the person receiving the notice is entitled to request a hearing to

1-4.05(b), so long as such request is received by the Code Enforcement Director
within thirty (30) days after mailing the notice of assessment.
   (b)   Hearing. Upon request by any person or entity entitled to notice

protests to the assessment itself or the amount of the assessment. The City

hearing, the City Manager or his or her designee shall, based upon the evidence
presented at the hearing, determine whether all or part of the abatement costs,
fees, fines, or penalties shall be assessed against the affected parcel. The
decision of the City Manager or his or her designee shall be provided either at
the hearing or in writing to the person or entity requesting the appeal at the
address provided in the request for appeal and shall be final. Any further
appeals shall be in accord with Cal. Code of Civil Proc. §§ 1094.5 or 1094.6,
and/or Cal. Gov’t Code § 53069.4, as applicable.
   (c)   Resolution and assessment. If the City Manager or his or her designee
determines that the property should be assessed, and the amount to be assessed
has not been paid within thirty (30) days of the final decision, the City
Council may approve the amount of the special assessment, as determined by the
City Manager or his or her designee, by resolution, and cause the same to be
recorded on the assessment roll. The assessment shall be collected at the same
time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and
shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case
of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to
the levy, collection and enforcement of city taxes shall be applicable to the

or special assessment may be recorded with the County Recorder.

Sec. 2-1.301. City Council Electoral System
   (a)    At-large election - Mayor. Pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 34886, the
mayor shall be voted on at-large.
   (b)   City Council districts established. Four City Council districts are
hereby established in the City of Ontario. The boundaries and identifying
number of each district shall be as described on the Council District Map 17
attached to Ord. 3224 as Exhibit "A" and incorporated herein by this reference.
   (c)   Election of members of the City Council by district.
      (1)   Following the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
section and upon the commencement of "by district" elections in the order
established in section (d) of this § 2-1.301, members of the City Council shall
be elected "by district" as defined in Cal. Gov’t Code § 34871 or any successor
statute. Except for the Mayor, a person shall not be eligible to be elected to
be a member of the City Council unless he or she is otherwise qualified as
required by law and resided in the district, and both resided in the
geographical area making up the district from which he or she is nominated to
be elected and was a registered voter of the City of Ontario at the time
nomination papers are issued to the candidate as provided for in § 10227 of the
Cal. Elections Code. It is the intent of the City Council, in enacting this
article, that no term of any member of the City Council that commences on or
prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section shall be
affected prior to its expiration date.
      (2)   Registered voters signing nomination papers or voting for a member
of the City Council shall be residents of the geographical area making up the
district from which the member is to be elected.
      (3)   The terms of the office of each member elected to the City Council,
including the Mayor, shall remain four years.
   (d)   Commencement of district elections. It is the intent of the City
Council, in enacting this article, that this section shall not affect any term
of office in existence or commencing on or before the effective date of the
ordinance codified in this section. Commencing with the general municipal
election in November of 2024 and thereafter, the voters in districts 1 (one)
and 4 (four) shall elect members of the City Council by district for full four-
year terms. At the general municipal election in 2026 and thereafter, the
voters in districts 2 (two) and 3 (three) shall elect members of the City
Council and the Mayor shall be elected at large for full four-year terms.
   (e)   Adjustment of boundaries.
      (1)   Pursuant to Elections Code § 21601, as it may be amended, the City
Council shall, by ordinance or resolution, adjust the boundaries of any or all
of the districts following each decennial federal census. Using the census as a
basis, the City Council shall adjust the boundaries so that the districts shall
be as nearly equal in population as practicable and in compliance with all
applicable provisions of law. Any adjustment of district boundaries shall be
made by ordinance or resolution, adopted by the City Council before the first
day of November of the year following the year in which each decennial federal
census is taken. Prior to the public hearing approving the adjustment of the
district boundaries, the City Council shall hold at least one public hearing on
the proposed district boundaries as required by Election Code § 21607.
      (2)   At the time of any annexation of territory to the City, the City
Council shall designate, by resolution adopted by a vote of at least a majority
of the City Council, the contiguous district to which the annexed territory
shall be a part and shall amend the district boundaries if necessary in
accordance with Election Code § 21603, as it may be amended.
      (3)   Pursuant to Elections Code § 21606, the term of office of any
Council member who has been elected and whose term of office has not expired
shall not be affected by any change in the boundaries of the district from
which he or she was elected. At the first election for Council following
adjustment of the boundaries of the districts, a person meeting the
requirements of Gov’t Code § 34882 shall be elected to the City Council for
each district under the readjusted district plan that has the same district
number as a district whose incumbent's term on the Council is due to expire.
   (f)   Implementation. If necessary to facilitate the implementation of this
article, the City Clerk is authorized to make technical adjustments to the
district boundaries that do not substantively affect the populations in the
districts, the eligibility of candidates, or the residence of elected officials
within any district. The City Clerk shall consult with the City Manager and
City Attorney concerning any technical adjustments deemed necessary and shall
advise the City Council of any such adjustments required in the implementation
of the districts.

to the emergency.

Sec. 3-1.121. Effect of prosecution.

(§ 1, Ord. 2526, eff. April 8, 1992)
Sec. 3-1.122. Annual statement of licensee.
   (a)   Filing of statement. In all cases where the amount of business license
taxes to be paid by any person is based upon the amount of gross receipts, or

space, such person, before obtaining a license for business and within sixty
(60) days after the beginning of each license period, shall file with the
License Official a written statement in the form required by the License
Official, supported by such documentation requested by the License Official,
showing the total amount of gross receipts during the preceding calendar year,

this statement and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is a true, correct
and complete statement, made in good faith for the period stated.”

this section as to the gross receipts of a particular person shall be
confidential in character and shall not be subject to public inspection. It
shall be the duty of the License Official to preserve and keep such gross
receipts information so that it may not become known except to the persons
charged by law with the administration of this chapter.
   (d)   Statement not conclusive. No statement filed pursuant to this section
shall be conclusive upon the City or upon any officer thereof as to the matters
therein set forth, and the same shall not prejudice the right of the City to
recover any amount that may be ascertained to be due from such person in
addition to the amount shown by such statement should it be found to be
incorrect.
   (e)   Newly established business license renewal. In any case where an
original business license is to be issued for a newly established business, the
minimum business license tax applicable for that type of business shall be paid
for the original license. At the date of renewal, an additional tax shall be
charged, based upon the gross receipts of such business during the prior year,
at the tax rate applicable for such business, after deducting from the amount
so found to be due the amount paid at the time such original license was
issued. This subsection applies only to businesses which are taxed on the basis
of gross receipts.
   (f)   Accuracy of statement subject to audit. The correctness of any
statement filed pursuant to this section shall be subject to audit and
verification by the License Official, who is hereby authorized and empowered to
inspect and audit the books and records of any and all persons licensed to

   The Council hereby declares that the provisions of this chapter are adopted
to achieve the following, among other, purposes and directs that the provisions
of this chapter be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:
   (a)   To adopt a sales and use tax law which complies with the requirements
and limitations set forth in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code of the State (commencing with Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7200);
   (b)   To adopt a sales and use tax law which incorporates provisions
identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State insofar as those
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations set forth
in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code of the State
(commencing with Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7200);
   (c)   To adopt a sales and use tax law which imposes a tax and provides a
measure therefor which can be administered and collected by the State Board of
Equalization in a manner which adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and
requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the sales and use taxes of the State; and
   (d)   To adopt a sales and use tax law which can be administered in a manner
that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of
Division 2 of said Revenue and Taxation Code (commencing with Cal. Rev. & Tax.
Code § 7200), minimize the cost of collecting City sales and use taxes and at
the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to
taxation under the provisions of this chapter.
(§ 1, Ord. 1873, eff. January 1, 1976)
Sec. 3-5.05. Contract with State Board of Equalization.
   Prior to the operative date of this chapter, the City shall contract with
the State Board of Equalization to perform all the functions incident to the
administration and operation of this sales and use tax law; provided, however,
if the City shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization
prior to such operative date, the City shall nevertheless so contract, and, in
such a case, the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar
quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of
the first calendar quarter following the adoption of this chapter.
(§ 1, Ord. 1873, eff. January 1, 1976)
Sec. 3-5.06. Sales taxes.
   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is
hereby imposed upon all retailers in the City at the rate set forth in §
3-5.02 of this chapter of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of
all tangible personal property sold at retail in the City on and after the
operative date of this chapter.
(§ 1, Ord. 1873, eff. January 1, 1976)
Sec. 3-5.07. Place of sale.
   For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the

delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-State destination or to a
common carrier for delivery to an out-of-State destination. The gross receipts
from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject
to the State sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is
made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the State
or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail
sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be
prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.
(§ 1, Ord. 1873, eff. January 1, 1976)
Sec. 3-5.08. Use taxes.
   An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or other consumption in

in the City at the rate set forth in §
3-5.02 of this chapter of the sales price of the property. The sales price

and Taxation Code of the State (commencing with Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7200),
all of the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code
(commencing with Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6001) are hereby adopted and made a
part of this chapter as though fully set forth in this chapter.
(§ 1, Ord. 1873, eff. January 1, 1976)

wherever the State is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of
the City shall be substituted therefor. Such substitution, however, shall not
be made when the word “State” is used as part of the title of the State
Controller, the State Treasurer, the State Board of Control, the State Board of
Equalization, the State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State; the
substitution shall not be made when the result of that substitution would
require action to be taken by or against the City, or any agency thereof,
rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the
functions incident to the administration or operation of the provisions of this
chapter; the substitution shall not be made in those sections, including, but
not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of
the State, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an
exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use, or other
consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt
from this tax while such sales, storage, use, or other consumption remains
subject to tax by the State under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code (commencing with Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6001), or to
impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use, or other
consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by
the State under the provisions of the Code; the substitution shall not be made
in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §§ 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof),
6711, 6715, 6737, 6797, or 6828; and the substitution shall not be made for the
word “State” in the phrase “retailer engaged in business in this State” in Cal.
Rev. & Tax. Code § 6203 or in the definition of that phrase in Cal. Rev. & Tax.
Code § 6203.
(§ 1, Ord. 1873, eff. January 1, 1976)
Sec. 3-5.11. Permits not required.

the gross receipts from the sale of which have been subject to tax under a
sales and use tax ordinance enacted in accordance with Part 1.5 of Division 2
of the Revenue and Taxation Code (commencing with Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7200)
by any city and county, county, or city in this state shall be exempt from the
tax due under this chapter.
   (c)   There are exempted from the computation of the amount of the sales tax
the gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property to operators of
aircraft to be used or consumed principally outside the city in which the sale
is made and directly and exclusively in the use of such aircraft as common
carriers of persons or property under the authority of the laws of this State,
the United States, or any foreign government.
   (d)   In addition to the exemptions provided in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §§
6366 and 6366.1, the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal
property purchased by operators of aircraft and used or consumed by such
operators directly and exclusively in the use of such aircraft as common
carriers of persons or property for hire or compensation under a certificate of
public convenience and necessity issued pursuant to the laws of this State, the
United States, or any foreign government is exempted from the use tax.

which amendments relate to sales and use taxes and which are not inconsistent
with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of said Revenue and Taxation Code
(commencing with Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7200), shall automatically become a
part of this chapter.
(§ 1, Ord. 1873, eff. January 1, 1976)
Sec. 3-5.14. Enjoining collection forbidden.
   No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall
issue in any suit, action, or proceeding in any court against the State or the
City, or against any officer of the State or the City, to prevent or enjoin the
collection under this chapter or Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code of the State (commencing with Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7200) of

principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the
principal or the managing agent, however, shall be considered to be compliance
by both.
   (d)   “Person” shall mean any individual, short-term renter, vacation
renter, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal
organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust,
receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a
unit.
   (e)   “Rent” shall mean the consideration charged, whether or not received,
for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received
in money, goods, labor, or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits,
property, and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (f)   “Tax Administrator” shall mean the Executive Director of Finance of
the City of Ontario, or his or her authorized representative.
   (g)   “Transient” shall mean any person who exercises occupancy or is
entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access,
license, or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar
days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person
so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the
period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days has expired unless there is an
agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a
longer period of occupancy. Any individual person who exercises or is entitled
to occupancy for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less
shall be deemed to be a transient, regardless of whether the reservation and/or
payment for occupancy is made directly by the person exercising occupancy or
another person, or entity. The intent is to tax the individual person
occupying, or having the right or entitlement to occupancy, the hotel room.
“Transient” includes any employee or officer of the State government or of the
government of a political subdivision of the State. “Transient” does not mean
or include any Federal officer or employee when on official Federal government
business, or any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by
reason of express provision of Federal law or international treaty, who
exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession,
permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for a period of thirty
(30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as
full days.
   In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of
time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the
provisions of this chapter may be considered.

Sec. 3-6.03. Tax imposed.
   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient shall be subject
to and shall pay a tax in the amount of eleven and three-quarters percent
(11¾%) of the rent charged by the operator. Such tax shall constitute a debt
owed by the transient to the City, which debt shall be extinguished only by
payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the
operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in
installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each
installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy
space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator
of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may require that such tax shall be paid
directly to the City.

Sec. 3-6.04. Exemptions from provision.
   (a)   No tax shall be imposed upon:
      (1)   Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond
the power of the City to impose the tax provided for in this chapter; and
      (2)   Any Federal officer or employee when on official Federal government
business, or any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by
reason of express provision of Federal law or international treaty, who
exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession,
permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for a period of thirty
(30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as
full days.
   (b)   No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the
time the rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed
by the Tax Administrator. Any Federal officer or employee when on official
federal government business claiming such an exemption shall provide to the
operator as conclusive evidence that his or her occupancy is for the official
business of his or her employer:
      (1)   Travel orders from his or her government employer; or a government
warrant issued by his or her employer to pay for the occupancy; or a government
credit card issued by his or her employer to pay for the occupancy; and
      (2)   Photo identification, proof of his or her governmental employment
as an employee or officer as described in subsection (b)(1), and proof,
consistent with these provisions, that his or her occupancy is for the official
business of his or her governmental employer.

and § 2, Ord. 3234, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 3-6.05. Operator's duties.
   Each operator shall collect and hold in trust for the account and benefit of
the City the tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter to the same extent
and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount
of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged.
   No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether
directly or indirectly, that the tax, or any part thereof, will be assumed or
absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if
added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter.
(§ 5, Ord. 1569, eff. July 1, 1965, as amended by § 3, Ord. 2925, eff. July 15,

Sec. 3-6.06. Letting of rooms to minors prohibited; Exceptions.
   Letting of rooms to minors shall be prohibited. Any person or corporation
owning, controlling or managing any hotel in the City, who rents or lets any
room or rooms to, or allows any room or rooms to be occupied by any minor under
the age of eighteen (18) years, unless such minor is accompanied by his or her
parent, parents, or legal guardian, shall immediately by telephone, and within
twenty-four (24) hours by written report, notify the Ontario Police Department
of such fact.
(§ 2, Ord. 3234, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 3-6.07. Hotel registration and certificate.
   On or before May 6, 1965, or within thirty (30) days after commencing
business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting an occupancy
to transients shall register such hotel with the Tax Administrator and obtain
from the Tax Administrator a “Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate.”
Any operator that operates a hotel within the City shall at all times post the
certificate in a conspicuous place on the hotel premises. All other operators
shall maintain a copy of the certificate at their place of business, as
indicated on the certificate. Such certificate shall, among other things, set
forth the following information:
   (a)   The name of the operator;
   (b)   The address of the hotel;
   (c)   The date upon which the certificate was issued; and
   (d)   A statement as follows: “This Transient Occupancy Registration
Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled
the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Law by registering with
the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the
Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting such tax to the City. This certificate
shall not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct
any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without
strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including, but not limited
to, those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department, or office
of this City. This certificate shall not constitute a permit.”
(§ 6, Ord. 1569, eff. July 1, 1965, as amended by § 4, Ord. 2925, eff. July 15,
2010, and § 2, Ord. 3234, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 3-6.08. Guest registration.
   (a)   Every manager or person in control of any hotel in the city shall keep
a register for the registration of transient guests. The guest register shall
at all times be open and subject to reasonable inspection by city officials or
by any law enforcement officer in the City.
   (b)   Guests Must Register. No person in control of any hotel in the city
shall let or assign for temporary or transient occupancy any suite, room or bed
in that hotel, to any person until after such person shall have registered his
or her name and address in the register herein provided to be kept, and
thereafter such register shall be made to show correctly the year, month, day
and hour of the arrival of such person at the hotel and the number of the suite
or room let or assigned to such guest; and such person in control of such hotel
or the letting of any suite, room or bed therein shall at the time of the
departure of each guest, endorse upon such register the date of such departure,
nor shall any person erase or alter any name or address written in such
register.
   (c)   Registration Information Required. The operator of any hotel shall
keep a register on forms approved by or supplied by the City, of the names and
home or business addresses of all persons to be accommodated with the length of
stay indicated. At the time of registration, the operator or his or her
employee shall verify the identification of the registrant by requesting to
see, and copying onto the registration form any of the following: the
registrant's valid driver's license number, the registrant's valid military
identification, the registrant's valid passport number and country of issuance.
The operator or his or her employee must also include on the registration forms
the make, type and license number of the registrant's automobile, trailer or
other vehicle, and the state in which such vehicle is registered and the year
of registration, for any vehicle that is parked on the premises. Hotels that
can demonstrate that they take sufficient reasonable steps to control access to
and from parking areas on the premises shall not be required to include this
information on registration forms. Such sufficient reasonable steps to control
access to and from parking areas shall include, but not be limited to, valet
parking, automated access gates, and parking attendants.
   (d)   Pre-Arrival Registration. In the event that the hotel utilizes a pre-
arrival registration or approval procedure that obviates the requirement for an
arriving guest to go to the front desk and provide information typically
required as part of the hotel's customary registration process, the hotel shall
not be required to comply with subsection (c) of this section; provided,
however, that the hotel's pre-arrival registration or approval procedure must
be submitted to and approved by the Tax Administrator, and the facility must
obtain such guest related information of the type specified in subsection (c)
as the Tax Administrator might reasonably require.
   (e)   Illegal Registration. No person shall register at any hotel in the
city, under the name of any other person, or by any assumed, false or
fictitious name. No person placing any information required by this section
shall falsely or inaccurately state such information.
(§ 2, Ord. 3234, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 3-6.09. Reporting and remitting.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of each calendar month, make a return to the Tax Administrator, on forms
provided by him or her, of the total rents charged and received and the amount
of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed,
the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the City. The Tax
Administrator may require further information in the return. Returns and
payments submitted by United States mail or other mail delivery service shall
be deemed to have been made as of the date post marked. Returns and payments
submitted electronically Monday through Friday before 5:00 p.m., shall be
deemed to have been paid that same day. Returns and payments submitted
electronically Monday through Friday after 5:00 p.m., shall be deemed to have
been paid the following calendar day. Returns and payments submitted
electronically Friday after 5:00 p.m., Saturday, Sunday, or any day in which
the City is closed for business, shall be deemed to have been paid the next
business day. Any payment received after the due date, regardless of weekend or
holiday, will be considered late, with penalties and interest applying. All
taxes collected by operators pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall
be held in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to
the City.
(§ 7, Ord. 1569, eff. July 1, 1965, as amended by § 5, Ord. 2925, eff. July 15,

(§ 2, Ord. 3234, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 3-6.11. Penalties and interest.
   (a)   Original delinquency. Any operator who shall fail to report and remit
any tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter within the time required
shall pay a penalty in the amount of one-half of one percent (0.5%) per day of
the tax due and owing in addition to the amount of the tax, up to thirty (30)
days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent.
   (b)   Continued delinquency. Any operator who shall fail to remit any
delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the
date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second
delinquency penalty in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the tax due and owing
in addition to the amount of the tax and the one-half of one percent (0.5%)
penalty, up to thirty (30) days, first imposed pursuant to subsection (a).
   (c)   Fraud. If the Tax Administrator shall determine that the non-payment
of any remittance due pursuant to the provisions of this chapter is due to
fraud, a penalty in the amount of twenty five percent (25%) of the amount of
the tax due and owing shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties set
forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.
   (d)   Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who shall
fail to remit any tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall pay
interest at the rate of one-half of one percent (0.5%) per month, or fraction
thereof, on the amount of the tax due and owing, exclusive of penalties, from
the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.
   (e)   Penalties and interest merged with tax. Every penalty imposed and such
interest as accrues pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become a
part of the tax required to be paid by the provisions of this chapter.
   (f)   Civil Penalties. Any violation of this chapter, and any failure to pay
assessed penalties, delinquencies, or interest specified herein may result in
alternative remedies, such as referral to a collection agency, civil action, or
any other legal remedy.
   (g)   Criminal Penalties. In addition to the penalties, delinquencies,
interest, or other consequences set forth in subsections (a) through (e) above,
any operator who fails or refuses to collect the tax, fails or refuses to make
any return, fails or refuses to keep adequate records or open them up for
inspection by the city, fails or refuses to furnish other data reasonably
requested by the Tax Administrator, or makes a false or fraudulent return with
intent to evade the tax, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction
thereof, shall be punished pursuant to Ontario Municipal Code Chapter 1-2
(Penalty Provisions). Each and every day during any portion of which any
violation is committed, continued, or permitted, shall constitute a separate
offense and shall be punished accordingly.
   (h)   Waiver. Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary,
the Tax Administrator may waive any penalty or interest, or any portion
thereof, imposed upon a person required to collect and/or remit for failure to
collect the tax imposed by this chapter if the non-collection occurred in good
faith. In determining whether the non-collection was in good faith, the Tax
Administrator will take into consideration industry practice or other objective
precedents.
(§ 8, Ord. 1569, eff. July 1, 1965, as amended by § 6, Ord. 2925, eff. July 15,
2010, and § 2, Ord. 3234, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 3-6.12. Failure to collect and report tax.
   (a)   Determination. If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect such
tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and
remittance of such tax, or any portion thereof, required by the provisions of
this chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed in such manner as he or she
may deem best to obtain the facts and information on which to base his or her
estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator shall procure such
facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the
assessment of any such tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter and
payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to
make such report and remittance, the Tax Administrator shall proceed to
determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest, and penalties
provided for by the provisions of this chapter. In the event such determination
is made, the Tax Administrator shall give notice of the amount so assessed by
serving it personally or depositing it in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place
of address.
   (b)   Hearing. Such operator may, within ten (10) days after the service or
mailing of such notice, make an application in writing to the Tax Administrator
for a hearing on the amount assessed. If an application by the operator for a
hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest, and
penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and
conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such an application is made, the
Tax Administrator shall give not less than five (5) days' written notice in the
manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and
place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed
for such tax, interest, and penalties. At such hearing the operator may appear
and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest, and penalties should not
be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax Administrator shall determine the
proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the
person in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the
amount of such tax, interest, and penalties. The amount determined to be due
shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is filed as provided
in §
3-6.10 of this chapter.
(§ 9, Ord. 1569, eff. July 1, 1965, and § 2, Ord. 3234, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 3-6.13. Appeals.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Administrator with respect
to the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
City Manager, or his or her designee, by filing a notice of appeal with the
City Clerk within fifteen (15) days after the service or mailing of the
determination of the tax due. The City Manager, or his or her designee, shall
fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give
notice in writing to such operator at his or her last known place of address.
The findings of the City Manager, or his or her designee, shall be final and
conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed in
this chapter for the service of a notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due
shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(§ 10, Ord. 1569, eff. July 1, 1965, as amended by § 2, Ord. 3234, eff. January
19, 2023)
Sec. 3-6.14. Recordkeeping and inspection.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and
payment to the City of any tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter to
keep and preserve, for a period of four (4) years, all records as may be
necessary to determine the amount of such tax as the operator may have been
liable for the collection of and payment to the City. All records shall be
maintained in conformance with standards set forth by the Tax Administrator.
The Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect such records at all
reasonable times.
   (b)   Any audit which must be performed to secure compliance with the terms
of this section is to be performed in the city of Ontario. If for any reason
the audit cannot be performed in Ontario, the operator shall reimburse the City
for the actual cost of all transportation, lodging, meals, travel time and
other incidental costs reasonably incurred by the City in conducting the audit.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, of any person required to
collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this chapter. The Tax Administrator
shall notify said person of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the
absence of fraud or other intentional misconduct, the audit period of review
shall not exceed a period of four (4) years next preceding the date of receipt
of the written notice by said person from the Tax Administrator. Upon
completion of the audit, the Tax Administrator may make a deficiency
determination pursuant to Section
3-6.09 of this chapter for all taxes, penalties and interest owed and not paid,
as evidenced by information provided by such person to the Tax Administrator.
If said person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient records to enable
the Tax Administrator to verify compliance with this chapter, the Tax
Administrator is authorized to make a reasonable estimate of the deficiency.
Said reasonable estimate shall be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
correctness.
(§ 11, Ord. 1569, eff. July 1, 1965, as amended by § 2, Ord. 3234, eff. January
19, 2023)
Sec. 3-6.15. Refunds.
   (a)   Claim. Whenever the amount of any tax, interest, or penalty has been
overpaid, or paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, such amount
may be refunded as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section provided
a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific
grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator
within one (1) year after the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms
furnished by the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   Operator’s compensation. An operator may claim a refund or take as
credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than
once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established
in a manner prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the
tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, neither a refund
nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has
either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable
by the transient to the operator.
   (c)   Transient’s compensation. A transient may obtain a refund of taxes
overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a)
of this section but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the
Tax Administrator, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator,
establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that the transient has
been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)   Evidence. No refund shall be paid pursuant to the provisions of this
section unless the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written
records showing entitlement thereto.
   (e)   Eligibility. The Tax Administrator shall determine the eligibility of
any person who asserts a right to a refund from the tax imposed by this
chapter.
(§ 12, Ord. 1569, eff. July 1, 1965 as amended by § 2, Ord. 2746, eff. October
4, 2001, and § 2, Ord. 3234, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 3-6.16. Actions to collect.
   (a)   Collection. Any tax required to be paid by any transient pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to
the City. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the
City shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing
money to the City pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to
an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount.
   (b)   Liens. When the fines, penalties, and related costs are not paid
within the prescribed time, the amount of those fines, penalties, and their
related costs may be recorded as a lien upon and against the hotel without
further hearing, subject to notice of the lien as required by law.
(§ 13, Ord. 1569, eff. July 1, 1965, as amended by § 2, Ord. 3234, eff. January
19, 2023)
Sec. 3-6.17. Cessation or change of ownership.
   (a)   Cessation of Business. If any operator liable for any amount under
this chapter sells out, transfers, or quits his or her business, he or she
shall make a final return and remittance within fifteen (15) days after the
date of selling or quitting the business.
   (b)   Duty of Successor, Assignee, or Transferee. If any operator liable for
any amount of tax, interest or penalty under this chapter sells out, transfers,
or quits his or her business, his or her successors, assigns, or transferees
shall withhold sufficiently from the purchase price to cover such amount until
the former owner produces from the Tax Administrator either a receipt
reflecting full payment or a certificate stating that no amount is due. If a
purchaser of a business fails to withhold from the purchase price as required,
he or she shall be personally liable for the payment of the amount required to
be withheld by him or her to the extent of the purchase price.
(§ 2, Ord. 3234, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 3-6.18. Additional powers and duties of the Tax Administrator.
   (a)   General. The Tax Administrator shall have the power and duty, and is
hereby directed, to enforce each and all of the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   Administrative Rules, Regulations and Discretion. The Tax
Administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations not inconsistent
with provisions of this chapter for the purpose of interpreting, clarifying,
carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes
herein imposed. The administrative ruling shall not impose a new tax, revise an
existing tax methodology as stated in this section, or increase an existing
tax, except as allowed by Cal. Gov’t Code § 53750(h)(2), as may be amended or
renumbered from time to time. A copy of such administrative rules and
regulations shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office. To the extent
that the Tax Administrator determines that the tax imposed under this chapter
shall not be collected in full for any period of time from any particular
operator or transient, that determination shall be considered an exercise of
the Tax Administrator's discretion to settle disputes and shall not constitute
a change in taxing methodology for purposes of Gov’t Code § 53750 or otherwise.
The Tax Administrator is not authorized to amend the City's methodology for
purposes of Gov’t Code § 53750 and the City does not waive or abrogate its
ability to impose the Transient Occupancy Tax in full as a result of
promulgating administrative rulings or entering into agreements.
   (c)   Administrative Agreements. Upon a proper showing of good cause, the
Tax Administrator may make administrative agreements, with appropriate
conditions, to vary from the strict requirements of this chapter and thereby:
      1.   Conform to the billing procedures of a particular operator so long
as said agreements result in the collection of the tax in conformance with the
general purpose and scope of this chapter; or
      2.   To avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection and
remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such agreement
shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office, and are voidable by the Tax
Administrator or the City Manager at any time.
   (d)   Compromise Limits. The Tax Administrator, with the written approval of
the City Attorney, may compromise a claim pursuant to this chapter where the
portion of the tax proposed to be released is less than five thousand dollars
(5,000.00); and, with the approval of the City Attorney and the City Council,

seventy five cents ($1.75) per vehicle per day, or twelve point five percent
(12.5%) of the monthly charge where the charge is made on a monthly basis, for
occupying any parking station pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid upon any occupancy on or after
the operative date, although such occupancy is had pursuant to a contract,
lease, or other arrangement made prior to such date.
(§ 1, Ord. 2259, eff. January 5, 1984, as amended by § 1, Ord. 2508, eff. July
3, 1991, § 1, Ord. 2529, eff. October 15, 1992, § 1, Ord. 2566, eff. February

Sec. 3-8.02. Persons liable for tax.
   Every occupant occupying parking space in a parking station in this City
shall be liable for the tax imposed herein. This liability shall not be
extinguished until the tax has been paid to the City, except that a receipt
from an operator maintaining a place of business in this City or from an
operator who is authorized by the Finance Director under such rules and
regulations as he may prescribe, to collect the tax and who is for the purposes
of this chapter regarded as an operator maintaining a place of business in this
City, which receipt is given to the occupant pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter, shall be sufficient to relieve the occupant from further liability for
the tax to which the receipt refers.
(§ 1, Ord. 2259, eff. January 5, 1984)
Sec. 3-8.03. Collection of tax by operators: Receipt to occupant: Rules for
collection schedules.
   Every operator maintaining a place of business in this City and renting
parking space in a parking station in this City shall at the time of collecting
the rent from the occupant and on demand give to the occupant a receipt
therefor. In all cases in which the tax is not collected by the operator, as
aforesaid, the person upon whom such tax is imposed shall pay the same when due
to the Finance Director of the City. In all cases of transactions upon credit
or deferred payment, the payment of tax to the operator may be deferred in
accordance therewith, and the operator shall be liable therefor at the time and
to the extent that such credits are paid or deferred payments are made in
accordance with the rate of tax owing on the amount thereof.
   The Finance Director shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations
prescribing methods and schedules for the collection and payment of the tax and
such methods and schedules shall provide that the fractional part of five one-
hundredths of a dollar ($.05) shall be disregarded unless it amounts to two and
one-half one-hundredths of a dollar ($.025) or more, in which case the amount
(determined without regard to the fractional part of five one-hundredths of a
dollar) shall be increased by five one-hundredths of a dollar ($.05).
(§ 1, Ord. 2259, eff. January 5, 1984)
Sec. 3-8.04. Registration of operator.
   Every person in or about to engage in business as an operator of a parking
station in this City shall immediately register with the Finance Director on a
form provided by said Finance Director. Persons engaged in such business must
so register not later than fifteen (15) days after the operative date of this
tax, but such privilege of such registration after the said operative date of
such tax shall not relieve any person from the obligation of payment or
collection of tax on and after the said operative date, regardless of
registration. Such registration shall set forth the name under which such
person transacts or intends to transact business, the location of his place or
places of business and such other information to facilitate the collection of
the tax as the Finance Director may require. The registration shall be signed
by the owner if a natural person; in case of an association or partnership, by
a member or partner; in the case of a corporation, by an executive officer or
some person specifically authorized by the corporation to sign the
registration. The Finance Director shall within thirty (30) days after such
registration issue without charge a certificate of authority to each registrant
to collect the tax from the occupant, together with a duplicate thereof for
each additional place of business of such registrant. Each certificate and
duplicate shall state the place of business to which it is applicable and shall
be prominently displayed therein so as to be seen and come to the notice
readily of all occupants and persons seeking occupancy. Such certificates shall
be nonassignable and non-transferable and shall be surrendered immediately to
the Finance Director upon the cessation of business at the location named or
upon its sale or transfer.
   If the Finance Director deems its necessary in order to facilitate initial
registration hereunder of persons engaged in business on or prior to the date
of imposition of the tax as set forth in this chapter, he may prescribe
provisions therefor other than those provided in this section. Such provisions
shall be made to effect the purpose thereof. For such purposes, such provisions
shall be in lieu of those herein provided. Such registration and the
certificate thereof shall have the same effect as that provided herein.

Sec. 3-8.06. Examination of records.
   The Finance Director or any person authorized in writing by him may examine
the books, papers, records and equipment of any person liable for the tax and
may investigate the character of the business of the person in order to verify
the accuracy of any return made or if no return is made by the person, to
ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid.
(§ 1, Ord. 2259, eff. January 5, 1984)
Sec. 3-8.07. Authority to require reports.

shall set forth the rental charged for each occupancy, the date or dates of
occupancy, and such other information as the Finance Director may require.
(§ 1, Ord. 2259, eff. January 5, 1984)
Sec. 3-8.08. Time of payment.

due and payable and delivered to the Finance Director of the City not later
than the twentieth (20th) day of each calendar month following the month in
which said taxes were collected.
(§ 1, Ord. 2259, eff. January 5, 1984)
Sec. 3-8.09. Extension of time to file.
   For good cause, the Finance Director may extend for not to exceed one month
the time for making any return or payment of tax. Any person to whom an
extension is granted who makes return and pays the tax within the period of
such extension shall pay, in addition to the tax interest on the amount thereof
at the rate of one percent (1%) per month or fraction thereof, for the period
of such extension to the time of return and payment.
(§ 1, Ord. 2259, eff. January 5, 1984)
Sec. 3-8.10. Deficiency determination.
   If the Finance Director is not satisfied with the return or returns of the
tax or the amount of the tax required to be paid to the City by any person, he
may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of the
facts contained in the return or returns or upon the basis of any information

than one period.

   In making a determination, the Finance Director may offset overpayments for

underpayments for another period or periods against penalties, and against the
interest on the underpayments. The interest on underpayments and overpayments
shall be computed in the manner set forth in §
3-8.11.
(§ 1, Ord. 2259, eff. January 5, 1984)
Sec. 3-8.13. Time for payment of amounts found due: Penalty for delinquency.
   All determinations of the Finance Director made hereunder are due and
payable at the time they become final. If they are not paid when due and
payable, a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the determination,

   Any person who fails to pay any tax to the City or any amount of tax
required to be collected and paid to the City, except amounts of determinations
made by the Finance Director pursuant hereto within the time required, shall
pay a penalty of ten percent (10%) penalty of the tax or amount of the tax in
addition to the tax or amount of tax plus interest at the rate of one percent
(1%) per month or fraction thereof from the date on which the tax or the amount
of tax required to be collected became due and payable to the City until the

(§ 1, Ord. 2259, eff. January 5, 1984)
Sec. 3-8.16. Determination if no return is made.
   (a)   Estimate of Gross Receipts: Computation of Tax Penalty. If any person
fails to make a return, the Finance Director shall make an estimate of the
amount of the gross receipts of the person or, as the case may be, of the
amount of the total rentals in this City which are subject to the tax. The
estimate shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the person
failed to make a return and shall be based upon any information which is in the
Finance Director's possession or may come into his possession. Upon the basis
of this estimate, the Finance Director shall compute and determine the amount
required to be paid to the City, adding to the sum thus arrived at a penalty
equal to ten percent (10%) thereof. One or more determinations may be made for
one or for more than one period.
   (b)   Manner of Computation: Offsets: Interest. In making a determination,
the Finance Director may offset overpayments for a period or periods, together
with interest on the overpayments, against underpayments for another period or

Sec. 3-12.01. Purpose.
   This chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes, and
directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those
purposes:
   (a)   To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the
provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code and § 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which
authorizes the City to adopt this tax ordinance which shall be operative if a
majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition
of the tax at an election called for that purpose.
   (b)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates
provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of
California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the
requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code.
   (c)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a
tax and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by
the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in a manner that adapts
itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation
from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the
California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in administering and
collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes.
   (d)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes,
and at the same time, minimize the burden of record-keeping upon persons
subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 3239, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 3-12.02. Contract with state.
   Prior to the operative date, the City shall contract with the California
Department of Tax and Fee Administration to perform all functions incident to
the administration and operation of this transactions and use tax ordinance;
provided, that if the City shall not have contracted with the California
Department of Tax and Fee Administration prior to the operative date, it shall
nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the
first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a
contract.
(Ord. 3239, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 3-12.03. Transactions tax rate.
   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is
hereby imposed upon all retailers in the incorporated territory of the City at
the rate of one percent (1%) of the gross receipts of any retailer from the
sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in said territory on and
after the operative date of this chapter.
(Ord. 3239, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 3-12.04. Place of sale.
   For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the

delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a
common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts
from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject
to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is
made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the State
or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail
sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be
prescribed and adopted by the California Department of Tax and Fee
Administration.
(Ord. 3239, eff. January 19, 2023)

of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby adopted and made a
part of this ordinance as though fully set forth herein.

other consumption remain subject to tax by the State under the provisions of
Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or
         (B)   Impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or
other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to
tax by the state under the said provision of that code.
      (4)   In reference to Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence
thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.
   (b)   The word "city" shall be substituted for the word "state" in the
phrase "retailer engaged in business in this state" in Section 6203 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code and in the definition of that phrase in Section 6203.
      (1)   "A retailer engaged in business in the District" shall also include

Sec. 4-6.1305. Permit parking zones on residential streets.
   (a)   Definitions. For the purposes of this section, unless otherwise
apparent from the context, certain words, terms, and phrases used in this
section are defined as follows:
      (1)   “Adjacent residence” shall mean a residential dwelling unit
fronting upon or having direct access to a residential street.
      (2)   “Nonresident vehicle” shall mean a vehicle operated or parked by a
person whose destination is to a nonresidential location.
      (3)   “Permit parking zone” shall mean certain residential street, or
portions thereof, which are designated by the Council as a permit parking zone
for the benefit of the adjacent residences, in which zone vehicles may not park
unless an authorized permit or other indicia is displayed thereon or unless
such vehicle is otherwise exempt as provided in this section.
   (b)   Designation of permit parking zones. The Council, by resolution, may
designate a permit parking zone and establish the days and hours during such
days when parking in such permit parking zone shall be restricted.
   (c)   Findings. Prior to designating certain residential streets, or
portions thereof, as a permit parking zone, the Council shall find with respect
to such streets or portions:
      (1)   That such zone is necessary to provide reasonably available and
convenient parking for the benefit of the adjacent residences;
      (2)   That the proposed zone is desirable to encourage the use of car
pooling;
      (3)   That the proposed zone is desirable to enhance or protect the
quality of life in the area of the proposed zone; and
      (4)   That the proposed zone will tend to encourage nonresident vehicles
to park in off-street parking facilities.
   (d)   Considerations. Before making its findings with respect to any
proposed permit parking zone, the Council shall consider such factors as it
deems appropriate, including the following:
      (1)   Whether nonresident vehicles do or may substantially and regularly
interfere with the use by or for the benefit of adjacent residences of a
majority of available public street parking spaces in the proposed permit
parking zone, and whether such interference occurs at regular and significant
intervals;
      (2)   Whether nonresident vehicles driven or parked in the proposed
permit parking zone are a source of unreasonable litter, noise, traffic
hazards, environmental pollution, or devaluation of real property in the area
of the proposed permit parking zone;
      (3)   Whether the occupants of adjacent residences in the proposed permit
parking zone desire its establishment;
      (4)   Whether a shortage of residential-related parking spaces exists in
the area of the proposed permit parking zone: and
      (5)   Whether an alternative solution is feasible or practical.
   (e)   Posting required. The City Traffic Engineer shall designate
established permit parking zones by placing and maintaining appropriate signs
indicating that the parking of vehicles which do not display a permit issued
for such zone is prohibited and the hours and days when such parking is
prohibited.
   During the hours and on the days designated on such signs, it shall be
unlawful for the operator of any vehicle to park such vehicle on any street in
a permit parking zone unless there is displayed on such vehicle a valid permit
issued for such zone or such vehicle is otherwise exempt.
   (f)   Parking permits. Permits, of a type and design established by
resolution of the Council authorizing parking in the permit parking zone for
which issued, shall be issued by the License Official.
      (1)   Upon submitting such application and supplying such proof of
residence as is required by the License Official, the License Official shall
issue to the occupant(s) of an adjacent residence within a permit parking zone
a number of parking permits for such zone, not to exceed three (3), except as
hereinafter provided. The License Official may issue more than three (3)
parking permits for an adjacent residence if it is shown, by proof satisfactory
to the License Official, that there are more than three (3) vehicles registered
to occupants of the adjacent residence and that insufficient off-street parking
is available to them during the restricted hours.
      (2)   A permit issued pursuant to this section shall remain valid for so
long as the person to whom it was issued continues to reside in the adjacent
residence for which the permit was issued or until the permit parking zone for
which such permit was issued is disestablished.
      (3)   It shall be unlawful for any person to whom a permit is issued
pursuant to this section to transfer, sell, rent, or lease such permit, or to
allow such permit to be used on a nonresident vehicle not owned by the
applicant, either with or without consideration. The License Official shall
revoke the parking permit of any person who is convicted of a violation of this
subsection.
      (4)   It shall be unlawful for any person to pay any consideration for
the purchase or use of a parking permit issued pursuant to this section. It
shall be unlawful for any person who is not an occupant of an adjacent
residence to display in a vehicle any parking permit issued pursuant to this
section, except while visiting an adjacent residence in the zone for which the
permit was issued.
   (g)   Exempt vehicles. The posted restrictions of a permit parking zone
shall not apply to commercial vehicles which are otherwise lawfully in use or
parked within a permit parking zone.
   (h)   Disestablishment. The Council, by resolution, may disestablish or
modify a permit parking zone whenever the Council finds that it is in the
public interest to do so.
   (i)   Penalties.
      (1)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be
guilty of an infraction.
      (2)   The penalty for a violation of the provisions of subsection (e) of
this section shall be:
         (i)   Twenty five Dollars ($25.00) if such penalty is paid within
thirty (30) days after the writing of the citation;
         (ii)   Fifty Dollars ($50.00) if such penalty is paid more than thirty

violation;

second violation of the same provision within one (1) year;
         (iii)   A fine of not more than Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00)
for each additional violation of the same provisions within one year; and
         (iv)   Any person violating any provisions of this section shall be
guilty of a separate offense for each and every day during which any violation
of any provision of this section is committed, continued or permitted by such
person and shall be punishable accordingly.

Sec. 4-6.1803. Application and determination.
   (a)   An applicant who desires designation of a route for access to a
terminal may submit an application on a form provided by the City. Such
application shall be accompanied by such other information as may be required
by the City Traffic Engineer. The application must be filed with the
Engineering Department, and all applicable fees must be paid at the time of
filing.
   (b)   Upon receipt of an application, the City Traffic Engineer will
determine whether the proposed terminal is located in a zone which permits such
use, and whether such use could otherwise be lawfully conducted at the proposed
location.
   (c)   If the terminal may lawfully be located where it is proposed, then the
City Traffic Engineer will determine the capability of the route requested, and
alternative routes, whether requested or not. Determination of route capability
will include, without limitation, a review of adequate turning radius and lane
widths of ramps, intersections and highways, and general traffic conditions,
such as site distance, speed, and traffic volumes.
   (d)   At the completion of his investigation, the City Traffic Engineer
shall notify the applicant, and Caltrans, as to which routes, if any, are
satisfactory, which routes, if any, are unsatisfactory, and which routes, if
any, are unsatisfactory, but could be made satisfactory through retrofitting.
   (e)   No route shall be approved unless it is also approved by Caltrans.

   (b)   When the work is done by the City, the applicant will deposit with the
City of Ontario the estimated cost of retrofitting. The adjustments between the
estimated and actual cost shall be made after completion of the work, and any

refunded to the applicant, as the case may be. When the work is done by the
applicant, the applicant may file with the City Traffic Engineer, on a form

retrofitting, as determined by the City Traffic Engineer, which proportionate
share, if collected, shall be disbursed by the City of Ontario to the applicant
who paid for the retrofitting, as well as any applicant who contributed to the

unsatisfactory route includes the inability of interstate trucks to negotiate
the route or said vehicles causing undesirable driving conditions for other
vehicular traffic or pedestrians.
   (b)   The City Traffic Engineer may revoke any approved terminal or route
designation if any billing to an applicant, for fees, charges or other sums due
the City under this article, or any resolution adopted pursuant to this
article, is not paid within sixty (60) days. This subsection shall not affect
the City's right to recover the sums represented by any such billing by an
action of law or otherwise.

revoke any approved terminal or route to each affected applicant. The action of
the City Traffic Engineer shall be effective when the time to appeal the same

Engineer is appealed in a timely manner, the action of the City Traffic
Engineer shall be effective upon the date of any City Council action upholding

Department, and shall be filed with the City Clerk. The appeal shall state
specifically wherein there was an error or abuse of discretion by the City
Traffic Engineer. Within ten (10) days of the filing of an appeal, the City
Traffic Engineer shall submit to the City Clerk the terminal application, the
sketches of the revoked route, and all other data filed therein, the report of
the City Traffic Engineer, and his decision on the application.

of appeal is filed. The City Clerk shall make copies of the data provided by
the City Traffic Engineer available to the appellant, and may give notice to
any party who requested notice of the time when the appeal will be considered
by the City Council.
   (c)   Within ten (10) days after the hearing, the City Council shall render
its decision on the appeal.

the City Council, but must be made to Caltrans, as may be permitted by
Caltrans.

through the City will be the responsibility of the jurisdiction which controls
the terminal's land use.

estimated cost shall be billed or refunded to the applicant, whichever the case
may be. No terminal or route may be used until such signs as may be required
are in place. Costs of trailblazer signs may be apportioned in accordance with
the procedures in §

Article 22. Valet Parking
Sec. 4-6.2201. Purpose.
   The primary purpose of public streets and rights-of-way is the free and
unobstructed right of travel. The City recognizes that the use of public
streets and rights-of-way for valet parking operations, while providing a
public benefit, may impede travel, interfere with rights of others using the
streets and rights-of-way, and may affect the public safety and create a public
nuisance. The City may therefore permit and restrict valet parking operations
as a special privilege, not as a matter of right, in order to foster public
safety and to prevent public nuisances. The approval of any permit under this
chapter for the use of the public right-of-way is on a temporary and
nonpermanent basis and is for a nonexclusive use of that public right-of-way.
Permittees shall have neither a property interest in nor any entitlement to the
granting or continuation of any permit for the use of any public right-of-way.
For the reasons set forth in this article, a system of valet parking permits is
enacted for the City of Ontario.

   (l)   "Valet parking zone" means an area for a standard single passenger
vehicle on the public right-of-way that has been set aside by the City Engineer
for valet parking.

Sec. 4-6.2205. Rules and regulations.
   The City Council may establish rules and regulations, by resolution, for the

the officers are called to respond to false alarms.

other police duties.

efficiently, the number of false alarms can and must be reduced.

inefficiencies associated with false alarms and to encourage alarm companies
and property owners to maintain the operational reliability, properly use alarm
systems, and to reduce or eliminate false alarm dispatch requests.

establishes fees, fines, establishes a system of administration, sets
conditions for the suspension of a police response and establishes a public
education and training program.

arrival at the alarm site, the response is not considered a false alarm and no
false alarm fine will be assessed.
   (f)   The alarm installation company shall be assessed a fine in an amount
established by resolution of the City Council if the officer responding to a
false alarm determines that an on-site employee of the alarm installation
company directly caused the false alarm. Such false alarms are not included in
the total number of false alarms for the alarm user, nor is the alarm user to
be held liable for any false alarm fine resulting from such alarm activation.
   (g)   A fine in an amount established by resolution of the City Council

(§ 1, Ord. 3151, eff. February 20, 2020)
Sec. 4-9.120. Notice to alarm users of false alarms and suspension of a police
response.
   (a)   The Alarm Administrator shall notify the alarm user in writing or by

alarm dispatch request for suspended alarm site.
   (a)   The Alarm Administrator shall notify the Police Department of each
alarm user whose alarm registration qualifies for suspension under this
section. The Alarm Administrator may suspend an alarm registration if it is
determined that:
      (1)   There is a false statement of a material fact in the registration
application; or
      (2)   The alarm user has had four or more false burglar alarms within the
one-year registration period, except that the Alarm Administrator may waive a

      (3)   The alarm user fails or refuses to pay an alarm registration or
alarm registration renewal fee, false alarm fine, late charge, or any other
fee, fine, or charge assessed under this section.
   (b)   It is a violation of this section for a person to operate a burglar
alarm system during the period in which the alarm registration is suspended. It
is a violation of this chapter for a monitoring company to make an alarm
dispatch request to a burglar alarm site after the monitoring company's Alarm
Response Manager (ARM) has been notified by electronic mail by the Alarm
Administrator that the registration for that alarm site has been suspended. A
grace period of five (5) business days after the ARM's notification shall be
granted for the monitoring company to comply. The alarm monitoring company
shall be assessed a fine in an amount established by resolution of the City
Council for requesting a burglar alarm dispatch request on a suspended alarm
site.
   (c)   False alarm fines under suspension status. In addition to the fines
set forth in §
4-9.110(a), a supplemental fine is hereby imposed upon any person operating a
suspended burglar alarm system. The amount of said fines shall be established
by resolution of the City Council.
   (d)   It shall be the responsibility of the alarm user to notify their
respective alarm monitoring company of their suspension status. An alarm user
shall be held financially accountable for all false alarm fines incurred.

progress, the Police Department may or may not dispatch an officer to an alarm
site for which an alarm registration is suspended.
(§ 1, Ord. 3151, eff. February 20, 2020)
Sec. 4-9.140. Appeals of determinations regarding alarm registrations, fees and
fines.
   (a)   If the Alarm Administrator assesses a fee or fine, suspends an alarm
registration or denies the issuance, renewal or reinstatement of an alarm
registration, the Alarm Administrator shall send notice of the action and a
statement of the right to appeal to the affected applicant, alarm user, alarm
installation company or alarm monitoring company.
   (b)   The applicant, alarm user, alarm installation company or alarm
monitoring company may appeal any action described in subsection (a) above to
the Police Chief (or his or her designee) by setting forth in writing the
reasons for the appeal and delivering the appeal to the Chief of Police (or
designee) within twenty (20) days after receipt of notice of the action.
Failure to deliver the appeal within that time period is a waiver of the right
to appeal.
   (c)   The procedure for an appeal to the Chief of Police (or designee) is as
follows:
      (1)   The applicant, alarm user, alarm installation company or monitoring
company may file a written request for appeal by paying an appeal fee and
setting forth the reasons for the appeal. The appeal must be entitled "Appeal
from Alarm Administrator's Action." The appeal fee shall be in an amount
established by resolution of the City Council and will be returned to the
appealing party if the appeal is successful.
      (2)   The Chief of Police (or designee) shall conduct a hearing on the
appeal within thirty (30) days after the Police Department's receipt of the
request for appeal and appeal fee and shall consider the evidence submitted by
the appealing party and the Alarm Administrator. The Chief of Police (or
designee) must base the decision on the preponderance of evidence presented at
the hearing and must render a decision within fifteen (15) days after the date
of the hearing. The decision shall affirm or reverse the decision or action
taken by the Alarm Administrator.
      (3)   Filing of an appeal stays any action by the Alarm Administrator to
suspend an alarm registration or require the payment of a fee or fine until the
appeal process has been exhausted. This provision applies only to the action of
the Alarm Administrator that is the subject of the appeal. This provision does
not operate as a bar to enforcement action on violations of this section that
occur thereafter.
   (d)   The Alarm Administrator or the Chief of Police, or their respective
designees, may adjust the count of false alarms or assessed fees based on:
      (1)   Evidence that a false alarm was caused by action of a
communications services provider (i.e., telephone, cellular, cable company);
      (2)   Evidence that a false alarm was caused by a power outage of more
than four (4) hours or severe weather such as a tornado, earthquake, or
excessive winds (35 m.p.h. or above as measured by the Ontario International
Airport weather monitoring station);
      (3)   Evidence that an alarm dispatch request was not a false alarm; or
      (4)   The occurrence of multiple alarms within a twenty-four (24) hour
period, which may be considered as one false alarm if the alarm user has taken
corrective action, unless the false alarms are directly caused by the alarm
user.
   (e)   The Alarm Administrator may waive all or part of a false alarm fine
due to extenuating circumstances or to encourage corrective action with
supervisor approval.
(§ 1, Ord. 3151, eff. February 20, 2020)
Sec. 4-9.150. Reinstatement of suspended alarm registrations.
   (a)   On the suspension of an alarm registration, a person whose alarm
registration has been suspended may obtain reinstatement of the registration by
the Alarm Administrator if the person:

Council;
      (2)   Pays, or otherwise resolves, all outstanding fees, fines, and other
charges;
      (3)   Submits a written notice from an alarm installation company stating
that the alarm system has been inspected and repaired (if necessary) by the
alarm installation company;
      (4)   The alarm user successfully completes an alarm user awareness class
and test.
   (b)   The Police Department shall reinstate its response to an alarm site as
soon as is practicable after receiving notice of reinstatement from the Alarm
Administrator. The alarm user and monitoring company shall take notice that the
alarm site has been officially reinstated only after receiving notice from the
Alarm Administrator of that fact. It shall be the responsibility of the alarm
user to verify that his, her, or its registration status and future police
response has been properly restored.
(§ 1, Ord. 3151, eff. February 20, 2020)
Sec. 4-9.160. Suspension of police response to dispatch requests from certain
alarm installation companies and monitoring companies.
   (a)   The Chief of Police or command staff designee may suspend police
response to an alarm dispatch request from an alarm installation company or
monitoring company if it is determined that:
      (1)   There is a violation of this chapter by the alarm installation
company or monitoring company and the condition causing the violation has not
been corrected and/or;
      (2)   The alarm installation company or monitoring company has failed to
pay any fee, fine, or other charge assessed under this section, more than sixty
(60) days after the fee, fine, or other charge is due.
   (b)   The Police Department may not respond to any alarm dispatch request
where the alarm installation company or monitoring company who
installed or monitors that alarm has failed to comply with California licensing
requirements or failed to maintain a valid copy of the State of California
Department of Consumer Affairs alarm company operators license.
   (c)   A suspension of police response made pursuant to this section is
subject to the appeal process provided for within this chapter. In addition,
the Alarm Administrator has the ability to accept a workable solution from the
affected party prior to an appeal. The affected party has sixty (60) days after
the written notice of suspension before Police response is suspended to its
alarm customers.
   (d)   The Alarm Administrator shall notify all known alarm users subscribing
to an alarm installation company or an alarm monitoring company that the Police
Department has suspended response to the company's alarm dispatch requests.
   (e)   The City shall assess the alarm installation company or monitoring
company a reinstatement fee in an amount established by resolution of the City
Council. In addition, if the Alarm Administrator has incurred costs in
notifying alarm users by mail of the suspension of their alarm installation
company or monitoring company, reimbursement to the City of those costs shall
be a condition of reinstatement.
(§ 1, Ord. 3151, eff. February 20, 2020)
Sec. 4-9.170. Police Department response.
   (a)   Subject to the suspension provisions in §
4-9.130 above and the discretion discussed in §
4-9.190 below, the Police Department at its discretion will respond to all "in
progress" robbery, panic or burglar alarms as promptly as possible, taking into
account pending calls for service and any policy establishing priority of
dispatched calls following notification of the receipt of the alarm from the
monitoring company. Police supervisors may, in their discretion, cancel a
police response to any or all alarms based on weather or other factors
affecting police service needs.
   (b)   The Chief of Police or his or her designee may re-prioritize
assignment of burglar alarms and response time at any time during a 24-hour
period as may be necessary due to the service needs of the community.
(§ 1, Ord. 3151, eff. February 20, 2020)
Sec. 4-9.180. Confidentiality of alarm information.
   All information contained in documents gathered through alarm registrations,
the submission of customer lists, the alarm appeal process and records relating
to alarm dispatch requests must be held in confidence by all employees of the
Alarm Administrator, the City of Ontario and any third-party alarm
administrator. Such information is proprietary and is hereby declared
confidential and not a public record. Absent special circumstances, such
information must not be released to the public or any person other than a law
enforcement agency, third party administrator or the applicable alarm user,
alarm installation company or alarm monitoring company except pursuant to court
order. Per California Government Code 6254(f).
(§ 1, Ord. 3151, eff. February 20, 2020)
Sec. 4-9.190. Scope of police duty; immunities preserved.
   The issuance of an alarm registration does not create a contract between the
Police Department and/or the City of Ontario and any alarm user, alarm
installation company or monitoring company, nor does it create a duty or
obligation, either expressed or implied, of the Police Department to respond to
any alarm. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the
failure of the Police Department to respond to an alarm dispatch request is
hereby disclaimed and full governmental immunity as provided by law is
retained. By applying for an alarm registration, the alarm user acknowledges
that the Police Department response is influenced by the availability of
officers, priority of calls, traffic conditions, weather conditions, emergency
conditions, staffing levels, prior response history and administrative actions.

Sec. 4-12.06 Civil penalties for loud or unruly parties, gatherings or other
similar events; Findings and purpose.
   (a)   Due to inadequate supervision, some large gatherings of people, such
as parties, frequently become loud and unruly to the point that they constitute
a threat to the peace, health, safety, or general welfare of the public as a
result of conduct such as one (1) or more of the following: excessive noise,
excessive traffic, obstruction of public streets or crowds who have spilled
over into public streets, public drunkenness, the service of alcohol to minors,
fights, disturbances of the peace, vandalism, and litter.
   (b)   The City is required to respond to such unruly gatherings, or a
particular premises, in order to restore and maintain the peace and protect
public safety. Such gatherings are a burden on scarce City resources and can
result in police responses to regular and emergency calls being delayed and
police protection to the rest of the City being reduced.
   (c)   In order to discourage the occurrence of repeated loud and unruly
gatherings, the persons responsible for the public nuisance created by these
gatherings should be fined.
(§ 1, Ord. 2889, eff. March 6, 2008, as amended by § 1, Ord. 2940, eff. October
5, 2011)
Sec. 4-12.07. Loud or unruly gatherings; Public nuisance.
   It shall be unlawful and a public nuisance to conduct a gathering of five
(5) or more persons on any private property in a manner which constitutes a
substantial disturbance of the quiet enjoyment of private or public property of
a neighborhood, as a result of conduct constituting a violation of law.
Illustrative of such unlawful conduct is excessive noise or traffic,
obstruction of public streets by crowds or vehicles, public drunkenness, the
service of alcohol to minors, fights, disturbances of the peace, vandalism, and
litter. The following are the specific violations of permitting any noise
disturbance that is:
   (a)   Plainly audible across property boundaries;
   (b)   Plainly audible through partitions common to two residents within a
building;
   (c)   Plainly audible at a distance of 50 feet in any direction from the
source of music or sound between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.; or
   (d)   Plainly audible at a distance of 25 feet in any direction from the
source of music or sound between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
   A gathering constituting a public nuisance may be abated by the City by all
reasonable means including, but not limited to, an order requiring the
gathering to be disbanded and citation and/or arrest of any law violators under
any applicable local laws and state statutes such as: Ontario Municipal Code
(“OMC”) sections governing excessive noise, Cal. Penal Code §§ 415 and 416
(Breach of the Peace); Cal. Penal Code §§ 374 et seq. (Litter); Cal. Penal Code

Sec. 4-12.08 Notice of loud or unruly gatherings; Certified mail.
   (a)   Notice of violation will be served via the actual citation written by
the Police Officer on scene and/or a formal written "Notice of Violation"
issued on scene and/or through certified mail. The formal "Notice of Violation"
will record the date and time of the police intervention and include a formal
written advisal that subsequent responses will cause the violating party to
incur additional fines and/or result in a formal arrest, within a one hundred
eighty (180) day period. The violations shall result in the joint and several
liability of any guests causing the public nuisance, persons who are residents
or in control of the property at which the public nuisance occurred, persons
who sponsored the gathering constituting the public nuisance, and owners of the
premises. All persons listed who are present can receive a violation.
   (b)   Mailing of Notice to Property Owner. Notice of the police intervention
shall also be mailed to any property owner at the address shown on the City’s
property tax assessment records. The notice shall advise the property owner
that the current violation and any subsequent gathering resulting in a public
nuisance within one hundred eighty (180) days on the same premises
necessitating City intervention shall result in liability of the property owner
for all penalties associated with such intervention.” The Ontario Police
Department will issue and mail the Notice of Violation to the Property Owner;
the notice will be sent certified mail.

Sec. 4-12.09 Persons liable for response to a gathering constituting a public
nuisance.
   If the City is required to intervene at a gathering constituting a public
nuisance on the same premises once and/or on multiple responses in any one
hundred eighty (180) day period, including a second intervention during the
same day or night as the first intervention, the following persons shall be
jointly and severally liable for civil penalties as set forth in §
4-12.10, in addition to any other applicable penalties or liability under the
Ontario Municipal Code or other provision of law.
   (a)   The person or persons who own the premises where the gathering
constituting a public nuisance took place if any of the following are the case:
Said owner resides on or adjacent to the premises; said owner was present when
the citation and/or formal "Notice of Violation" was issued; or the formal
"Notice of Violation" was mailed to said owner and ten (10) days have elapsed
since the date of said mailing. For purposes of this subsection, where a
gathering takes place within the confines of a single unit in a building owned
by a housing cooperative, the owner of the property shall be deemed to be the
owner of the single unit and not the members of the housing cooperative in
general. Where the gathering took place in the common area of a building owned
by a housing cooperative, only the members of the cooperative owning units in
the building where the gathering took place shall be deemed the owners of the
property for purposes of this subsection. Other members of the housing
cooperative may still be liable if they fall within the categories of person
made liable by subsections (b), (c), or (d), below.
   (b)   The person or persons residing on or otherwise in control of the
property where such gathering took place.
   (c)   All persons attending such gathering who engaged in any activity
resulting in the public nuisance.
   (d)   The person or persons who organized or sponsored such gathering.
   (e)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose liability on the
resident or owners of the premises or sponsor of the gathering, for the conduct
of persons who are present without the express or implied consent of the
resident or sponsor, as long as the resident and sponsor have taken all steps
reasonably necessary to exclude such uninvited participants from the premises.
Where an invited guest engages in conduct which the sponsor or resident could
not reasonably foresee and the conduct is an isolated instance of a guest at
the event violating the law which the sponsor is unable to reasonably control
without the intervention of the police, the unlawful conduct of the individual
guest shall not be attributable to the sponsor, owner, or resident for the
purposes of determining whether the event constitutes a public nuisance under
this section.

person who violates any provision of this chapter more than once within a one
hundred eighty (180) day period shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Each day a

      (1)   For the first violation within a one hundred eighty (180) day
period, the minimum mandatory fine shall be two hundred fifty dollars ($250).

Sec. 4-12.11 Collection of delinquent costs for a City response.
   The amount of any civil penalty imposed by the provisions of this chapter
shall be deemed a debt to the City. An action may be commenced in the name of
the City in any court of competent jurisdiction for the amount of any police
services fee which is not paid within thirty (30) days after being billed to
the person responsible for payment thereof. In any such action, the City shall
be entitled to recover, in addition to the police services fee and any interest
accruing thereon, costs of suit, including the City’s reasonable attorneys’
fees. The City may also assess a lien for said debt against the premises where
the nuisance activity occurred pursuant to the applicable procedures for lien
assessment set forth in the Ontario Municipal Code or other provision of law.

   This chapter shall be known as "the Ontario newsrack ordinance."
(§ 2, Ord. 2774, eff. June 5, 2003)
Sec. 4-14.02. Intent and purpose.
   The City Council of the City of Ontario hereby finds and declares:
   (a)   The City of Ontario has significant interests in:
      (1)   Promoting vehicular traffic and pedestrian safety and convenience;
      (2)   Preventing damage to public sidewalks, structures, and landscaping;
      (3)   Preventing visual clutter; and
      (4)   Protecting the aesthetic character of an area.
   (b)   The City of Ontario has a substantial interest in promoting the public
health, safety, welfare and convenience of its citizens, businesses and
visitors by ensuring that public streets, sidewalks and rights-of-way in the
City are not unreasonably obstructed by newsracks and that newsracks are
properly maintained.
   (c)   In recent years, the proliferation of newsracks on the streets and
sidewalks of the City, in particular excessive, poorly maintained or abandoned
newsracks, have contributed to the congestion of the City sidewalks, impeded
the flow of pedestrian traffic, interfered with the use of streets, sidewalks
and public rights-of-way, presented hazards to persons and property and
resulted in substantial visual blight.
   (d)   The City of Ontario has a substantial interest in preserving and
protecting the unique visual and aesthetic qualities of the City. To that end,
and consistent with the City's General Plan the City desires to take steps to
reduce the visual blight, pedestrian inconvenience and hazards associated with
an unlimited number and design of newsracks, poorly maintained newsracks and
the unrestricted placement of newsracks on streets, sidewalks and rights-of-way
in the City.
   (e)   After extended inquiry by the City Council and City staff, it has
become clear that the most effective way to reduce the visual clutter and
hazards associated with excessive numbers of newsracks and unregulated design
or appearance of such newsracks is to prohibit the unlimited placement of
private newsracks in the City and instead, institute a program to provide City-
approved fixed pedestal newsrack of a consistent design, placement and color.
   (f)   Thus, the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health,
safety and welfare and the aesthetic qualities of the City by controlling the
size, shape, construction and appearance of newsracks in the City, as a
reasonable time, manner and place regulation, so as to:
      (1)   Provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience;
      (2)    Ensure that there is no unreasonable interference with the flow of
vehicular and pedestrian traffic, including ingress and egress from any City
residence, place of business or public facility, or any legally parked or
stopped vehicles;
      (3)   Ensure compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act and improve
passage for persons with disabilities by reducing impediments to passage caused
by poorly-located newsracks;
      (4)   Provide reasonable access for the safe and efficient use and
maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants,
mailboxes, delivery areas, loading zones, transit shelters, curb and
handicapped ramps and other street furniture;
      (5)   Reduce visual blight and clutter and litter problems associated
with poorly maintained or improperly located or abandoned newsracks;
      (6)   Advance the economic interests of the City merchants and other
information providers, including those involved in the publication and
distribution of newspapers and periodicals through newsracks;
      (7)   Protect the unique architectural, historical and aesthetic
attributes of the City;
      (8)   Reduce exposure of the City to personal injury or property damage
claims and litigation;
      (9)   Provide for public and property safety during emergency conditions;
and
      (10)   Maintain and protect the values of surrounding properties.
   (g)   In adopting this chapter, the City Council is mindful that newsrack
regulations implicate rights protected by the First Amendment of the United
States Constitution and Article I, Section 2 of the California Constitution. To
that end, the City Council hereby adopts these regulations and directs that
their enforcement be conducted in a manner consistent with the constitutional
rights of citizens and regulated parties.
   (h)   Given the limited space available within the City's rights of way, the
City of Ontario has a substantial interest in devising a systematic approach to
newsrack removal and placement in the City to ensure a fair and equitable
distribution of newspapers and periodicals. The City Council declares that this
objective and the other aforementioned objectives are best achieved by adopting
this chapter and creating regulations to allow fixed pedestal newsrack of a
consistent design, placement and color and also by enhancing aesthetic
character of public areas through uniformity in appearance.
   (i)   The City Council further declares that allowing only newsracks of a
consistent design, placement and color in the City directly promotes the City's
interests in promoting public safety, reducing visual blight and clutter,
protecting the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the City and
advancing the economic interests of the City merchants and other information
providers.

   (b)   If a permit application for a specific geographic location is received
and said geographic location complies with the standards set forth in §
4-14.10, and all other requirements of this chapter are met, said application
shall be approved on a first come, first served basis, except that all
applications accepted during the initial implementation program, described in §
4-14.07(a) of this chapter, shall be deemed pending as of the same date and
time. If there is more than one application for a specific geographic location
pending, then the priority for granting the applications shall be as set forth

publications, those published and distributed on at least one but less than
five calendar days in a calendar week.
      (3)   Third, to newsrack used for the sale or distribution of all other
publications not described in divisions (1) or (2) of this subsection. Among
these publications, priority shall next be given based on frequency of
publication, with the higher priority given to publications for which new
editions or issues were published most frequently in the full calendar month
preceding the date of application.
      (4)   Within groups of applicants with the same frequency of publication
and within groups of applicants not entitled to priority, permits shall be
granted to the maximum allowable in a block by the drawing of lots as follows:
the director shall assign the location at random by placing the name of all
applicants for the remaining locations into a container from which the names
shall be drawn, one at a time, by the director, until the remaining number of
locations is filled.
      (5)   The priority for granting a shared permit shall be based upon the
frequency of publication of the primary applicant for the shared permit.
      (6)   Any permit that cannot be granted on the unavailability of a
location as set forth in this chapter shall instead be approved for a location
on that block that complies with the requirements of this chapter that is in
closest proximity to the requested location.
   (e)   It shall be a condition of any permit granted according to a priority
set forth in this section to maintain editions in the newsrack according to the
frequency for which the priority was given.
(§ 2, Ord. 2774, eff. June 5, 2003)

Sec. 4-19.05 Selection of towing carriers.
   (a)   Within ninety (90) calendar days of the date an existing towing
carrier permit is due to expire, or whenever the Chief of Police determines
that a new towing carrier is needed to provide tow services to the City, the
Chief of Police shall request that the Purchasing Division prepare and

permit. The Purchasing Division shall identify the most qualified towing
carrier, provided that the City receives at least one qualified applicant, in
accordance with the objective performance criteria set forth in this chapter
and as may be promulgated in writing by the Chief of Police. In determining the
required number of towing carriers, the Chief of Police may consider, but is
not limited to, the following factors:
      (1)   The operational needs of the City or its Police Department;
      (2)   The population growth in the City;
      (3)   The additional land area annexed into the City;
      (4)   The number of currently authorized towing carriers and their
average response times;
      (5)   The administrative burdens imposed by the number of towing carriers
to be included on the rotation list; and

   (b)   The name of any qualified applicant(s), if there is one, shall be
forwarded to the Chief of Police who shall conduct a background investigation
of the operator and his or her employees. In addition, the Chief of Police will

successful completion of the background investigation, the Chief of Police
shall recommend in writing to the City Manager that the City issue, or refuse
to issue, a towing carrier permit to the applicant(s) identified by the
Purchasing Division. The City Council shall then determine whether it is in the
City's best interests to issue a towing carrier permit to the identified
applicant(s). If the City Council determines that it is in the City's best
interests to issue a towing carrier permit, it may do so by resolution in
accordance with this chapter.

2015)
Sec. 4-19.06 Towing carrier’s obligations; minimum requirements for facilities.
   To be eligible to provide towing services to the City and its Police
Department, the towing carrier must meet the following minimum requirements
with respect to its facilities:
   (a)   Location of storage facility. The proposed towing storage lot shall be
located within the City of Ontario city limits, or within five (5) miles
thereof upon approval as described in subsection (e) below, to ensure adequate
response times and limit the City's costs and administrative burdens of having
Police Department personnel conduct investigations at distant storage lots.
   (b)   Storage facility requirements. Adequate security measures for the
protection of vehicles and property shall be provided for all storage
facilities. The Chief of Police or his or her designee shall be the sole judge
of what constitutes "adequate" security measures and may grant additional
consideration for state of the art security measures, including, but not
limited to, security cameras and motion sensors. At a minimum, all storage
facilities shall comply with the following requirements:
      (1)   All storage facilities shall be enclosed by a wall or fence at
least six (6) feet in height. Alternatively, storage facilities may consist of
enclosed buildings.
      (2)   Storage lot that can hold a minimum of one hundred fifty (150)
vehicles.
      (3)   The storage facility and lot shall be configured in such a way that
no vehicles shall be left parked or stored on the public streets at any time.
The business must provide off-street parking for its equipment and be able to
accommodate at least two (2) additional vehicles for customer parking. In
addition to the two (2) customer parking spaces, at least one (1) additional
customer parking space shall be provided for handicapped parking purposes. Said
handicapped parking space shall be van accessible. Storage vehicles should be
secured away from customer parking and the office area. The towing carrier's
office located in the City must have a sign posted including the company name,
address, phone number and hours of operation, to be clearly visible from the
roadway.
      (4)   The proposed storage facility shall contain an enclosed building or
enclosed storage facility that holds a minimum of two (2) vehicles, to be used
exclusively in situations where the Police Department orders an impound because
probable cause exists to believe that the vehicle was involved in the
commission of a crime or for other reasons that require evidentiary analysis of
the vehicle (the "designated impound space").
         (i)   The designated impound space shall be completely protected from
the elements, including wind, heat, adverse weather and other forms of
contamination (i.e., dust).
         (ii)   The designated impound space must be able to be secured and
unauthorized entry must be prevented. At a minimum, there should be a door or
gate that can be locked and secured from employees and visitors.
         (iii)   The designated impound space must be at least thirty (30) feet
by forty (40) feet.
         (iv)   The designated impound space must be lit with a minimum of two
50-watt, overhead lamps, or similar lamps that provide equal or greater light.

system to prevent unauthorized entry. The alarm system shall be monitored by an
off-site monitoring company. The alarm code for the alarm system shall be
provided to Police Department personnel at all times and shall be changed by
the towing carrier only upon receiving authorization from the Chief of Police
or at his or her direction. The towing carrier shall not provide the alarm code
to any person unless authorized to do so by the Chief of Police.
   (c)   All proposed storage facilities must be approved for security by the
Traffic Division Sergeant or designated representative, and available for
inspection upon request. Any breach of security in a building or fence must be
repaired within twenty-four (24) hours.
   (d)   All necessary vehicle storage facilities needed to meet the minimum
requirements of this section shall be constructed prior to the submittal of a
response to the request for qualifications issued by the Purchasing Division.
Proposed facilities shall not be awarded credit. All necessary approvals for
such storage facilities shall comply with the applicable provisions of the
Ontario Municipal Code, or appropriate county and/or City codes. Compliance
with this subsection shall not be deemed to create any duty for the City to
award a permit to the towing carrier.
   (e)    In the event that City-sponsored or City-initiated economic
development activity results in the displacement of an existing tow yard within
the City, the tow operator whose location has been displaced may apply to the
City in writing for relief from the in-City locational requirement. A committee
consisting of the City Manager, the Chief of Police and the Executive Director
of the Public Works Agency, or their designees, shall consider the application
and decide within 30 days whether to allow extra-territorial siting. The
decision of the committee shall be final and non-appealable.

Sec. 4-19.09 Towing carrier’s miscellaneous obligations.
   As a condition to issuance of a permit by the City, the towing carrier must

shall provide the basis for either suspension or revocation of its towing
services agreement;
   (k)   Indemnify and defend the City, its elected and appointed officers,

by any person, firm, entity, corporation, political subdivision or other
organization arising out of or in connection with any of the towing service
operations or activities by the towing carrier, its officers, agents, or
employees, whether or not there is concurrent passive or active negligence on
the part of the City, its officers, agents or employees, but excluding such
actions, claims, damages to persons or property, penalties, obligations, or
liabilities arising from the sole negligence or willful misconduct of the City,
its elected or appointed officers, employees, agents or volunteers who are
directly responsible to the City and in connection therewith:

activities of the towing carrier hereunder, the towing carrier agrees to pay to
the City any and all costs and expenses incurred by City, its elected and
appointed officers, employees, agents and volunteers in such actions or
proceedings, together with reasonable attorneys' fees of the attorneys selected
by the City to defend the City, its elected and appointed officers, employees,
agents and volunteers in such actions; and
      (4)   Disputes between the towing carrier and the City arising from the
provision of towing services to the City pursuant to the towing services
agreement are excluded from the duty to indemnify, defend and hold harmless.
   (l)   Develop and maintain written policies and procedures to restrict
access and to preclude evidence contamination by employees and other
individuals in the designated impound space. Such policies shall be submitted
with the permit application, within thirty (30) days after award of the

   (p)   Vehicles placed into the designated impound space shall not be removed
from such protection until approved by the Police Department;

requirements are satisfied, the written authorization for release is provided
by the Ontario Police Department and all appropriate release charges are
collected; and
   (s)   Not release personal property contained within towed vehicles unless
written authorization of the Ontario Police Department is first obtained. When
personal property is released the written authorization shall be kept with the
vehicle storage paperwork. There shall be no charge for the release of personal
property during normal business hours. Towing carriers may charge an after
hours release fee for property released after normal business hours. Minimum
normal business hours shall be from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., five (5) days a
week (Monday through Friday), excluding holidays.

The towing carrier further must agree to be available and timely respond to any
inquiries made by the Police Department concerning the impacts of any proposed
towing rotation system changes. Should a towing carrier refuse or be unable to
respond to a call for service, the City may request services from any other

towing carrier upon ten (10) days’ written notice of the adoption of such
resolution.
   (c)   Late charges on delinquent accounts shall be subject to penalties
outlined in §

a subsequent change in federal, state or local law.
   (e)   The towing carrier must make available to the Police Department, the
City or their designated representative(s), upon three (3) days’ written
notice, its accounting records and books for inspection and audit. The Police
Department, the City or their designated representative(s) agree to maintain

City in a format that is acceptable to the Traffic Division of the Department.
Such documentation shall include the following information: the date, time,

surrounding the tow (traffic collision, Department impound, and the like).
Towing carriers shall maintain these records for a period of three (3) years.
If the results of the audit show an administrative fee underpayment of greater
than two percent (2%), the towing carrier will pay the cost of the audit plus
fifty percent (50%) of the total error as a penalty in addition to any amount
owed as shown by the audit. If the results of the audit show an underpayment of
less than two percent (2%) or an overpayment, the City shall pay its own costs
associated with the audit. Any underpayment and resulting penalty shall accrue
interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, compounded daily from the

   (f)   In the event the results of the audit are disputed, the City may, at
its sole discretion, elect to arbitrate the dispute. In the event the City
elects to arbitrate, the City and the towing carrier shall each select an
independent auditor at their own cost. The two (2) auditors shall agree upon
the results of the audit. If the two (2) independent auditors cannot agree upon
the results of the audit, a third auditor will be selected by the two (2)
independent auditors to make a final determination. The determination of the
third independent auditor shall be final.

penalties due under this section.

Sec. 4-19.15 Revocation and suspension of towing carrier permits.
   (a)   The Chief of Police may suspend temporarily, and the City Council or

chapter, and to rescind all rights and privileges associated with them at any
time if:

default after receipt of written notice of the default from the City or its
Police Department and a reasonable opportunity to cure the default in
accordance with subsection (c)(1) below;
      (2)   If the towing carrier fails to provide or maintain in full force

or upon persons to whom it provides tow truck service as determined by a court
of law; or
      (5)   If the towing carrier becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay
its debts and obligations, or is adjudged to be bankrupt. The City's revocation
of the towing carrier's permit shall in no way affect any right of the City to
pursue any remedy under the towing services agreement or any other provision of
law.
   (b)   (1)   Notwithstanding the City Manager or City Council's right to
suspend or revoke a permit and related towing services agreement, the Chief of
Police shall have the right to suspend, for a period not to exceed thirty (30)
days, any towing carrier permit granted pursuant to this chapter, and any
towing services agreement entered into pursuant to this chapter, and to rescind
all rights and privileges associated with them during the suspension period, if
the towing carrier violates any provision of this chapter, any material
provision of the towing services agreement or any state or federal law. The
Chief of Police may exercise this authority up to three (3) times per calendar
year. Thereafter, the Chief of Police may recommend suspension or revocation of
the towing carrier's permit and towing services agreement to the City Manager
or City Council.
      (2)   Any appeal of the Chief of Police's decision to suspend a towing
carrier's permit and towing services agreement shall be made to the City
Manager. The appeal shall be conducted in accord and pursuant to the procedures
set forth in §
1-4.01 et seq., with the exception that the hearing officer shall be the City
Manager or his or her designee. Any subsequent appeal shall be to the City
Council as noted in subsection (c)(3) below.
   (c)   Prior to suspending or revoking a permit granted under this chapter,
and towing services agreement entered into pursuant to this chapter, the City
shall give the towing carrier notice and an opportunity to be heard on the
matter, in accordance with the following administrative procedures:
      (1)   City staff shall first notify the towing carrier of the violation
in writing by personal delivery or registered or certified mail, and demand
that the towing carrier cure the default within a reasonable time, which shall
not be less than ten (10) days in the case of the towing carrier's failure to
pay any sum or other amount due the City under this chapter or the towing
carrier's towing services agreement with the City and thirty (30) days in all
other cases. If the towing carrier fails to correct the violation within the
time prescribed or if the towing carrier fails to commence correction of the
violation within the time prescribed, the City shall give the towing carrier
fourteen (14) calendar days written notice of public hearing to be held before
the City Manager. The written notice shall specify the alleged violations
supporting the recommendation for suspension or revocation of the permit and
towing services agreement.
      (2)   The City Manager shall hear and consider all relevant evidence
submitted by staff and the towing carrier or its agent or representative. If
the City Manager finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the towing
carrier has committed a material breach of the towing services agreement or
this chapter, the City Manager may suspend or revoke the towing carrier's
permit and towing services agreement.
      (3)   The towing carrier may appeal the City Manager's decision to the
City Council. The appeal shall be conducted in accord and pursuant to the
procedures set forth in §

   A towing carrier shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, mortgage
or dispose of in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by
ordinary sale, contract, consolidation or otherwise, the permit or any rights
or privileges therein granted, without the prior written consent of the City
Council. The City Council's approval of a transfer or assignment of a permit
granted pursuant to this chapter shall be conditioned upon the towing carrier's
sale or disposal of all ownership rights to its tow truck business. A towing
carrier that desires to transfer or assign its permit, because he or she
intends to sell or dispose of all interests in the tow truck business that has
a permit with the City, shall make a written request for transfer or assignment
of the permit. The written request, a deposit of One Thousand Dollars
($1,000.00) and the proposed sale agreement or other document evidencing
disposal of the tow truck business shall be submitted to the Administrative
Services Agency at least one hundred-twenty (120) days before the requested
transfer or assignment date. The Administrative Services Agency and the Police
Department shall investigate the proposed transferee or assignee and determine
whether the transferee or assignee is qualified to serve as a permitted towing
carrier pursuant to the criteria and requirements set forth in this chapter and
make a recommendation to the City Council. Upon completion of the City
Council's approval or denial, the Administrative Services Agency shall provide
the towing carrier that requested the transfer or assignment with an accounting
of the administrative and legal costs associated with the City's review of the
towing carrier's request for a transfer or assignment of the permit, and shall
also provide any refund due. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign or
otherwise dispose of the permit without the prior consent of the City Council
shall be null and void.

of-way or any other public property shall be subordinate to any prior or

transferee.
   (e)   In making a determination on whether to approve the transfer
application, the City Council shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
consider the legal, financial, technical and other qualifications of the
transferee to operate the system, whether the transferor video provider is in
compliance with its license agreement and this chapter and, if not, the
candidate transferee's commitment and plan to cure such noncompliance, whether
operation by the transferee would adversely affect the delivery of video
programming to subscribers or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, and
such other criteria provided for by applicable state and federal law.
   (f)   A transfer application shall not be granted unless the proposed
transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this
chapter and the license agreement, assume the obligations and liabilities of
the previous grantee under the license, and assume such other conditions as may
be lawfully prescribed by the City Council resolution approving the transfer.

commenced installation of a video provider system in the annexed territory
before the date such annexation becomes effective. Where feasible, City shall
provide notice to the holder of a foreign license of the City's intent to annex
territory that may result in a termination under this section. Failure to
provide such notice shall not affect the termination of the foreign license.
   (d)   Where grantee of a foreign license has commenced installation of a
video provider system in annexed territory on or before the date such
annexation becomes effective, grantee may continue to provide video
programming, by means of a video provider system, to the annexed territory for

extension not granted by the City), subject to the terms and conditions then in
effect under such license, and the timely payment to the City of all license

(§ 1, Ord. 2833, eff. August 5, 2006)
Sec. 4-20.16. License fee.
   (a)   As compensation for any license granted, and in consideration of
permission to use the public right-of-way in the operation of its video
provider system, and because the City will incur costs in regulating and
administering the license, grantee shall pay to the City a license fee in the
amount equal to five percent (5%) of grantee's gross revenues.
   (b)   The license fee assessed shall be paid quarterly, to be received by
the City Treasurer not later than forty-five (45) days after the close of each
quarter of grantee's fiscal year.
   (c)   On a quarterly basis, grantee shall provide the City a complete and
accurate statement verified by an authorized representative of grantee with
reasonable personal knowledge of the accuracy and completeness of such
statement, indicating gross revenues for the past quarter, listing every
revenue source by category, and depicting gross revenue computations.
   (d)   On an annual basis, grantee shall file a complete and accurate
statement verified by an authorized representative of grantee with reasonable
personal knowledge of the accuracy and completeness of such statement,
indicating all gross revenues for said year, listing every revenue source, by
category, and depicting gross revenue computations. If the City has any
concerns or objections relating to such report, the City shall have sixty (60)
days to notify grantee and request additional information. Grantee shall have
sixty (60) days to provide additional information to resolve any concerns or
objections to the City's satisfaction. Thereafter, the City may, at its sole
discretion, request that such statement be certified by an independent
certified public accountant, at grantee's sole cost; provided, however, that
any such request shall be made within sixty (60) days after grantee's response
is received.
   (e)   Upon reasonable notice, at any time during the term of a license, the
City shall have the right to conduct, or require grantee to obtain, an
independent audit by certified public accountants of any and all records of
grantee that are related to gross revenue reports or computations. Grantee
shall pay the costs of such audit not more frequently than once every three (3)
years in the event such audit reveals an underpayment of five percent (5%) or
more. Grantee shall cooperate with any such audit making readily available any
and all relevant information requested by the City. The certified public
accountants shall be required to certify in the audit that the grantee is in
compliance with this chapter and the license fee requirements of the license
agreement. Grantee shall maintain in a readily accessible place all such
records for a minimum of four (4) years after any payment period that such
record pertains to. This right shall be in addition to City's right to conduct
any other audit.
   (f)   In the event that any license fee payment is not paid by the due date,
interest shall be charged monthly at a monthly rate of one and one-half percent
(1-1/2%), or the highest rate allowed by law, whichever is lower. In addition,
if any license fee is not paid in full within fifteen (15) days after receipt
of notice from the City as to the delinquency of such payment, a one-time late
fee in the amount of five percent (5%) of the delinquent amount shall be
assessed.
   (g)   In the event grantee claims to have overpaid by more than five percent
(5%) the amount of license fee actually due during any given quarter, it shall
file an application with the City within one (1) year after said payment was
made; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, grantee shall be
permitted to seek refund of overpaid amounts that are revealed by an audit
conducted in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, and the grantee
requests such refund within sixty (60) days of the audit's release. The failure
to timely and properly make such claim shall constitute a waiver by grantee of
any right to such claimed overpayment, whether by refund, offset, credit or any
other accommodation, except to the extent the overpayment is revealed by an
audit conducted in accordance with subsection (e) of this section. All such
applications shall state the amount of claimed overpayment, the reason for the
claimed overpayment, and sufficient documentation to allow the City to verify
grantee's claim. Upon request by the City, grantee shall provide any further
information that is deemed relevant by the City. All such applications shall be
considered by the City Council, and the City Council's decision with respect to
such applications shall be final.
   (h)   If grantee bundles video programming services with non-video service,
grantee agrees that it will allocate the discount associated with such bundle
consistent with the portion allocated in grantee's books and records kept in
the regular course of grantee's business. If grantee bundles video programming
services with non-video services, grantee agrees that it will not intentionally
or unlawfully allocate such revenue for the purpose of evading license fee
payments under its license. The parties agree that tariffed telecommunication
services that cannot be discounted by state or federal law or regulation are to
be excluded from the bundled discount allocation basis.

      (11)   Failure to provide, upon written request, relevant data,

protect grantee's confidential information from public disclosure; and
      (12)   Dissolution, liquidation or ceasing to conduct business;

(§ 1, Ord. 2833, eff. August 5, 2006)
Sec. 4-20.20. Procedure for adjudication of breaches of the license.
   (a)   Prior to imposing any liquidated damages, sanction or penalty upon
grantee, including termination or revocation of the license, the City Manager,
shall demand in writing that grantee cure such breach or diligently commence a
cure of such breach within a specified period, which period shall not be less
than thirty (30) days following notification. However, only fifteen (15) days
notice shall be required in the case of failure to pay undisputed monies due to
the City. In addition, the City may, in an emergency, prescribe a notice less
than thirty (30) days consistent with the nature of the emergency. An emergency
under this subsection (a) means an occurrence or condition that creates an
actual or imminent danger to life or property.
   (b)   Should grantee fail to provide sufficient written proof within the
specified cure period that corrective action has been taken, or that corrective
action is being actively and expeditiously pursued by grantee, then the City
Manager shall place the issue of termination, revocation or other penalty
before an appropriate hearing officer for his or her determination pursuant to
§
4-20.21. The hearing officer shall issue a recommended decision, which will
then be acted upon by the City Council pursuant §
4-20.22.
   (c)   The City Manager, or any hearing officer authorized to act pursuant to
this chapter shall have the power to issue subpoenas in order to carry out the
fact-finding activities authorized by this chapter. The process for the
issuance and enforcement of such subpoenas shall be governed by the California
Code of Civil Procedure.
(§ 1, Ord. 2833, eff. August 5, 2006)
Sec. 4-20.21. Hearing officer procedures.
   (a)   The City Manager may, at his or her sole discretion, refer to a
hearing officer any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the
license or its existence, construction, interpretation, performance,
enforcement, operation, breach, continuance or termination. Such hearing
proceedings shall be initiated by the City Manager by written notice to grantee
at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing, which will specify the time,
place and purpose of such hearing, and provide grantee the opportunity to be
heard.
   (b)   The procedures set forth in §
1-5.08 shall govern the conduct of such administrative hearing.
   (c)   The hearing officer shall be vested with quasi-judicial authority, and
shall be authorized to issue a recommended decision:
      (1)   Ordering grantee to undertake remedial action to cure any breach of
its obligations under its license;
      (2)   Assessing liquidated damages and/or levying a penalty upon grantee
in accordance with the terms of this chapter and the license agreement;
      (3)   Determining that grantee has not violated any of its obligations
under its license; and/or
      (4)   Recommending to the City Council grounds for the revocation of the
license.
(§ 1, Ord. 2833, eff. August 5, 2006)
Sec. 4-20.22. City Council hearing procedures.
   (a)   Based on the hearing officer's recommended decision pursuant to §
4-20.21, the City Council shall determine, in writing, in its discretion
whether or not a material breach occurred and whether to terminate the license
or take other appropriate action.
   (b)   Should the City Council find that there has been a material breach of
the license, but that termination of the license is inappropriate, then the
Council may assess and levy or impose such other relief as the Council deems
appropriate, pursuant to this chapter or the license agreement, including, but
not limited to, any relief specified in §§
4-20.21(c),
4-20.23 or any combination thereof. Failure of grantee to fully and promptly
comply with an order of the City Council shall be deemed a material breach of
the license.
   (c)   The City shall cause grantee to be served with written notice of any
action taken by the City Council. The decision of the City Council as to such
matters shall be final, but may be challenged by grantee in a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   (d)   Nothing herein is intended to limit the City Council's right to make
other determinations that are reasonably related to the license, or to seek any
other appropriate relief to which the City may be entitled, at law or equity,
as a result of any breach by grantee of its obligations under the license.
(§ 1, Ord. 2833, eff. August 5, 2006)
Sec. 4-20.23. Penalties for breach of the license.
   The hearing officer or City Council may, following notice and opportunity to
cure as herein provided, impose the following penalties for any breach of the
license, except any breach of subscriber service standards, which shall be
governed by §
4-20.38, and non-payment of fees, which shall be governed by §
4-20.16(f):
   (a)   Up to Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) for each day of each material
breach, or such other amount provided in the license agreement.
   (b)   For a second material breach of the same nature occurring within
twelve (12) months where a fine or penalty was previously assessed, One
Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for each day of each material breach.
   (c)   For a third or further material breach of the same nature occurring
within twelve (12) months of the first such breach, where a fine or penalty was
previously assessed, Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) for each day of each
material breach.
(§ 1, Ord. 2833, eff. August 5, 2006)
Sec. 4-20.24. Alternative remedies.
   The City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems
appropriate to enforce the City's rights under the license in lieu of
revocation of the license. In no event shall the amount of any insurance, bond,
letter of credit or any other security instrument be construed to limit
grantee's liability for damages.
(§ 1, Ord. 2833, eff. August 5, 2006)
Sec. 4-20.25. Removal and abandonment; Purchase of system.
   (a)   Subject to applicable law, in the event that a license is terminated,
revoked, or is not renewed upon expiration, then grantee shall, upon demand of
the City, and at grantee's sole expense, promptly remove all or any portion of
its video provider system from the public rights-of-way, except with respect to
telecommunications facilities. With respect to telecommunications facilities,
grantee shall certify to the City that the portion of the facilities
responsible for delivering video programming has been disabled. In removing its
video provider system, grantee shall restore all streets to the City's standard
specifications and repair any damage to utilities or other infrastructure
caused by such removal. The liability, indemnity, insurance, security fund and
bonds required under the license shall continue in full force and effect until
such removal is accepted as complete by the City.
   (b)   Subject to applicable law, in the event that a license is not renewed
and the City acquires ownership of a video provider system or effects a
transfer of ownership of a video provider system to another person, any such
acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis
of the video provider system valued as a going concern, but with no value
allocated to the license itself. If a license is revoked for cause and the City
acquires ownership of the video provider system or effects a transfer of
ownership of the video provider system to another person, any such acquisition
or transfer shall be at an equitable price. The value of a video provider
system (fair market value or equitable price) shall be determined by an
appraisal committee consisting of three (3) disinterested appraisers. The City
and grantee shall each select one (1) appraiser, and the two (2) selected
appraisers shall agree upon and appoint a third appraiser. The foregoing shall
not apply to telecommunications facilities.
   (c)   If a grantee's plant, or a portion thereof, is deactivated for a
continuous period of thirty (30) days, (except for reasons beyond the grantee's
control), and without prior written notice to and approval by City, then the
grantee must, at City's option and demand, and at the sole expense of the
grantee, promptly remove all of the grantee's property from any streets or
other public rights-of-way, except any property comprising telecommunications
facilities. The grantee must promptly restore the streets or other public areas
from which its property has been removed to the condition existing prior to the
grantee's use.
   (d)   City may, upon written application by a grantee, approve the
abandonment in place by a grantee of any property, under such terms and
conditions as City may approve. Upon City-approved abandonment in place of any
property, the grantee must cause to be executed such instruments as the City
may prescribe in order to transfer and convey ownership of the abandoned
property to the City.
(§ 1, Ord. 2833, eff. August 5, 2006)
Sec. 4-20.26. Receivership and foreclosure.
   (a)   Subject to applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code,
any license shall, at the option of the City, cease and terminate one hundred
twenty (120) days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over
and conduct the business of grantee whether in a receivership, reorganization,
bankruptcy or other action or proceeding unless such receivership or
trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred
twenty (120) days, or unless:
      (1)   Such receiver or trustee shall have, within one hundred twenty
(120) days after his or her election or appointment, fully complied with all
terms of the license and remedied all breaches of the license or provided a
plan for the remedy of such breaches which is approved in writing by the City;
and,
      (2)   Such receiver or trustee shall, within said one hundred twenty
(120) days, execute an agreement duly approved by the Court having
jurisdiction, under which such receiver or trustee agrees to be bound by each
and every term, provision and limitation of the license.
   (b)   Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial
part of a video provider system, grantee shall notify the City of such fact,
and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in
ownership of grantee has taken place and the provisions of this chapter
governing such changes shall apply.
(§ 1, Ord. 2833, eff. August 5, 2006)
Sec. 4-20.27. Continuity of service mandatory.

provider shall at all times, and under all conditions, to the greatest extent
economically and technically possible, maintain continuity of service. In the
event of an assignment of the video provider system, the assignor shall
cooperate with the City and the assignee in order to maintain continuity of
service to all subscribers.

aerial facility in any given area. If the City reimburses any licensee for
undergrounding, all other licensees with facilities requiring undergrounding in
the same area shall be similarly reimbursed.
   (c)   Where the video provider system is installed underground, line
extenders, amplifiers, taps, power supplies, traps and related electronic
equipment and components may be placed in appropriate housings above the
surface of the ground to the extent that the method employed is compliant with
any and all generally applicable, non-discriminatory City, state, federal or
other regulations, and consistent with any other generally applicable
guidelines, policies or procedures that may, from time to time, be adopted by
the City or other applicable government agency. grantee shall provide a
procedure for undergrounding taps and pedestals, the cost of which the
subscriber will bear, and relocating the taps and pedestals within the
technical constraints of the video provider system.

enacted. Grantee shall repair and restore any cuts and/or trenching in the
roadway or sidewalks to generally applicable, non-discriminatory City
standards. Grantee shall locate and maintain its lines, cables, and other
appurtenances, on public property, in such a manner as to cause no unreasonable
interference with the use of such public property by any person.
(§ 1, Ord. 2833, eff. August 5, 2006)
Sec. 4-20.32. Approvals.

fees as may be required by other generally applicable, non-discriminatory
applicable laws or regulations.
(§ 1, Ord. 2833, eff. August 5, 2006)
Sec. 4-20.33. Submission of drawings.
   Grantee shall file with the City strand maps of the entire video provider

the video provider system.
(§ 1, Ord. 2833, eff. August 5, 2006)
Sec. 4-20.34. Relocation of facilities and equipment.
   (a)   Grantee shall remove or relocate at its sole cost any facilities
installed, used or maintained in connection with the license if and when such
removal or relocation is made necessary by any project. For purposes of this
section, the word "project" means any change of grade, alignment or width of
any public street, way, alley or place, including but not limited to, the
construction of any subway or viaduct, that the City may initiate, either by or
through itself or any redevelopment agency, community facility district,
assessment district, undergrounding district, reimbursement agreement or
generally applicable impact fee program.
   (b)   In the event that such removal or relocation is required, grantee
shall commence physical fieldwork on the removal or relocation on or before one
hundred twenty (120) days after written notice of such requirement is provided

and a reasonable opportunity to cure as provided for under this chapter, or
should grantee fail to commence performance of such work within the required
period of time, or fail to diligently proceed and promptly complete such work
thereafter, the City Manager may, subject to applicable law, upon five (5) days
prior written notice to grantee (except in cases of emergency), cause such work
or other act to be completed in whole or in part by the City or others, and

subscribers outside the office of the provider must be clearly identified as
associated with the video provider.
      (3)   At the time of installation, and annually thereafter, all video

problem.
      (8)   All video providers must provide a minimum of thirty (30) days'
written notice before increasing rates or deleting channels. All video

advance of the distribution to customers. The thirty (30)-day notice is waived
if the increases in rates or deletion of channels are outside the control of
the video provider. In those cases, the video provider must make reasonable
efforts to provide customers with as much notice as possible.
      (9)   Every video provider must allow every residential customer who pays
his or her bill directly to the video provider at least fifteen (15) days from
the date the bill for services is mailed to the customer, to pay the listed
charges unless otherwise agreed to pursuant to a residential rental agreement
establishing tenancy. Customer payments must be posted promptly. No video
provider may terminate residential service for nonpayment of a delinquent
account unless the video provider furnishes notice of the delinquency and
impending termination at least fifteen (15) days prior to the proposed
termination. The notice must be mailed, postage prepaid, to the customer to
whom the service is billed. Notice must not be mailed until the sixteenth day
after the date the bill for services was mailed to the customer. The notice of
delinquency and impending termination may be part of a billing statement. No
video provider may assess a late fee any earlier than the twenty-second day
after the bill for service has been mailed.
      (10)   Every notice of termination of service pursuant to the preceding
subsection (9) must include all of the following information:
         (i)   The name and address of the customer whose account is
delinquent.
         (ii)   The amount of the delinquency.
         (iii)   The date by which payment is required in order to avoid
termination of service.
         (iv)   The telephone number of a representative of the video provider
who can provide additional information and handle complaints or initiate an

      (12)   Any service terminated without good cause must be restored without
charge for the service restoration. Good cause includes, but is not limited to,
failure to pay, payment by check for which there are insufficient funds, theft
of service, abuse of equipment or system personnel, or other similar subscriber
actions.
      (13)   All video providers must issue requested refund checks promptly,
but no later than forty-five (45) days following the resolution of any dispute,
and following the return of the equipment supplied by the video provider, if
service is terminated.
      (14)   All video providers must issue security or customer deposit refund
checks promptly, but no later than forty-five (45) days following the
termination of service, less any deductions permitted by law.
      (15)   Video providers must not disclose the name and address of a
subscriber for commercial gain to be used in mailing lists or for other
commercial purposes not reasonably related to the conduct of the businesses of
the video providers or their affiliates, unless the video providers have
provided to the subscriber a notice, separate or included in any other customer
notice, that clearly and conspicuously describes the subscriber's ability to
prohibit the disclosure. Video providers must provide an address and telephone
number for a local subscriber to use without toll charge to prevent disclosure
of the subscriber's name and address.

   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to authorize the imposition of
monetary penalties for the violation of the customer service standards

      (2)   If the grantee or any interested person is aggrieved by a decision
of the City Manager, the aggrieved party may, within ten (10) days of the
written decision, appeal that decision in writing to the City Council. The

twelve (12)-month period for which the City has provided notice and a penalty
has been assessed, the maximum penalty is Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00) for
each day of the material violation, not to exceed One Thousand Two Hundred
Dollars ($1,200.00) for each occurrence of the material violation.
         (iii)   For a third or further material violation of the same nature
within a twelve (12)-month period for which the City has provided notice and a
penalty has been assessed, the maximum penalty is One Thousand Dollars
($1,000.00) for each day of the material violation, not to exceed Three
Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) for each occurrence of the material violation.
      (4)   Judicial remedy. This subsection does not preclude any affected

Sec. 5-12.09. Notice of intention to abate.
   (a)   A ten (10) day notice of intention to abate and remove the vehicle or

or parts thereof is in such condition that identification numbers are not

prescribed by a resolution of the City Council.
   (b)   The requirement that not less than a ten (10) day notice of intention
to abate and remove the vehicle or part thereof as a public nuisance be issued,
unless the property owner and the owner of the vehicle have signed releases

thereof. However, the notice of intention is not required for removal of a
vehicle or part thereof that is inoperable due to the absence of a motor,
transmission, or wheels and incapable of being towed, is valued at less than

was recovered pursuant to subdivision Cal. Veh. Code § 22661(a), the local
agency shall provide notice to the registered and legal owners of intent to
dispose of the vehicle or part, and if the vehicle or part is not claimed and
removed within twelve (12) days after the notice is mailed, from a location
specified in Cal. Veh. Code § 22662, final disposition may proceed. No local
agency or contractor thereof shall be liable for damage caused to a vehicle or

use or (2) not improved with a residential structure containing one or more
dwelling units.
(Cal. Veh. Code § 22661(c)) (§ 9, Ord. 1684, eff. June 6, 1968, as amended by §
5, Ord. 2554, eff. October 7, 1993)
Sec. 5-12.10. Hearing; Notice.
   Upon request by the owner of the vehicle or the owner of the land and if
received by the Code Enforcement Manager within the ten (10) days after the
mailing of the notices of intention to abate and remove, the Code Enforcement
Manager shall hold a hearing, which shall be open to the public, on the
question of abatement and removal of the vehicle, or parts thereof as an
abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle, and the assessment of
the administrative costs and the cost of removal of the vehicle, or parts of a
vehicle, against the property on which it is located.
   If the owner of the land submits a sworn statement, in writing, denying
responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land within the such ten
(10) day period, said statement shall be construed as a request for a hearing
which does not require his presence. Notice of hearing shall be mailed, by
registered or certified mail, at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the
hearing to the owner of the land and to the owner of the vehicle, unless the
vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to
determine ownership. If such a request for hearing is not received within said
ten (10) days after mailing of the notice of intention to abate and remove, the
City shall have the authority to abate and remove the vehicle or parts thereof
as a public nuisance without holding a hearing.

   All hearings under this chapter shall be held before the Code Enforcement
Manager which shall hear all facts and testimony it deems pertinent. Said facts
and testimony may include testimony on the condition of the vehicle, or parts
thereof, and the circumstances concerning its location on the said property,
public or private. The Code Enforcement Manager shall not be limited by the
technical rules of evidence.
   The owner of the land may appear in person at the hearing or present a sworn
statement, in writing, in time for consideration at the hearing, and deny
responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his reasons
for such denial.
   The Code Enforcement Manager may impose such conditions and take such other
action as he deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purpose
of this chapter. He may delay the time for removal of the vehicle, or parts
thereof, if in his opinion the circumstances justify it. At the conclusion of
the hearing, the Code Enforcement Manager may find that a vehicle, or parts
thereof, has been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or is inoperative on private
or public property and order the same removed from the property as a public
nuisance and disposed of as hereinafter provided and determine the
administrative costs and the cost of removal to be charged against the owner of
the land. The order requiring removal shall include a description of the
vehicle or parts thereof and the correct identification number and license
number of the vehicle if available at the site.
   If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land
without the consent of the owner of the land and that he has not subsequently
acquiesced in its presence, the Code Enforcement Manager shall not assess the
costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon
which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from
such owner of the land.
   If the owner of the land submits a sworn statement denying responsibility
for the presence of the vehicle on his land but does not appear or if an
interested party makes a written presentation to the Code Enforcement Manager
but does not appear, he shall be notified in writing of the decision.

by filing a written notice of appeal with the said Code Enforcement Manager
within ten (10) days after its decision. Such appeal shall be heard by the City
Council which may affirm, amend or reverse the order or take other action
deemed appropriate.
   The Clerk shall give written notice of the time and place of hearing to the
appellant and those persons specified in §
5-12.09 of this
Chapter 12.
   In conducting the hearing, the City Council shall not be limited by the
technical rules of evidence.

closet and lavatory for each sex in a closed facility for employees of each
food concession or operation within the enclosure area of such food operation

any license may be issued. Chemical toilets shall be emptied and recharged at
the licensee's expense as necessary pursuant to procedures established by the

operations, and for the use of employees may not be waived.

psychologists, nurses, and other aides needed to staff such facilities, and the
quantity of medical supplies, drugs, ambulances, and other equipment which

attorneys’ fees and costs to a prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable
attorneys’ fees incurred by the City in the proceeding.
(§ 3, Ord. 3046, eff. April 14, 2016)
Sec. 5-22.07. Assessment of costs.
   (a)   To the extent the Code Enforcement Director, or his or her designee,
determines that the public nuisance or nuisances cited in the Notice of
Violation existed on the affected premises, and the cost of abatement of such
nuisance or nuisances was reasonable, the Code Enforcement Director, or his or
her designee, shall make a written order setting forth these findings and
ordering that, if such costs are not paid within a specified period, the owner,
lessee, occupant, or other person having charge of the affected premises, shall
be personally liable for such costs. Upon resolution of the City Council, such
costs shall be collected by:
      (1)   A lien on the affected premises pursuant to California Government
Code § 38773.1; or
      (2)   A special assessment against the affected premises pursuant to
California Government Code § 38773.5.
   (b)   If the City chooses to collect its abatement costs through a lien on
the affected premises, the notices to the owner of the affected premises
required by this chapter shall be served in the same manner as summons in a
civil action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Part 2, Title 5, Chapter 4,
Article 3 (commencing with § 415.10). If the owner of record of the parcel of
land on which the nuisance is maintained, based on the last equalized
assessment roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is more current, after
diligent search cannot be found, notices to the owner may be served by posting
a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the affected premises for a period
of ten (10) days, and publication thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation, published in San Bernardino County pursuant to California
Government Code § 6062. The lien shall be recorded in the San Bernardino County
Recorder’s Office, and from the date of recording, shall have the force,
effect, and priority of a judgment lien. The lien shall specify the amount of
the lien, the name of the City as the agency on whose behalf the lien is filed,
the date of the Notice of Violation and order of the City Council, the street
address, legal description and assessor’s parcel number of the affected
premises on which the lien is imposed, and the name and address of the recorded
owner of the affected premises. In the event that the lien is discharged,
released, or satisfied, either through payment or foreclosure, notice of the
discharge containing the information specified in the preceding sentence shall
be recorded by the City. The lien and the release of the lien shall be indexed
in the grantor-grantee index. The lien may be foreclosed by an action brought
by the City for a monetary judgment.
   (c)   If the City chooses to collect its abatement costs through a special
assessment, the notices required by this chapter shall be provided to the owner
by certified mail, as determined from the County Assessor’s or County
Recorder’s records. Notice of the special assessment, and requests for a
hearing regarding the special assessment, shall be in accordance with §
1-4.05 (Appeal Hearing for Special Assessments) of this Municipal Code.
      The special assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the
same manner as ordinary City taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the
same penalties, and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as
provided for ordinary City taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection
and enforcement of City taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. If
any real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred
or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide
encumbrance for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date
on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the
cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property, but
instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. The City may
conduct a sale of vacant residential developed property for which the payment
of such assessment made pursuant to this subdivision is delinquent. Notices or
instruments relating to the abatement proceeding or special assessment may be
recorded.
   (d)   All other notices required by this chapter shall be delivered by first
class US Mail, postage prepaid to the recipient thereof.

   (a)   The owner, lessee, occupant, or other person having charge of any such
buildings or premises who maintains any public nuisance, as defined in §
5-22.01(a) and (d) of this chapter, or who neglects to comply with the Notice
of Violation pursuant to § 5-22.04 (Notice of Violation) of this chapter, is
guilty of an infraction.
   (b)   Any occupant or lessee in possession of any such building or structure
who refuses to vacate the building or structure, in accordance with an order
given as herein provided, is guilty of an infraction.
   (c)   Any person who removes any notice or order posted as herein required
for the purpose of interfering with the enforcement of these provisions shall
be guilty of an infraction.
   (d)   No person shall obstruct, impede, or interfere with any representative
of the City Council, or any representative of a City department, or with any
person who owns or holds any estate or interest in a building that has been
ordered to be vacated, repaired, rehabilitated, or demolished and removed, or
with any person to whom any such building has been lawfully sold pursuant to
these provisions whenever any such representative of the City Council,
representative of the City, purchaser or person having any interest or estate
in such building is engaged in vacating, repairing, rehabilitating, or
demolishing and removing any such building pursuant to these provisions, or in
performing any necessary act preliminary to or incidental to such work as
herein authorized or directed. It is a defense to prosecution under this
division (d) that the alleged obstruction or interference consisted of
constitutionally protected speech only.
   (e)   Any prevailing party in an action to abate a public nuisance shall be
entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs, to the extent such attorneys’ fees and
costs do not exceed the reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by the
City. The City may limit recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs by the
prevailing party to those individual actions which the City elects, at the
initiation of that individual action, to seek recovery of its own attorneys’
fees and costs.
   (f)   Upon entry of a second or subsequent civil or criminal judgment within
a two- (2-)year period finding that an owner of property is responsible for a
public nuisance, except for conditions abated pursuant to California Health &
Safety Code § 17980, the owner shall be liable to the City for treble the costs
of the abatement.
(§ 3, Ord. 3046, eff. April 14, 2016)
Sec. 5-22.09. Recordation of Notice of Violation.
   (a)   If a violation has not been fully abated or corrected, as determined
by the City, within the deadline set forth in a Notice of Violation, or within
the deadline provided in a decision on an appeal of a Notice of Violation in
the event of an appeal, then the City, in its sole discretion, may record the
Notice of Violation with the San Bernardino County Recorder's Office against
said premises.
   (b)   The City shall record a Notice of Release of Notice of Violation with
the San Bernardino County Recorder's Office within 10 business days of its
determination that a violation or a public nuisance has been fully abated or
corrected with all required City approvals, permits, licenses and the passage
of all City required inspections.
(§ 7, Ord. 3230, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 5-22.10. Emergency Action to Abate an Imminent Hazard.
   (a)   Notwithstanding any provision of this Code to the contrary, an
enforcement official may cause a public nuisance to be summarily abated if it
is determined that the nuisance creates an imminent hazard to a person or
persons, or to other real or personal property. Prior to abating the nuisance,
the City may attempt to notify a responsible person of the imminent hazard and
request its abatement by said person. The enforcement official may, in his or
her discretion, dispense with an attempt of prior notification of a responsible
person if the nature or severity of the hazard justifies such inaction.
   (b)   Within 10 business days, or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter,
following emergency actions of City Personnel to abate an imminent hazard, the
City shall serve any responsible person with a Notice of Emergency Abatement of
an Imminent Hazard. The notice shall contain a brief description of the
condition(s) and reasons why it constitutes an imminent hazard, the law
prohibiting or pertaining to the imminent hazard, and the actions the City took
to abate the imminent hazard. A Notice of Emergency Abatement may be appealed
in the same manner as a Notice of Violation in accordance with the provisions
of §
5-22.05. The City shall be entitled to recover its fees and costs for the
abatement of an imminent hazard. In such instances, the City shall follow the
procedures set forth in this Chapter.

Sec. 5-25.01. Findings and purpose.
   Abandoned shopping carts constitute a nuisance, create potential hazards to
the health and safety of the public, and interfere with pedestrian and
vehicular traffic within the City of Ontario. The accumulation of wrecked,
dismantled, and abandoned shopping carts on public or private property also
tends to create conditions that reduce property values, promoting blight and
deterioration in the City. The purpose of this chapter is to provide
regulations pertaining to abandoned shopping carts, unmarked shopping carts,
and to provide a requirement for a mandatory plan to prevent cart removal. This
chapter is not intended to duplicate State law or regulate any matters
pertaining to shopping carts which are the subject of State law. To the extent
any provision of this chapter is determined to be preempted by State law, it
shall be deemed severed from all other provisions of this chapter and such
other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

removal of the cart from the business premises;
      (3)   Notifies the public that the unauthorized removal of the cart from
the premises or parking area of the retail establishment, or the unauthorized
possession of the cart, is a violation of State law; and
      (4)   Lists a valid telephone number to contact to report the location of
the abandoned cart or lists an address for returning the cart to the owner or
business establishment.
   (b)   Required signs on property. Signs shall be placed in pertinent places
near door exits and near parking lot exists that notify customers that cart

CHAPTER 26: TEMPORARY STREET CLOSURES DUE TO CONTINUING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY
   
5-26.01   Findings and purpose
   
5-26.02   Definitions
   
5-26.03   Identification of designated streets
   
5-26.04   Temporary street closure; violation

5-26.07   Spectators prohibited at speed contests or exhibitions
Sec. 5-26.01. Findings and purpose.
   (a)   Certain streets within the City have been subject to continuing and
escalating nighttime street racing over the past two years. Such street racing
constitutes a nuisance, creates potential hazards to the health and safety of
the public, and interferes with pedestrian and vehicular traffic within the
City. The illegal races occur on a regular basis in the industrial or warehouse
zones of the City. Hundreds of people have been found to form illicit “tracks”
along Broad Street and Long Street. Those gathered often block the streets and
sidewalks to form the racetrack area, place bets and generally encourage, aid
and abet the racing process.
   (b)   Street racers accelerate to extremely high speeds without regard to
oncoming traffic, pedestrians, or vehicles parked and moving nearby. The racers
move quickly from street to street, racing for several heats and then often
moving on to another street upon the arrival of a police unit. Calls for police
service, traffic accidents, and property crimes have increased dramatically
since 1998; and two murders have also occurred which were motivated by unpaid
street racing bets.
   (c)   This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority granted by Cal. Veh.
Code § 21101.4 which allows local authorities to adopt rules and regulations
for temporary street closures due to serious and continual criminal activity on
portions of the streets recommended for closure.
   (d)   The Council's findings, based upon the recommendation of the Ontario
Police Chief in regard to the Cal. Veh. Code § 21101.4 criteria, are as stated
in §§
5-26.02 through
5-26.06.
(§ 1, Ord. 2713, eff. June 1, 2000)
Sec. 5-26.02. Definitions.
   (a)   "Designated Streets" shall mean those streets which the City Council
determines by resolution to meet the criteria identified in Cal. Veh. Code §
21101.4.
   (b)   "Street race" shall mean any unlawful speed contest, as defined by
Cal. Veh. Code § 23109, whether or not the race is attended by persons other
than the drivers racing vehicles on city streets.
   (c)   "Temporary street closure" shall mean closure for not more than 18
months, pursuant to Cal. Veh. Code § 21101.4(b) (subject to extension) of the
abovementioned streets from the hours of 11:00 p.m. on Friday night to 6:00
a.m. Saturday morning, and 11:00 p.m. Saturday night to 6:00 a.m. Sunday
morning.
   (d)   "Violator" shall mean the responsible party for a juvenile violator of
this chapter or an adult violator of this chapter.
(§ 1, Ord. 2713, eff. June 1, 2000)
Sec. 5-26.03. Identification of designated streets.
   (a)   Upon the recommendation of the Police Chief, the City Council may from
time to time adopt a resolution identifying streets where there are continuing
activities that warrant closure of a street in accordance with Cal. Veh. Code §
21101.4.
   (b)   Prior to adopting a resolution identifying designated streets for
temporary closure, the City Council shall make the following findings:
      (1)   Serious and continuing criminal activity exists on designated
streets within the City which are recommended for temporary closure on weekends
between the hours of 11:00 p.m. Friday night and 6:00 a.m. Saturday morning,
and 11:00 p.m. Saturday night and 6:00 a.m. Sunday morning.
      (2)   The designated streets have not been designated as through highways
or arterial streets;
      (3)   Vehicular or pedestrian traffic on the designated streets
contributes to the criminal activity of nighttime street racing; and
      (4)   The temporary closure of the designated streets will not
substantially adversely affect traffic flow, safety down the adjacent streets
or in the surrounding neighborhoods, the operation of emergency vehicles,
performance of municipal or public utility services, or the delivery of freight
by commercial vehicles in the area of the highway posed to be temporarily
closed.
(§ 1, Ord. 2713, eff. June 1, 2000)
Sec. 5-26.04. Temporary street closure; violation.
   (a)   Vehicles parked on the designated streets during the time of temporary
closure shall be towed pursuant to Cal. Veh. Code § 22651(n).
   (b)   Signs giving notice of the temporary closure shall be posted prior to

14, 2002)
Sec. 5-26.05. Police services fee for violations of temporary street closures.
   (a)   Purpose. The City finds and determines that persons who are detained
and taken into custody by police personnel for violating temporary street
closures at the designated streets impose an extraordinary burden on Police
Department staffing and resources. Police officers supervising detained
violators are unavailable to carry out police duties in the field, causing
decreases in levels of police protection and public safety in the community.
The purpose of this section is to defray the reasonable costs the City incurs
to provide extraordinary police services to respond to, detain and supervise
violators of temporary street closures.
   (b)   Police services fee established; debt to City.
      (1)   The violator of the temporary street closure shall be liable for a
police services fee whenever the City's police personnel respond to, detain and
supervise a violator of temporary street closures. The City Council shall
establish the amount of the police services fee by resolution.
      (2)   The police services fee charged to the violator of the temporary
street closure shall be a debt to the City by the violator. Any violator owing
to the City pursuant to this section shall be liable in an action brought by
the City in its own name to recover such amount, including reasonable
attorneys' fees.
   (c)   Billing. The Chief of Police or his or her designee shall notify the
Finance Department in writing of (i) the names and addresses of the violator,
(ii) the date and time of the violation of §
5-26.04 of this chapter, (iii) the names of the police personnel who responded
to, detained and supervised the violator, and (iv) the date that the violator
was reprimanded by the San Bernardino Juvenile Court for the violation (if
applicable). The Finance Department may adopt administrative procedures for the
purposes of enforcing the provisions of this section.
   (d)   Appeal. Any violator who receives a bill from the Finance Department
pursuant to this section may, within fifteen (15) days after receiving such
bill, file a written request with the City Clerk appealing the bill. The
written appeal shall state the grounds for such appeal and the specific facts
and basis for the appeal. The violator is deemed to have received a bill on the
third day following the date that the Finance Department caused the bill to be
placed in the United States mail. The City Manager, or his or her designee,
shall review any written appeal filed with the City Clerk pursuant to this
section and shall prepare a written decision on the appeal within thirty (30)
days from the date that the written appeal is received by the City Clerk. All
decisions by the City Manager, or his or her designee, shall be final.
(§ 1, Ord. 2713, eff. June 1, 2000)
Sec. 5-26.06. Citation of persons violating temporary street closures; removal
and storage of vehicle; release of stored vehicle; liability for towing and
storage fees.
   (a)   Whenever a peace officer determines that a person was violating the
temporary street closure, as described in §
5-26.04 of this Code, the peace officer may immediately cite that person and
may cause the removal and storage of the motor vehicle used by that person. A
motor vehicle may not be stored for more than 30 days.
   (b)   The registered and legal owner of the vehicle that is removed and
seized under subdivision (a) or their agent shall be provided with the
opportunity for a storage hearing to determine the validity of the storage.
   (c)   (1)   An impounding agency shall release the motor vehicle to the
registered owner or his or her agent prior to the conclusion of the impoundment
period described in subdivision (a) under any of the following circumstances:
         (i)   If the vehicle is a stolen vehicle.
         (ii)   If the person is alleged to have been parked on designated
streets during the time of temporary closure, as described in §
5-26.04 of this Code, was not authorized by the registered owner of the motor
vehicle to operate the motor vehicle at the time of the commission of the
offense.
         (iii)   If the legal owner or registered owner of the vehicle is a
rental car agency.
         (iv)   If, prior to the conclusion of the impoundment period, a
citation or notice is dismissed, criminal charges are not filed by the City
Attorney because of lack of evidence, or the charges are otherwise dismissed by
the court.
      (2)   A vehicle shall be released pursuant to this subdivision only if
the registered owner or his or her agent presents a currently valid driver's
license to operate the vehicle and proof of current vehicle registration, or if
ordered by a court.
   (d)   A vehicle stored or impounded under subdivision (a) shall be released
to the legal owner of the vehicle or the legal owner's agent on or before the
30th day of impoundment if all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The legal owner is a motor vehicle dealer, bank, credit union,
acceptance corporation, or other licensed financial institution legally
operating in this state, or is another person, not the registered owner,
holding a security interest in the vehicle.
      (2)   The legal owner or the legal owner's agent pays all towing and
storage fees related to the impoundment of the vehicle. No lien sale processing
fee shall be charged to a legal owner who redeems the vehicle on or before the

      (3)   The legal owner or the legal owner's agent presents foreclosure
documents or an affidavit of repossession of the vehicle.
   (e)   (1)   The registered owner or his or her agent is responsible for all
towing and storage charges related to the impoundment, and any administrative
charges authorized by law.
      (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the violator was not authorized
by the registered owner of the motor vehicle to operate the motor vehicle at
the time of the commission of the offense, the court shall order the convicted
person to reimburse the registered owner for any towing and storage charges
related to the impoundment, and any administrative charges authorized by law
and incurred by the registered owner to obtain possession of the vehicle,
unless the court finds that the person convicted does not have the ability to
pay all or part of these charges.
      (3)   If the vehicle is a rental vehicle, the rental car agency may
require the person to whom the vehicle is rented to pay all towing and storage
charges related to the impoundment and any administrative charges authorized by

   It is hereby found and declared that:
   (a)   The making and creation of excessive, unnecessary or unusually loud
noises within the limits of the City is a condition that has existed for some
time, however, the extent and volume of such noises is increasing;
   (b)   The making, creation or maintenance of such excessive, unnecessary,
unnatural or unusually loud noises that are prolonged, unusual and unnatural in
their time, place and use affect and are a detriment to public health, comfort,
convenience, safety, welfare and prosperity of the residents of the City; and
   (c)   The necessity in the public interest for the provisions and
prohibitions hereinafter contained and enacted, is declared as a matter of
legislative determination and public policy, and it is further declared that
the provisions and prohibitions hereinafter contained and enacted are in
pursuance of and for the purpose of securing and promoting the public health,
comfort, convenience, safety, welfare and prosperity and the peace and quiet of
the residents of the City.
(§ 2, Ord. 2888, eff. March 6, 2008)
Sec. 5-29.02. Definitions.
   As used in this chapter, specific words and phrases are defined as follows:
   (a)   "Ambient noise level" shall mean the all-encompassing noise level
associated with a given environment and is a composite of sounds from all
sources, excluding the alleged offensive noise or excessive sound, at the
location and approximate time at which a comparison with the alleged offensive
noise is to be made.
   (b)   "Applicable (noise) zone" shall mean the noise zone category based on
the actual use of the property, provided that the actual use is a legal use in
the City.
   (c)   "A-weighted sound level" shall mean the sound pressure level in
decibels (dBAs) as measured with a sound level meter using the A-weighted
filter network (scale) at slow response and at a pressure of twenty (20)
micropascals. The A-weighted filter de-emphasizes the very low and a very high
frequency component of sound in a manner similar to the response of the human
ear, and is a numerical method of rating human judgment of loudness.
   (d)   "Decibel (dBA)" shall mean a unit for measuring the amplitude of a
sound, equal to twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base ten (10) of the
ratio of pressure of the sound measured to the reference pressure of twenty
(20) micropascals.
   (e)   "Equivalent sound or noise level (Leq)" shall mean the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60804 Standard for measurement, or the most
recent revision thereof, for the sound level corresponding to a steady state
noise level over a given sample period with the same amount of acoustic energy
as the actual time varying noise level or the energy average noise level during
the sample period. The measurement period for the purposes of this chapter is
fifteen (15) minutes.
   (f)   "Impulsive noise" shall mean a noise of short duration usually less
than one (1) second and of high intensity, with an abrupt onset and rapid
decay. Such objectionable noises may also be repetitive.
   (g)   "Intrusive noise" shall mean that noise that intrudes over and above
the ambient noise at a given location. The relative intrusiveness of a sound
depends upon its amplitude, duration, frequency, time of occurrence and tonal
information content, as well as the prevailing ambient noise level.
   (h)   "Maintenance" shall mean the upkeep, repair or preservation of
existing property or structures.
   (i)   "Noise" shall mean any unwanted sound or sound that is undesirable
because it interferes with speech and hearing, or is intense enough to damage
hearing or is otherwise annoying.
   (j)   "Noise level (sound level)" shall mean the weighted sound pressure
level obtained by use of a sound level meter having a standard frequency filter
for attenuating part of the sound spectrum. For purposes of this chapter, all
noise levels (sound levels) shall be A-weighted sound pressure level.
   (k)   "Noise (sound) level meter" shall mean an instrument, including a
microphone, an amplifier, an output meter and frequency weighting networks for
the measurement and determination of noise and sound levels. For the purposes
of this chapter, the sound level meter must meet the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60651 and 60804 Standards, or the most recent
revisions thereof, for Type 1 sound level meters or an instrument and the
associated recording and analyzing equipment that will provide equivalent data.

   The actual use of the property, and not necessarily its zoning designation,
shall be the determining factor in establishing whether a property is in Noise
Zone I, II, III, IV or V, provided that the actual use is a legal use within
the applicable zone.

of securing and promoting the public health, comfort, safety and welfare for
its citizenry. While recognizing that the use of sound amplifying equipment may
be entitled to certain protection by the constitutional rights of freedom of
speech and assembly, the City Council finds that in order to protect the public
safety and the correlative rights of the citizens of this community to privacy
and freedom from public nuisance of loud and unnecessary noise, reasonable
regulation of the time, place and manner of the use of amplifying equipment is
necessary. In no event shall approval or authorization required herein be
withheld by reason of the constitutionally protected content of any material
proposed to be broadcast through amplifying equipment.
   (b)   It is unlawful for any person, other than personnel of law enforcement
or governmental agencies, to install, use or operate a loudspeaker or sound
amplifying device in a fixed or movable position or mounted upon any vehicle

addresses or lectures to any persons or assemblages of persons in or upon any
street, alley, sidewalk, park, place or public property without a permit to do
so from the Police Chief or his or her designee. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this chapter, the provisions of this section shall also apply to
the use of sound amplifying equipment upon public or private property when used
in connection with outdoor or indoor public or private events, whether or not
admission is charged or food or beverages are sold, when such activity is to be
attended by more than one hundred (100) persons and the noise emanating from
the event will be audible at the property plane, or in the case of a street
dance or concert on the nearest residential property. Those activities listed
in §
5-29.06(a) are exempt from the requirements of this section.
   (c)   The Police Chief or his or her designee is authorized to approve and
issue permits under this section.
   (d)   An application for a permit required by this section shall be filed
with the Police Chief at least sixteen (16) days and no more than one hundred
twenty (120) days prior to the date on which the sound amplifying equipment is
intended to be used. Applications for events covered by the First Amendment of
the United States Constitution are exempt from the time requirements of this
section if it is shown that circumstances require a shorter filing period and
the event will not constitute an unsafe condition. The application shall
contain the following information:
      (1)   The name, address and telephone number of both the owner and the
user of the sound amplifying equipment;
      (2)   The license number, if a sound truck is to be used;
      (3)   A general description of the sound amplifying equipment which is to

permit if the chief finds any of the following:
      (1)   The application contains materially false or intentionally
misleading information;
      (2)   The use of sound amplifying equipment at an event or activity
proposed will be located in or upon a premises, building or structure that is
hazardous to the health or safety of the employees or patrons of the premises,
business, activity, or event, or the general public, under the standards
established by the Uniform Building or Fire Codes, or other applicable codes,
as set forth in OMC Titles 4 and 8;

prior to the intended event. Community parks are exempt from this subsection
(8); or
      (9)   The applicant or location has had previous violations within the
past calendar year, and in the judgment of the Police Chief, issuance would be
contrary to the intent of this section.
   (f)   In determining whether the use of the equipment would constitute an
unreasonable interference with or detriment to traffic safety, the Police Chief
shall consider, but shall not necessarily be limited to:
      (1)   The volumes, patterns and speed of vehicular and pedestrian traffic
in the proposed area of use;

City Manager or hearing officer shall be the final administrative decision of
the City. Any party dissatisfied with the decision of the City Manager or
hearing officer may seek review of such decision under the provisions of Code
Civil Procedure, §§ 1094.5 and 1094.8, as amended from time to time.

CHAPTER 31: SIDEWALK VENDING
   
5-31.01   Purpose; findings
   
5-31.02   Definitions
   
5-31.03   Permit required
   
5-31.04   Stationary sidewalk vending locations and standards

5-31.07   Penalties
Sec. 5-31.01. Purpose; findings.
   The City Council finds that the vending of prepared or pre-packaged foods,
goods, and/or wares at semi-permanent locations on public sidewalks and rights-
of-way may pose unsafe conditions and special dangers to the public health,
safety, and welfare of residents and visitors. The purpose of this chapter is
to implement regulations on both roaming and stationary sidewalk vending that
protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the community while complying
with the requirements of general state law, as amended from time to time, to
promote safe vending practices, prevent safety, traffic, and health hazards,
and preserve the public peace, safety, and welfare of the community. The
activities of sidewalk vendors, who set up stands on sidewalks or move from
place to place as a roaming vendor, have the potential for vendors to engage in
illegal activities, including but not limited to the sale of illegal substances
or merchandise and the sale of counterfeit products, and many sidewalk vendors
sell products which are targeted towards and purchased by children, which
necessitates background checks for vendors to assure that any past
improprieties are disclosed to the permitting authority and in order to ensure
the safety of residents and the merchantability of products sold by vendors
without fixed places of business. The activities of sidewalk vendors also have
the potential to cause injury to persons or property by the manner in which
they are sited, or by their movement on sidewalks that are otherwise used by
the traditionalactivities of pedestrians and vehicles on adjacent streets for
access, transport, delivery of merchandise to local businesses, exercise and
related activities. As sidewalk vending activities have significant potential
to be physically incompatible with the general public's traditional use of
sidewalks, reasonable regulations, including siting restrictions, are necessary
to protect the public health, safety and welfare to ensure sidewalks are safe
and passable, especially for pedestrians and the physically disabled.

cannot be advertising or other commercial message with brand name, product
name, abbreviation thereof, company or business name or logo, trademark, brand
imagery or products and services for sale. The Public Art Program Advisory
Commission will determine if an image, painting pattern, or other element on

element is not a work of art, then other applicable law may be applied such as
sign or building design guidelines by other City departments.

intended to change the rules governing the determination of whether a mural may
be placed on a historic building.
   (e)   A City commissioned mural shall remain in place, without alteration,
for a minimum of six (6) months.
   (f)    Removal. A City commissioned mural may be removed after six (6)

property, under any the following circumstances as determined by the Executive
Director of the Community Life & Culture Agency:
      (1)   The property is sold;
      (2)   The structure or property is substantially remodeled or altered in

herein below, the City shall, at the discretion of the City Council, set aside
an amount equal to one (1) percent of the City Council approved budget for
development costs of such capital improvement projects for the commission,

of such funds towards public art projects other than on the site from which the
funds were budgeted for projects valued at $100,000,000.00 or more.
   (d)   Bond proceeds may be utilized for the commission and/or acquisition of
artwork on a case by case basis and upon review and approval by City Finance
staff and City's Bond Counsel. If City Finance staff and City's Bond Counsel
approve the use of bond proceeds for the commission and/or acquisition of a
specific artwork, then the Public Art Commission shall request that the
specific amount needed to commission and/or acquire that artwork be distributed
to cover expenses, up to one (1) percent of the approved budget for development
costs of such capital improvement project. Bond proceeds shall not be directly
transferred to the Public Art Fund upon issuance of bonds but will only be
distributed on a case by case basis with approval by City Finance staff and
City's Bond Counsel.
   (e)   Development Impact Fees may be utilized for the commission and/or
acquisition of artwork on a case by case basis and upon review and approval by
City Finance staff and City's legal counsel. If City Finance staff and City's
legal counsel approve the use of Development Impact Fees proceeds for the
commission and/or acquisition of a specific artwork, then the Public Art
Commission shall request that the specific amount needed to commission and/or
acquire that artwork be distributed to cover expenses, up to one (1) percent of
the approved budget for development costs of such capital improvement project.

or upon private property. Such extended period of time shall consist of
incessant barking for 30 minutes or more in any 24-hour period, or intermittent
barking for 60 minutes or more during any 24-hour period. A dog shall not be
deemed a "barking dog" for purposes of this Chapter if, at any time the dog is

property in or upon which the dog is situated, or when the dog is being teased
or provoked.
   (b)   "Civil Citation" means a notice issued pursuant to this Article that
there has been a violation of this Chapter.
   (c)   "Day or Days" as used in this Article shall mean calendar day or
calendar days, respectively, unless otherwise expressly provided. The time in

designee.

violation occurred, or the date the citation is posted in a conspicuous place
either on the property where the barking dog or noisy animal is located or

by posting, the barking dog or noisy animal citation shall also be mailed
within 24 hours of posting to any address known for the violator.
   (h)   "Noisy Animal" shall mean any animal other than a dog that makes a
noise which emanates from the animal. The noise must be for an extended period
of time to the disturbance of another person, either continuously for 30
minutes or more in any 24-hour period, or intermittently for a total of 60 or
more accumulated minutes during any 24-hour period. An animal shall not be
considered a "noisy animal" for purposes of this Article if the animal is

private property in or upon which the animal is situated, or when the animal is
being teased or provoked, or if the animal is injured.
   (i)   "Notice of Decision" means a form used by a Hearing Officer to inform
a violator and/or complainant of an administrative hearing decision regarding
provisions of this Chapter.

proper control over a barking dog or noisy animal.

its discretion to utilize any other remedy, civil or criminal, including
declaring a barking dog or noisy animal a public nuisance and abating as such.
   (d)   The purpose of issuing civil citations pursuant to this Article is to
encourage voluntary and complete compliance with the provisions of this Code

Sec. 6-1.252. Barking Dog and Noisy Animals Declared Public Nuisance.
   (a)   A barking dog or noisy animal, as defined in §
6-1.250, may be declared to be a public nuisance that may be abated as provided
in this Section.
   (b)   A barking dog or noisy animal may be deemed a public nuisance when two
or more declarations, made under penalty of perjury and made by declarants
living in separate households, are filed with the Enforcing Officer within a
sixty (60) day period stating in detail all of the following:
      (1)   That the declarant is a resident of a residential neighborhood
located within 200 yards of the boundaries of the premises where the dog or
animal is located;
      (2)   Within the past month declarant has heard the dog bark or animal
make noise for substantially long periods to the extreme annoyance of the
declarant.
   (c)   Upon receipt of two such declarations, the Enforcing Officer shall
assign an officer to investigate the complaints. The officer shall personally
interview both the complainants and the Owner and/or Responsible Party.
   (d)   If the investigating officer determines that there is merit to the
complaints, the Owner and/or Responsible Party shall be notified by the officer
that the dog's barking, or animal's noises, is annoying the neighbors and that
it must be abated.
   (e)   If any further declaration is received by the Enforcing Officer
concerning the same barking dog or noisy animal, within a six (6) month period
from the last of the initial declarations, the Enforcing Officer may take
action by notifying the Owner and/or Responsible Party by certified mail,
return receipt requested, that an administrative hearing is to be held. Such
administrative hearing will be held in accordance with the provisions of § 1-
5.08 of this Code.
(§ 3, Ord. 3229, eff. January 19, 2023)
Sec. 6-1.253. Barking Dog or Noisy Animal Citation: General.
   (a)   In addition to treating a barking dog or noisy animal as a public
nuisance, any Enforcement Officer also has the authority to issue a civil
citation to any Responsible Person for a barking dog or noisy animal violation
that the Enforcement Officer did not see or hear occur based on a complaint,
signed under penalty of perjury, lodged by a member of the community who has
been disturbed by the barking dog or noisy animal. A Responsible Person to whom
a civil citation is issued shall be liable for and shall pay to the City the
fine or fines described in the barking dog or noisy animal citation when due.
Where the Responsible Person is a minor under the age of eighteen (18) years,
the minor's parents or legal guardian shall be liable for and held responsible
for payment of their minor child's citation fines and/or late penalties. In any
case, the Responsible Person (or his/her parents or legal guardian, when the
Responsible Person is under the age of eighteen) shall have the right to appeal
the issuance of the citation pursuant to the provisions of this Article.
   (b)   Prior to issuing a civil citation for a barking dog or noisy animal,
the Responsible Person shall be given a 10-day period within which to correct
the problem.
   (c)   Each day a barking dog or noisy animal violation exists beyond the
initial 10-day period allowed for correction shall be a separate violation and
may be subject to a separate citation and fine. A barking dog or noisy animal
civil citation may include a violation for one (1) or more days on which a
violation exists, and for violation of one (1) or more Code sections.

The Director may authorize payment to be made in accordance with any other

      (2)   The violator may choose to appear at an administrative hearing on
the assigned administrative hearing date contained in the citation. In that

time within which to pay the fine if, in the Hearing Officer's sole discretion,
such additional time for payment is necessary.
   (b)   Payment of a fine shall not excuse the violator from correcting the

animal citation and/or payment of a fine shall not bar the City from taking any
other enforcement action regarding a barking dog or noisy animal violation that
is not corrected, including issuing additional barking dog or noisy animal
citations and/or criminal complaints.
(§ 3, Ord. 3229, eff. January 19, 2023)

contest the barking dog or noisy animal citation by denying that a violation
occurred, by denying that it was not corrected within the original ten (10) day
correction period, if applicable, or by denying that the violator is a
Responsible Person for the violation.
   (b)   If the citation fine is not paid prior to the assigned date and time
of the administrative hearing noted on the barking dog or noisy animal

is final. The Hearing Officer has no discretion or authority to reduce the
amount of a fine.

Article 1: General Provisions
Sec. 6-3.101. Declaration of policy.
   The City Council of the City of Ontario hereby finds and declares:
   (a)   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to comply with state law on
solid waste management as it is found in California Public Resources § 40000 et
seq.
   (b)   State law requires local agencies such as the City to control and
reduce their waste streams, and to meet per capita waste generation goals each
year. This reduction requires an ongoing evolution of the practices within the
City to include elements that reduce waste generation, promote reuse, and
require collection of recyclables and organic waste.
   (c)   The accumulation, collection, removal, disposal, composting, and
recycling of solid waste shall be controlled by the City for the protection of
the public health, safety and welfare, and to contribute toward the diminution
of health hazards and pollution in the City. The City Council finds that to
give practical effect to this policy, a comprehensive system for the periodic
collection, removal, disposal, composting and/or recycling of integrated waste
from all premises in the City is essential and benefits all residents of the
City; therefore, all such occupants are made responsible for the collection,
disposal, composting, and/or recycling of solid waste.
   (d)   The provisions of this chapter shall control in the event of any
inconsistencies between this chapter and any other City ordinances,
resolutions, or other written arrangements.
   (e)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the right of an individual person,
organization, or other entity to donate, sell or otherwise dispose of
recyclables or organics, provided that any such donation, sale or disposal is
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, including but not limited to
the provisions of §
6-3.808(b).
   (f)   The City Manager shall be responsible for reviewing solid waste
collection services, contracts, permits, fees and rates, and for making
recommendations on the administration of the above to the City Council for
final approval.
(§ 1, Ord. 3187, eff. January 1, 2022, as amended by Ord. 3216, eff. August 18,

including, but not limited to, The Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989,
California Code Title 14, Division 7, and any subsequent amendments to each.
(§ 1, Ord. 3187, eff. January 1, 2022)
Sec 6-3.103. Administration.
   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the City Manager shall
administer, implement, direct and cause enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter. Whenever any power is granted to or a duty is imposed upon the City
Manager, the City Manager or his or her designee shall exercise this power or
perform this duty.
(§ 1, Ord. 3187, eff. January 1, 2022)
Sec 6-3.104. Applicability.
   (a)   This chapter shall apply to all waste generators within the City, and
to waste generators outside the City who are, by permit, contract, or agreement
with the City, users of the City's non-organic waste, recycling and green waste
and other organics collection services, or are conducting business or
activities within the City which fall under the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   The inspection, reporting, and enforcement provisions of this chapter
shall further apply to the donation, sale, or disposal of Non-Waste, as that
term is defined in Section
6-3.106, as though the purchasers, recipients, collectors, transporters,
recyclers, haulers, or other persons in receipt of such Non-Waste were
collectors of solid waste.

2022)
Sec 6-3.105. Exclusive jurisdiction.
   (a)   The collection of all solid waste within the City shall be performed
under the direction of the City Manager, and for such purposes, the City may
use City personnel, enter into contract agreements with private hauling firms
or approve franchise agreements to perform such collection, provided that the
City shall respect all continuation rights required by the Public Resources
Code.
   (b)   Residential, integrated, waste management collection services and
commercial, integrated, waste management collection services shall be provided
exclusively by or under the direction of the City. A solid waste enterprise may

   (a)   Every person owning or occupying any building, lot or premises in the
City shall keep such property in a clean and sanitary condition; this includes
placing all solid waste, with the exception of bulky items, in the appropriate
container. The property owner or occupant shall not cause or permit organic
waste to collect or accumulate for more than one (1) week, or cause or permit
any other solid waste to accumulate for a period in excess of one (1) month;
provided, however, the provisions of this section shall not be construed to
interfere with any occupant keeping building materials upon premises during
construction, reconstruction, or repair of a building or structure thereon
under a valid building permit, nor with the keeping of wood neatly piled upon
such premises for household use.
   (b)   The Administrator may require a greater number of collections per week
or may require placement of additional containers upon finding that an
unhealthful, unsightly, or public nuisance exists under the current service
level. The Administrator may also reduce the number of collections per week or
permit fewer containers upon a finding that the lower collection frequency and/
or fewer containers are sufficient to maintain the premises in a clean and
sanitary condition and will not result in putrescible materials accumulating
for greater than one week. In either event, the customer will be charged for
collections and/or containers at the current fee schedule. Prior to imposing
such service and rate adjustments, the City shall provide at least two (2)
written notifications, at least seven (7) days apart, to the customer as listed
on the City billing. The customer may appeal such a determination in writing to
the City Manager within seven (7) days of the second notice. The City shall not
impose the service adjustments until the seven (7) day appeal period has
passed, or if appealed, until the City Manager determines the outcome of the
appeal.
   (c)   If a member of the Integrated Waste staff observes that a property
owner or occupant will violate this section, Integrated Waste will notify Code
Enforcement. If the Code Enforcement officer determines a violation of this
section, the Code Enforcement officer will tag the container or property with a
notice of violation, requiring the property owner or occupant to bring the
property into compliance. It is expected that the property owner's or
occupant's attempt to comply with the directives of the notice of violation
will require input from the Integrated Waste Department. If the property owner
or occupant does not respond to or comply with the notice of violation, the
City will take the necessary steps to bring the property into compliance,
including, if necessary, cleaning and sanitizing the container and area. The
property owner shall be held responsible for all fees and costs incurred as a
result of the City bringing the property into compliance.

net payment by the generator of purported Non-Waste to the person receiving it
renders that transaction an act of solid waste collection subject to the
provisions of this Code.

Article 6. Administrative Enforcement Remedies
Sec. 6-6.601. Notice of correction (NOC).
   Whenever the City Engineer or his designee finds that any discharger has the
potential to violate or has already violated any prohibition, limitation or
requirement contained in this chapter, any NPDES stormwater permit or the Basin
Plan, the City may serve upon such person a written Notice of Correction
stating the nature of the violation and the necessary actions that must be
implemented to correct the situation. The NOC shall stipulate a time period by
which the problem must be corrected and the penalties for non-compliance.
(§ 2, Ord. 2755, eff. April 4, 2002)
Sec. 6-6.602. Notice of violation.
   When the City Engineer or his or her authorized representative finds that
any discharger has failed to comply with a Notice of Correction or has violated
or continues to violate any prohibition, limitation or requirement contained in
this chapter, any NPDES stormwater permit or the Basin Plan, the City may serve
upon such person a written Notice of Violation stating the nature of the
violation and the penalties for non-compliance. At a minimum, the Notice of
Violation shall require that the discharger submit to the City Engineer, within
a time period specified in the notice, a plan indicating the cause of the
violation and corrective actions which will be taken to prevent recurrence. A
discharger shall be guilty of a separate offense for every day during any
portion of which any violation of any provision of this chapter is committed,
continued, or permitted by the discharger. Pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code §
53069.4 and 36900(b) the following violation assessments will apply to the
issuance of a Notice of Violation by the City Engineer or his or her authorized
representative:
   (a)   A first Notice of Violation shall be issued for a first violation of
this chapter and shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding One Hundred
Dollars ($100.00);

Hundred Dollars ($500.00).
(§ 2, Ord. 2755, eff. April 4, 2002)
Sec. 6-6.603. Administrative orders.
   The City Engineer may require compliance with any prohibition, limitation or
requirement contained in this chapter, any NPDES stormwater permit or the Basin
Plan, by issuing an Administrative Order, enforceable in a court of law or by
directly seeking court action. Administrative orders may include Compliance
Orders, Stop Work Orders, Cease and Desist Orders, Termination of Service
Orders and Immediate Termination of Service Orders.
   (a)   Compliance orders. The City Engineer or his or her designee may issue
a Compliance Order to any discharger who fails to correct a violation of this
chapter, any NPDES stormwater permit or the Basin Plan. The order shall be in
writing, specify the violation(s) and require appropriate compliance measures
within a specified time period. The Compliance Order may include the following
terms and requirements:
      (1)   Specific steps and time schedules for compliance as reasonably
necessary to eliminate an existing prohibited discharge or illegal connection
or to prevent the imminent threat of a prohibited discharge;
      (2)   Specific requirements for containment, cleanup, removal, storage,
installation of overhead covering or proper disposal of any pollutant having
the potential to contact stormwater runoff;
      (3)   Installation of stormwater treatment devices, containment
structures, wash racks and addition and removal of stormwater drains;
      (4)   Any other terms or requirements reasonably calculated to prevent
imminent threat of or continuing violations of this chapter, including, but not
limited to requirements for compliance with best management practices guidance
documents promulgated by any federal, state or regional agency.
   The City Engineer or his or her designee may adopt a proposed compliance
schedule submitted by the user or may adopt a revised compliance schedule if in
his judgement, the proposed compliance schedule would allow the user to cause
harm to the receiving waters and/or the City's storm drainage system.
   A Compliance Order shall require the discharger to pay a One Thousand Dollar
($1,000) penalty fee to the City for the issuance thereof.
   (b)   Stop work order. The City Engineer or Building Official may serve a
written Stop Work Order on any person engaged in doing or causing to be done,
new construction, tenant improvements, alterations or additions, if:
      (1)   No construction permit has been granted by the City;
      (2)   Work has begun prior to the submittal of a written Stormwater
Quality Management Plan (SWQMP) and subsequent approval by the City Engineer or
his or her designee; or,
      (3)   Violations of this article are found at the site of the new
construction, tenant improvements, alterations or additions.
   Any person served a Stop Work Order shall stop such work forthwith until
written authorization to continue is received from the City Engineer or
Building Official. A Stop Work Order shall require the discharger to pay a One
Thousand Dollar ($1,000) penalty fee to the City for the issuance thereof.
   (c)   Cease and desist order. When the City Engineer or his or her designee
finds that any industrial and/or commercial discharger has violated or
threatens to violate any prohibition, limitation or requirement contained in
this chapter, any NPDES stormwater permit or the Basin Plan, or NPDES
Stormwater Permit, the City may issue a Cease and Desist Order directing the
discharger to:
      (1)   Immediately discontinue any illicit connection or prohibited
discharge to the City's stormwater drainage system;
      (2)   Immediately contain or divert any flow of water off the property,
where the flow is occurring in violation of any provision of this chapter;
      (3)   Immediately discontinue any other violation of this chapter.
   A Cease and Desist Order shall require the discharger to pay a One Thousand
Dollar ($1,000) penalty fee to the City for the issuance thereof.
   (d)   Termination of service. When the City Engineer finds any industrial
and/or commercial discharger, who has a direct connection into the City's
stormwater drainage system or has violated an Administrative Order, the City
Engineer may terminate storm drain service to the discharger. The discharger
shall be liable for all costs for termination of storm drain service incurred
by the City. This provision is in addition to any other statues, rules or
regulations authorizing termination of service for delinquency payment or for
any other reasons. Storm drain service shall be re-instituted by the City
Engineer after the discharger has complied with all the provisions of the
Administrative Order. The discharger shall also be liable for all costs for re-
instituting storm drain service.
   (e)   Immediate termination of service. The City Engineer may immediately
suspend storm drain service and any non-stormwater discharge permit when such
suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the City Engineer, to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the
environment, or which significantly or could significantly cause pollution to
the receiving waters, ground and/or storm drainage system of the City. Any
industrial and/or commercial discharger notified that their storm drain service
has been suspended shall immediately cease and eliminate the discharge into the
City stormwater drainage system.
   In the event of failure to comply voluntarily with the Termination of
Service Order, the City Engineer shall take appropriate steps, including
immediate severance of all applicable storm drain connections. All persons
responsible for a discharge that may endanger the health or welfare of the
community or the environment shall be liable for all costs incurred by the City
in terminating storm drain service. Storm drain service shall be re-instituted
by the City Engineer after the actual or threatened discharge has been
eliminated. A detailed written statement, submitted by the industrial and/or
commercial discharger, describing the cause of the harmful contribution and the
measures to prevent any future occurrence, shall be submitted to the City
Engineer within ten (10) working days of the date of storm drain service
termination.

administrative heating, at which time, a discharger who causes or allows, or
who has caused or allowed, an unauthorized discharge to enter into the City's
stormwater drainage system or who continues to allow a violation of this
chapter to exist, may show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not
be taken against him. The City Manager, or the City Manager's designee, shall
preside over the administrative heating, at which time each party, including
the discharger and the City Engineer or his or her designee, shall have the
right to present evidence.
   (b)   A Notice of Hearing shall be served on the discharger specifying the
time and place of the hearing and referencing the specific violation and/or
violations of this chapter, the reasons why the action is to be taken and the
proposed enforcement action, directing the discharger to show cause before the
Hearing Officer why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
Notice of Hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested at least ten (10) working days prior to the
hearing. Service of the Notice of Hearing may be made on any agent or officer
of the discharger.
(§ 2, Ord. 2755, eff. April 4, 2002)
Sec. 6-6.605. Administrative civil penalties.
   (a)   Pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code §§ 54739 and 54740.5, the City Engineer
may issue an administrative complaint to any person who violates this chapter,
any prohibition or limitation thereof or any compliance order, cease and desist
order, stop work order or injunction. The administrative complaint shall allege
the act or failure to act that constitutes the violation, the proposed civil
penalty, and the authority under which it is imposed.
   (b)   The administrative complaint, served on the alleged violator by
personal delivery or by certified mail, shall inform the person served that a
hearing before the City Engineer shall be conducted within sixty (60) days of
the service of the complaint. The right to a hearing may be waived by the
person who has been issued the administrative complaint, in which case the City
shall not conduct a hearing. A person dissatisfied with the decision of the
City Engineer may appeal to the City Council of the City of Ontario within
thirty (30) days of notice of the Engineer's decision.
   (c)   If after the hearing, or appeal, if any, it is found that the person
has violated reporting or discharge requirements, the City Engineer or City
Council may assess a civil penalty against that person. In determining the
amount of the civil penalty, the City Engineer or City Council may take into
consideration all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the economic benefit derived through
any noncompliance, the nature and persistence of the violation, the length of

gallon for discharges in violation of any stop work order, cease and desist
order or other orders, or prohibition issued, reissued, or adopted by the City.
      (4)   The amount of any civil penalties imposed under this section which
have remained delinquent for a period of sixty (60) days shall constitute a
lien against the real property of the discharger from which the discharge
originated resulting in the imposition of the civil penalty. The lien provided
herein shall have no force and effect until recorded with the County Recorder
and when recorded shall have the force and effect and priority of a judgement
lien and continue for ten (10) years from the time of recording unless sooner
released, and shall be renewable in accordance with the provisions of Cal. Code
of Civil Procedure §§ 683.110 to 683.220, inclusive.

penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
   (b)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the discharger's violation,
corrective actions by the discharger, the compliance history of the discharger,
and any factor as justice requires.
   (c)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against a discharger. The City may
institute further legal action to collect such penalties in the event that the

Article 8. Fees and Charges
Sec. 6-6.801. Basic assessment unit (BAU).
   (a)   A BAU represents the proportionate stormwater runoff from the average
single family residential parcel. The average single family residential parcel
has an area of 0.1666 acres (7,200 square feet) and a runoff factor of 0.695.
The level of runoff from this type of property is referred to as one Basic
Assessment Unit and is used to establish user class equivalency. All single
family residential are assessed one BAU. Each residential living unit that has
a separate water service meter shall be classified as a single family unit. All
other living units shall be classified as multiple family units.
   (b)   The following computations shall be used to determine the number of
BAUs for all land uses except single family residential:
   BAU = (Area of Parcel in Acres) x (Land Use Runoff
   Factor)
   (0.1666 Acres x 0.695)
   (c)   All developed parcels are classified according to their stormwater
runoff factor. This is a numeric value for each land use based upon the County
of San Bernardino land use standards and directly relates to the land use of
the particular property. Excluding single family residential, ten (10) land
uses are identified and recognized for varying runoff factors. These factors
are applied in the computation of the number of BAUs associated with any
developed parcel, and are as follows:
Land Use Runoff Factor
Land Use                  Runoff Factor
Single Family Residential N/A
Multi-Family Residential
   Condominiums        0.766
   Apartments          0.766
   Mobile Homes        0.775
Commercial/Services       0.820
   Industrial          0.820
   schools             0.699
Group Quarters            0.766
Other Residential         0.594
Institutional             0.820
Vacant Buildings          0.820
 
(§ 2, Ord. 2755, eff. April 4, 2002)
Sec. 6-6.802. Stormwater pollution abatement charge.
   (a)   The stormwater pollution abatement charge shall be collected on a bi-
monthly basis and based on the rates and formulas as set forth in §
6-6.801. The monthly stormwater pollution abatement charge for each Basic
Assessment Unit associated with a given parcel of developed land within the
City is One Dollar ($1.00).
   (b)   If a discharger disagrees with his or her assigned land use, the
discharger may appeal to the City Engineer by presenting proper certification
of actual land use conditions. The Engineer shall verify the new land use,
apply the new runoff factor and compute a new number of BAUs associated with
said parcel. The new BAUs shall be used as the basis for appropriate billing
and a billing adjustment shall be applied. The changes in the billing records
shall be effective on the first day of the current billing cycle.
(§ 2, Ord. 2755, eff. April 4, 2002)
Sec. 6-6.803. Business inspection fees.
   Business inspection fees shall be collected on an annual basis, along with
the Business License Tax for those businesses requiring regular compliance
inspections under the Areawide Urban Storm Water Run-Off Permit. Affected
businesses shall include industrial businesses subject to the California
Statewide General NPDES Permit for Storm Water Discharges Associated with
Industrial Activities, commercial businesses listed in the Areawide Urban Storm
Water Run-Off Permit and other industrial and commercial sites/sources that the
City determines may contribute a significant pollutant load to the Municipal
Separate Storm Sewer System. The inspection fee shall pay for inspection time
including the preparation of inspection reports, review of written Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plans, storm water runoff sampling activities, enforcement
response and follow-up as needed. The inspection fees shall be adopted by
resolution and shall be subject to periodic review and revision by resolution,
as part of the City's updated and modified schedule of service fees, inspection
fees and processing fees.

(§ 3, Ord. 2755, eff. April 4, 2002)
Sec. 6-7.102. Purpose and objectives. 
   (a)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users that directly
or indirectly connect to the City of Ontario's sewerage system and IEUA's
regional sewage system, and enables the City to comply with all applicable
state and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act of 1977, the General
Pretreatment Regulations set forth at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR),
Part 403, the National Pretreatment Standards set forth at 40 CFR Chapter I,
Subchapter N, Parts 405-499, the California Water Code, and subsequent
amendments to each.
   (b)   It is the intent of this chapter to recognize that the Inland Empire
Utilities Agency with its approved pretreatment program is designated as the
control authority over wastewater discharges within its service area including
the City of Ontario, and holder of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit. As such, the City of Ontario is committed to
administering and enforcing pretreatment regulations and ensuring consistency
in the implementation of the pretreatment requirements under the review of the
Inland Empire Utilities Agency.
   (c)   The primary objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the City of Ontario
sewerage system, which would otherwise interfere with the operation and
maintenance of the collection system or with the wastewater pretreatment
facilities or contaminate the resulting sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the City of
Ontario's sewerage collection and IEUA's regional sewage system which would
otherwise pass-through said system inadequately treated, into receiving waters
or the atmosphere, or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   To protect the health of the public and the City of Ontario and
IEUA operations and maintenance personnel;
      (4)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
biosolids from the sewerage system; and
      (5)   To provide for the equitable distribution of the cost of the
sewerage system, pretreatment programs, and all related services through the
establishment of fair and equitable fees and charges.
   (d)   This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the City of Ontario's sewerage system through the issuance of
individual wastewater discharge permits or discharge authorizations to certain
non-domestic sewer users, in order to regulate the quantity and quality of
wastewater discharges, imposes pretreatment requirements, authorizes monitoring
and enforcement activities; requires user reporting; assumes that existing
customers' capacity will not be preempted, and provides for the setting of fees
by the City of Ontario for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from
the program established herein.

Sec. 6-7.209. Dilution. 
   (a)   Except where authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment
standard or pretreatment requirement, it is unlawful for any user to increase
the use of process water or dilute a discharge as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment
standard or requirement. Whenever dilution is authorized, the Administrator may
impose mass limits on the user.
   (b)   When a wastestream regulated by a categorical standard is combined
prior to treatment with other wastestreams, either regulated or non-regulated,
the Administrator shall apply a combined wastestream formula to calculate an
alternate discharge limit.

Sec. 6-7.210. Bypass. 
   (a)   Bypass is prohibited unless:
      (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage;
      (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable judgement to prevent a bypass which occurred during
normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
      (3)   The user submitted notices as required under subsection (b) of this
section.
   (b)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, the user shall
submit prior notice to the Administrator, at least ten (10) days prior to the
date of the anticipated bypass. After considering its potential adverse
effects, an anticipated bypass may be approved by the Administrator if the
three (3) conditions that are listed in subsection (a) of this section, are
met.
   (c)   In case of an unanticipated bypass that causes or may cause a
violation of an industrial wastewater permit or any applicable pretreatment
standard, the user shall notify the Administrator and IEUA pursuant to §
6-7.509.

Sec. 6-7.211. Prohibited discharge locations. 
   (a)   No user, except City of Ontario personnel involved in maintenance
functions of the sewerage system, shall discharge any wastewater directly into
a manhole or other opening in a sewer other than through an approved building
sewer, unless approved by the Administrator upon written application by the
user and payment of any applicable fees and charges established herein.
   (b)    No user shall circumvent or obviate the intent or purpose of this
chapter by discharging, or causing to be discharged, into any storm drain,
stormwater channel, stormwater drainage system facility, or natural
watercourse, whether currently carrying water or not, or into any pipe, public
street, or waterway leading to such drain, channel, facility, or natural
watercourse, any material, waste, or wastewater, not including unpolluted
water, which is prohibited or restricted as to its discharge into the public
sewer system.
   (c)   No user shall deposit or discharge into any sump which is not
impermeable or into any pit or well, or onto the ground:
      (1)    Acids or caustics, whether neutralized or not;
      (2)   Excessively saline wastes (electrical conductivity greater than
2,000 umhos/cm);
      (3)   Any material, waste, or wastewater, which by seeping underground or
by being leached or by reacting with soil is detrimental to the surface or
ground water; and
      (4)   Violates waste disposal requirements, waste discharge requirements,
as adopted by the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Santa Ana Region, State
Water Resources Control Board, the Department of Environmental Health Services,
the Environmental Protection Agency, or any other Regulatory Agency with
appropriate jurisdiction.
(§ 3, Ord. 2755, eff. April 4, 2002)
Section. 6-7.212. Local discharge limits. 
   (a)   Local limits are established to protect against pass through and
interference. No SIU shall discharge wastewater to the public sewer in excess
of the local limits that are established by the IEUA and/or adopted by the
City. It is unlawful for an SIU to discharge wastewater to the public sewer
that exceeds the local limits and/or Title 40 of the Code of Federal
Regulations (the more stringent regulations apply) or which will result in the
inability of the local POTW to meet its NPDES wastewater discharge permit
requirements and/or its effluent limitations. Modifications of the local limits
may be necessary to meet the requirements for discharge to the POTW or for
basin groundwater recharge.
   (b)   Wastewater discharged to the sewerage system by a categorical
industrial user shall be limited to the stricter of the discharge limit listed
under subsection (a) of this section, and/or Title 40 of the Code of Federal
Regulations for applicable categorical standards.
   (c)   The Administrator may specify a mass limit for any pollutant in the
user's industrial wastewater permit. Any mass limit shall be based on the local
discharge limit or Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, whichever is
stricter, and the user's average daily wastewater discharge. The average daily
wastewater discharge shall be based on the previous twelve (12) months of
operation or other representative data. The Administrator may revise the mass
limit previously established in the user's permit at any time, based on the
user's current or anticipated operating data, and the City's ability to comply
with the regional contract and the requirements of any other regulatory agency.
The excess use of water to establish an artificially high flow rate for mass
emission rate determination is prohibited.
   (d)   In order for the POTW to remain in uninterrupted compliance with
mandated changes in federal, state or local wastewater pretreatment
requirements, the City Council shall adopt any required changes to the City's
wastewater discharge local limits.
   (e)   The Administrator may specify an electrical conductivity limit of one-
thousand two-hundred and eighty (1,280) micro Ohms per centimeter in lieu of
the TDS local limit, if there is reason to believe that there may be
significant interference with the analytical procedure to determine TDS.
(§ 3, Ord. 2755, eff. April 4, 2002, as amended by § 2, Ord. 2913, eff. January

Article 3. Permits
Sec. 6-7.301. Industrial wastewater permit. 
   (a)   To provide for the maximum public benefit for the use of the City
sewerage system, written authorization to use said facilities is required. This
written authorization shall be in the form of a discharge permit. No vested
right shall be given by issuance of permits provided for in this section. The
City reserves the right to establish by Municipal Code or in wastewater
discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to
the City's sewerage facilities if deemed appropriate by the Administrator.
   (b)   The permit for industrial wastewater discharge or discharge
authorization shall require compliance with applicable National Pretreatment
Standards and requirements, state discharge requirements, and local limits and
requirements. It may also require pretreatment of industrial wastewaters before
discharge, restriction of peak flow discharges, discharge of certain
wastewaters only to specified sewers of the City, relocation of the point of
discharge, prohibition of discharge of certain wastewater components,
restriction of discharge to certain hours of the day, payment of additional
charges to defray increased costs of the City created by the wastewater
discharge, and such other conditions as may be required to effectuate the
purpose of this ordinance. It is unlawful to discharge industrial wastewaters
in excess of the quantity or quality limitations set by the permit for
industrial wastewater discharge or discharge authorization. Any person desiring
to discharge wastewaters or use facilities which are not in conformance with
the industrial wastewater discharge permit or discharge authorization shall
apply to the City Administrator for an amended industrial wastewater discharge
permit or discharge authorization.
   (c)   Industrial wastewater discharge permits will be issued in one (1) of
eight (8) forms and is dependent upon the type of discharger, volume, and
discharge characteristics. A user may not require a permit if it does not meet
the definition of an SIU, discharges domestic waste only and/or has been
determined by the Administrator to have little potential to adversely affect
the operation and maintenance of the sewerage system, the POTW, and poses no
threat to system worker or the public welfare. The eight (8) discharge permit
types are:
      (1)   Class I Wastewater Discharge Permit issued to significant
industrial users and categorical users:
         (i)   Any user subject to Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards
under 40 CFR 403.6 and 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N;
         (ii)   Any user having industrial flows equal to or greater than
twenty-five thousand (25,000) gallons per day (excluding sanitary, non- contact
cooling and boiler blow down wastewater);
         (iii)   Any user contributing a process wastestream which makes up
five percent (5%) or more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic
capacity of the POTW regional treatment plant; and
         (iv)   Any user designated as such by the Administrator on the basis
that the industrial user has a reasonable potential for adversely affecting the
operation of the regional treatment plant or for violating any pretreatment
standard or pretreatment requirement; and
      (2)   Class II Wastewater Discharge Permit issued to any user that does
not fit the definition of an SIU, but has the potential to negatively affect
the City sewerage system, the local POTW, or endanger worker welfare, and to
any user discharging wastewater other than domestic waste only, where the
Administrator has determined that a Class II permit is required.
      (3)   Class IIF Wastewater Discharge Permit issued to:
         (i)   Facilities that are engaged in food preparation for consumption
by the public desiring to discharge wastewater into the City sewerage system,
and have been determined to have a reasonable potential to negatively affect
the City of Ontario collection system or POTW;
      (4)    Class IIZ Wastewater Discharge Permits are issued to any
industrial user who is performing operations that are subject to categorical
pretreatment standards, but does not discharge federally regulated wastewater
to sewer, and only discharges unregulated wastewater that would normally be
covered under a Class II type permit into the sewerage system.
      (5)    Class III permits are issued to targeted non-SIU commercial sector
groups to regulate the conventional pollutants only.
      (6)   Class IIIZ Industrial Wastewater Permit issued to any industrial
user who is performing operations that are subject to categorical pretreatment
standards, but does not discharge federally regulated wastewater to sewer, and
only discharges unregulated wastewater that would normally be covered under a
Class III type permit into the sewerage system.
      (7)   Class IZ Industrial Wastewater Permit issued to any user who is
subject to categorical pretreatment standards, and does not discharge
industrial waste, and only discharges domestic waste into the sewerage system.
      (8)   Temporary Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit issued to:
         (i)   Any user discharging wastewater temporarily from industrial
operations;
         (ii)   Any user who has a discharge of unpolluted water whereby no
alternative method of disposal is available.
   (d)   No user of the City sewerage system requiring a permit shall discharge
wastewater without obtaining a wastewater discharge permit. The determination
for requiring a wastewater discharge permit is made by the Administrator or
their designee. Any user that fits the definition of a significant industrial
user, or having otherwise been determined to have a reasonable potential to
adversely affect the operation and maintenance of the sewerage system, the
POTW, or poses a threat to worker welfare, or has been determined in need of
one by the Administrator is required to obtain a permit.
   (e)   All users of the City's sewerage system proposing to discharge
industrial waste directly or indirectly into the sewerage system, where a
potential exists to interfere with the operation and maintenance of the sewer
system or with the pretreatment facilities shall obtain a wastewater discharge
permit from the City Administrator or their designee by filing an application
pursuant to §
6-7.302 and paying the applicable fees pursuant to §
6-7.704. These wastes will include all wastewater discharges which are required
to be regulated by federal laws or regulations, State of California mandates,
or local ordinances.
   (f)   All wastewater discharge permits shall be expressly subject to all
provisions of this chapter and all other regulations, charges for use, and fees
established by the City. Wastewater discharge permit conditions shall be
enforced by the City of Ontario and Inland Empire Utilities Agency in
accordance with this chapter and applicable state and federal regulations.
   (g)   Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the
presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with
40 CFR § 403.15. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the Administrator. Upon request of the
industrial user, the applicable pretreatment standard will be calculated on a
"net" basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake
water) if the requirements of 40 CFR 403.15(b) are met.

Sec. 6-7.306. Non-transferability. 
   Industrial wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a
specific operation at a particular location. Such permits shall not be
reassigned, transferred or sold.
(§ 3, Ord. 2755, eff. April 4, 2002)
Sec. 6-7.307. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
   (a)   Industrial users subject to a categorical pretreatment standard must
comply with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR
Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471.
   (b)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Administrator
may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual significant
industrial users.
   (c)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same pretreatment standard, the
Administrator shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6
(e).
   (d)   The Administrator may convert the mass limits of the categorical
pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration-based
limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual
industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Administrator.
   (e)   Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the
equivalent limitations developed in this §
6-7.307 in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the
equivalent limitations were derived.
   (f)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one (1) limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four (4)-day average, limitations.
Where such pretreatment standards are being applied, the same production or
flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum
equivalent limitation.
   (g)   Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration-based limits calculated from a production-based
pretreatment standard shall notify the Administrator within two (2) business
days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level
will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not
notifying the Administrator of such anticipated change will be required to meet
the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original
estimate of the long term average production rate.

plans prepared and signed by an engineer of suitable discipline licensed in the
State of California.
   (c)   Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures, and compliance schedules shall be submitted to the City for review
and approval before construction of the facility.
   (d)   The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way
relieve the permittee from the responsibility of modifying the facility as
necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the Administrator under the
provisions of this ordinance.
   (e)   Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
operation shall be reported to and be approved by the Administrator.
   (f)   The Administrator or his/her appointed designee shall have the
authority in negotiation with any industrial permittee, to impose compliance
schedules relating to installation of specific pretreatment equipment, filing
of reports, and achievement of specific discharge conditions.
   (g)   No permittee shall increase the use of process water or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with any local, state, or federal discharge
standard.

maintenance log for any pretreatment system. The daily operation and
maintenance log shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:
      (1)   The name of the user responsible for the operation of the
pretreatment system, hours of work, and telephone number;
      (2)   Date, time, and a description of all routine maintenance and
calibration of the system;
      (3)   Date and time of any major repair and down time on the system;
      (4)   The emergency or backup system or program instituted while the
pretreatment system was out of operation; and
      (5)   The estimated daily operational efficiency of the pretreatment
system and any other information which may be required to assure compliance
with pretreatment requirements.
      (6)   A food service establishment shall keep records of grease
pretreatment device cleaning, maintenance and grease removal and shall report
on such maintenance to the Administrator when required. The Administrator may
require the permittee to provide results of periodic measurements of its
discharge which may include chemical analysis for oil and grease content and
other constituents.
   (i)   The Administrator may require any user discharging into the sewerage
system to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a
suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An
individual wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
   (j)   The user shall at all times properly operate and maintain all
facilities and systems of treatment and control (and related appurtenances)
which are installed or used by the user to achieve compliance with the
conditions of the permit. Proper operation and maintenance also includes

   (c)    When more than one user can discharge into a common private sewer,
the Administrator may require installation of a separate monitoring facility
for each user. Also, when in the judgement of the Administrator, there is a
significant difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced
by different operations of a single user, the Administrator may require that a
separate monitoring facility be installed for each segregated wastestream. This
may include, but may not be limited to, segregation of Categorical process
wastestreams from additional wastestreams not subject to categorical standards.
   (d)   City standard drawings establish design requirements, applicable
construction standards, safety devices and specifications for surveillance/
monitoring facilities. The design plans for any required or surveillance/
monitoring facility shall be prepared and signed by an engineer registered in
the State of California. Such plans shall be reviewed and must be approved by
the Administrator prior to any construction of said facility. The approval of
the design of any facility meeting the requirements set forth in this section
or any recommendation or requirements made by the Administrator, shall not
relieve the user from the responsibility of meeting the requirements of this
chapter, and shall not impute any liability to the City for the adequacy of
such facility under the actual conditions of use.
   (e)   If explosive or flammable substances are stored or used on-site, and
such substances have the potential of entering the sewerage system, the user
may be required to install, operate and maintain a combustible gas monitoring
system and facilities to divert the entire wastewater flow to a holding tank
when the combustible gas level is greater than twenty percent (20%) of the
lower explosive limit. These facilities will be provided and maintained at the
user's own cost and expense. A user so notified shall provide detailed gas
monitoring and wastewater diversion plans, including facilities and operating
procedures, to the Administrator for review.
   (f)   If required by the City in writing, the user shall submit construction
plans and/or instrumentation for approval by the City of the following:
      (1)   A pH-recording instrument with a strip chart to record all flows on
a twenty-four (24) hour continuous basis;

twenty-four (24) hour continuous basis;
      (3)   A flume, weir, flow meter or similar device approved by the City
and suitable to measure the non-domestic flow rate and total volume on a
continuous basis. The monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition by the user. All devices used to measure
wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at a frequency determined by
the Administrator to ensure their accuracy. The costs of installing and
maintaining such device(s) shall be at the sole expense of the user.
   (g)   Construction of any monitoring facility or device shall be completed
within a time period established by the Administrator.
   (h)   Unrestricted access to the monitoring facility shall be available to
authorized personnel of the City and IEUA at all times. Unreasonable delays in
allowing City or IEUA personnel access to the user's premises shall be a
violation of this chapter.
   (i)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
monitoring facility or surveillance/monitoring facility shall be promptly
removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the Administrator and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
user.
   (j)   A monitoring facility or surveillance/ monitoring facility may be
required to include a security closure that can be locked by the City during
sampling or upon termination of service.
   (k)   A monitoring facility or surveillance/ monitoring facility shall be
located so that samples can be taken immediately downstream from the
pretreatment facilities, if any exist, or where no treatment is employed,
immediately downstream from the user's wastestream.
   (l)   Any sample taken from the monitoring facility shall be considered
representative of the user's discharge.
   (m)   Users are responsible for cleaning and maintaining the monitoring
facility and equipment. Oils, solids, and other debris removed from the
monitoring facility shall not be discharged to the sewer.

Sec. 6-7.404. Interceptors.
   (a)   A food service establishment discharging grease wastes which, under
the conditions existing in the downstream sewers, could cause or threaten to
cause stoppage or grease accumulations, shall install an approved grease and
oil interceptor and regularly maintain it so as to prevent excessive discharges
of grease and oil into the sewerage system. The costs of installing and
maintaining such device(s) shall be at the sole expense of the user. Any user
who operates, owns or maintains a food service establishment shall cause all
floor drains, floor sinks, sinks, and waste container wash racks to be directed
through the grease and oil interceptor, and shall keep all domestic wastewater
from restrooms, showers, drinking fountains, and condensate (i.e. ice melt, air
conditioning) separate from the food service wastewater until the food service
wastewater has passed through all necessary pretreatment equipment, devices, or
monitoring stations.
   (b)   Each permittee shall be required to provide a collection tank or
container for the purpose of physically segregating oils, greases, and greasy
solids from wash water. Permittees shall establish procedures for personnel to
follow in order to segregate oils, greases, and greasy solids to the collection
container prior to performing any washing and other water cleaning which goes
into the sewers. The permittee shall be responsible for the proper removal and
lawful disposal of the material captured from either the grease pretreatment
devices on wastewater lines or the collection container utilized for the
segregation of oils, greases and greasy solids.
   (c)   Each vehicle wash, vehicle or equipment servicing, industrial
transportation, and/or cleaning facility shall install an appropriate sand,
grease and oil Interceptor of a size and design approved by the Administrator.
Wastewater arising from the cleaning, servicing and repair of vehicles shall
pass through this interceptor before discharge to the sewerage system.
   (d)   If an interceptor is not adequate under the conditions of use, one
which is effective in accomplishing the intended purpose shall be constructed
by the user within a time period established by the Administrator.
   (e)   The design plans for any required interceptor not included in the
Plumbing Code or City standard drawings shall be prepared and signed by an
engineer registered in the State of California and meet the drawing submittal
requirements set forth in §
6-7.401. Such plans shall be reviewed and must be approved by the Administrator
prior to any construction of said device.
   (f)   The interceptor required by this chapter shall be watertight,
structurally sound, durable, properly maintained, and easily accessible for
inspection and cleaning to assure that the accumulation of sand, oil or grease
does not impair the efficiency of the interceptor or pass through the device.
At no time shall any material, debris, obstacle or obstruction be placed in
such a manner as to prevent immediate access to the Interceptor.
   (g)   A user who is required to install and maintain an interceptor shall
keep maintenance records and hauler's manifests for a minimum of three (3)
years. These records shall be made available to the Administrator upon request.
Each vehicle wash and food service facility shall be responsible for the costs
of installing, inspecting, pumping, cleaning and maintaining its grease
interceptor. Cleaning and maintenance must be performed when the total volume
of captured grease and solid material displaces more than twenty percent (20%)
of the total volume of the unit. All vehicle wash and food service facilities
that have grease interceptors shall utilize a licensed grease hauler who has
been permitted for pumping services. Pumping services shall include the initial
complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater and
bottom sludge and solids from the interceptor. It is unlawful for any grease
waste hauler to reinsert, deposit, pump, place, release, or discharge into a
grease trap, grease interceptor, manhole, cleanout, or other sanitary sewer
appurtenance any materials that the hauler has removed from the grease trap or
grease interceptor, or to cause those materials to be so handled. This
prohibition as it pertains to the reinsertion of material removed from a grease
trap or grease interceptor, shall not apply to a grease waste hauler that has
met all of the conditions that are outlined in both the California Penal Code
Section 374.5(a)(2)(b) and the City of Ontario Public Sewer System Ordinance,
Title 6, Chapter 7, §
6-7.404. Grease interceptor cleaning shall include scraping excessive solids
from the walls, floors, baffles and all pipe work. It shall be the
responsibility of each vehicle wash or food service facility to inspect its
grease interceptor during the pumping procedure to ensure that the interceptor
is properly cleaned out and that all fittings and fixtures inside the
interceptor are in working condition and functioning properly.
   (h)   Each vehicle wash or food service facility shall determine the
frequency at which its grease interceptor(s) shall be pumped according to the
following criteria:
      (1)   When the floatable grease layer exceeds six (6) inches in depth as
measured by an approved dipping method;
      (2)   When the settleable solids layer exceeds eight (8) inches in depth
as measured by an approved dipping method;
      (3)   When the total volume of captured grease and solid material
displaces more than twenty percent (20%) of the capacity of the interceptor as
calculated using an approved dipping method; or
      (4)   When the interceptor is not retaining/ capturing oils and greases;
or the removal efficiency of the device, as determined through sampling and
analysis, is less than eighty percent (80%).
   (i)   Periodic inspection of the interceptor may be performed to determine
compliance with this section. The owner and/or user of the property shall be
subject to enforcement actions if such user fails to maintain the interceptor
and/or keep adequate records.
   (j)   Conditional waivers for the grease and oil interceptor or sand, grease
and oil interceptor requirement shall be granted by the Administrator for food
service establishments or vehicle wash, vehicle or equipment servicing,
industrial transportation and/or cleaning facility determined not to have
adverse effects on the City's sewerage system or the POTW. Conditional waivers
may be revoked for the following reasons:
      (1)   Changes in menu;
      (2)   Falsification of information submitted;
      (3)   Change in operating hours;
      (4)   Changes in equipment used;
      (5)   Changes in the number of vehicles washed; or
      (6)   As determined by the Administrator to have adverse effects on the
City's sewerage system or the POTW.

Sec. 6-7.405. Secondary spill containment.
   (a)   Upon written notification by the Administrator, the user shall provide
secondary spill containment for stored chemicals or other substances which are
prohibited or regulated by this chapter and which have the potential of
entering the public sewerage system. The user so notified shall submit to the
Administrator detailed secondary spill containment plans, including the
facility's location, dimensions, and type and volume of material or waste
stored.
   (b)   Drawings shall be submitted in accordance with §
6-7.401.
   (c)   The containment system shall be designed and operated as follows:
      (1)   The base shall be free of cracks or gaps, and shall be sufficiently
impervious to contain leaks, spills, or precipitation until the collected
material is detected and removed;
      (2)   The base shall be sloped or the containment system shall be
otherwise designed and operated to drain and remove liquids resulting from
leaks, spills, or precipitation, unless the containers are elevated or are
otherwise protected from contact with accumulated liquids and precipitation;
      (3)   The containment system shall have sufficient capacity to contain
precipitation from, at least a twenty-four (24) hour, twenty-five (25) year
storm plus ten percent (10%) of the aggregate volume of all containers or the
volume of the largest container, whichever is greater plus a freeboard of at
least three (3) inches. Containers that are not used to store chemicals in a
liquid form need not be considered in this determination;
      (4)   Stormwater runoff from adjacent areas shall be prevented from
flowing into the containment system;
      (5)   Spilled or leaked waste and accumulated precipitation shall be
removed from the sump or collection area in as timely a manner as is necessary
to prevent overflow of the collection system. Unless otherwise approved by the
Administrator, all chemicals or wastes discharged within the collection area
shall be disposed of appropriately and not discharged to the sewerage system or
the ground.
   (d)   The user shall submit to the Administrator a written statement, signed
by a professional civil engineer registered in California, indicating that the
containment system is suitably designed to achieve the requirements of this
section.
   (e)   Construction shall be completed within a time period established in a
compliance schedule.
(§ 3, Ord. 2755, eff. April 4, 2002)
Article 5. Monitoring, Reporting, Notification and Inspection Requirements
Sec. 6-7.501. Monitoring. 
   (a)   Periodic measurements of flow rates, flow volumes, and wastewater
characteristics for compliance with any limitations or requirements specified
in the industrial wastewater permit or this chapter shall be performed using
appropriate procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 136 and 403.12(e), 403.12 (g),
403.12(h) and 122.45(c). Analyses of the constituents and characteristics shall
be by a state-certified laboratory, and at the sole expense of the permittee.
   (b)   A user with large fluctuations in quantity or quality of wastewater
may be required to provide continuous monitoring for some of the wastewater
characteristics.
   (c)   Routine monitoring and sampling shall be conducted at the City-
approved monitoring facility, and during a period of normal business operations
and wastewater flows of the user.
   (d)   Grab and/or composite samples of the industrial wastewater shall be
properly obtained, preserved, and analyzed for the specified wastewater
constituents by a state-certified laboratory.
   (e)   All sampling and analysis for the purposes of providing pollutant
discharge information to the Administrator in self-monitoring and other reports
shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in the Code of
Federal Regulations at 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto.
   (f)   When 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA Administrator
determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW
or other parties, approved by the EPA Administrator.
   (g)   When requested by the Administrator or the user, a split sample will
be provided to the other party to verify the levels of constituents in the
wastewater.
   (h)   It shall be unlawful, and the user shall be held financially
responsible for any damage to, breakage of, or tampering with, any laboratory
or City monitoring equipment while it is in use either in, on, or next to the
monitoring facility of the user.
   (i)   The City or IEUA may inspect and sample the wastewater generating and
disposal facilities of any user to ascertain whether the intent of this chapter
is being met and the user is complying with all requirements. Where a user has
security measures in force, the user shall make necessary arrangements so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the City, IEUA or
laboratory will be permitted to enter without delay for the purpose of
performing their specific responsibilities.
   (j)   The City or IEUA shall have the right to set up on the user's property
or other locations as determined by the City, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling or metering operations.
   (k)   Results from all samples taken from the designated monitoring point
shall be reported to the City.
   (l)   If sampling by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the
City within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user
shall repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the City within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the
violation. Resampling by the user is not required if the City or IEUA performs
sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the City or IEUA
performs sampling at the user's facility between the time when the initial
sampling was conducted and the time when the user receives the results of this
sampling, or if the City or IEUA has performed the sampling and analysis in
lieu of the user.
   (m)    If a user monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the
City, the results of the monitoring shall be included in the periodic reports
on continued compliance.
   (n)   All laboratory reports shall be accompanied by the corresponding
chain-of-custody log. The chain-of-custody shall contain the following
information: sample source; date, time and method of sampling and sample
preservation; type of container used, sampler identification, results of any
field measurement or observation, and any other information related to sample
handling.
   (o)   The reports required in §
6-7.502 below must be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data are
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The
Administrator shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess
and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment
standards and pretreatment requirements. Grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic
compounds. For all other pollutants, twenty-four (24) hour composite samples
must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques,
unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by
the Administrator. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling
is authorized by the Administrator, the samples must be representative of the
discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented
in the industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols
(including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four
(24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for
cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the
laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil & grease the samples
may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters
unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA
methodologies may be authorized by the Administrator, as appropriate.
   (p)   The City or IEUA may randomly sample and analyze the effluent from
industrial users and conduct surveillance activities in order to identify,
independent of information supplied by industrial users, occasional and
continuing noncompliance with pretreatment standards. The City or IEUA must
inspect and sample the effluent from each significant industrial user at least
once a year.
   (q)   The City or IEUA shall investigate instances of noncompliance with
pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements, as indicated in the
reports and notices required under § 403.12, or indicated by analysis,
inspection, and surveillance activities described in §
6-7.501(p). Sample taking and analysis and the collection of other information
shall be performed with sufficient care to produce evidence admissible in
enforcement proceedings or in judicial actions.
   (r)   The City shall perform a special investigation for user's with
repeated violations of their discharge limit to identify and access the
noncompliance problems and the required corrective actions. This inspection
includes a comprehensive onsite evaluation of the adequacy of the pretreatment
system, and the user's waste management practices, manufacturing processes, and
waste generating sources.
   (s)   The City shall perform a comprehensive inspection prior to the
issuance of an initial permit or the renewal of a user wastewater discharge
permit. It provides a detailed compliance check as well as information needed
to issue an initial permit or to re-evaluate an expiring permit. These
inspections include evaluation of the manufacturing process and pretreatment
equipment, review of hazardous waste manifests and other disposal documents,
compliance evaluation, measurement of industrial wastewater flows, field
testing of wastewater, and a review of applicable regulations.

December 1, 2005, and § 2, Ord. 3190, eff. October 7, 2021)
Sec. 6-7.502. Plans and reporting.
   The City may require reports for self-monitoring of wastewater constituents
and characteristics of the discharger needed for determining compliance with
any limitation, or requirements as specified in the user's permit, federal
regulations, or this chapter. These reports include:
   (a)   Solvent management plans as described in §
6-7.503;
   (b)   Baseline monitoring reports (BMRs) as described in §
6-7.504;
   (c)   Ninety (90) day compliance reports as described in §
6-7.505;
   (d)   Compliance schedules; for the purpose of meeting federal, state, and
local requirements the following conditions shall apply to the schedule
required by 40 CFR 403.12(b)(7):
      (1)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
industrial user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards
(e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final
plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction,
completing construction, etc.);
      (2)   No increment referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall
exceed nine (9) months; and
      (3)   Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a
progress report to the Administrator including, at a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the
date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason
for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the
construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine (9)
months elapse between such progress reports to the Administrator.
   (e)   Progress reports;
      (1)   Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard
deadline. Within ninty (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements
shall submit to the Administrator a report containing the information described
in paragraphs 40 CFR 403(b)(4)-(6). For industrial users subject to equivalent
mass or concentration limits established by the Administrator in accordance
with the procedures in § 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable
measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation),
this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate
sampling period.
   (f)   Slug discharge control plans as described in §
6-7.506;
   (g)   Periodic reports on continued compliance;
      (1)   All SIUs must, at a frequency determined by the Administrator
submit no less than twice per year (July and January) reports indicating the
nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily
flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard
requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution
prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the
Administrator or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the
compliance status of the user;
      (2)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (3)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Administrator, using the procedures prescribed
in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, otherwise approved by EPA, or as
specified in this permit, the results of such monitoring shall be included in
any calculations of actual daily maximum or annual average daily pollutant
discharge concentrations, and annual average daily discharge volume, and the
results shall be reported in the monitoring report submitted to the City. Such
increased monitoring frequency shall also be indicated in the user's self-
monitoring report(s).
      (4)   In addition to the foregoing, the industrial user shall provide all
applicable reports described in the Code of Federal Regulations at 40 CFR
403.12, including, but not limited to: compliance schedules for meeting
categorical pretreatment standards, compliance schedule progress reports,
reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, and
final compliance reports.
      (5)   All industrial users shall notify the Administrator thirty (30)
days in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of
pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous
wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under
40 CFR 403.12(p).
         (i)   The Administrator may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application per §
6-7.302.
         (ii)   The Administrator may issue an individual wastewater discharge
permit under §
6-7.301 of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under
§
6-7.305 of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.
      (6)   All periodic reports must be signed and certified in accordance
with §
6-7.510 of this chapter.
   (h)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste;
      (1)   The industrial user shall notify the Administrator, the IEUA, the
EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste
authorities in writing of any discharge into the sewerage system and POTW of a
substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must satisfy the requirements set forth at 40
CFR 403.12(p).
   (i)   Bypass notification;
      (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the City Administrator and General Manager of IEUA, at
least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the City Administrator and
General Manager of IEUA of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable
pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes
aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five
(5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written
submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass.
The City Administrator and General Manager of IEUA may waive the written report
on a case-by-case basis of the oral report has been received within twenty-four
(24) hours.
      (3)   Notification provided shall not relieve the user of liability for
any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result

manner, and frequency determined at the discretion of the City.
      (2)   Non-compliance with mass emission rate limits, concentration
limits, permit discharge conditions, or any discharge provision of this chapter
may be determined by an analysis of a grab or composite sample of the effluent
of a user. Non- compliance with mass emission rate limits shall be determined
by an analysis of a composite sample of the user's effluent. A grab sample may
be used to determine compliance with mass emission rate limits when the
discharge is from a closed (batch) treatment system in which there is: no
wastewater flow into the system when the discharge is occurring, the volume of
wastewater contained in the batch system is known, the time interval of
discharge is known, and the grab sample is homogeneous and representative of
the discharge.
      (3)   Any sample taken from a sample point is considered to be
representative of the discharge to the sewerage system.
   (b)   Permit, agreements, and administrative orders provisions.
      (1)   Non-compliance with a permit condition, Compliance Agreement, or
Cease and Desist Order compliance deadline shall be determined by whether the
user or permittee has submitted the required information, or completed the
required action (such as installing and operating a pretreatment system that is
discharging effluent and meeting the permitted discharge limits) by the date
and/or time specified.
      (2)   The user or permittee may request in writing by certified mail, an
extension to a deadline to meet a compliance deadline. At a minimum, the
request shall specify the reasons for not meeting the deadline, what actions
are now being taken to accomplish the requirement, and the new date by which
the user will complete the requirement.
      (3)   It the discretion of the Administrator, the request may be granted
and the user notified in writing of the new compliance deadline. If the
Administrator does not provide notification by the original compliance date in
the permit, Compliance Agreement, or Cease and Desist Order, then the original
date shall stand as the compliance date.
   (c)   Fees, surcharges, or penalties. A user shall be in non-compliance with
the chapter and their permit, if connection fees, sewer surcharge fees,
penalties, non-compliance fees, administrative fees, bond guaranty or other
monies owed to the City for sewer services are not paid within the time
specified on the bill or in the permit, Compliance Agreement, or other
enforcement agreement.

grounds exist for permit revocation, he or she shall give written notice
thereof by personal delivery or by certified mail to the user setting forth a
statement of the facts and grounds deemed to exist, together with the time and
place where the charges shall be heard by the Administrator. The hearing date
shall not be less than fifteen (15) calendar days or more than forty-five (45)
calendar days after mailing of such notice.
      (1)   At the revocation hearing, the user shall have an opportunity to

      (1)   Upon an order of revocation by the Administrator becoming final,
the user shall have no right to discharge any non-domestic wastewater or
sanitary wastes (whichever applies) directly or indirectly to the City sewerage
system for the duration of the revocation. All costs for physically terminating
and reinstating service shall be paid by the user.
      (2)   Any owner or responsible management employee of the user shall be
bound by the order of revocation. An order of permit revocation issued by the
Administrator shall be deemed final in all respects upon delivery to the
applicant or user unless a request for hearing is filed with the City Council
pursuant to §
1-4.01 of Chapter 4 of Title 1 of the Ontario Municipal Code.
      (3)   Any future application for a permit at any location within the City
by any user subject to an order of revocation will be considered by the

   The Administrator shall have full power and authority to take any necessary
precautions including, but not limited to; decontamination, sewer closure,
packaging, diking, and transportation of materials, in order to protect life,
protect property, or prevent further damage resulting from a condition that is
likely to result in a discharge which presents an imminent hazard to the
public's health, safety or welfare; or which either individually or by
interaction with other discharges, is an imminent hazard to the City's sewerage
facilities; or which places the regional treatment plant in violation of its
NPDES permit. In the pursuit of such an operation, City personnel, any party
contracting with the City, or duly authorized representative of another
government agency shall have immediate access to the premises. The
Administrator may prohibit approach to the scene of such emergency by any user,
vehicle, vessel or thing, and all users not actually employed in the
extinguishing of the condition or the preservation of lives and property in the
vicinity thereof.
   The Administrator or an authorized designee may immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears
to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of the community, the operation of the POTW, causes or contributes to a
violation of IEUA's NPDES permit, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment. Failure to comply with the emergency
suspension order may lead to termination of service.

depositing financial security in an amount equal to said user's average total
fees and charges for the two (2) prior calendar quarters. Said deposit shall be
used to guarantee payment of all fees and charges incurred for future services
and facilities furnished by City and shall not be used by the City to recover
outstanding fees and charges incurred prior to the user filing and receiving

or interference, and the user was in compliance with each such local limit
directly prior to and during the pass through or interference; or
      (2)   If a local limit designed to prevent pass through and/or
interference, as the case may be, has not been developed in accordance with §
6-7.201(c) for the pollutant(s) that caused the pass through or interference,
the user's discharge directly prior to and during the pass through or
interference did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the
user's prior discharge activity when the POTW was regularly in compliance with
the POTW's NPDES permit requirements and, in the case of interference,
applicable requirements for sewage sludge use or disposal.

Article 7. Schedule of Fees and Changes
Sec. 6-7.701. Revenues.
   (a)   Every person whose premises in the City are served by a connection to
the public sewer system whereby the sewage and/or industrial wastes are
disposed of by the City through the regional sewage system, or otherwise, shall
pay a sewer operation charge and any surcharge as established by §
6-7.703 of this chapter.
   (b)   The charges provided for in §
6-7.703 shall be applicable only on premises to which a public sewer system
main is connected.
   (c)   The charges provided for in §
6-7.703 for any promise or property shall be collected with the charges and
rates for water services furnished by the City to such premises. Such charges
shall be billed upon the same bill as prepared for charges for water services
and shall be due and payable monthly at the same time such charges for water
services are due and payable. The total amount due for the charges herein fixed
and for charges for water shall be paid as a unit.
   (d)   The City Council may, from time to time in its discretion by ordinance
or resolution, alter, change, amend, or revise the charges and rates for
services and facilities in connection with the public sewer and stormwater
drainage systems.
   (e)   It shall be the duty of the Revenue Department of the City to collect
all charges provided for in this chapter.
   (f)   The City Council shall have the right to require any person liable to
pay any stormwater pollution abatement charges, sewer operation charges and
applicable surcharges to make a reasonable deposit to insure the collection of
such charge.
   (g)   If any person fails to pay any applicable charges when the same become
due, the City may, in addition to any other remedies it has, cut off any of the
services and facilities provided for in this chapter and shall not resume the
same until all delinquent charges, together with any charges necessitated by
the resumption of such services and facilities, have been fully paid.
   (h)   All funds and monies received from the collection of sewer operation
charges and applicable surcharges as herein established, shall be deposited and
maintain in a separate fund and account to be known as the Sewer Operation
Fund. The moneys deposited in such fund shall be used as permitted by Cal.
Health & Safety Code § 5471.
   (i)   Adequate funds shall be transferred from Sewer Service Revenues to the
Sewer Revolving Fund for sewer capital facilities repairs and replacement. The
amount of this transfer shall be reviewed and adjusted in conjunction with rate
studies to meet the needs of the sewer capital improvement program.
   (j)   If a developed parcel does not have a utility account with the City on
the effective date of this section, a new account shall be established for that
parcel and billed to the owner of said parcel as shown on the latest County
Assessor's property tax rolls as an existing utility account. When an
undeveloped parcel is developed, a new account shall be established and billed
to the owner of that parcel as shown on the latest County Assessor's property
tax rolls. The developed property owner shall maintain responsibility for
payment until such time as other City utility services are provided to said
parcel and a primary utility account is established for payment responsibility
with the occupier of said property.
(§ 3, Ord. 2755, eff. April 4, 2002)
Sec. 6-7.702. Equivalent dwelling units (EDU).
   (a)   Residential customers: The wastewater flow from a single family
residential unit is defined as one (1) EDU. On the average, this flow is two
hundred seventy (270) gallons per day, and the levels of biological oxygen
demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS) are equal to two hundred thirty (230)
mg/l and two hundred twenty (220) mg/l, respectively. The average flow from a
multiple family residential or mobile home unit is one hundred eighty-nine
(189) gallons per day with the same levels of BOD and SS. By definition, this
is equal to seven-tenths (.7) of one (1) EDU.
   (b)    Schools. The number of EDUs for a school is determined annually based
on the school's October Average Daily Attendance (ADA). One (1) EDU is
equivalent to fifty-four (54) Kindergarten through high school students, or
twenty-seven (27) college students.
   (c)   Commercial customers. Commercial customers are grouped in different
sewer categories as shown below. Each category is assigned a wastewater factor
(WF) based on the percentage of water consumption returned to the sewer, and
the wastewater levels of BOD and SS according to the following formula:
   WF = Flow %
   ((0.37 + (0.31 BOD/230) + (0.32 SS/220)) / 10.98
The number of EDUs is calculated using the monthly water consumption in hundred
cubic feet (HCF) as follows:
EDUs — HCF x WF COMMERCIAL
CATEGORIES AND WASTEWATER FACTORS FOR DETERMINING MONTHLY SEWER CHARGES
Category Type of Commercial BOD/SS Flow % Wastewater Factor
EDUs — HCF x WF COMMERCIAL

   (d)   Industrial customers. Industrial customers shall consist of any
industrial user identified in the NAICS/SIC Code US Manual, 1997, as amended
and supplemented, under the category Division D - Manufacturing, and any other
user of significant waste products as determined by the City. The number of
EDUs of industrial customers shall be the sum of domestic and non-domestic
wastewater EDUs as follows:
      (1)   The number of domestic wastewater EDUs is calculated using a
wastewater factor equal to 0.0729 (category 1 - commercial customers) as
described in subsection (c) of this section.
      (2)   The number of non-domestic wastewater EDUs is calculated based on
the average daily flow (gallons per day) and strength (BOD & SS in mg/l) of the
non-domestic wastewater flow according to the following formula:
   EDUs-Non-Domestic Flow
   ((0.37 + (0.31 BOD/230) + (0.32 SS/220)) / 270
   (e)   If required by the City, any non-residential user may be required to
submit on a yearly basis (on or before the first of July of every year), a
twenty- four (24) hour composite wastewater sample analysis performed by a
certified laboratory. Said analysis shall be for BOD, SS and/or any other
parameters, as may be required by the City. The customer shall pay all
monitoring costs. The results of the analysis may be used to adjust the
customer's wastewater factor and billing records. The frequency of wastewater
analysis samples submitted may vary depending on the type of industrial
discharge as determined by the City.
   (f)   In the event a customer believes the parameters used to establish the
customer's wastewater factor is no longer applicable, said customer may submit
the results of laboratory analyses and any other documents for review by the
City. An adjustment in the wastewater factor and billing records may be made if
deemed appropriate and consistent with the intent of this section. Any
adjustment shall not be retroactive and shall be effective on the first day of
the current billing cycle.
   (g)   If a wastewater pretreatment device and/or in-plant modification is
instituted which involves a change in the quality and/or quantity of wastewater
being discharged, the customer shall immediately notify the City. The user
shall be required to submit flow 71 measurements and laboratory analysis for
BOD, SS and any other parameters as described in subsection (e) of this
section.
   (h)   The specific wastewater rate calculation criteria, including the
assignment of sewer factors to specific customers, shall be determined by the
City for all customers not specifically mentioned under the classifications set
forth in this section, in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (i)   If a commercial or industrial customer's water meter is used for both
domestic and landscape irrigation, forty-five percent (45%) of the metered
water consumption shall be assigned to landscape irrigation. If the user can
show that landscape irrigation constitutes more than forty-five percent (45%)
of the total, the City shall adjust this value provided that installation of a
separate irrigation meter is not feasible. The adjustment shall be made after
review, verification and approval of a water-use audit report prepared and
submitted by the customer. Water meters that are used for landscape irrigation
only, and other water meters that do not contribute to sewer flow shall not be
included in the EDU calculations, and shall be exempt from sewer charges.

Sec. 6-7.703. Sewer revenue charge rates.
   In addition to other fees, assessments, or charges provided by the Municipal
Code or adopted by the City Council, the owner or occupant of any parcel of
property for which no other sewer service charge is provided, and which parcel
of property is connected to the sewer system of the City, shall pay monthly
sewer service charges as established from time to time by resolution of the
City Council.

Sec. 6-7.705. Industrial wastewater non-compliance fees.
   Any user who has violated or continues to violate this chapter, an
industrial wastewater permit, an order issued hereunder, or any prohibition,
limitation, or requirement contained herein, shall pay non- compliance fees to
the City as established in §
6-7.603 of this chapter, to recover all costs incurred by the City in
performing inspections, sampling and analysis of the user's wastewater, and
administrative costs associated with processing notices of violation, and
conducting enforcement actions.
(§ 3, Ord. 2755, eff. April 4, 2002)
Sec. 6-7.706. Capital Capacity Reimbursement Account (CCRA) fee.
   (a)   The City is required to deposit regional sewer capacity fees in a
separate capital facilities fund with other charges received, and account for
the charges in a manner to avoid any commingling with other moneys of the City,
except for investments, and shall expend those charges solely for the purposes
for which the charges were collected. Any interest income earned from the
investment of moneys in the capital facilities fund shall be deposited in that
fund.
   (b)   The City is a party to the regional sewerage service contract, the
obligations of which include financing the capital expansion of the regional
sewerage facilities serving the City. These regional sewerage facilities are
operated by the Inland Empire Utilities Agency (IEUA).
   (c)   IEUA has prepared a Ten (10) Year Capital Improvement Program which
includes a study of the impact of anticipated development within the
jurisdiction of each of the contracting agencies, including the City, upon the
need for and cost of sufficient wastewater interceptor and treatment capacity.
   (d)   Purpose and findings.
      (1)   In order to implement the goals and objectives of the City of
Ontario's General Plan and the regional sewerage service contract, a Ten (10)
Year Capital Improvement Program is prepared annually by IEUA for those
expansions of the regional sewerage facilities to be needed by the contracting
agencies to mitigate sewage impacts caused by new development in the City of
Ontario and within the spheres of each of the contracting agencies.
      (2)   The Ten (10) Year Capital Improvement Program, which is hereby
incorporated by reference, establishes that certain sewerage pretreatment
facilities must be or had to be constructed to provide adequate treatment
capacity to service anticipated new development within the jurisdiction of each
of the contracting agencies. The cities and agencies contracting for sewage
treatment with the IEUA are Cucamonga Valley Water District, and the cities of
Ontario, Chino, Chino Hills, Fontana, Montclair and Upland.
      (3)   The contracting agencies and IEUA have determined that a regional
sewer capacity fee is needed in order to completely finance these public
improvements and to pay for public facilities in existence at the time regional
sewer capacity fees are imposed or for new public facilities to be acquired or
constructed in the future that are of proportional benefit to the person or
property being charged, including, real property interests, and entitlements
and other rights of the local agency involving capital expense relating to its
use existing or new public facilities.
      (4)   IEUA's Ten (10) Year Capital Improvement Program identifies the
need for new regional wastewater interceptor facilities, pretreatment
facilities, and disposal facilities and sets forth the relationship between new
development, needed facilities and estimated costs of the facilities. This
report is annually updated by IEUA. The report utilizes the contracting
agencies' forecasted growth and an analysis of IEUA's financial projection of
being able to provide capacity. Those projections have been examined and have
been found to be reasonable estimates of the projected growth within the City
and the regional service area of the IEUA.
      (5)   The regional sewer capacity fees collected pursuant to this section
shall be used to finance only the regional wastewater interceptor facilities,
pretreatment facilities and disposal facilities identified in the IEUA Ten (10)
Year Capital Improvement Program in accordance with the terms of the regional
contract.
      (6)   New development within the City of Ontario will generate additional
need for sewage treatment capacity within the regional service area and will
contribute to the degradation of pretreatment facility capacity within the
regional service area of the IEUA.
      (7)   The amount of the regional sewer capacity fees does not exceed the
estimated reasonable cost of providing the service for which the fees are
imposed.
      (8)   There is a need in the City for sewage treatment capacity which has
not been constructed or has been constructed in anticipation of new development
which has not contributed its fair share towards these facility costs and said
facilities have been called for in or are consistent with the City's General
Plan.
         (i)   There is a reasonable relationship between the need for the
wastewater interceptor facility, pretreatment facility, and disposal facilities
and the types of development considered in the forecasts submitted by the
contracting agencies, including the City of Ontario, for which a CCRA fee is
hereby imposed;
         (ii)   There is a reasonable relationship between the use of such fee
and each type of development project upon which the fee is imposed;
         (iii)   There is a reasonable relationship between the IEUA amount of
the fee and the cost of the facilities to be built to service new development
projects for which the fee is imposed; and
         (iv)   The procedures used to determine these relationships are
described in more detail in the "Agreement Amending and Supplementing Chino
Basin Regional Sewage Service Contract" and the Ten (10) Year Capital
Improvement Program.
      (9)   There is a need in this City for sewage treatment capacity which
has not now been constructed or has been constructed in anticipation of new
development which has not contributed its fair share towards these facility
costs and said facilities have been called for in or are consistent with the
City's General Plan.
      (10)   The cost estimates set forth in IEUA's Ten (10) Year Capital
Improvement Program are reasonable cost estimates for constructing wastewater
interceptor facility, pretreatment facility, and disposal facilities
necessitated by projected new development, and the development fees collected
by the City from any affected development project will not exceed the total of
these costs attributable to the increased capacity necessary to serve that
project.
   (e)   Every developer constructing any new residential, commercial, or
industrial structure which will be connected to the City's public sewer shall
pay to the City a regional sewer capacity fee calculated by multiplying the
number of EDUs by the current IEUA rate per EDU. The regional sewer capacity
fee will automatically be adjusted each year on July 1 to the amount adopted by
the IEUA Board of Directors.
   (f)   For the purposes of computing uniform financial obligations for each
contracting agency in the regional sewerage system, the following computation
shall be used to determine EDUs for residential, commercial and industrial
units:
      (1)   Residential is a structure or part of a structure which is designed
for the purpose of providing permanent housing for one (1) family or tenant
shall be one (1) EDU. This includes, but is not limited to, a single family
detached residence, an apartment, a townhouse, a condominium, or mobile home
space within a mobile home park.
      (2)   Commercial is a structure which is designed for the purpose of
providing permanent housing for enterprises engaged in the exchange of goods
and services. This shall include, but is not limited to, all private business
and service establishments, schools, churches, and public facilities. EDUs
shall be determined by multiplying the fixture units, as defined in the Uniform
Plumbing Code, shown on the approved building plans by the appropriate sewage
factor. Total EDUs for commercial centers with various use categories will be
the sum of the EDUs computed for each category use as follows:
COMMERCIAL USE CATEGORIES LISTING
No. Type of Commercial Gallons Per Fixture BOD/TSS Sewage Factor
No. Type of Commercial            Gallons Per Fixture BOD/TSS Sewage Factor

      (3)   Industrial is a structure which is designed for the purpose of
providing permanent housing for enterprises engaged in the production,
manufacturing, or processing of material. EDUs for industrial users shall be
determined as follows:
         (i)   For domestic type wastewater, multiply the fixture units, as
defined by the Uniform Plumbing Code, as shown on the approved building plans
by a sewer factor of 0.0741 based on a twenty (20) gallons per fixture unit
flow per day.
         (ii)   For industrial wastewater, compute the number of EDUs from
information contained on the industrial waste permit, as set forth in §
6-7.702 of this chapter.
         (iii)   Combine the resultant EDUs derived from (i) and (ii) above.
      (4)   The sewage factor formula used for commercial and industrial
categories is as follows:
Sewage factor = Gallons per fixture
((0.37 + (0.31 BOD/230) + (0.32 SS/220)) / 270
   (g)   Exempt from the regional sewer capacity fee shall be the following:
      (1)   Any residential, commercial or industrial structure which is or
will be connected exclusively to another agency's sewer system or to a private
sewage disposal system; and
      (2)   That portion of a newly constructed commercial and/or industrial
development's waste which is discharged into the non-reclaimable waste system.
   (h)   For residential structures with a building permit issued prior to July
1, 1979, no regional sewer capacity fees will be levied at the time of
connection to the regional system. If the original permit was issued after July
1, 1979, then the regional sewer capacity fees established at the time of
permit issuance will apply.
   (i)   The regional sewer capacity fees will apply to all commercial and
industrial development regardless of when the structure was constructed. When a
non-residential user requests to connect to the regional system or to modify
its use, if already connected, the regional sewer capacity fee shall be based
on the current fee in effect at the time the connection or modified use is
made.
   (j)   Additional regional sewer capacity fees shall be levied on existing
commercial and industrial users who expand or revise their use. The additional
regional sewer capacity fee shall be based on the additional number of EDUs
according to the following criteria:
      (1)   Regional sewer capacity fees will only be levied on the fixture
unit (FU) count difference between existing FUs and new FUs.
      (2)   The regional sewer capacity fee will be determined based on the fee
in effect at the time of building or sewer permit issuance for the revised or
expanding development.
      (3)   A change in use, placing a commercial development in a different

obligation for the existing FUs. Only the regional sewer capacity fees for the
new added FUs will be levied based on the commercial category which best
defines the proposed use.
   (k)   All sewer use rights and capacity shall remain with the existing
building and shall be sold to building owners rather than tenants. In cases
where an existing building is completely demolished, the transfer of capacity
rights can be permitted provided that:
      (1)   Proof of building demolition can be documented;
      (2)   Payment for original system capacity can be documented;
      (3)   The demolition occurs simultaneously with the transfer; and
      (4)   The transfer occurs within the contracting agency who originally
sold the capacity.

Ontario."
(§ 2, Ord. 2907, eff. June 16, 2009, as amended by § 2, Ord. 3027, eff. October
1, 2015 and § 2, Ord. 3196, eff. December 7, 2021)
Sec. 6-8.21. Statement of policy and declaration of purpose.
   (a)   Because of the water supply conditions prevailing in the City and/or
the area from which the City obtains a portion of its supply, the general
welfare requires that the water resources available to the City of Ontario be
put to the maximum beneficial use to the extent to which they are capable, and
that the waste or unreasonable use, or unreasonable method of use of water be
prevented and that the conservation of such water be practiced with a view to
that reasonable and beneficial use thereof in the interest of the people of the
City.
   (b)   The purpose of this chapter is to minimize the potential for a water
shortage through the practice of water conservation, and to minimize the effect
of a shortage of water supplies on the water customers of the City. It is
furthermore the intent of this chapter to adopt provisions that will
significantly reduce the inefficient consumption of water, thereby extending
the available water resources necessary for domestic, sanitation, and fire
protection of the community to the greatest extent possible.
   (c)   This chapter shall be applicable to all persons within the City. For
the purposes of this chapter, "person" means any natural person, property
owner, renter, or lessee, as well as any corporation, partnership, government
entity or subdivision, trust, estate, cooperative association, homeowners'
association, joint venture, business entity, or other similar entity, or the
property management company, property manager, agent, employee or
representative of any of the above.

Sec. 6-8.22. Authorization.
   (a)   The City Council may declare a water shortage based on a determination
by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the Inland Empire
Utilities Agency, the declaration of an executive order of the Governor, or the
adoption of voluntary or mandatory water use restrictions by any state agency
governing the use of water, or based upon any interruption in water supply or
delivery that the City Council determines in its sole discretion necessitates
water conservation pursuant to this chapter.
   (b)   In the event of an immediate emergency that causes an unplanned
interruption of water supply, the City Manager or his/her designee is
authorized to restrict water use and apportion the available supply of water
among its customers in the most equitable manner possible to continue service
fairly and without discrimination, except that preference shall be given to
such service as is essential to the public interest and to the preservation of
life and health.
   (c)   A water shortage, including a water shortage emergency but excluding
an immediate emergency, shall be declared by the adoption of a resolution of
the City Council.
      (1)   A notice of a water shortage, other than a water shortage
emergency, shall be published in a daily newspaper of general circulation
within the City. Any restrictions on the use of water during a declared water
shortage shall become effective immediately upon such publication.
      (2)   Notice of hearing to declare a water shortage emergency, other than
an immediate emergency, shall be made in accordance with Water Code Section
351. Any restrictions on the use of water during a declared water shortage
shall become effective immediately upon adoption unless otherwise be determined
by the City Council.

record. Any utility bill remaining unpaid eighteen (18) business days after
such bill date shall be deemed past due and a late charge and penalties will be
applied as set forth in §§
1-2.06 and
1-2.07 of the Ontario Municipal Code. Should a residential account remain
unpaid for a period of sixty (60) calendar days from the past due date, water
service to the property may be disconnected for nonpayment after the City

of residential water service, described in paragraph (c) below. Should a non-
residential account remain unpaid from thirty (30) calendar days from the past
due date, water service to the property may be disconnected for non-payment
after mailed notice to the customer of record at least ten (10) calendar days
prior to termination.
   Residential water customers may contest or appeal a bill in the manner
described in the City’s adopted policy for discontinuation of residential water
service. Non-residential customers may contest or appeal a bill using the same
dispute and appeal procedures described in the policy for discontinuation of
residential water service.
   (c)   Disconnection of Residential Water Service. The City Manager may adopt
and amend a written administrative policy on discontinuation of residential
water service for nonpayment pursuant to Section

billing procedures, discontinuation of service, notification procedures,
restoration of service, procedures to contest or appeal a bill, extensions or
other alternative payment arrangements, protections available to qualified low-
income customers, procedures for becoming a customer of the City under
specified circumstances, and related matters. To the extent a policy adopted
pursuant to this section conflicts with any provisions of this chapter, this
chapter shall control. Except as expressly provided in this section or the
policy, the policy shall not apply to non-residential customers.
   (d)   Water turn on/off. Once terminated, service shall not be turned on
again except upon payment of all amounts due on the utility account, including

turn the water off and/or on shall be set forth in an ordinance adopted by the
City Council. Residential customers who demonstrate a household income below
200% of the federal poverty line may be eligible for reduced turn-on fees
pursuant to applicable law and as further described in the City's policy on
discontinuation of residential water service.
   (e)   Customer liability. Failure to receive a bill shall not relieve the
customer of liability. Any amount due shall be deemed a debt to the City, and

1-2.07 of the Municipal Code.
   (f)   Special bill rate. Special bills, split bills, any other irregular
bills, or bills covering irregular billing periods, shall be calculated by the

minimum charges as set forth in this section, each separate meter connected to
the water system shall be charged on individual readiness-to-serve meter fee

provided to an eligible household, shall be discounted by an amount approved by
the City Council pursuant to an ordinance or resolution. The discount shall be
available only to customers with individually metered residential water
service. The discount shall be in effect for a one (1) year period, which shall
begin as determined by the City Council (e.g. upon approval of an individual
application, upon the start of the following fiscal year, etc.). To renew the
discount for an additional year, the customer must complete and return a
renewal application to the City’s Utilities Customer Services Department. A
renewal notice shall be mailed to the customer with the utilities bill at or
before the end of each year of eligibility. The discount offered under this
subsection is subject to City Council approval through the annual budget
process and the availability of funds allocated to fund the discount.
   (e)   Termination of eligibility. A household shall no longer be an eligible
household if the Utilities Customer Services Department does not receive a
renewal application, if the eligibility criteria set forth in subsection (b)
above cease to exist, or if funds to provide the discount are unavailable
pursuant to subsection (d).

Article 1: General Provisions
Sec. 6-8.701. Authority.
   Recycled water use is regulated by the California State Water Resources
Control Board (State Board) and the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Santa
Ana Region (RWQCB). In accordance with waste discharge requirements for water
reclamation projects, the RWQCB requires control mechanisms to regulate
facilities distributing recycled water. The California Legislature has
established a state policy encouraging the use of recycled water (California
Water Code, Section 13510). Permission to use recycled water is based on Inland
Empire Utilities Agency's ability to treat domestic wastewater in accordance
with the Uniform Statewide Recycling Criteria under Title 22, Division 4,
Chapter 3 of the California Code of Regulations. These regulations were adopted
to ensure proper health protection and specify the treatment degree to meet the
needs of the intended applications.
(§ 1, Ord. 2689, eff. June 17, 1999, as amended by § 2, Ord. 3197, eff. January
7, 2022)
Sec. 6-8.702. Purpose.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures, specifications, and
limitations for the safe use and operation of recycled water facilities and
systems within the City's service area, and adopt rules and regulations
controlling such use and operation.
(§ 1, Ord. 2689, eff. June 17, 1999, as amended by § 2, Ord. 3197, eff. January
7, 2022)
Sec. 6-8.703. Goals.
   The goals of this chapter are as follows:
   (a)   Achieve conservation of potable water supplies by using recycled water
for current and future demands. Recycled water uses may include:
      (1)   Agricultural irrigation.
      (2)   Commercial uses (including flushing toilets and urinals).
      (3)   Construction use.
      (4)   Industrial processes.
      (5)   Landscape irrigation.
      (6)   Landscape and/or recreational impoundments.
      (7)   Wildlife habitat.
      (8)   Groundwater recharge, as approved by the State Board and RWQCB.
   (b)   Maintain recycled water quality through a stringent pretreatment
program for industrial wastewater.
   (c)   Prevent direct human consumption of recycled water through:
      (1)   Adherence to all applicable rules and regulations.
      (2)   Posting of warning signs by the user.
      (3)   Cross-connection/backflow prevention program.
   (d)   Control runoff of recycled water through monitoring of the
installation and operation of all recycled water facilities and use areas.
   (e)   Monitor recycled water quality.
(§ 1, Ord. 2689, eff. June 17, 1999, as amended by § 2, Ord. 3197, eff. January
7, 2022)
Sec. 6-8.704. Policy.
   (a)   It is the policy of the City that recycled water be used for any and
all purposes approved by state regulations for recycled water use. Recycled
water shall be the primary source of supply for commercial and industrial uses,
whenever available and/or feasible. Use of potable water for commercial and
industrial uses shall be contrary to City policy, shall not be considered the
most beneficial use of a natural resource, and shall be avoided to the maximum
extent feasible. If the City determines that recycled water service is feasible
under §§
6-8.710 and
6-8.711, the applicant, owner, or user will be required to use recycled water
service.
      (1)   The people of the State of California have a primary interest in
the development of facilities to recycle water containing waste to supplement
existing surface and underground water supplies and to assist in meeting the
future water requirements of the state (California Water Code, Section 13510).
Conservation of all available water resources requires the maximum reuse of
recycled water for beneficial uses of water (California Water Code, Section
461). The State of California has declared that use of potable water for non-
potable uses may be a waste or an unreasonable use where recycled water is
available (California Government Code, Section 65602(e); California Water Code,
Section 13550).
      (2)   It is the policy of the City that recycled water shall be used
within the jurisdiction of the City whenever and wherever: 1) there is not an
alternative higher or better use for the recycled water; and 2) such use is
consistent with legal requirements, preservation of public health, safety and
welfare of the public, and protection of the environment.

seasonal and recurrent nuisance as provided in this section.
   (b)   The notice required by §
6-9.02(c) shall, in addition to containing all other required matters, state
that the efficient and economical control of such seasonal and recurrent
nuisance requires preventive chemical control of such weeds, weed seeds and
weed seedlings and that the City may require preventive chemical control of
such nuisance.
   (c)   In the event the City is once required to abate such nuisance the City
may, in addition, before and during the next following germinating season of
such weeds, provide for the preventive abatement of such nuisance by using

(§ 2, Ord. 2956, eff. October 4, 2012)
Sec. 6-9.04. Notices; Manner of posting.
   After issuance of a Notice of Violation that has not been appealed, or
appealed and the Notice of Violation upheld, the Director shall cause a notice
of intent to abate weeds and remove refuse, rubbish and dirt to be
conspicuously posted on or in front of the property on or in front of which the
nuisance exists. The notice shall be posted as follows:
   (a)   One (1) notice to each separately owned parcel of property of not over
fifty (50) feet frontage.
   (b)   Not more than two (2) notices to any such parcel of one hundred (100)
feet frontage or less.

property as detailed in a Notice of Violation, or any combination thereof. The
decision of the Director or the designated hearing officer pertaining to the
appeal or the objections to the Notice of Violation or the City's abatement
requirement is final. Failure to file a written appeal within the required
time, including the payment of any applicable appeal fee, shall constitute a
failure to exhaust the recipient's administrative remedies. If the Notice of
Violation is upheld and objections to abatement requirements are overruled, the
Director acquires jurisdiction to proceed with the abatement of weeds, refuse,
rubbish, and dirt. If the abatement requirements are modified or the appellant
(s) agree to perform the abatement by a date certain as a result of the appeals
hearing, the Director acquires jurisdiction to perform the abatement work as
modified by the appeals hearing and to proceed with the abatement work should
the appellant(s) fail to fully perform the work by the agreed upon date.

property to abate the nuisance.
(§ 2, Ord. 2956, eff. October 4, 2012)
Sec. 6-9.11. Removal of weeds, refuse and dirt by property owner.
   Before the Director causes any abatement of weeds, rubbish, refuse or dirt,
any property owner may remove the weeds, rubbish, refuse, or dirt at his own
expense. Nevertheless, in any case in which an order to abate is issued, the
City Council, by motion or resolution, may further order that a special
assessment and lien be imposed pursuant to §
6-9.12. In that case the assessment and lien shall be limited to the costs
incurred by the City in enforcing abatement upon the parcel(s), including
investigation, boundary determination, measurement, clerical, legal, and other
related costs.

costs incurred by the City in enforcing abatement upon the parcels, including
investigation, boundary determination, measurement, clerical, legal, and other

recipient of the notices required by this chapter.
   (b)   The amount of the assessment shall be collected at the same time and
in the same manner of ordinary municipal taxes. If delinquent, the amount is
subject to the same penalties and procedure of foreclosure and sale provided
for ordinary municipal taxes; provided however, that the sale of the property
for unpaid taxes may be conducted following three (3) years, rather than five
(5) years, as provided by state law.
   (c)   The Director may determine that, in lieu of collecting the entire
assessment at the time and in the manner of ordinary municipal taxes, such
assessments of an amount determined by the Director may be made in annual
installments and collected one (1) installment at a time at the times and in
the manner of ordinary municipal taxes in successive years. If any installment
is delinquent, the amount thereof is subject to the same penalties and
procedure for foreclosure and sale provided for ordinary municipal taxes. The
payment of assessments so deferred shall bear interest on the unpaid balance at
a rate of six percent (6%) per annum.
(§ 2, Ord. 2956, eff. October 4, 2012)
Sec. 6-9.13. Priority of lien of assessment.

Government Code and City procedures implementing such claims.

there exist within the City serious and hazardous wind erosion problems
creating conditions that affect the health, safety, welfare and property of the
residents of the City. These conditions exist because of the improper and
untimely disturbance of the surface or subsurface of the land, the soil of
which is coarse-textured and of a sandy nature, and because of the character
and presence of strong prevailing winds, seasonal and otherwise, which
progressively erode the land and blow it in substantial quantity onto public
roads and other public and private properties.

tree, vine or root crops, or by disturbing or spreading a substantial quantity
of similar soil on said land, or by any other action likely to cause or
contribute to wind erosion of said land, or to aggravate said erosion thereon
at any time) without first having obtained a valid permit therefor and having
complied with the terms of said permit as provided for in this chapter.
   (b)   It shall be unlawful for any person or any agent thereof who obtains a
valid permit to fail to comply with the terms of said permit.
   (c)   A permit will not be required to disturb the surface or subsurface of
the land under the following circumstances; however, prevention of dust storms
pursuant to §
6-12.04 will still be required:
      (1)   When such activities are required by another ordinance, statute,
rule or regulation;
      (2)   When necessary to grade, trench or otherwise install, repair or
replace utility services within the boundaries of utility or public rights-of-
way; or
      (3)   When the disturbance or the proposed activity is confined to an
area of one (1) acre or less.
   (d)   The term of the permit shall be one (1) calendar year from the date of
issue.
   (e)   The annual permit fee shall be as follows:

purpose, and shall set forth such information required to enable the Building
Official or his or her deputy to fix and prescribe appropriate conditions which
will prevent or minimize wind erosion of the permittee's soil.
   (b)   The permit shall be subject to such conditions as the Building
Official may require which will assure that surface protection at or prior to

and blown onto public roads or other public or private property. Such
protective measures as required by the Building Official shall be provided by
means of agricultural measures, or any other effective method or combination of
methods of holding the soil in place as determined by the City Council.

Sec. 6-14.01. Purpose and intent.
   It is the purpose and intent of the City Council of the City, through the
adoption of this chapter, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect
public and private property from acts of vandalism and defacement especially,
but not limited to, graffiti on privately and publicly-owned walls which are
hostile and destructive of the rights and values of private property owners as
well as the total community. The power of graffiti to create fear within the
community and blight upon the hardscapes, devaluing property and detracting
from the sense of community enjoyed by residents of Ontario, is beyond the cost
of cleanup or removal. Not only is graffiti a property crime, but a social
crime on the quality of life and freedom from intimidation citizens desire
within their neighborhoods.

Sec. 6-14.10. Removal of graffiti.
   (a)   Maintaining graffiti unlawful. It is unlawful for any person who is
the owner or who has primary responsibility for control of property or who has
primary responsibility for the repair or maintenance of property (“responsible
party”) to permit property which is defaced with graffiti to remain so defaced
for a period of seven (7) days after notice of violation and order to remove,
unless:
      (1)   The person shall demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that he
or she does not have the financial or physical ability to remove the defacing
graffiti; or
      (2)   It can be demonstrated that the responsible party has an active
program for the removal of graffiti and has scheduled the removal of the
graffiti as part of that program in which case it shall be unlawful to permit
such property defaced with graffiti to remain defaced for a period of fifteen
(15) days after notice of same.

and determines that graffiti is so located on public or privately-owned
property within the City, the City shall be authorized to use public funds for
the removal of same, or for the painting or repairing of same, but shall not
authorize or undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more
extensive area than that where the graffiti is located, unless the City
Manager, or designee, determines in writing that a more extensive area is
required to be repainted or repaired in order to avoid an aesthetic
disfigurement to the neighborhood or community, or unless the responsible party
agrees to pay for the costs of repainting or repairing the more extensive area.
   (c)   Entry on private or public property; consent. Prior to entering upon
private property or property owned by a public entity other than the City, for
the purpose of removal of graffiti, the City shall secure the consent of the
property owner, and a release of the City from liability for private or public
property or liability damage.
   (d)   Notice of violation. A notice of violation and order to remove shall
be served on the responsible party by the City in the same manner as summons in
a civil action in accordance with Article 3 of Chapter 4 of Title 5 of Part 2
of the Code of Civil Procedure (commencing with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 415.10).
If the owner of record, after diligent search cannot be found, the notice may
be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property
for a period of ten (10) days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the county in which the property is located pursuant
to Cal. Gov't Code § 6062.
   (e)   Failure to remove after notice. If a responsible party fails to remove
the offending graffiti within the time specified in this section, or if the
City shall have required consent to remove or paint over the offending graffiti
and the responsible party shall have refused consent for entry on terms
acceptable to the City consistent with the terms of this section, the City may
abate the graffiti as a nuisance as provided under this chapter.
   (f)   Special assessment. In the event the City removes graffiti with the
consent of the responsible party and the responsible party fails to reimburse
the City for the cost of removal within thirty (30) days of notice of the
amount of such costs, such costs shall be a special assessment against the
property pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code § 38773.5 as set forth in

public nuisance upon the property owner's real property.

illegal cultivation of cannabis in violation of this Chapter without prior

any of the provisions of this chapter is declared a public nuisance and may be
abated as provided in §

law.
   (e)   The remedies and penalties provided herein are cumulative, alternative
and nonexclusive. The use of one does not prevent the use of any other
criminal, civil, or administrative remedy or penalty authorized by law.

   (e)   Conditions for granting permits. The Engineer shall have the right to
require any reasonable conditions for granting a permit to move, or cause to
move, any building or oversize load upon, over, along, or across any public
highway and to take all actions he deems necessary to protect the public
highway or property of any person and the public health, peace, safety, and
welfare, including, but not limited to, the following:
      (1)   The right to inspect all rollers, trucks, wheels, dollies,

traffic may approach;
      (6)   The right to require the applicant to notify and obtain the written
approval of any person or public utility whose property or facilities will be
unduly disturbed or endangered by the applicant moving an overload upon, over,

or facilities, or the relocation or temporary removal and replacement of the
same, shall be home by the applicant;
      (7)   The right to require the moving of any building or oversize load to
be accomplished under the supervision of a City Inspector. The permittee shall
pay the City an amount equal to the compensation for, and transportation of,
such inspector, plus overhead costs during the time he is assigned to inspect
such move; and
      (8)   The right to require any other reasonable conditions he or she
deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter and to protect the
public health, peace, safety, and welfare.
   (f)   Issuance of permits. If, after receiving an application for a permit
to move a building or oversize load, accompanied by the required fees and
deposits and insurance or certificate thereof, and after the Engineer has
determined within the reasonable period of time that the movement as proposed
in the application will not be detrimental to the public health, peace, safety,
and welfare, and that the permittee has complied with all fire, police, safety,
sanitary, health, building, planning, and general welfare requirements of the
pertinent rules, regulations, Codes, ordinances, and other laws of the City or
State relating thereto in effect at the time, the Engineer shall issue a permit
to move a building, or sections thereof, or an oversize load or loads subject
to such reasonable terms, provisions, and conditions as required by this
chapter and as he or she deems necessary to protect the public highways and
property or structures of any person and the public health, peace, safety, and
welfare. The granting of such permit shall in no way relieve the permittee from
liability for damages to public highways or to any persons or property.
   (g)   Denial of permits. The Engineer shall have the authority, within his
or her discretion, to deny the issuance of a permit if, in his or her opinion,

property or will be detrimental to the public health, peace, safety, and
welfare or will be in violation of any pertinent rules, regulations, Codes,
ordinances, and other laws of the City or State.
   (h)   Flammable and explosive materials. No person shall transport
explosive, flammable, or corrosive materials by means of any building or

causing or permitting a violation of, this chapter, including the conditions
set forth by the Engineer in granting such permit or any pertinent laws of the
City or the State or when it has been shown to his or her satisfaction that the
activities so permitted are being conducted in a manner detrimental to the
public health, peace, safety, or welfare of the City. The Engineer may also
suspend or revoke any permit hereunder if he or she has probable cause to
believe the permittee, or any agent, official, or employee of the permittee,
has misrepresented, falsified, or concealed any material fact in the
application therefor.
   (j)   Permits to be carried in vehicles or with operators. Every building or
oversize load permit, or facsimile thereof, shall be carried in the vehicle to

Sec. 7-3.06. Right to appeal to the Council: Hearings.
   Any applicant who deems himself or herself aggrieved by any action or
determination of the Engineer as provided in this chapter may appeal to the
Council within five (5) days after such action or determination by filing a
written notice of appeal with the Engineer and paying a filing fee of Fifty
Dollars ($50.00). Failure on the part of the applicant to file such notice of
appeal within the five (5) days as herein specified shall constitute the
acceptance of such action or determination of the Engineer.
   The notice of appeal shall be sufficient in form if it contains the names
and addresses of the applicants and states that the appeal is from an action of
the Engineer in either granting or denying such application for a building or
oversize load moving permit.
   Any person or persons who may consider themselves aggrieved by the moving of
buildings or oversize loads as provided in this chapter may file written signed
objections with the Engineer at least twenty four (24) hours prior to the
issuance of such permit, setting forth the name and address of the party
aggrieved and the reasons for the objections, and, upon such objections being
filed with the Engineer, the permit shall not be issued. The Engineer shall
forthwith send any notice of appeal or written signed objections, together with
a copy of the application and the objections thereto, to the City Clerk, upon
any such notice of appeal or objection, the application, together with such
notice of appeal or written objection, with the report and file relating
thereto, shall be forwarded to the Council as soon as reasonably practical, and
the Council shall thereupon determine whether or not the permit shall be issued
as provided herein after a hearing thereupon, and such hearing shall be held
within the City at the earliest reasonable time thereafter; provided, however,
the applicant and any such objector shall be mailed certified notice thereof to
their last known address at least five (5) days prior to such hearing.
   All determinations by the Council after any hearing as provided in this
section shall be considered final and conclusive.
(§ 1, Ord. 1879, eff. February 5, 1976)
Sec. 7-3.07. Safety devices, lights, and barricades.
   Any activity or encroachment on a right-of-way which is hazardous, creates a
hazard, or is in conflict with the normal use of a right-of-way shall be
adequately safeguarded as required by the City. In the conduct of such activity
or encroachment, materials, supplies, excavated material, and equipment shall
be properly placed, and the permittee shall provide and maintain such safety
devices, including, but not limited to, lights, barricades, signs, and guards,
as are necessary to protect the public. Any omission on the part of the
Engineer to specify in the permit the type and locations of such devices that
shall be provided by, or preventive action required of, the permittee shall not
excuse the permittee from complying with all the laws and regulations relating
to the protection of persons or property under the circumstances. Any
disturbance of, or interference with, such safety devices by any person shall
be prohibited. If the Engineer or any authorized representative of the City
finds that suitable safety devices are not being provided, the City may provide
such devices and may bill the permittee for the same and collect such costs in
any lawful manner.
(§ 1, Ord. 1879, eff. February 5, 1976)
Sec. 7-3.08. Storage, displays, and advertising.
   The use of any right-of-way for the purposes of storing, displaying, or
advertising personal property, merchandise, services, or activities shall be

Article 1. Purpose and Methods
Sec. 8-13.101. Findings of fact.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of Ontario, California are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities,
and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.
(§ 1, Ord. 2409, eff. February 4, 1988)
Sec. 8-13.102. Statement of purpose.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
   (a)   To protect human life and health;
   (b)   To minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   To minimize damages to public facilities and utilities, such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (g)   To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
   (h)   To insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
(§ 1, Ord. 2409, eff. February 4, 1988)
Sec. 8-13.103. Methods of reducing flood losses.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increase in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.

(§ 1, Ord. 2409, eff. February 4, 1988, § 6, Ord. 3271, eff. April 4, 2024)
Sec. 8-13.602. Conditions for variances.
   (a)   A variance is authorized to be issued for the repair, improvement, or
rehabilitation of a historic structure upon a determination that the proposed
repair, improvement, or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. When
the proposed work precludes the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure, a variance shall not be granted and the structure and any repair,
improvement, and rehabilitation shall be subject to the requirements of the
building code in conjunction with the provisions of this article.
   (b)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (c)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (d)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or the victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (e)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use, provided that the provisions of subsections (a)
through (d) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
   (f)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the regulatory flood elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the
Floodplain Board in the office of the San Bernardino County Recorder and shall
be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the
affected parcel of land.

(§ 12, Ord. 3227, eff. January 5, 2023)
Sec. 8-14.04. Alternative building standards for adaptive reuse projects.
   (a)   Purpose. The Historic Preservation-Adaptive Reuse Plan in Title 9
Development Code expanded the scope of eligible and underutilized buildings or
structures that have great potential to be converted into new uses or occupancy
that can benefit from relief of parking standards, setbacks and zoning height
limitations. However, key to the success of the Adaptive Reuse Plan relies on
the ability of the Building Official and Fire Marshal to effectively use their
authority to grant code modification or alternative materials, design and
methods of construction and equipment to address practical difficulties
involved in complying with the strict provisions of the code or consider
alternative design or methods not specifically prescribed in the code. Other
statutory regulations such as the California Historic Building Code adopted in
§
8-14.01 and the California Existing Building Code adopted in §
8-14.02, including Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 17958.11 and Cal. Health and Safety Code
§ 19957, provides the Building Official and Fire Marshal with the ability to
consider other alternative building standards. Therefore, the purpose of this
chapter is to amend, expand, establish and clarify alternative building
standards for the conversion of existing buildings or structures to accommodate
new uses or occupancy for other purposes than what it was originally designed
for and still provide reasonable use and safety to the building occupants.
   (b)   Applicability. Projects that meet the definition and applicable
requirements of an adaptive reuse project pursuant to Title 9 Development Code
may be permitted to use the alternative building standards of this chapter.
   (c)   Adaptive Reuse Technical Manual.
      (1)   Although other chapters or sections of the Ontario Municipal Code
and the most recently adopted edition of the California Building Standards Code
are applicable to new construction or a change of use or occupancy, the use of
the Adaptive Reuse Technical Manual, which includes Alternative Building
Materials and Methods, may be permitted to provide alternative regulations for
adaptive reuse projects that meet the applicability requirement of subsection
(b).
      (2)   The Building Official and Fire Marshal shall prepare, maintain, and
update, as deemed necessary and appropriate, the Adaptive Reuse Technical
Manual and shall include technical information and implementation parameters,
alternative compliance for technical infeasibility, as well as other rules,
requirements and procedures as the City deems necessary, for implementing the
provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   The Building Official and Fire Marshal shall develop, as deemed
necessary and appropriate, in cooperation with other City departments and
stakeholders, informational bulletins, training manuals and educational
materials to assist in the implementation of this chapter.

(§ 2, Ord. 2616, eff. June 20, 1996)
Sec. 8-15.102. Purpose.
   (a)   The purpose of these sections is to safeguard life, health, property
and public welfare by establishing minimum requirements regulating the design,
construction and modification of buildings in the vicinity of Ontario
International Airport. These sections are not intended to abridge any safety or
health requirements required under any other applicable codes or ordinances.
   (b)   These sections define the procedures for implementing the sound
insulation requirements set forth in the State Division of Aeronautics Noise
Standards (California Code of Regulations, Title 21, Subchapter 6) and the
State Building Code (California Code of Regulations, Title 24, § 3501). Based
on these documents, acoustic insulation shall be provided within specified
community noise equivalent level (CNEL) contours to ensure an interior CNEL
(due to exterior noise) of forty-five (45) dB or less in all habitable rooms in
both single and multifamily residential dwellings and in specified noise-
sensitive nonresidential buildings.
(§ 2, Ord. 2616, eff. June 20, 1996)
Sec. 8-15.103. Scope.
   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all Group R buildings (single
and multifamily residential dwellings), as defined by the Uniform Building
Code, within the most recent fourth quarter sixty (60) CNEL noise contour map
of Ontario International Airport published by the City of Los Angeles
Department of Airports and to specified nonresidential buildings within the
sixty-five (65) CNEL of the airport. Group R buildings are not allowed to be
constructed in the seventy-five (75) CNEL or greater noise contour on the
latest annual map. This chapter is intended to supplement the provisions of the
Uniform Building Code and in the case of conflict between this chapter and any
other applicable codes, the more restrictive requirements shall be met.
(§ 2, Ord. 2616, eff. June 20, 1996)
Sec. 8-15.104. Standards and certifications.
   (a)   Prescriptive design/construction standards are provided for the sound
insulation of new construction or modification of Group R buildings located
within the most recent fourth quarter sixty-five (65) annual CNEL contour.
Within the most recent fourth quarter sixty (60) CNEL to the sixty-five (65)
CNEL zone, Group R buildings that are proposed for construction or modification
are not required to comply with the prescriptive sound insulation standards;
however, a certified acoustical engineer must provide certification that
planned building modification and construction will achieve at least the forty-
five (45) CNEL standard for all habitable rooms.
   (b)   Prescriptive design/construction standards are not provided for noise-
sensitive nonresidential buildings (schools, churches and hospitals) that
constitute incompatible land use within the sixty-five (65) CNEL contour;
however, a certified acoustical engineer must provide certification that the
planned construction or modifications will achieve the required noise
environment.
   (c)   Deviations from the specified building requirements (i.e., standards,
materials and construction assemblies) provided in the building requirements
herein are permissible only if all deviations are certified to comply with and
achieve the forty-five (45) CNEL standard for every habitable room constructed
or modified. All deviations require approval by the Building Official and
certification by a certified acoustical engineer. Acoustic measurements will be
conducted by a certified acoustical engineer to verify that the forty-five (45)
CNEL standard is not exceeded for all habitable rooms incorporating deviations
from the building requirements.
   (d)   All new and modified residential construction within the sixty-five
(65) CNEL contour is subject to post-construction/pre-occupancy acoustic
measurement at the discretion of the Building Official. Occupation of all
habitable rooms not achieving the required CNEL rating may be precluded until
such time as acoustic modification of that room achieves at least the forty-
five (45) CNEL standard.
(§ 2, Ord. 2616, eff. June 20, 1996)
Sec. 8-15.105. Application to existing buildings.
   Addition or alteration of floor area may be made to existing Group R
buildings within the sixty (60) CNEL noise contour but outside the seventy-five
(75) CNEL contour without making the entire building comply with all the
requirements of this chapter for new construction unless the cost of
improvements is seventy-five (75) percent or more of the total assessed value
of the structure, in which case the entire building shall be made to comply. No
addition of habitable space shall be made to existing Group R buildings inside
the seventy-five (75) CNEL contour unless the entire building is made to
comply. All additions of separable habitable rooms, and all separable habitable
rooms or areas that result from an expansion of the building, including both
the newly expanded area and the pre-existing room or area, shall fully comply
with the design and construction procedures and standards set forth in this
Code.

(§ 1, Ord. 2894, eff. July 17, 2008)
Sec. 8-17.109. Right of entry.
   Whenever it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of or perform any duty imposed by this Chapter or other applicable
law, or whenever the City Manager has reasonable cause to believe that there
exists in any Property any violation of the provisions of this Chapter or other
applicable law, or any condition that makes the Property hazardous,
substandard, unsafe or dangerous, or a public nuisance, the City Manager is
hereby authorized to enter the Property at any reasonable time and to inspect
it and perform any function authorized by this Chapter or other applicable law,
including any resolution of the City Council.
(§ 1, Ord. 2894, eff. July 17, 2008)
Sec. 8-17.110. Collection; penalty.

latest equalized assessment roll, a "service fee notice", requesting payment
for the applicable service fee.
   (b)   It shall be unlawful for any person to fail to pay the applicable
service fee when due. If the owner fails to pay the service fee, as specified
in this chapter, within forty-five (45) days of mailing the service fee notice,
in addition to any other remedy authorized by law, the amount of the unpaid
service fee, plus any penalties and accrued interest, shall constitute a
personal debt and obligation of such owner and shall be made a proposed lien
against the property that is the subject of the enforcement activity. The
amount of the proposed lien may be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as property taxes are collected. All laws applicable to the levy,
collection, and enforcement of ad valorem taxes shall be applicable to the
proposed lien. If the City chooses to collect the service fee, late fees and
penalties specified in this chapter through a special assessment, the notices
shall be in accordance with §
1-4.05.
   (c)   In addition to the remedies set forth herein or otherwise provided for
by law, the obligation to pay any unpaid service fee, plus any penalties and
accrued interest, shall constitute a personal obligation of any owner of
property subject to this chapter. Such obligation may be recovered against such
property owner through a suit instituted by the City or its authorized
collection agent, or in any other manner provided for by law. In any such
action, the City shall be entitled to recover, in addition to the service fee
and any penalties and interest accruing thereon, costs of suit, including the
City's reasonable attorneys' fees.

2010)
Sec. 8-17.111. Penalties.
   (a)   In addition to the remedies provided by this chapter or elsewhere by
law, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter or any misrepresentation of any owner signed under
penalty of perjury, or any violation of any rule or regulation adopted by the
City Manager pursuant to this chapter, shall be deemed unlawful and a per se
public nuisance and may be enjoined or abated by the City by means of a civil
action or administrative abatement pursuant to Title 5-22 of this Code, and
each day such condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate
offense.
   (b)   Except in cases where a different punishment is specifically
prescribed elsewhere in this chapter, every violation of this chapter shall
constitute a misdemeanor offense, punishable in accordance with §
1-2.01(c); provided, that where the City Attorney determines that such action
would be in the interests of justice, the City Attorney may specify in the
accusatory pleading (or the citing officer in a Notice to Appear) that the
offense shall be an infraction, punishable in accordance with §
1-2.01(b).
   (c)   If any property owner fails to pay the service fee, as specified in
this chapter, within forty-five (45) days of mailing such service fee notice, a
penalty shall be assessed equal to two times the required fee, plus accrued
interest on such amount (including any penalty) at a rate of ten percent (10%)
per annum commencing as of the date of the mailing of the service fee notice
until paid.

responsibility to promote the health, peace, safety, welfare, and convenience
of all persons in regard to their use and enjoyment of any City-owned park
defined in §
10-1.01(f) of this chapter. The Council finds that to give practical effect to
this policy and to insure that all persons may enjoy such parks, it is

permit by the Director or his duly authorized representative and subject to the
payment of fees therefor. No exclusive use of any park for a pre-advertised
outdoor activity consisting of the assembly of twenty five (25) or more persons
may be made without the issuance of an exclusive use park permit therefor, the
purpose of which is to protect the rights of all persons to enjoy and make use
of such parks, to protect the rights of those in surrounding areas, and to
protect the public health, peace, safety, and welfare. All applications for an
exclusive use park permit shall be signed or cosigned by an adult, which adult
shall agree to be responsible for such exclusive use. No exclusive use park
permit will be granted for the time and place specified in the application if,
prior to the time the application was filed, the City has scheduled a City-
sponsored event at the same time and place as the activity proposed in such
application.
   No exclusive use park permit shall be granted for any outdoor assembly or
assembly activity during any of the time between one (1) hour before sunset and

application in writing for such permit with the Director not less than ten (10)
working days nor more than six (6) weeks prior to the proposed use of the park.

Sec. 10-1.06. Action on exclusive use park permit applications.
   (a)   The Director, in considering requests from applicants for exclusive
use park permits, shall insure that the proposed use will not be detrimental to
the public health, peace, safety, or general welfare. The Director shall grant
or deny such application on or before ten (10) working days after the filing of

been waived by the applicant in writing.

may impose reasonable requirements and conditions concerning the use of the
park by the applicant, including time limitations on permit activities and any
other reasonable terms, provisions, and conditions as required by this chapter
and as he deems necessary to protect the property of any person and the public
health, peace, safety, and welfare.
   (c)   The number, location, and type of officers shall be determined and
specified by the Police Chief or his designee to provide for the preservation
of order and the protection of property in and around the place of the event.
Funds to employ the specific number of law enforcement officers at the current
hourly salary rate for the Police Department shall be deposited with the City
at least ten (10) days prior to the specified date the event is to occur. One
(1) law enforcement officer for every five hundred (500) persons expected to be
in attendance shall be required, with a minimum of two (2) officers.
   Where the Police Chief specifies the employment of off-duty peace officers
to meet the requirements of this section, such peace officer shall be under the
complete direction and control of the Police Chief. The Police Chief shall be
satisfied that the requisite number of peace officers will be provided at all
times of operations, plus any specified time prior to and following the event,
before a license is issued. (See §
5-16.08(a))
   (d)   The applicant, or another responsible person named on the application,
shall remain on the premises for which the permit is issued during the entire
duration of the permit; failure to observe this condition shall be grounds for
the immediate cancellation of the permit by the Director.
   (e)   The Director may grant the application for a park other than that
applied for with the consent of the applicant in the event a permit has already
been issued for said park or said park does not meet the needs of the applicant
or is otherwise unsuitable. In the event more than one application is received
for a park for use on the same day, the Director shall act upon the application
first received.
   (f)   The Director shall deny the application if he finds that any of the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   That the application reveals that the City has no park which will
accommodate the activity of the applicant.
      (2)   That the proposed activity or use of the park will unreasonably
interfere with or detract from the general public use and enjoyment of the
proposed park;
      (3)   That the proposed activity will not be in compliance with Federal,
State, and local laws;
      (4)   That the applicant has failed to agree to provide a reasonable
means of informing all of the persons participating in the proposed activity of
the terms and conditions of such permit;
      (5)   That the applicant refuses to agree in writing to comply with all
the conditions in the permit; or
      (6)   That the applicant has failed to file a timely application, unless
waived by the Director and the applicant waives all rights of appeal.
   Such denial shall specify the grounds therefor and provide notification of
the applicant's right of appeal.
(§ 1, Ord. 2114, eff. January 15, 1981)
Sec. 10-1.07. Exclusive use of general park facilities and buildings.
   The City's park facilities and buildings shall be made available for the
exclusive use of individuals or groups, subject to the issuance of a permit by
the Director or his duly authorized representative and subject to the payment
of fees therefor as provided by resolution. Closing times for each park and
building shall be set by the Director and shall be uniformly applied. No
exclusive use permit will be granted if, prior to the time the application was

as the activity proposed in such application.
(§ 1, Ord. 2114, eff. January 15, 1981)
Sec. 10-1.08. Park facility and building use permits: Applications.

of the person in charge of the proposed activity;

one application is received for the same park facility or building for use at
the same time, the Director shall first act upon the application first
received.
   (d)   The Director shall deny the application if he finds that any of the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   That no building with the required occupancy load capacity is
available;
      (2)   That the park facility or building is ill-suited to the activity
described in the application;

conditions in the permit;

costs, damages, or expenses that the City or any of its officers may incur or
be obligated to pay by reason of the granting of such permit, including damages
to park growth, facilities, buildings, and other City-owned property. The
Director may require the applicant to post a like surety bond indemnifying any
property owners adjoining such park site for any costs necessitated for

Sec. 10-1.12. Suspension and revocation of permits.

this chapter when he has reasonable cause to believe that a permittee has
violated or is causing or permitting a violation of this chapter, including the
conditions set forth by the Director granting such permit, or any pertinent
Federal, State, County, or City law, or when it has been shown to his
satisfaction that the activities so permitted are being conducted in a manner
detrimental to the public health, peace, safety, or welfare of the City. The
Director may also suspend or revoke any such permit if he has probable cause to
believe the permittee has misrepresented, falsified, or concealed any material
fact in the application therefor.

the issuance of any permit as provided in this chapter may file written signed
objections with the Director after the issuance of such permit setting forth
the name and address of the party aggrieved and the reasons for the objections.
Upon such objections being filed with the Director, the permit shall be
suspended if, in the Director's determination, such objections are justified in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter; provided, however, if the
Director determines that the objections are not justified in accordance with
this chapter, he shall notify the objectors of such a determination.
(§ 1, Ord. 2114, eff. January 15, 1981)
Sec. 10-1.15. Right to appeal to Recreation Commission and Council: Hearings.
   With respect to any permit issued pursuant to this chapter, any applicant or
objector may appeal the decision of the Director regarding the issuance of any
permit as provided in this chapter to the Recreation Commission. The applicant
or objector shall file such appeal with the Director within five (5) working
days after the Director's mailing of such decision. Upon any such notice of
appeal or objection being received by the Director, the application, together
with such notice of appeal and/or written objections, together with the report
and file relating thereto, shall be forwarded to the Commission as soon as
reasonably practicable. Upon the receipt of such material, the Commission shall
hold a hearing on such application, such hearing to be held within the City at
the earliest reasonable date thereafter, at which time the applicant and/or any
objectors may present any and all evidence, testimony and information relevant
to the application. The applicant, along with any objectors, shall be mailed
postpaid a notice of the hearing thereof to their last known address at least
five (5) days prior to such a hearing. The Commission, within twenty four (24)
hours after such appeal hearing, shall issue a decision either affirming the
denial of the application or advising the Director to issue a permit as applied
for subject to reasonable terms and conditions as set forth in this chapter.
   After an appeal to the Recreation Commission, any applicant or objector who
deems himself aggrieved by any action or determination of any official of the
City as provided in this chapter may appeal to the Council within five (5) days
after such action or determination by filing a written notice of appeal with

Sec. 10-2.11. Violations of provisions.
   The failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this chapter
within forty eight (48) hours after receiving a notice of the violation thereof

shall constitute a separate offense. The foregoing provision notwithstanding,
when any violation is deemed by the City to constitute an immediate hazard to
health or safety, the City shall eliminate such hazardous violation and
thereafter shall recover the costs incurred from the owner in any lawful
manner.
   Notice of violation shall be given in writing by the City and served upon
the owner in person, if possible. If personal service is not possible, the
notice shall be sent by mail, receipt requested, and a copy of the notice shall
be conspicuously posted at the site of the violation.

tolerant trees and shrubs to create shading, moderate outdoor temperatures, and
provide various economic and aesthetic benefits. However, there are certain
situations in which the need for widespread use of alternative energy devices
such as solar collectors requires specific and limited controls on trees and
shrubs.
   All street trees that require removal or pruning to allow for adequate
operation of solar collectors shall be removed or pruned at owners expense. All
work must be approved by the City and shall meet City specifications. All
street tree removals must meet the requirements of §
10-2.06(e).
