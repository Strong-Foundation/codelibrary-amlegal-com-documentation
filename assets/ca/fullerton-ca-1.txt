Preface
   The Fullerton Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing
Company in 1961, has been kept current by regular supplementation.
   During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and
indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction
of the City Attorney.
   The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor
decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation
without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number
designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus,
Section 21.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 21.12 of Title 21. In
most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving
nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future
provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal
expansion.
   In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying
the specific sources of the provisions of that section. This legislative
history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text
of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they
appear in the codification.
   A subject matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific
code provisions by individual section numbers.
   This supplement brings the code up to date through Ordinance 3332.

provision of this code, at the discretion of the City Attorney or District

is specifically stated therein. The complaint/citation charging such violation
shall specify whether the violation is a misdemeanor or an infraction.

exists, the city official vested with the authority to enforce the various
provisions of this code may issue an Administrative Citation under the
provisions of
Chapter 1.10. (Ord. 2940 § A (1, 2), 1998).

within the meaning of the Penal and Vehicle Codes and that any person guilty

the City for violating such provision of this code and there is hereby fixed
and imposed upon any person liable of such, penalties therefor now or hereafter
imposed by Vehicle Code Section 40200.

existing which provide the procedures to be followed when an infraction has
been committed shall apply with respect to all notices, arrests and other
procedures for the enforcement of any provision of this code which the
violation of, or failure to comply with, constitutes an infraction of this
code. (Ord. 2843 § 1, 1993; Ord. 2783 (part), 1991; Ord. 2617 § 1, 1987; Ord.

manner provided by the laws of the State of California and the ordinances of
this City for the abatement of a public nuisance, and the City shall also have
all rights provided by such laws and ordinances to recover damages suffered
from any such nuisance and to recover from the owner of the property upon which

Responsible Person administrative remedies regarding any reductions of the

the deadline.

supporting documents. Once the City receives a completed Advance Deposit
Hardship Waiver form, it stays payment of the fine until the Community
Development Director, or designee issues a written determination granting or
denying the Advance Deposit Hardship Waiver. Such determination shall be final.
If the determination denies the Advance Deposit Hardship Waiver, the
Responsible Party shall pay the full amount of the fine within ten days from

opportunity to testify and present witnesses and relevant evidence concerning
the charges set forth in the Administrative Citation.
   D.   The failure of the person contesting the Administrative Citation to
appear at the Administrative Citation hearing shall constitute a forfeiture of
any fines paid and a failure to exhaust their administrative remedies.
   E.   The Administrative Citation and any additional documents submitted by
the Enforcement Officer shall constitute prima facie evidence of the respective
facts contained in those documents.
   F.   Neither the Enforcement Officer nor any other representative of the
City shall be required to attend the hearing nor shall the Hearing Officer
require submittal of any evidence, other than the citation, that may exist
among the public records of the City on the violation. However, the Enforcement
Officer or any City employee or agent has the discretion to make such
appearance and/or submission.
   G.   The Enforcement Officer must provide a copy of any additional records
concerning the Administrative Citation submitted to the Hearing Officer for
consideration at the hearing to the person requesting the hearing at least ten

decision.

of the Hearing Officer written decision within twenty days from the date the

otherwise be determined by majority vote of the City Council, as to the
appointment of City Commission/Committee members:
   A.   Applicants must complete an application for each Commission/ Committee
he/she is applying for and submit the application(s) to the City Clerk’s
Office. All qualified candidate applications will be forwarded to City Council
for review. In order to be considered a qualified candidate, an applicant must,
at a minimum, be a resident of the City and be at least 18 years of age.
   B.   City Council will ratify direct appointments prior to making at-large
appointments. All directly appointed Commission/Committee members will serve
four-year terms with terms running concurrent with the appointing City Council
member’s term or remainder of term.
   C.   At-large Commission/Committee applicants shall be interviewed by a

member of the City Council designated by the Mayor; and the chair (or his/her
Commission/Committee designee) of the appropriate Commission/Committee. The

   D.   All Commission/Committee members shall continue in office until their
successors are appointed.
   E.   City Council shall make appointments for unscheduled vacancies in the
same manner as appointments for full terms. The person appointed to fill an
unscheduled vacancy will serve for the remainder of the term. Partial terms do
not count as a term for the purposes of term limits.
   F.   No person shall concurrently serve on any Commission or Committee at
anytime.
   G.   City employees are not eligible to serve on any Commission or
Committee, except for the Investment Advisory Committee as set forth in the
City’s investment policy.
   H.   All appointed Commission/Committee members shall serve at the pleasure
of the City Council unless otherwise provided by law. Any Commission/Committee
member may be removed at any time by the City Council member appointing that
member or by a four-fifths vote of the City Council.
   I.   Effective May 7, 2021, all Commissions and Committees will consist of

2.11.035   Removal.

or her without a vote of the entire Council. Where a City Council member leaves
office before the expiration of his or her term, his or her successor to serve
the remainder of the term may remove his or her appointed Commissioner during
the remainder of the term without a vote of the entire Council. (Ord. 3167 § 2,
2011; Ord. 3060 § 4, 2005: Ord. 1650 (part), 1970).
2.11.036   Announcement of vacancies.
   All vacancies occurring on Commissions and boards shall be announced by news
releases to the local press. The expiration of the term of an incumbent
Commissioner or Board member shall be considered a vacancy within the meaning
of this section. (Ord. 2032 (part), 1975).
2.11.037   Filling of vacancies -- Expiration of term.
   Upon the expiration of the initial full term, the incumbent may be offered
the opportunity to be considered for one additional term and, in the event of
an affirmative response, the Council shall consider the incumbent with other
applicants. When a Commissioner has served two full terms, in addition to any
partial term, they are eligible for reappointment after a waiting period
equivalent to one full term. The waiting period shall not apply, however, to
Commissions where specific technical expertise is required for membership. In
the event there are no applicants for a Committee and a member who has served
two full terms wishes to be reappointed, it is Council's prerogative to
reappoint that member. (Ord. 2890 § 2, 1996: Ord. 2032 (part), 1975).
2.11.040   Vacancies.

shall have missed three consecutive regular meetings of the Commission of which

within ten days following the third absence, a written request to be excused
from any of such absences, or who is absent in excess of twenty-five percent of
the regularly scheduled meetings, of such Commission during any anniversary
year of his or her membership, shall be deemed to have resigned from such
Commission. If said request is granted by the City Council his membership shall
continue, but if said request is denied by the City Council his or her
membership on such Commission shall be thereby terminated. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the reappointment by the Council of any person to any
Commission from which he has resigned, been deemed to have resigned, or from
which his membership has been terminated. (Ord. 3087 (part), 2007: Ord. 1806 §
1, 1972: Ord. 1650 (part), 1970).
2.11.060   No compensation.

serve without compensation. When approved by the City Manager, Commissioners
may be reimbursed for their necessary expenses in the performance of their
duties as Commissioners. (Ord. 3087 (part), 2007: Ord. 1650 (part), 1970).
2.11.070   Election or appointment as Councilmember.
   The election or appointment of a Commissioner as a member of the City
Council shall constitute the immediate removal of such Commissioner from any
Commission(s) on which they are then serving. (Ord. 2863, 1995: Ord. 1650
(part), 1970).
2.11.080   Notices of meetings.

   Annually, each Commission/Committee shall elect one of its members as Chair
and another of its members as Vice-Chair, and each shall hold office for one
year or until a successor is elected. (Ord. 3258 §5, 2018)
2.11.100 Rules of procedure.
   The City Council may adopt one or more resolutions setting forth rules of
procedure and other administrative practices for Commissions/ Committees. In
the event of any conflict, the provisions of this code shall govern over the
provisions of such resolutions. (Ord. 3258 §6, 2018)

in, on, over, under, upon, across and along any public street, such poles,

the CATV system serving that city. No other provisions of the franchise, or
grantee's proposal which has been incorporated by reference into this
franchise, are in any way modified by this provision. Only those rights which
are expressly granted herein are deemed to be granted.
   B.    The grantee may make a charge to subscribers for installation or
connection to its CATV system and a fixed monthly charge under provisions
established by the Council expressed by resolution. (Ord. 2519 § 2, 1984; Ord.
2326 § 1 (part), 1980).
3.14.050   Duration of franchise.
   A.    This franchise is for a term of twenty years from the effective date
of the ordinance transferring the franchise from Theta Cable of California,
Inc., to the Teleprompter Corporation, but shall terminate if, as and when, and
to the extent that, the City acquires the CATV system property of the grantee
installed in the city.
   B.    The City may terminate any franchise granted pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter in the event of the wilful failure or refusal by
grantee to do or comply with any material requirement or limitation contained
in this chapter, or any material rule or regulation of the Council or City
Manager validly adopted pursuant to this chapter.
   C.    The City Manager may make written demand that the grantee do, or
comply with, any such requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule or
regulation. If the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee continues for a
period of thirty days following such written demand, the City Manager may place
his request for termination of the franchise upon the Council meeting agenda.
The City Manager shall cause to be served upon such grantee, at least ten days
prior to the date of such Council meeting, a written notice of his intent to
request such termination, and the time and place of the meeting.
   D.    The Council shall consider the request of the City Manager and shall
hear any persons interested therein, and shall determine whether or not any
failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause.
   E.    If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just
cause, the Council shall direct the grantee to comply within such time and
manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable.
   F.    If the Council determines such failure, refusal or neglect by the
grantee was without just cause, then the Council may pass its resolution
declaring that the franchise of the grantee shall be terminated and forfeited
unless there is compliance by the grantee within such period as the Council may
fix.
   G.    The termination and forfeiture of any franchise shall in no way affect
any of the rights of the City under the franchise or any provision of law.
   H.    In the event of any holding over after the expiration or other
termination of any franchise granted hereunder, without the prior consent of
the City, expressed by resolution, the grantee shall pay to the City reason-
able compensation and damages, of not less than fifty percent of its total
gross revenue during said period.
   I.    Any and all minimum standards governing the operation of grantee and
any and all maximum rates, ratios, and charges specified herein or in any
franchise issued hereunder, existing now and at any time in the future, and any
and all rights, powers, privileges, and authorities of the City to determine,
establish, or fix any of the same, are each and all hereby declared by the City
and by any grantee accepting any franchise hereunder to be contractual in
nature and to be for the benefit of the city and all subscribers situated
herein. (Ord. 2326 § 1 (part), 1980).
3.14.060   Franchise payments.
   The grantee shall pay annually to the City, by delivery to the Director of
Finance, until this franchise is terminated, a sum equal to five percent of the
gross annual receipts of the grantee. If, during any part of the franchise
term, there is in effect a Federal or State limit regulating the franchise fee
percentage to a lesser amount, such a limitation shall apply, but only for that
period such limit is legally operational. Franchise payments required hereunder
shall be in lieu of any business license, occupation tax or similar levy.
   A.    The grantee shall file with the City, by delivering to its Director of
Finance, within ninety days after the end of each calendar year until this
franchise is terminated and within thirty days after such termination, a
financial statement certified by a certified public accountant, or person
otherwise satisfactory to the City Manager, showing in detail the gross annual
receipts, as defined in Section
3.14.010, of grantee during the preceding calendar year or portion thereof
until such termination. Within fifteen days after the time for filing such
statements, the sum hereinabove prescribed or any unpaid balance thereof for
such calendar year or for such portion thereof, as shown by such statements,
shall be so paid to the City.
   B.    The City shall have the right to inspect and audit the grantee's
fiscal records. If any independent audit of the grantee's records directed by
the City shows a franchise fee error in excess of two percent in the City's
favor, the grantee shall assume all reasonable costs for said audit. No
acceptance of any payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and
satisfaction of any claim the City may have for further additional sums payable
under this section or for the performance of any other obligation hereunder.
Any refusal of the grantee to file said verified statement, or to pay said
percentage in full, at the time or in the manner hereinbefore provided, which
refusal shall continue for more than fifteen days following notice thereof to
the grantee from the City shall be grounds for the termination of this
franchise as provided for in Section
3.14.050.
   C.    For any full calendar year for which said payments equal to five
percent of the gross receipts amount to less than twelve hundred dollars, the
grantee shall so pay to the City for such year an additional amount equal to
the difference between the total of such payments and the sum of twelve hundred
dollars. For any part of a calendar year for which period such payments amount
to a total sum less than one hundred dollars multiplied by the number of
months, measured from a beginning date in one calendar month to the same date
in the next calendar month, and for any fraction of such a month, at the rate
of one-thirtieth of one hundred dollars per day, in such period, the grantee
shall so pay to the City for such period an additional amount equal to the
difference between the total of such payments and the minimum rate of one
hundred dollars per month. (Ord. 2326 § 1 (part), 1980).
3.14.070   Limitations of franchise.
   A.    The franchise granted by this chapter is nonexclusive.
   B.    No privilege or exemption is granted or conferred by this franchise
except those specifically prescribed herein.
   C.    Any privilege claimed under this franchise by the grantee in any
street or other public property shall be subordinate to any prior lawful
occupancy of the streets or other public property.
   D.    This franchise is a privilege to be held in personal trust by the
grantee and by any assignee thereof. It cannot in any event be sold,
transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by
forced or involuntary sale, or by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or
otherwise, without the prior consent of the Council expressed by resolution,
and then only under such conditions as may be therein prescribed. Any such
transfer or assignment shall be made only by an instrument in writing, a duly
executed copy of which shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk within
thirty days after any such transfer or assignment. The consent of the Council
may not be arbitrarily refused; provided, however, the proposed assignee must
show financial responsibility and must file with the City Clerk its acceptance
of the assignment and its agreement to assume, perform, and to be bound by, and
to comply with, all of the provisions of this franchise; and provided further,
that no such consent shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage or
other hypothecation as a whole, to secure an indebtedness, but shall be
required before any assignment is made in compliance with any authority under
any such security transaction.
   E.    Time is of the essence of this franchise. The grantee shall not be
relieved of its obligation to comply promptly with any of the provisions of the
franchise or by any failure of the City to enforce prompt compliance therewith.
   F.    Any right or power given to, and any duty impressed upon, any officer,
employee, department, or board of the City shall be subject to transfer by the
Council to any other officer, employee, department, or board of the City.
   G.    Except for the City's gross negligence or intentional misconduct, the
grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the City for any loss, cost,
expense or damage arising out of any provision or requirement of this franchise
or because of its enforcement.
   H.    Except as limited by the State and Federal law, the grantee shall be
subject to all requirements of City ordinances, rules, regulations and
specifications heretofore or hereafter enacted or established, provided that
any such requirements are not inconsistent with the terms of this chapter.
   I.    This franchise does not relieve the grantee of any obligation involved
in obtaining pole space from any department of the City, from any utility
company, or from others maintaining poles in streets.
   J.    This franchise is granted in lieu of, and the grantee waives, any and
all other rights, privileges, powers, immunities, and authorities owned,
possessed, controlled, or exercisable by the grantee, for itself and for any
success or to any interest of the grantee hereunder, of, or pertaining to the
construction, operation, or maintenance of any CATV system in the city and the
acceptance of this franchise shall operate, as between the grantee and the
City, as an abandonment to the City of any and all of such rights, privileges,
powers, immunities, and authorities within the city, to the effect that, as
between the grantee, and the City, any and all construction, operation and
maintenance by the grantee of any CATV system in the city shall be, and shall
be deemed and construed in all instances and respects to be, under and pursuant
to this franchise, and not under or pursuant to any other right, privilege,
power, immunity or authority whatsoever. (Ord. 2326 § 1 (part), 1980).
3.14.080   Rights reserved to the City.
   A.    In the event the City wishes to acquire part or all of the cable
system either by purchase or through the exercise of the right of eminent
domain, City and grantee will each appoint one appraiser to establish the value
of the system to be acquired by the City. The two appraisers will select a
third appraiser who will be chairman of the appraisal board. The board will, by
majority vote, determine the value of the system to be acquired by the City.
This value will be final and binding on both the City and grantee and will be
used as the purchase price of just compensation in an eminent domain proceeding
between the City and grantee.
   In the event of purchase by the City, or a change of grantee, the current
grantee shall cooperate with the City, or with a representative appointed by
the City to operate the system for a temporary period in maintaining continuity
of service to all subscribers.
   B.    There is reserved to the City every right and power which is required
to be herein reserved or provided by any ordinance of the City, and the grantee
by its acceptance of this franchise agrees to be bound thereby and to comply
with any action or requirement of the City in its exercise of such rights or
power, heretofore or hereafter enacted or established, provided that any such
requirements are not inconsistent with the terms of this chapter.
   C.    Neither the granting of the franchise hereunder nor any of the
provisions contained herein shall be construed to prevent the City from
granting any identical, or similar, franchise to any other person, firm or
corporation, within all or any portion of the city.
   D. The City may amend this franchise, upon application of the grantee, when
necessary to enable the grantee to take advantage of any developments in the
field of transmission of communication signals which will afford it an
opportunity more effectively, efficiently, or economically to serve its
customer; provided, however, that this section shall not be construed to
require the City to make any amendment.
   The grantee agrees to incorporate, as a part of the cable system installed,
historically proven advances in equipment and services at the first reasonable
opportunity, provided that it is economically feasible and otherwise agreed
upon. Such equipment and service shall include, but not be limited to, two-way
access available to all subscribers, equipment to facilitate such two-way
services at both headend and subscriber terminals, availability of national or
international transmission via communications satellites, application of fiber
optic technology and other such advances. Such equipment and services shall be
incorporated in the Fullerton Cable System without regard to the company,
corporation or other agency involved in its development.
   E.    Neither the granting of this franchise nor any provision hereof shall
constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power
of the City.
   F.    The Council may do all things which are necessary and convenient in
the exercise of its jurisdiction, and may determine any question of fact which
may arise by reason of the existence of this franchise. The City Manager is
authorized and empowered to adjust, settle, or compromise any controversy or
charge arising from the operations of the grantee under this franchise, either
on behalf of the City, the grantee, or any subscriber, in the best interest of
the public. Either the grantee or any member of the public who may be
dissatisfied with any decision of the City Manager may appeal the matter to the
Council for hearing and determination. The Council may accept, reject or modify
the decision of the City Manager, and the Council may adjust, settle or
compromise any controversy or cancel any charge arising from the operations of
the grantee. (Ord. 2326 § 1 (part), 1980).
3.14.090   Construction.
   A.    The grantee does agree as stated in its proposal to commence
construction of its cable communication system within ninety days of the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and will diligently
proceed with all construction thereunder shown so as to cause the five
construction areas to be completed and service available to subscribers, in
accordance with the following schedule:
   Area      Time
   Area I      within 6 months after the effective date
   Area II      within 8 months after the effective date
   Area III   within 10 months after the effective date
   Area IV   within 14 months after the effective date
   Area V      within 18 months after the effective date
   B.    The five construction areas are those areas designated on the map
contained in the grantee's proposal. The grantee will certify, in a written
report to the City, the actual completion dates of each such area.
   C.    The Council may in its discretion extend the time for completion of
construction in the event the grantee, acting in good faith, experiences delays
by reason of circumstances beyond its control, including failure of utility
companies to provide pole clearances and permits in a timely manner. (Ord. 2326
§ 1 (part), 1980).

adjustment in the amounts requested by grantee, provided that:
         a.    The amount of such rate adjustment divided by the current
subscriber rates shall not exceed seventy-five percent of the total percentage

   The City Council finds and declares as follows:
   A.   The permit requirements and restrictions imposed by this chapter are
reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens
of the City.
   B.   The City is authorized, by virtue of the Constitution of the State of
California, and Section 51031 of the California Government Code, to regulate
massage establishments by imposing reasonable standards relative to the skill
and experience of massage operators and massage technicians and imposing
reasonable conditions on the operation of the massage establishment.
   C.   There is a significant risk of injury to massage clients by improperly
trained and/or educated massage technicians and this chapter provides
reasonable safeguards against injury and economic loss.
   D.   There is opportunity for acts of prostitution and other unlawful sexual
activity to occur in massage establishments. Courts have long recognized
massage as a pervasively regulated activity and that massage establishments are
often brothels in disguise. The establishment of reasonable standards for
issuance of permits and restrictions on operations would serve to reduce the
risk of illegal activity.
   E.   The restrictions and requirements contained in this chapter are
intended to reduce the burden of massage establishment regulation on the Police
Department.
   F.   The regulations and restrictions contained in this chapter are intended
to discourage massage establishments from degenerating into houses of
prostitution and the means utilized in this chapter bear a reasonable and
rational relationship to the goals sought to be achieved. (Ord. 2967 § 1
(part), 2000).

and used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining any evidence given in
direct examination, but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding
unless such testimony would be admissible over objection in civil actions. The

states that such peddler is a person of good moral character and is acting as a
distributor or peddler for, or under the sponsorship, authority or direction
of, the issuer of such certificate, provided that such certificate is exhibited
upon request to any police officer or other person upon request therefor. Nor

under a valid license issued to him by any agency of the State of California
authorizing him to peddle or distribute anything as an incident to an
occupation regulated by State law, provided that such license is exhibited upon

   No such permit shall be issued to any person who, according to his
application or the investigation made pursuant to this chapter, is deemed by
the Chief of Police reasonably probable to have any propensity toward theft,
embezzlement, falsification or misrepresentation or to be a person who is not
law abiding or of good moral character or a person who is not then, and for one
year thereafter reasonably probable to be, available to be contacted by law
officers and by process servers for the service of process in any action
brought by any person paying money to such applicant upon any transaction
described in this chapter or is reasonably probable to receive advance payments
described in this chapter which will total, as to all items of merchandise not
delivered, services not performed and labor and materials not furnished, an
amount in excess of one-half of the net worth of the applicant over and above
all liabilities and exempt property; provided however that the applicant may
remove the objection to his not being available for the service of process, by
executing and filing with the Chief of Police a written authorization
designating him as the agent of the applicant to accept the personal service of
process in any civil action involving the return of the advance payment made to
the applicant upon any transaction described in this chapter and provided

except as authorized by such permit. A person who gives false information in

does not impair the good moral character of the applicant. (Ord. 1845 § 2
(part), 1972).
3.40.070   Permits not transferable.

person or of good moral character. (Ord. 1845 § 2 (part), 1972).
3.40.090   Appeal.
   Upon any permit required by this chapter being refused or revoked by the
Chief of Police, the applicant or permittee may, within fifteen days after
notice thereof has been sent by certified mail, addressed to him at his address
shown on his application, or otherwise on file with the Chief of Police, file a

hearing by him to review such action. He shall set such hearing within thirty
days from his receipt of any such request and send by certified mail addressed

and shall exhaust the administrative remedy of the applicant or permittee for
any such refusal or revocation of such permit. If such decision is that the
issuance of such permit to the applicant is not prohibited by Section
3.40.060 of this chapter, but is thereby required to be issued, the City
Administrator shall direct the Chief of Police to issue or reinstate such
permit and he shall do so forthwith. If such decision is that the issuance of
such permit to the applicant is prohibited by Section
3.40.060 of this chapter, the City Administrator shall affirm the denial or
revocation of such permit. A copy of any decision by the City Administrator
hereunder shall be sent by him by certified mail addressed to the person who
requested such review at the address shown therein. (Ord. 1845 § 2 (part),

Administrator removed within such time. (Ord. 1845 § 2 (part), 1972).

person has accepted an advance payment upon any transaction described in this
chapter, in the city, not in the presence of such officer, without a permit for
him to do so as required by this chapter, such police officer shall proceed by
a criminal complaint to charge such person with such violation and carry such
charge to a final disposition by the court.

   B.   Annual. All annual business taxes due and payable under the provisions
of this title shall be for a period of one year and shall expire at 12:01 a.m.
on the first day of the same month of the year succeeding issuance or, if
applicable, at 12:01 a.m. on the first day of the same month of the year
succeeding the original due date except where otherwise specifically
hereinafter provided.
   C.   Gross Receipts or Personnel Basis. The first annual business tax on the
gross receipts or personnel basis shall be based on the minimum rate herein
prescribed and such sum shall be payable in advance upon application for an
original registration certificate. The amount of the tax for each succeeding
business tax year shall be ascertained by applying the total gross receipts or
personnel figure for the previous business tax year to the applicable tax
schedule under classification "A," "B" or "C" of Section
4.06.020 of this title.
   D.   Gross Receipts or Personnel Statement. Not later than the last day of
the same month in which the business tax is due, the statement required under
Section
4.02.130 of this chapter shall be submitted and the full amount due and payable
shall accompany the return or statement. No registration certificate shall be
issued until the amount so determined to be due and payable has been paid in
full.
   E.   Daily. Daily business taxes herein prescribed shall be payable in
advance. No registration certificate shall be issued until the amount due and
payable has been paid in full. (Ord. 2913 § 1, 1997; Ord. 2170 §§ 1, 2, 1977;
Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.060   Penalties for failure to pay tax when due.
   For failure to pay a business tax when due, the Collector shall add a
penalty of ten percent of said business tax on the last day of the same month
in which the business tax first became delinquent, and an additional ten
percent penalty on the last day of each month that such delinquency continues
thereafter, providing that the amount of such penalty to be added shall in no
event exceed one hundred percent of the amount of the business tax due.
   Whenever any payment, statement, return, report, request or other
communication is received by the Collector after the time prescribed in this
title for the receipt thereof, but is in an envelope bearing a postmark showing
that it was mailed prior to the time prescribed in this title for the receipt
thereof, the Collector may regard such payment, statement, return, report,
request or other communication as having been timely received. (Ord. 2062 § 2
(part), 1975).
4.02.070   Extension of time -- Compromise of claims.
   In addition to all other power conferred upon him, the Collector shall have
the power, for good cause shown, to extend the time for filing any required
sworn statement and tax resulting therefrom for a period not exceeding thirty
days, and in such case to waive any penalty that would otherwise have accrued;
and shall have the further power, with the consent of the City Council, to
compromise any claim as to amount of business tax due. (Ord. 2062 § 2 (part),
1975).
4.02.080   Minor errors in payments.
   In the event a discrepancy exists between the amount of tax paid and the
amount of tax due under this title, resulting in any underpayment or
overpayment of the tax in an amount of five dollars or less, the Collector may
accept and record such underpayment or overpayment without other notification
to the taxpayer. (Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.085   Rules and regulations -- Apportionment.
   The Collector may make such rules and regulations as are not inconsistent
with the provisions of this title as may be necessary or desirable to aid in
the enforcement of the provisions of this title. When, by reason of the
provisions of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of
California, the business tax imposed by the provisions of this title cannot be
enforced without there being an apportionment according to the amount of
business done in the City of Fullerton, or in the state of California, as the
case may be, the Collector may make such rules and regulations for the
apportionment of the tax as are necessary or desirable to overcome the
constitutional objections. Such rules and regulations shall be approved by the
City Attorney prior to becoming effective. (Ord. 2170 § 3, 1977).
4.02.090   Application for registration certificate -- Information required.
   Before any registration certificate is issued to any person, unless
otherwise provided in this code, a written application by the applicant shall
be made to the Collector together with payment of the prescribed business tax.
Such application shall contain the following information:
   A.    The exact nature or kind of business, profession, show, exhibition,
game, occupation or enterprise for which the registration certificate is
requested;
   B.    The place where such business, profession, show, exhibition, game,
occupation or enterprise is to be carried on, and if the same is not to be
carried on at any permanent place of business, the places of residence of the
owners of the same;
   C.    Any further information which the Collector may require to enable him
to issue the type of registration certificate applied for;
   D.    In the event that application is made for the issuance of a
registration certificate to a person doing business under a fictitious name,
the application shall set forth the names and places of residence of those
owning said business, profession, show, exhibition, game, occupation or
enterprise. (Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.095   Application processing charge.
   A minimum charge is required for the processing of any initial or renewed
license application in such amount as does not exceed the reasonable cost to
the City of processing each such application. This charge shall be in addition
to the business license tax and shall not be prorated. The charge shall not be
refunded if the application is rejected. However, if after receipt of the
applicant's written notification of cancellation and no business activity has
been transacted or carried on, then in that event, a refund request for all
fees paid exceeding the application processing charge may be made pursuant to
Section
4.02.200. In no event, however, shall the application processing charge be
refunded. The Collector may waive the processing charge in the case of bona
fide nonprofit, charitable, or otherwise fee-exempt licensee.
   The provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, the following application
categories shall pay an application processing charge in an amount established
by resolution of the City Council:
   A.    Initial period application processing charge;
   B.    Renewal application charge;
   C.    Amended application processing charge. (Ord. 2764 § 1, 1991).
4.02.100   Form and contents of registration certificate.
   All registration certificates, unless otherwise provided in this code, shall
be prepared and issued by the Collector upon the payment to him of the sum
required to be paid hereunder. Each registration certificate so issued shall
state upon the face thereof the following:
   A.    The persons to whom the same is issued;
    B.    The kind of business, profession, show, exhibition, game, occupation
or enterprise holding a registration certificate, and the location of the same;
   C.    The business name;
   D.    The date of issuance of such registration certificate.
   In no case shall any mistake of the Collector in stating the amount of a
business tax prevent or prejudice the collection by the City of what should be
actually due from any person carrying on any business, profession, show,
exhibition, game, occupation or enterprise subject to said tax under the
provisions of this title. (Ord. 2913 § 2, 1997; Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.110   Error in registration certificate does not waive rights or excuse
compliance.
   In no case shall any error made by the Collector or any deputy of the
Collector in preparing a registration certificate, stating the amount of the
tax thereof, or determining the proper zone, prejudice the collection by the
City of the amount actually due under this title for the carrying on of any
business, trade, occupation, nor shall the issuance of a registration
certificate by the Collector or said deputy authorize the carrying on of any
business, trade or occupation in any zone or location contrary to the
provisions of the zoning ordinance of the City now in effect or which may
hereafter be adopted. (Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.120   Failure to file statement or corrected statement.
   If any person fails to file any required statement within the time
prescribed, or if after demand therefor made by the Collector, he fails to file
a corrected statement, the Collector may determine the amount of business tax
due from such person by means of such information as he may be able to obtain.
   If such a determination is made, the Collector shall give a notice of the
amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United
States Post Office at Fullerton, California, postage prepaid, addressed to the
person so assessed at his last known address. Such person may, within fifteen
days after the mailing or serving of such notice, make application in writing
to the Collector for a hearing on the amount of the business tax. If such
application is made, the Collector shall cause the matter to be set for hearing
within thirty days before the City Council. The Collector shall give at least
ten days' notice to such person of the time and place of hearing in the manner
prescribed above for serving notices of assessment. The City Council shall
consider all evidence produced, and shall make findings thereon, which shall be
final. Notice of such finding shall be served upon the applicant in the manner
prescribed above for serving notices of assessment. (Ord. 2062 § 2 (part),
1975).
4.02.130   Statement of gross receipts or personnel and affidavit.
   In all cases where the business tax is based upon gross receipts or
personnel, the person subject to the business tax shall submit to the Collector
for his guidance in ascertaining the amount of the business tax to be paid by
such person, a written statement, upon a form to be provided by the Collector,
written under penalty of perjury, or sworn to before a person authorized to
administer oaths setting forth such information concerning the taxpayer's
business during the preceding year as may be required by the Collector to
enable him to ascertain the amount of the business tax to be paid by such
person pursuant to the provisions of this title. (Ord. 2170 § 4, 1977: Ord.
2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.140   Statements not conclusive.
   A.   No statement shall be conclusive as to the matters set forth herein,
nor shall the filing of the same preclude the City from collecting by
appropriate action such sum as is actually due and payable hereunder.
      1.   The collector, his deputies or authorized employees or agents of the
City has the authority to examine by audit and any other accepted accounting
process the records and practices of any place of business in the City to
ascertain whether the provisions of the chapter have been complied with.
      2.   A business that misstates its gross receipts or basis for tax
liability may be liable for the City's actual costs to conduct the audit
irrespective of whether the understatement results in any change in the tax
due. Recoverable costs shall include the costs paid to an auditor or audit
recovery service, or the salary and overhead of City staff auditors performing
the audit. Penalties shall be due on the underreported revenue or tax
deficiency from the date the amount was due until it is paid, as defined by the
penalty provisions of this chapter.
      3.   Upon 30 days written notice, all persons engaged in business in the
City of Fullerton are required to permit the examination of all books and
records that the City may deem necessary in order to conduct the audit. The
information furnished or secured pursuant to this section, Section
4.02.090, or Section
4.02.130 of this chapter shall be confidential, provided that nothing in this
subsection shall be construed to prevent the disclosure of such information to,
or the examination of such records by, any official of another governmental
agency while acting in his official capacity, or to a grand jury or court of
law, upon subpoena; provided further, that nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to prevent the disclosure to any member of the public requesting it,
such information as the business name, real name, business address and type of
business of any person possessing a valid registration certificate. Any
unauthorized disclosure or use of such information by any officer or employee
of the City of Fullerton shall constitute a misdemeanor and such officer or
employee shall be subject to the penalty provisions of this chapter, in
addition to any other penalties provided by law.
      4.   If any person fails to furnish any information or records required
by this chapter upon demand by the Director of Administrative Services,
authorized personnel or agent, the Director of Administrative Services,
authorized personnel or agent may issue a subpoena demanding that such person
supply the requested information or records. The subpoena shall specifically
identify the information or records sought, and indicate the place, date and
time at which the information or records must be presented. If any person fails
to comply with a regularly issued subpoena, the Director of Administrative
Services, authorized personnel, or agent may apply to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction for any order requiring compliance with the subpoena.
   B.   Whenever charges are not paid within a reasonable time following
demand, the Director of Administrative Services and the City Attorney, as
applicable, are authorized to prosecute the claim to judgment in an appropriate
court with jurisdiction and to take any other action appropriate for collection
without further direction from the City Council after demand has been refused.
The City Council shall be notified when litigation is initiated.
   C.   The City Attorney is authorized to collect any amounts due by civil or
administrative action, or both, together with all costs incurred in the
collection of that indebtedness after demand for payment has been refused.
Costs for legal services shall be based on actual billings for legal services.
(Ord. 3098 § 2, 2007; Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.150   Exemptions.
   A.    Charitable, Religious and Nonprofit Organizations. The provisions of
this title shall not be deemed or construed to require the payment of a
business tax or the procurement of a registration certificate to conduct,
manage, or carry on any business, occupation, or activity from any institution,
organization or association which is conducted, managed or carried on wholly
for the benefit of charitable or religious purposes; nor shall any registration
certificate or business tax be required for the conducting of any

literary, religious, or moral subjects within the City whenever a percentage of
the receipts of any such entertainment, concert, exhibition or lecture are to
be appropriated to any church or school or to any religious or benevolent
purposes; nor shall the procurement of a registration certificate or the
payment of a business tax be required by any business having a contract for a
casual appearance for any religious, charitable, fraternal, educational,
military, State, County, or municipal organization or association for the

or lecture whenever a percentage of the profits from said business are to be
appropriated for the purposes and objects for which said organization or
association was formed; nor shall the procurement of a registration certificate
or the payment of a business tax be required by any person engaged in managing,
conducting or carrying on the business of maintaining any vending, weighing or
merchandise machine or device when said person has a contract with a

religious or nonprofit organization receives a percentage of the profits from
said business; provided, however, that any person claiming an exemption
pursuant to this subsection may be required to furnish to the Collector a

      1.   Articles of incorporation (or bylaws if an unincorporated
association or organization);
      2.   Determination letter from the United States Treasury Department

less persons.
   C.   Discharged Servicemen. The provisions of this title shall not be deemed
or construed to apply to any honorably discharged soldier, sailor, marine or
airman of the United States, peddling, hawking or vending any goods permitted
by law; provided, that nothing in the subsection shall be deemed to exempt any
such person from complying with any of the regulatory measures or provisions of
this code.
   D. Federal or State Law. Nothing in this title shall be deemed or construed
to apply to any person transacting and carrying on any business exempt by
virtue of the Constitution or applicable statutes of the United States or of
the State of California from the payment of such taxes or the procurement of
such registration certificates as are herein prescribed.
   E.   Repealed by Ord. 2766
   F.   Public Utilities. There is exempted from the provisions of this title
any public utility operating in the city under a franchise or franchises from
the City and which make franchise payments thereunder to the City.
   G.   Solicitation of Business. No business tax is imposed upon any act of
soliciting any business transaction by any peddler, solicitor, canvasser or
other person, including any attempt to sell, or take orders for, any real or
personal property or any service. If any business, trade, profession, calling,
or occupation is transacted or carried on in the city by any peddler,
solicitor, canvasser, or other person under an employment or other contract on
behalf, or for the benefit, of any person who has paid the business tax imposed
by the City of Fullerton for such activity, such peddler, solicitor, canvasser,
or other person under an employment or other contract on behalf, or for the
benefit, of any person who has paid the business tax imposed by the City of
Fullerton for such activity, such peddler, solicitor, canvasser or other person
shall not be required to pay any separate business tax for so transacting such
business of such taxpayer, otherwise no peddler, solicitor, canvasser or other
person shall fail to pay the business tax imposed by this title before making
any sale of, or taking any order for, any real or personal property or service
or otherwise transacting or carrying on any business in the City of Fullerton;
provided, however that nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to exempt any
such person from complying with any of the regulatory measures or provisions of
this Code.
   H.   Activities conducted pursuant to a permit obtained in accordance with
Chapter 3.80 (Filming Rules and Regulations). (Ord. 3250, § 1, 2017; Ord. 2766
§ 1, 1991; Ord. 2205 § 1, 1978; Ord. 2170 § 5, 1977; Ord. 2062 § 2 (part),
1975).
4.02.160   Branch establishments or two or more businesses.
   Every person who engages in any business within this City which is subject
to tax under the provisions of this title shall be deemed to be engaged in a
separate business at each branch establishment or location at which he engages
in business and must obtain a separate registration certificate and pay a
separate business tax for each classification of business engaged in at each
location or branch establishment in the City at which or from which the
business activities classified and subject to tax under the provisions of this
title are carried on. Each registration certificate so obtained and the payment
of the applicable tax for each such classification of business at each such
location shall authorize the person named upon the certificate to engage only
in the business specified at the location for which the certificate has been
issued; provided that where business is engaged in from one or more locations
outside the City, only one registration certificate for each classification of
business need be issued to the person for engaging in that business in the City
from all such outside locations; provided further, that warehouses and
distributing plants located in the City used in connection with and incidental
to a business for which a registration certificate has been issued to an
address located within the City shall not be deemed to be branch establishments
or separate locations; provided, however, that any person conducting two or
more types of businesses at the same location may, at his option, in lieu of
paying a separate business tax and obtaining separate registration certificates
as otherwise provided in this section, combine the activities of all such
businesses and pay a combined business tax calculated under the schedule that
applies to the principal business being so conducted and obtain a single
registration certificate for all such businesses. (Ord. 2170 § 6, 1977: Ord.
2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.170   Keeping registration certificates.
   Every person engaged in a business subject to tax under the provisions of
this title and which business is conducted at or from a fixed place of business
in the City shall keep the registration certificate issued in a safe place upon
the premises at or from which the business is conducted. (Ord. 2913 § 3, 1997:
Ord. 2062 § 2 (part) 1975).
4.02.180   Tax cumulative.
   Persons required to pay a business tax for transacting and carrying on any
business under this title shall not be relieved from the payment of any other
tax imposed by other provisions of this Code for the privilege of doing such
business. (Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.190   Interstate commerce.
   A.    Adjustment or Exemption. None of the business taxes provided for by
this title shall be so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate
commerce. In any case where a business tax is believed by a person subject to
the business tax provisions of this section to place an undue burden upon such
commerce, he may apply to the Business Collector for an adjustment of the tax
so that it shall not be discriminatory or unreasonable as to such commerce.
Such application may be made before, at, or within six months after payment of
the prescribed business tax. The taxpayer shall, by affidavit and supporting
testimony, show his method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross
volume of business and such other information as the Collector may deem
necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden on
such commerce. The Collector shall then conduct an investigation, and, after
having first obtained the written approval of the City Attorney, shall fix as
the business tax for the taxpayer, an amount that is reasonable and
nondiscriminatory, or if the business tax has already been paid, shall order a
refund of the amount over and above the business tax so fixed. In fixing the
business tax to be charged, the Collector shall have the power to base the
business tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which
will assure that the business tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed
on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed
the business tax as prescribed by this title. Should the Collector determine
the gross receipts measure of business tax to be the proper basis, he may
require the taxpayer to submit, either at the time of termination of such
person's business in the city, or upon the expiration of such person's City
registration certificate, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the
amount of business tax therefor, provided that no additional business tax
during any one business tax period shall be required after the taxpayer shall
have paid an amount equal to the annual business tax as prescribed in this
title.
   B.    Affidavit. Any person claiming an exemption pursuant to this section
shall file a verified statement with the Collector stating the facts upon which
exemption is claimed. (Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.200   Refunds.
   Refunds of business taxes collected shall be made only when the Collector
erroneously collects a business tax not required to be paid hereunder;
provided, that application for such refund is made within three years after the
date of payment. (Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.210   Misrepresentation.
   No person shall knowingly or intentionally misrepresent to any officer or
employee of the City any material fact in procuring the registration
certificates provided for in this title. (Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.220   Registration certificate does not permit business otherwise
prohibited.
   The payment of a business tax required by the provisions of this title, and
its acceptance by the City and the issuance of a registration certificate to
any person shall not entitle the holder thereof to carry on any business unless
he has complied with all the requirements of this Code and all other applicable
laws, nor to carry on any business in any building or on any premises
designated in such registration certificate in the event such building or
premises are situated in a zone, or locality in which the conduct of such
business is in violation of any law. (Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.230   Duplicate registration certificate.
   A duplicate registration certificate may be issued by the Collector to
replace any registration certificate previously issued hereunder which has been
lost or destroyed upon the taxpayer filing statement of such fact, and at the
time of filing such statement paying to the Collector a duplicate registration
certificate fee in an amount established by resolution of the City Council;
provided however, that a duplicate registration certificate may be issued,
without payment of any additional fee, by the Collector to replace any
registration certificate previously issued hereunder which has been lost after
having been deposited in the United States mail upon the taxpayer declaring
within ninety days thereafter that such registration certificate was never
received. (Ord. 2765 § 1, 1991: Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.250   Transfer of registration certificate.
   A.    Where a registration certificate is issued to a person to transact and
carry on business at a particular place and such business is or is to be moved
to some other location, such person shall upon changing the business location
make an application to the Collector and pay a fee in an amount established by
resolution of the City Council to have the registration certificate amended to
reflect the change of location.
   B.    Where a person, holding a registration certificate issued under the
provisions of this chapter, changes the name of the business, such person shall
upon changing the name make an application to the Collector and pay a fee in an
amount established by resolution of the City Council to reflect the change in
name.
   C.    Where the business taxed is transferred to another person under such
circumstances that the real or ultimate ownership of the business after the
transfer is substantially similar to the real or ultimate ownership existing
before the transfer, such person shall make an application to the Collector and
pay a fee in an amount established by resolution of the City Council to have
the registration certificate amended to reflect the real or ultimate ownership
of the business after such transfer. (Ord. 2765 § 2, 1991: Ord. 2062 § 2
(part), 1975).
4.02.260   Appeals.
   Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Collector or of any other
officer of the City made pursuant to the provisions of this title may appeal
therefrom to the City Council within fifteen days after notice thereof, by
filing with the City Clerk a written notice of appeal, briefly stating in such
notice the grounds relied upon for appeal. If such appeal is made within the
time prescribed, the City Clerk shall cause the matter to be set for hearing
before the City Council to be held within thirty days from the date of receipt
of such notice of appeal, giving the appellant not less than ten days' notice
in writing of the time and place of hearing by serving it personally or by
depositing it in the United States Post Office at Fullerton, California,
postage prepaid, addressed to such person at his last known address. The
findings and determination of the City Council at such hearing shall be final
and conclusive, and within three days after such findings and determination are
made, the City Clerk shall give notice thereof to the appellant.
   In the event no appeal is taken by the person aggrieved, the decision of the
Collector shall become final and conclusive on expiration of the time herein
fixed for appeal. (Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.270   Enforcement.
   It shall be the duty of the Collector, and he is directed to enforce each
and all of the provisions of this title, and the Chief of Police shall render
such assistance in the enforcement hereof as may from time to time be required
by the Collector or the City Council. The Collector in the exercise of the
duties imposed upon him hereunder and acting through his deputies or duly
authorized assistants, shall examine or cause to be examined all places of
business in the City to ascertain whether the provisions of this title have
been complied with.
   The Collector and each and all of his assistants and any police officer
shall have the power and authority to enter free of charge and at any
reasonable time any place of business required to be registered and taxed by
the provisions of this title, and demand an exhibition of its registration
certificate. Any person having such registration certificate theretofore
issued, in his possession or under his control, who wilfully fails to exhibit
the same on demand, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to the
penalties provided for by the provisions of this title. It shall be the duty of
the Collector and each of his assistants to cause a complaint to be filed
against any and all persons found to be violating any of said provisions. (Ord.
2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
 4.02.280   Savings clause.
   Neither the adoption of this title nor its superseding of any portion of any
other ordinance of the City shall in any manner be construed to affect
prosecution for violation of any other ordinance committed prior to the
effective date hereon, nor be construed as a waiver of any tax or any penal
provision applicable to any such violation, nor be construed to affect the
validity of any bond or cash deposit required by any ordinance to be posted,
filed, or deposited, and all rights and obligations thereunto appertaining
shall continue in full force and effect. (Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.290   Severability.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
title is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision
of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions of this title. The City Council declares
that it would have adopted this title and each section, subsection, sentence,
clause, phrase or portion thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or
more sections, subsections, clauses, phrases, or portions be declared invalid
or unconstitutional. (Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).
4.02.300   Violations of this title a misdemeanor.
   It is unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this title. Any person violating any of the
provisions or failing to comply with any of the mandatory requirements of this
title shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person convicted of a misdemeanor
under the provisions of this title, unless provision is otherwise herein made,
shall be punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or by
imprisonment in the County jail for a period of not more than six months, or by
both such fine and imprisonment. Each such person shall be guilty of a separate
offense for each and every day during any portion of which any violation of any
provision of this title is committed, continued or permitted by such person,
and shall be punishable accordingly. (Ord. 2062 § 2 (part), 1975).

   C.    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and
provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State

to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in

manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part

collecting City sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of
record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this
chapter. (Ord. 1931 § 2 (part), 1973).
4.80.050   Contract with State.
   Prior to the operative date this City shall contract with the State Board of

from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject
to the State sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is

Taxation Code are adopted and made a part of this chapter as though fully set
forth herein. (Ord. 1931 § 2 (part), 1973).

when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or
against the City, or any agency thereof rather than by or against the State
Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the
administration or operation of this chapter; the substitution shall not be made
in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections
referring to the exterior boundaries of the state of California, where the
result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with

personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such
sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the State
under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code,

consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by

   This chapter shall be known as the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance
of the City of Fullerton. (Ord. 1369 (part), 1964).
4.92.020   Definitions.
   Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this
section govern the construction of this chapter:
   PERSON. The term “person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint
venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   HOTEL. The term “hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any
structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by
transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel,
inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house,
rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home
or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion
thereof.
   OCCUPANCY. The term “occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to
the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.
   TRANSIENT. The term “transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or
is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access,
license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or
less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so
occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period
of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the
operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In
determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time
extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may
be considered.
   RENT. The term “rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not
received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be
received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash,
credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction
therefrom whatsoever.
   OPERATOR. The term “operator” means the person who is proprietor of the
hotel or short-term rental, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee,
sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the
operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or
character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an
operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and
liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by
either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be
compliance by both.
   SHORT TERM RENTAL UNIT. The Term “Short-Term Rental Unit” means a permanent
dwelling or part of a permanent dwelling unit (single or multi-family) where
lodging is provided for compensation for fewer than thirty consecutive days and
can therefore be subject to applicable city land use regulations, permit/
licensing requirements, fees and taxes.
   TAX ADMINISTRATOR. The term “Tax Administrator” means the Director of
Finance. (Ord. 3290 § 2 (part), 2020; Ord. 1369 (part), 1964).
4.92.030   Tax imposed.
   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel or short-term rental, each
transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent of the
rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient
to the City which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the
City. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel or short-
term rental at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installations,
a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The
unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the
hotel or short-term rental. If for any reason the tax is not paid to the
operator of the hotel or short-term rental, the Tax Administrator may require
that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 3290 § 2
(part), 2020; Ord. 2667 § 1, 1989; Ord. 2477 § 1, 1983; Ord. 2226 § 1, 1978;
Ord. 1546 § 1; July 2, 1968: prior Ord. 1369 (part), 1964).
4.92.040   Exemptions.
   No tax shall be imposed upon:
   A.    Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the
power of the City to impose the tax herein provided;
   B.    Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by
reason of express provision of Federal law or international treaty.
   No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time
rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. (Ord. 2818, § 1, 1992; Ord. 1369 (part), 1964).
4.92.050   Operator's duties.
   Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same
extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The
amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged,
and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No
operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or
indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the
operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part
will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. (Ord. 1369 (part),
1964).
4.92.060   Registration.
   Within thirty days after commencing business each operator of any hotel or
short-term rental renting occupancy to transients shall register said use with
the Tax Administrator and obtain from him a transient occupancy registration
certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.
Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
   A.   The name of the operator;
   B.   The address of the hotel or short-term rental;
   C.   The date upon which the certificate was issued;
   D.   The words: “This transient occupancy registration certificate signifies
that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the
Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax
Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the transient
occupancy tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate
does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct
any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel or short-term
vacation rental without strictly complying with all local applicable laws,
including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board,
commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not
constitute a permit.” (Ord. 3290 § 2 (part), 2020; Ord. 1369 (part), 1964).
4.92.070   Reporting and remitting.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period
which may be established by the Tax Administrator, make a return to the Tax
Administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and
received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time
the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to
the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator may establish shorter reporting
periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure
collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return.
Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any
reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held
in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Tax
Administrator. (Ord. 1369 (part), 1964).
4.92.080   Penalties and interest.
   A.    ORIGINAL DELINQUENCY. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of
the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.
   B.    CONTINUED DELINQUENCY. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of
ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and
the ten percent penalty first imposed.
   C.    FRAUD. If the Tax Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five
percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the
penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section.
   D.    INTEREST. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails
to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-
half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax,
exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became
delinquent until paid.
   E.    PENALTIES MERGED WITH TAX. Every penalty imposed and such interest as
accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax
herein required to be paid. (Ord. 1369 (part), 1964).
4.92.090   Failure to collect and report tax.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make, within
the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed
in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to
base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator shall
procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base
the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator
who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and
remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the
tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such
determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount
so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known
place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or
mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for
a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing
is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if
any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax Administrator
shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed
herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice
why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest
and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why
such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such
hearing the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and
shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed
herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and
penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days
unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section
4.92.100. (Ord. 1369 (part), 1964).
4.92.100   Appeal.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Administrator with respect
to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within fifteen days of
the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Council shall fix a
time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in
writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of
the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the
appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any
amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of
notice. (Ord. 1369 (part), 1964).
4.92.110   Records.
   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment
to the City of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a
period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount
of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the
City, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at
all reasonable times. (Ord. 1369 (part), 1964).
4.92.120   Refunds.
   A.    WHEN MADE. Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has
been overpaid, or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally
collected or received by the City under this chapter it may be refunded as
provided in subsections B and C of this section provided a claim in writing
therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the
claim is founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator within three years of the
date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Tax
Administrator.
   B.    REFUND TO TRANSIENT. An operator may claim a refund or take as credit
against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once
or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a
manner prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax
has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a
refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected
has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently
payable by the transient to the operator.
   C.    TRANSIENT'S RECOURSE. A transient may obtain a refund of taxes
overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A
of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to
the Tax Administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the
operator establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that the
transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected
the tax.
   D.    WRITTEN RECORDS. No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this
section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records
showing entitlement thereto. (Ord. 1369 (part), 1964).
4.92.130   Actions to collect.
   Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provision of this
chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the City. Any such tax
collected by an operator which has not been paid to the City shall be deemed a
debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing money to the City under
the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name
of the City of Fullerton for the recovery of such amount. (Ord. 1369 (part),
1964).
4.92.140   Violations.
   Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required
herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses
to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the Tax
Administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty
of a misdemeanor, and is punishable as aforesaid. Any person required to make,
render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent
report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount
due required by this chapter to be made is guilty of a misdemeanor and is
punishable as aforesaid. (Ord. 1369 (part), 1964).

demolition.
   Any person who generates solid waste in connection with the construction of
a new building, a building addition, remodel, or the demolition of any
structure for which a building permit is required, shall either make
arrangements for solid waste handling service with the use of containers from a
franchisee, be registered to self-haul such solid waste in the manner set forth
herein, or make arrangements pursuant to Section
5.14.060(H)(3). In addition to constituting a violation of this Chapter,
failure to produce evidence of compliance with this Section upon the request of
a City building inspector, code enforcement officer or other City officer shall

work cease until compliance with this Section.
(Ord. 3309, 2021: Ord. 3127, § 1 (part), 2009).
5.14.080. Self-haulers.
   A.   Self-haulers who obtain a permit from City, and are operating in
accordance with this Chapter are only permitted to collect, transport and
dispose of solid waste generated by and upon the self-haulers own premises.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, self-haulers shall not
share, place solid waste in, or otherwise use the bin, cart, rolloff box, or
other container of another person or business.
   B.   Registration. All self-haulers must apply for and receive a permit to
operate as a self-hauler from the City and shall comply with the following:
      1.   Each self-hauler shall obtain a permit from the City Manager, and
such permit shall be renewed on an annual basis.
      2.   Each permit application, whether upon initial application or
renewal, shall include the following: (i) a list of all bins, carts, rolloff
boxes and other containers to be used by the self -hauler, (ii) a list of all
transport and disposal equipment to be used by the self-hauler, (iii) a written
explanation of where all solid waste will be delivered for disposal and
diversion; (iv) a written plan explaining to the reasonable satisfaction of the
City Manager how not less than fifty percent of solid waste collected will be
diverted from disposal in compliance with AB 939; (v) a written plan explaining
to the reasonable satisfaction of the City Manager how compliance with the
requirement to divert organic waste, in accordance with applicable laws
including 14 CCR, Div. 7, Chapter 12, Section 18988.3 will be achieved, and
(vi) any other information deemed necessary by the City Manager to ensure
protection of public health, safety and sanitary needs.
      3.   Permit renewal applications shall additionally include (i) receipts
from self-hauling activities undertaken in the prior year demonstrating that
the applicant has effectively diverted at least fifty percent of all solid
waste generated at its premises from landfills in a manner that complies with
the requirements of AB 939; (ii) records reasonably satisfactory to the City
Manager demonstrating the manner in which organic waste was diverted from
landfills in accordance with applicable laws including 14 CCR, Div. 7, Chapter
12, Section 18988.3 and (iii) receipts from self-hauling activities undertaken
in the prior year demonstrating that the applicant has delivered solid waste
generated at its premises to appropriate disposal or recycling facilities at
least as frequently as collection is required for such self-hauler by the City
Manager.
      4.   The City Manager shall approve the application, and issue a self-
hauler permit, if the application meets the requirements of this Section, and
if the equipment, containers, diversion plan and disposal plan meet with his
reasonable satisfaction, and if evidence of past diversion and disposal
requirements demonstrate the applicant has complied with the fifty-percent
diversion requirement and otherwise complied with all laws related to disposal,
recycling and diversion of solid waste, including without limitation the
diversion of organic waste.
   C.   Containers. Each self-hauler shall provide its own bins, carts, rolloff
boxes or other containers. Bins, carts, rolloff boxes or other containers
utilized by a self-hauler must conform to industry standards for solid waste
disposal, comply with all laws and regulations, and must be approved by the
City Manager in writing prior to issuance of a self-hauler permit. In addition,
any containers utilized by a self-hauler shall comply with the following
requirements:
      1.   All containers shall be maintained in good repair, and any question
as to the meaning of this standard shall be resolved by the City Manager;
      2.   All containers shall be maintained in a sealed, watertight
condition;
      3.   Self-haulers shall remove any graffiti that appears on containers
within twenty-four hours after becoming aware of it.
   D.   Collection and transport equipment. Collection and transport equipment,
including but not limited to transport trucks and vehicles, utilized by a self-
hauler must be approved by the City Manager in writing prior to issuance of a
self-hauler permit.
   E.   Non-commercial venture. It is the intent of this Chapter to prevent and
proscribe self-hauling activities undertaken as a commercial enterprise. Self-
haulers must obtain all equipment, including containers and collection and
transportation equipment, at a fair market value that does not include any
hauling services, "free" or otherwise. A self-hauler may utilize its own
employees to undertake self-hauling activities, but under no circumstance may a
self- hauler utilize an independent contractor or any other person or entity
for solid waste handling services other than a franchisee.
   F.   Other recycling obligations. Self-haulers shall recycle, or divert from
disposal, all recyclable materials not otherwise addressed by this Section to a
degree and in a manner consistent with standards generally applicable to the
solid waste industry and as required by State law or regulation.
   G.   Collection frequency. Self-haulers shall remove solid waste from their
premises at least once per week. However, upon application to the City Manager
to obtain (or renew) a self-hauler permit, the City Manager may determine a
different frequency for solid waste collection, transport and disposal from the
self-hauler's premises. This determination shall be based upon the nature of
the premises, the type of solid waste generated by the premises, and the
collection capacity of the self-hauler as demonstrated by information in the
application.
   H.   Hazardous and special wastes. Unless lawfully and currently licensed
under all applicable State, Federal and local laws, no self-hauler shall engage
in the collection, transport or disposal of hazardous waste or special wastes.
   I.   Revocation. The City Manager may revoke a self-hauler permit if the
permittee (i) fails to divert at least fifty percent of all solid waste
generated at its premises from landfills in a manner that complies with the
requirements of AB 939; (ii) fails to divert organic waste from disposal in
accordance with applicable laws including 14 CCR, Div. 7, Chapter 12, Section
18988. 3, (iii) fails to deliver solid waste generated at its premises to
appropriate disposal or recycling facilities at least as frequently as
collection is required for such self-hauler by the City Manager, or (iv) fails
to comply with the provisions of this Chapter or its permit. The City Manager
shall notify any permittee in writing of the decision to revoke its permit, and
the basis therefor, and the permittee may appeal any such decision within 15
days of the date of such notice being issued by requesting an administrative
hearing in the same manner applicable to administrative citations set forth in
Chapter 1.10. of this Code.
(Ord. 3309, 2021: Ord. 3127, § 1 (part), 2009).
5.14.090. Removal of unauthorized containers.
   In addition to any other penalties and/or remedies as set forth in this
Chapter or provided for by law, any container placed within the City for the
collection of solid waste in violation of Section
5.14.060(H) (hereinafter "Unauthorized Container(s)") may be impounded as set
forth herein.
   A.   The City Manager may cause a notice to be placed in a conspicuous place
on any unauthorized container directing that it be removed. The notice shall
specify the nature of the violation and shall state that the bin, drop-off box,
trailer or waste receptacle must be removed within twenty-four hours or it may
be removed and stored by the City, and the contents disposed of, at the expense
of the owner thereof. The notice shall indicate the time that it was posted and
shall include the name and phone number of a person designated by the City to
hear any appeal or challenge to the requirement that the container be removed,
and, further, shall indicate that any appeal of the order for removal must
occur within twenty-four hours of the posting of the notice. The posting of a
notice to remove shall constitute constructive notice to the owner and user of
the requirement to remove the unauthorized container, and a copy of the notice
shall be provided to owner of the unauthorized container once said owner’s
identity is ascertained by City, and if not provided sooner, a copy of the
notice shall be provided at such time as the owner of the unauthorized
container seeks to retrieve any such container removed hereunder.
   B.   If within twenty-four hours after a notice to remove is posted on an
unauthorized container a request for an appeal has not been received and the
bin, drop-off box, trailer or waste receptacle is not removed, the City Manager
may direct the removal and storage of the unauthorized container. In addition,
if the contents of the container are either comprised of a substantial amount
of putrescible solid waste, or determined by the City Manager to create a
threat to health and safety if not disposed of immediately, the City Manager
may direct that the contents of the container be disposed of. The owner of the
unauthorized container shall be responsible to reimburse the City for the
actual cost of removal, storage and disposal. All amounts due to the City for
the cost of removal, storage and disposal must be paid before the unauthorized
container may be returned to the owner. Such amounts shall constitute a debt
owed by the owner to the City, and the owner shall be liable to the City in an
action brought by the City for the recovery of such amounts.
   C.   Between the date following the date upon which any unauthorized
container is removed by the City, and the date which is five business days
following its retrieval from City, the owner of the unauthorized container may
request a hearing to appeal the City's determination that the container is an
unauthorized container subject to removal by City as set forth herein. The City
Manager shall establish a procedure for such a hearing and the method for
requesting such a hearing shall be included on the notice to remove. If the
appeal is granted, any payments due to City shall be forgiven and any amounts
paid reimbursed.
   D.   If the identity of the owner of an unauthorized container that has been
removed by the City is known to the City Manager, the City Manager shall
promptly cause a copy of the notice to be mailed to the owner along with a
request that the owner claim the stored property. If the unauthorized container
is not claimed within ninety-five days after mailing of the notice to the
owner, or ninety days after removal if the identity of the owner is unknown to
the City Manager, the unauthorized container and its contents shall be deemed
abandoned property and may be disposed of accordingly. The notice to be posted
on unauthorized containers shall specify that the foregoing procedure related
to abandonment will apply.
(Ord. 3309, 2021: Ord. 3127, § 1 (part), 2009).

12, or any of the provisions hereof which address such obligations, shall be
subject to the provisions of Chapter 1.10 of the City's municipal code related
to administrative citations, modified as follows:
      1.   Upon determining a violation has occurred, the City Manager or his
designee shall issue a notice of violation pursuant to 14 CCR, Div. 7, Ch. 12,
Section 18995.4, requiring compliance within 60 days of such notice.

proceeding; and (2) the award of attorneys' fees does not exceed the amount of
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the City in the action or proceeding.

value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite
plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance
creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for
rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general
welfare. Therefore the presence of an abandoned wrecked, dismantled or
inoperative vehicle or part thereof, on private or public property not

and removal of such vehicle, or part or parts thereof as a public nuisance.
Such statement shall include notice to the property owner that he may appear in
person at such hearing or may present a sworn written statement denying

A hearing shall be held before the City Manager upon a written request
therefore filed with the City Clerk by the owner of the vehicle or part or
parts thereof or by the owner of the land on which such vehicle or part or
parts thereof is located, within ten days after the mailing of the notice of
intention to abate and remove the vehicle or part or parts thereof as required
by this chapter. If the owner of the land on which the vehicle or part or parts
thereof is located files with the City Clerk, a sworn written statement denying
responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land within such time
period, his statement shall be construed as a request for a hearing by the City
Manager which does not require the presence of the owner submitting such
request. If no request for a hearing is received within such period, no hearing
shall be required and the Chief of Police shall have the authority to remove
the vehicle or part or parts thereof without further notice. Upon any such
request being so filed within such time period, the City Clerk shall set the
question of abatement and removal of the vehicle or part or parts thereof and
the assessment of the administrative costs and the cost of removal for a
hearing before the City Manager and mail, by certified mail, to the person
requesting such hearing a notice of the time and place thereof not less than

   All hearings under this chapter shall be held before the City Manager which
shall hear all facts and testimony it deems pertinent. The facts and testimony
may include testimony on the condition of the vehicle or part thereof and the
circumstances concerning its location on the private property or public
property. The City Manager shall not be limited by the technical rules of

statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle or part or
parts thereof on his land with his reasons for such denial. (Ord. 2505 § 1

without the consent of the land owner and that he has not subsequently
acquiesced in its presence, the City Manager shall not assess costs of
administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the
vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such land
owner. (Ord. 2505 § 1 (part), 1984: Ord. 1533 § 1 (part), 1968).
5.20.130   Notice of decision.

the vehicle or part or parts thereof and dispose of the same by delivery to a
scrap yard or automobile dismantler's yard. After a vehicle has been removed it
shall not thereafter be reconstructed or made operable. If the City Manager or
Chief of Police determines that commercial channels or disposition are not
available or are inadequate, it or he may dispose of such vehicle or part or
parts thereof by removal to any suitable site owned by the City. The City
Manager or Chief of Police may make final disposition of such vehicle or part
or parts thereof or may transfer the same in any manner provided by law or by
the City Manager. (Ord. 2505 § 1 (part), 1984: Ord. 1728 § 4, 1971, Ord. 1533 §
1 (part), 1968).

whether or not a nuisance, in fact, exists. If the Public Nuisance Hearing
Officer determines that no nuisance exists, the Director of Development
Services or his designee shall take no further action with respect to the
subject property unless such action is taken with respect to a new or
additional violation(s).
   If the Public Nuisance Hearing Officer determines that a nuisance exists,
the Public Nuisance Hearing Officer shall order the nuisance removed and abated
by the owner and/or occupant within a reasonable period of time, and may
further recommend to the City Attorney that he seek a court order from a court
of competent jurisdiction to abate the nuisance if it is not timely abated by
the owner and/or occupant. The owner of record of the property and/or occupant
may appear in person at the hearing or present a written statement to be
considered at the hearing. Such hearings will be public hearings and the
decision of the Public Nuisance Hearing Officer shall be appealable to the
Planning Commission sitting as the Appeals Board.
   B.   At the conclusion of the hearing, if the Public Nuisance Hearing
Officer determines that a public nuisance exists, he shall adopt findings

a detailed list of needed corrections and suggested abatement methods. Any
property and/or occupant shall have the right to have such premises
rehabilitated or to have such buildings or structures demolished or repaired in
accordance with said findings and order, at his own expense, provided the same

commence upon the date the findings and order are served upon the owner and/or
occupant. The proceedings hereunder shall terminate upon the abatement of the
nuisance in full by the owner or occupant.
   B.   Where an appeal is filed, as provided in this chapter, the order of
abatement issued by the Public Nuisance Hearing Officer shall be suspended
pending the review of the determination by the Appeals Board in the manner set

   C.   The Director of Development Services shall set the matter for a de novo
hearing before the Appeals Board at a date and time not less than ten, nor more

of Development Services shall then notify the appellant, adjacent property
owners, and all others identified by previous process under Section

Board may, in its discretion, continue the hearing date when necessary. (Ord.

taken by the Public Nuisance Hearing Officer was in conformance with the
provisions of this chapter, it shall require the property owner and/or occupant
to comply with the Public Nuisance Officer's order of abatement within thirty
calendar days after the date of mailing of a copy of its order to the affected
property owner and/or occupant, unless a longer period of time to abate the
nuisance is specifically authorized by the Appeal Board's order.
   C.   If the nuisance is not abated within the thirty-day period, or within
such longer period as the Appeals Board may provide, the Director of
Development Services or his designee is expressly authorized and directed to
obtain the proper legal authorization to enter upon the premises for the
purpose of abating the nuisance, and/or request the City Attorney to file a
criminal complaint against the subject property owner and/or occupant. (Ord.

cost of abatement of a nuisance upon any lot or parcel of land shall constitute
a special assessment against the respective lot or parcel of land to which it
relates. After confirmation of the report, a copy thereof shall be transmitted
to the Orange County Auditor/Controller, whereupon it shall be the duty of the
Auditor/Controller to add the amounts of the assessment, or assessments, to the
next regular bills of taxes levied against the respective lots and parcels of
land for municipal purposes, and thereafter the amounts shall be collected at
the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected,
and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure for

NIGHTTIME CURFEW FOR MINORS

7.20.040   Defenses to curfew restrictions.
7.20.050   Enforcement.
7.20.060   Penalties.
7.20.010   Purpose.
   The provisions of this chapter are adopted in accordance with the authority
granted to the City under the police power delegated to it by the Constitution
of the State of California. Said police power provides the City with the
authority to react when the potential exists for jeopardy to the public health,
safety and general welfare of its citizens. The City is concerned with the
level of juvenile violence, juvenile gang activity and juvenile crime in the
City. The crimes being committed by juveniles include serious offenses such as
murders, drive-by shootings, drag-related crimes and other gang-related
activities. Moreover, juveniles are particularly susceptible by their lack of
maturity and experience to participate in unlawful and gang-related activities
and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime. In addition, recent local,
state and national statistics regarding juvenile crime and victimization
indicate that enforcement of a curfew for juveniles decreases the percentage of
juvenile victimi-zation and increases the number of arrests for violent crimes
during curfew hours. Based on the foregoing, the City believes that having an
enforceable juvenile curfew ordinance is critical to preserving the public
health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 2915 § 2 (part), 1997).

graffiti to create fear within the community and blight upon the landscape,
devaluing property and detracting from the sense of community enjoyed by

consent of the parent or other lawfully designated custodian of the person,

public and private nuisance, and may be abated according to the provisions and
procedures herein contained.

repairing the more extensive area. (Ord. 2833 (part), 1993).
7.31.100   Abatement and cost recovery proceedings.
   A.    Notice and Conduct of Due Process Hearing.
   The Director of Maintenance Services ("hearing officer") shall give not less
than forty-eight hours' notice, served in the same manner as summons in a civil
action in accordance with Article 3 (commencing with Section 415.10) of Chapter
4 of Title 5 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (If the owner of record,
after diligent search cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a
copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten days
and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in the
county in which the property is located pursuant to Section 6062) to the party
who is responsible for the maintenance of a parcel of property containing
graffiti ("property"), and, if a different person is the owner of record on the
parcel of land or which the nuisance is maintained, based on the last equalized
assessment roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is more current, then to
the owner also, of a "due process" hearing at which the responsible party shall
be entitled to present evidence and argue that his or her property does not
contain graffiti. The determination of the hearing officer after the due
process hearing shall be final and not appealable. If, after the due process
hearing, regardless of the attendance of the responsible party or his agent,
the hearing officer determines that the property contains graffiti, the hearing
officer shall give written notice ("eradication order") that, unless the
graffiti is removed within five days thereafter, the City shall enter upon the
property, cause the removal, painting over (in such color as shall meet with
the approval of the Maintenance Services Director) or such other eradication
thereof ("eradication effort") as the Maintenance Services Director determines
appropriate, and shall provide the responsible party thereafter with an
accounting of the costs of such eradication effort on a full cost recovery
basis.
   B.    Eradication Effort.
   Not sooner than the time specified in the order of the hearing officer, the
Maintenance Services Director or his designee shall implement the eradication
order, and shall provide an accounting to the responsible party of the costs
thereof ("eradication accounting").
   C.    Cost Hearing.
   If the responsible party fails to request a hearing before the hearing
officer on the eradication accounting ("cost hearing"), or, if requested, a
cost hearing is conducted after extending due process to the responsible party,
and after such a cost hearing, the hearing officer determines that all or a
portion of the costs are appropriately chargeable to the eradication effort,
the total amount set forth in the eradication accounting, or such amount
thereof determined as appropriate by the hearing officer, ("assessed
eradication charges") shall be due and payable by the responsible party within
thirty days.
   D.    Lien.
   If all or any portion of the assessed eradication charges remain unpaid
after thirty days, pursuant to the authority created by law, such portion
thereof as shall remain unpaid shall constitute and is declared to constitute a
lien on the property which was the subject matter of the eradication effort.
The Director of Maintenance Services shall present a resolution of lien to the
City Council, and upon passage and adoption thereof, shall cause a certified
copy thereof to be recorded with the Orange County Recorder's Office and with
the Orange County Auditor/Controller. The amount of such charges shall be
collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes.
If delinquent, the amount of such charges shall be subject to the same

ordinary municipal taxes. (Ord. 2833 (part), 1993).

or other similar land use entitlements, the City shall consider imposing any or
all related conditions at the public hearing required by law for approval of
the tentative map, conditional use permit, variance or other similar land use
entitlement. If approved:
   A.    Use of Anti-Graffiti Material.
   Developer shall apply an anti-graffiti material of a type and nature that is
acceptable to the Director of Maintenance Services to each of the publicly
viewable surfaces on the improvements to be constructed on the site deemed by
the Director of Maintenance Services to be likely to attract graffiti
("graffiti-attracting surfaces");
   B.    Right of Access to Remove Graffiti.
   Developer shall grant, prior to resale of any of the parcels which are
within the territory of the map, the right of entry over and access to such
parcels upon forty-eight hours of posting of notice by authorized city
employees or agents to the City for the purpose of removing or "painting over"
graffiti from graffiti-attracting surfaces previously designated by the
Director, and the right to remove such graffiti; and,
   C.    Supply City with Graffiti-Removal Material.
   Developer shall, for a period of two years after the resale of his or her
final lot, provide the City with sufficient matching paint and/or anti-graffiti
material on demand for use in the painting over or removal of designated
graffiti-attracting surfaces;

be for the benefit of the City, in a form satisfactory to the City, that the
owner of the lots shall immediately remove any graffiti placed thereon. (Ord.
2833 (part), 1993).

lot, with such features or qualities as may be established by the City as
necessary to reduce the attractiveness of the surface for graffiti, or as
necessary to permit more convenient or efficient removal thereof.
   B.   The owner of property on which is located a surface of a structure
other than residential which has been defaced with graffiti after removal more
than five times in six months, or the immediate area surrounding the surface,
shall permit the City to enter upon and make such modifications thereto, at
City's cost, which modifications shall include such features or qualities as
may be established by the City as necessary to reduce the attractiveness of the
surface for graffiti, or as necessary to permit more convenient or efficient
removal thereof. (Ord. 2833 (part), 1993).
7.31.140   Parental civil liability.
   Any parent or legal guardian whose child under the age of eighteen possesses
a Graffiti Implement, shall be personally liable for any and all costs to any

costs incurred in connection with the civil prosecution of any claim for
damages. (Ord. 2833 (part), 1993).

license issued under this chapter shall authorize the holder thereof to conduct
bingo games only on such property, the address of which is stated in the
application. In the event the described property ceases to be used as an office
and as a place for performance of the purposes for which the licensee is
organized, the license shall have no further force or effect. A new license may
be obtained by an eligible organization, upon application under this chapter,
when it again owns or leases property used by it for an office or for

thereof in the United States mail. Said notice shall state the grounds for such
revocation.

be obtained by an eligible organization, upon application under this chapter,
when it again owns or leases property used by it for an office or for
performance of the purposes for which the organization is organized.
   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require that the property
owned or leased by the licensee be used or leased exclusively by such licensee;
provided, however, that said property shall in no event be used for the conduct
of bingo games more often than one day out of any seven-day period, not more
than six hours out of each such day, regardless of the total number of
licensees utilizing said property. (Ord. 2576 § 2 (part), 1986; Ord. 2340 § 1

7.35.240   Days and hours of operation.
   A licensee may conduct bingo games on not more than one day during any
seven-day period. This limitation shall preclude a licensee from conducting
bingo games at the location authorized pursuant to the license where such
licensee has conducted bingo games on one or more days during said seven-day
period at any other location or locations within the county pursuant to any
other license or licenses issued by any other city in the county, or by the
County. Once during each calendar year, the Chief of Police may permit a
licensee to conduct bingo games for more than one day during any seven-day
period, provided that such permission shall be limited to bingo games which
will be conducted in conjunction with an established annual event regularly
held by the licensee, such as an annual festival, bazaar or similar event. A
licensee may not conduct bingo games between the hours of twelve midnight and
ten a.m. of any day. (Ord. 2576 § 2 (part), 1986; Ord. 2340 § 1 (part), 1980).

   The Chief of Police may prescribe such regulations with respect to the

   The City Council of the City of Fullerton finds and declares that:

traffic, creates a nuisance which jeopardizes the safety of the citizens of the
City by preventing safe passage to and from public sidewalks, public streets,
roadways or parkways.
   B.   The public display of pictorial material depicting nudity and sexual
conduct ("harmful matter") in publications contained in newsracks located on
public rights-of-way or public places is patently offensive and harmful to
passersby when readily visible to them, and is detrimental to a healthy moral
environment to which persons of the City are entitled.
   C.   Such public displays of harmful matter are thrust indiscriminately on
children and unwilling adults and constitute assaults upon individual privacy.

   G.   Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if the Development
Services Director, or his/her designee, finds that the location of a newsrack,
in accordance with the standards set forth herein, will create or allow a
condition prohibited by this section, or will otherwise endanger the public
peace, health, safety or welfare, or be contrary to the purposes and intent of
this chapter, he or she may prohibit the location of such newsrack in
accordance with such standards and/or may allow the location of such a newsrack

shall, within ten working days of the date on which the notice of violation was
mailed, either cause the violation to be corrected or request a hearing in
writing pursuant to Section
7.38.170.
   B.   In the case of violation of this chapter relative to restrictions upon
attachments of newsracks to property other than that owned by the owner of the
newsrack, to fixed objects or each other, and upon location of newsracks, any
public body or office may, as an alternative to removal under subsection A of
this section, remove such attachment and/or move such rack or racks in order to
restore them to a legal condition. (Ord. 2919 § 1 (part), 1997).

owner of said newsrack of the fact that the harmful matter has been removed
pursuant to this section. Upon failure of the owner to claim such harmful
matter and pay the expenses of removal and storage within thirty days after
such removal, said harmful matter shall be deemed to be unclaimed property in
possession of the Police Department and may be disposed of pursuant to
applicable provisions of the law regulating thereto.
   B.   In the event any newsrack which is installed pursuant to this chapter
does not have the owner's name, address and telephone number affixed, or where
a newsrack has been determined to be abandoned, the City may impound it
pursuant to the procedures set forth in this chapter. For the purposes of this
section, the term "abandoned" shall include, but is not limited to,
circumstances where no publication is in the newsrack for a period of over
seven days or is not serviced with the publication it is designed to
disseminate for a period of over seven days.
   C.   Failure to properly correct a violation or offending condition within
ten days, unless a hearing is requested pursuant to Section
7.38.170, shall result in the offending newsrack being impounded and processed
as unclaimed property under applicable provisions of law relating thereto.
   D.   In the event that any newsrack is found in a damaged condition, or in a
location, either of which creates an immediate threat to the public health,
safety or welfare, the City may immediately impound it pending a hearing
pursuant to Section
7.38.170, provided such hearing is requested by the owner within ten working
days of the date of mailing of a written notice of impoundment to the owner, if
known.
   E.   Whenever any newsrack is to be impounded pursuant to this section, the
owner may, within ten working days of the date the notice of violation is
posted on the newsrack or mailed, request a hearing in writing as provided in

the City Council, within thirty days of the date of impoundment or an order

permitted, an impound fee, the amount of which has been set by resolution of
the City Council, shall be imposed upon the owner. (Ord. 2919 § 1 (part),

otherwise dispose of any newsrack, together with its contents, and retain the
proceeds, including any monies, on behalf of the City, provided that either:

hundred fifty persons, two security guards shall be on the premises at all
times that live entertainment is being offered simultaneously with the sale of
alcohol. For an establishment with capacity greater than one hundred fifty, two

eighteen shall be prohibited from entering. A sign giving notice of this
provision shall be prominently displayed at the entrance of the adult business.
      9.   Intoxicated Patrons. No person obviously intoxicated shall enter or

prominently displayed at the entrance of the adult business.
   B.   Failure to comply with any of these requirements, or violations of
conditions commensurate with this chapter which are imposed upon the permit,
may be considered grounds for initiating revocation of the permit. (Ord. § 5
(part), 1996).
7.95.080   Decision to grant or deny permit.
   A.   The Planning Commission shall render a decision, which shall be
confirmed in writing, on an adult use development permit application within
sixty days of receiving a completed application if no traffic study is needed.
The Planning Commission shall render such decision after a duly noticed public
hearing has been held. The failure of the Planning Commission to render such a
decision within this time frame shall constitute a denial of the permit
application.
   B.   Notice of hearing on the adult use development permit application for
an adult business shall be provided pursuant to this code Section 15.76.060 and
pursuant to the requirements of Section 65901 of the California Government
Code.
   C.   The permit applicant has the burden to supply evidence to justify the
granting of the adult use development permit for an adult business. The
Planning Commission shall not be bound by the formal rules of evidence. The
Planning Commission shall grant, conditionally grant, or deny an adult use
development permit application. Only conditions commensurate with the objective
development standards of this chapter and the underlying district or zone in
which the property is located may be imposed by the Planning Commission on the
permit. The Planning Commission's decision shall be in writing, shall identify
the findings upon which its decision is based, and shall be mailed to the
permit applicant and to the property owner via first class mail. (Ord. § 5
(part), 1996).
7.95.090   Appeal to City Council.
   A.   Any interested person may appeal the Planning Commission's decision to
the City Council in writing within ten days after the Planning Commission's

application shall be provided pursuant to this code Section
15.76.060 and Section 65901 of the California Government Code.
   C.   The City Council shall make a decision at a de novo public hearing
which is to be held within thirty days of the filing or instituting of the
appeal. The City Council shall not be bound by the formal rules of evidence.
The appeals process shall be as provided for in Chapters
15.68 and
15.76 of this code, except as specifically modified herein. City Council action
on appeal of the Planning Commission's decision shall be by a majority vote of
a quorum of the City Council and shall be final and conclusive.
   D.   The City Council shall render its decision in writing, including
findings of fact and conclusions, within twenty days of the public hearing held
pursuant to this Section. Notice of the City Council's decision shall be mailed
to the applicant and to the property owner and shall refer the interested party
to the right of court review pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure
Section 1094.6. The City Council must identify the findings upon which its
decision is based. (Ord. § 5 (part), 1996).
7.95.100   Transferability of permit.
   The permit shall be valid only for the exact location specified in the
permit. The sale or transfer of a majority interest of an adult business or the
sale, transfer or assignment of the permit must be accompanied, if the permit
is to be valid, by the submittal of information by the new owners or permit
holders so as to satisfy all conditions imposed by the adult use development
permit for the adult business and the ordinance codified in this chapter.
   No transfer of a permit granted under this chapter shall be deemed valid if
any new owner or potential transferee has been found guilty of or pleaded nolo
contendere to within the past four years a misdemeanor or felony classified by
the State as a sex or sex-related offense. Attempted transfer of an adult
business permit under this chapter to a person who has been found guilty or
pleaded nolo contendere within the past four years of a misdemeanor or felony
classified by the State as a sex or sex-related offense shall be grounds for
revocation of an adult use development permit pursuant to the procedure set
forth in Section
7.95.120. (Ord. § 5 (part), 1996).
7.95.110   Nonconforming adult businesses.
   A.   All adult businesses or establishments regulated under the provisions
of this chapter which are nonconforming uses on the effective date of the
ordinance codified in this chapter that were lawfully in existence immediately
prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and were
rendered nonconforming by the application of this chapter shall be subject to
an amortization period expiring three years after the effective date of the
ordinance codified in this chapter. Such nonconforming uses shall either be
discontinued or shall be brought into full conformance with the provisions of
this chapter within three years of the effective date of the ordinance codified
in this chapter.
   B.   A nonconforming adult business may file an application with the
Planning Commission for an extension of the amortization period and shall
include a statement of the efforts that will be made to bring the adult
business into conformity by the conclusion of the extension period, whether a
previous extension has been requested and granted, and an application fee as
established by resolution of the City Council. No more than two such
applications will be considered for any nonconforming adult business. The term
of the extension shall be determined by the Planning Commission based upon the
factors set forth in subsection D of this section, but in no event shall the
total term of extension(s) granted pursuant to this section exceed two years
beyond the initial amortization period.
   C.   The Planning Commission shall follow all due process and notice
requirements that are required of adult use development permit application
hearings. The Planning Commission shall grant or deny the request within sixty
days of the filing of the extension application.
   D.   In rendering its decision, the Planning Commission shall determine
whether the adult business has been provided with a reasonable amortization
period commensurate with the investment involved. If the Planning Commission
determines that the amortization period is not reasonable it shall prescribe an
amortization period that is commensurate with the investment involved. The
burden shall be on the applicant to establish that the extension should be
granted. No one criteria set forth below shall be determinative. The Planning
Commission shall consider the following factors in making its determination:
      1.   The financial investment in the adult business;
      2.   The present actual and depreciated value of the business
improvements;
      3.   The applicable Internal Revenue Service depreciation schedules;
      4.   The remaining useful life of the business improvements;
      5.   The remaining lease term;
      6.   The cost of relocating the adult business to a site conforming with
the provisions of this chapter;
      7.   The date upon which the property owner or business owner received
notice of the nonconforming status of the adult business and the amortization
requirements;
      8.   The effects on the health, safety and welfare of surrounding
businesses and uses if the adult business is permitted to extend the
amortization period.
   E.   The Planning Commission's decision shall be in writing and shall be
mailed to the permit applicant and to the property owner via first class mail.
   F.   Any interested person may appeal the Planning Commission's decision to
the City Council in writing within ten days after the Planning Commission's
written decision. Any member of the City Council may within the same ten-day
period initiate such an appeal.
   G.   Notice and procedures of the appeal hearing shall follow that of the
permit application process.
   H.   The City Council declares to be a public nuisance any parcel where an
adult business is operating and where the amortization period as a legal
nonconforming use has expired and (a) no application for an extension is on
file or has been granted, or (b) no application for an adult use development
permit is on file or has been granted. (Ord. § 5 (part), 1996).
7.95.120   Revocation of permit.
   A.   The Planning Commission may revoke an adult use development permit for
an adult business for any of the following reasons:
      1.   The adult business violates one or more of the conditions imposed
upon the issuance of the adult use development permit, fails to conform to the
plans and procedures described in the application, or violates the occupant
load limits set by the building division;
      2.   The permit holder fails to obtain or maintain all required City,
County and State licenses and permits;
      3.   The adult use development permit is used to conduct an activity
different from that for which it was issued;
      4.   The permit holder has been untruthful or has misrepresented a
material fact in the permit application;
      5.   Due to changes in on-site conditions, the business lacks sufficient
on-site parking for employees and the public as set forth in the City's parking
code, unless such parking is legal and a nonconforming use;
      6.   The building or structure in which the business is conducted is
found to be out of compliance with the provisions of the Uniform Building,
Uniform Plumbing, or Uniform Fire Codes as adopted by the City, and the permit
holder has failed or refused to correct the violation within thirty days of
receiving written notification of the violation. This section shall not affect
the City's right to prohibit use of the premises for any purpose if the
building becomes hazardous to the health and safety of the employees, patrons
or general public, under the standards set forth in the Uniform Building,
Uniform Plumbing, or Uniform Fire Codes as adopted by the City as the result of
fire, flooding, earthquake, rioting, or other emergency;
      7.   The permitted adult business creates sound levels which violate the
noise ordinance of the City;
      8.   The permit holder fails to comply with conditions concerning
provision of security guards to patrol parking lots and the interior of the
premises as set forth in this Chapter;
      9.   The use for which the approval was granted has ceased to exist or
has been suspended for six months or more;
      10.   A patron or worker of the adult business is found guilty of, or
pleaded nolo contendere to, a misdemeanor or felony classified by the State as
a sex or sex-related offense, and that such offense or alleged offense occurred
on the premises of the adult business. If the conduct is that of a patron,
revocation must be based upon a finding that the operators of the adult
business failed to control the conduct of a patron or assisted the patron in
the conduct for which he or she is convicted.
   B.   Notice of hearing on the proposed permit revocation, together with
written notification of the specific grounds of complaint against the permit
holder, shall be provided to the permit holder at least fifteen days prior to
the hearing. The permit holder has the burden to supply evidence to justify the
continuation of the Adult Use Development Permit for the adult business. The
Planning Commission shall not be bound by the formal rules of evidence. The
Planning Commission shall revoke, not revoke, or conditionally revoke the
permit within thirty (30) days of the revocation hearing. The Planning
Commission's decision shall be in writing, shall identify the findings upon
which its decision is based, and shall be mailed to the permit applicant and to
the property owner via first class mail.
   C.   Any interested person may appeal the Planning Commission's decision to
the City Council in writing within ten days after such written decision. The
appeal process shall follow
Chapter 15.76 of this code. When a permit is revoked pursuant to this chapter,
another adult use development permit for an adult business shall not be granted
to the former permit holder within six months after the date of such
revocation. (Ord. § 5 (part), 1996).
7.95.130   Permit expiration and review.
   A.   An unrevoked adult use development permit for an adult business granted
under this chapter shall be subject to review automatically after its issuance
six months after issuance of the certificate of occupancy and every two years
thereafter. The review shall be for the purpose of determining if the proposed
use is being operated in compliance with the issued adult use development
permit. The permit holder shall pay a fee of one-half the initial permit fee to
cover the costs of investigation by the Police Department, Building Department
and Fire Departments to inspect the premises to ensure that the business is
being operated in compliance with the permit and to submit a review report to
the Commission. The permit holder shall supply current information with respect
to each category required in the initial application to enable the Commission
to conduct its review for compliance.
   The Commission shall place the item on its nonhearing agenda and provide the
applicant with notice of the time and place for the hearing at which the review
will be considered. If requested by a Commission member or by the permit
holder, the review may be by public hearing, following the same procedure set
forth in Section
7.95.080. If the Commission concludes that the business is not operating in
compliance with its adult use development permit, it shall set a de novo public
hearing to determine whether the permit should be revoked pursuant to the
provisions of Section
7.95.120.
   B.   An adult use development permit for an adult business permit granted
under this chapter shall become void if the adult business fails to operate
within six months of the date of permit approval, unless prior to this time the
permit holder demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of Development
Services that it has a good faith intent to presently commence the proposed
use. No more than two extensions of six months each for each failure to operate
shall be permitted. (Ord. § 5 (part), 1996).
7.95.140   Violation and penalty.
   A.   Any person who violates any section of this chapter shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor and subject to a fine not less than one hundred dollars or more
than one thousand dollars and/or imprisonment in the County jail for a period
up to six months. Each day such violation continues shall be regarded as a
separate offense.
   B.   Any adult business that violates any section of this chapter is
declared to be a public nuisance, and the City Attorney or the District
Attorney may, in addition to or in lieu of prosecuting a criminal action,
commence an action for the abatement and enjoining of the nuisance, in the
manner provided by law, and shall take other steps and shall apply to such
courts as may have jurisdiction to grant such relief as will abate or remove
such adult use establishment and restrain and enjoin any person from
conducting, operating or maintaining an adult use establishment contrary to the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. § 5 (part), 1996).

whether or not the terminal is, or within a reasonable period of time not to
exceed ninety (90) days, will be, an operating terminal as defined herein. If

"retro-fitted," as hereinafter provided, in order to ascertain whether said
route(s) appears to be adequate to accommodate interstate trucks. The City
Traffic Engineer shall present the results of the investigation at the
scheduled public hearing before the City Council. In determining adequacy, the
City Traffic Engineer shall consider whether or not said route(s), whether
retrofitted or not, meets the following criteria:
      1.   All ramps, intersections, streets and highways have turning lane
radii sufficiently wide to permit interstate trucks to safely negotiate the
entire route within traffic lanes and without danger to other users of the
public streets; and
      2.   There exist no physical conditions, including but not limited to,
overpass clearance, weight capacity of bridges, overcrossings or other
artificially supported roadways, and power or other overhead line clearance,
which would preclude the safe operation of interstate trucks on any proposed
route.
   G.   At the conclusion of the public hearing, the City Council shall
approve, subject to certain specified conditions, or deny the application,
subject to Caltrans approval as hereinafter provided, and shall support said
approval or denial with written findings showing whether or not each
requirement for approval, as specified in this section, is satisfied. However,
should Caltrans deny the proposed route(s); the City Council shall deny the
application.
   H.   If, after conducting the public hearing, the City Council determines
that no proposed route(s), whether modified or retrofitted, or not, is
"adequate" as defined herein, or that any requirement for approval has not been
satisfied, the City Council shall deny the application. If a proposed route is
determined to be adequate as modified or retrofitted in accordance with the
requirements herein, as necessary, and all other requirements imposed herein
have been satisfied, including environmental studies and submitted to the city
of all required documentation, the City Council may conditionally approve the
application and shall forward the application, along with a certified copy of
its resolution so approving, to Caltrans. No access from any federally
designated highway system within the city will be approved without the written
concurrence of Caltrans. If such approval by Caltrans is not issued within one
(1) year after the date of approval by the City Council, the City Council's
conditional approval shall be automatically revoked.
      1.   All other conditions of approval shall be satisfied within one (1)
year after approval by the City Council, unless otherwise expressly provided by
the City Council, or the City Council's conditional approval shall be
automatically revoked.
      2.   Failure to exercise any approval granted hereunder within one (1)
year after such approval's effective date shall cause said approval to be
automatically revoked.
   I.   Should the requested route(s) pass through the city to a terminal
located in another jurisdiction, the applicant shall obtain route approval in
accordance with this article from the city and from all other affected
jurisdictions, prior to operating on said route(s) within the city. It shall be
the responsibility of the applicant and the public entity approving the
terminal land use, if such terminal is not located within the city, to
coordinate route approval with the city. (Ord. 3180, § 1, 2013; Ord. 3145, § 1
(part), 2010)

to be paid by applicant prior to applicant utilizing any approval granted
hereunder. The sign fee to be paid shall be in an amount estimated by the city
to be equal to the cost of acquiring and installing appropriate trailblazer
signs marking the approved terminal route. Upon the completion of the sign
installation, the actual cost to the city shall be computed by the city and any
difference between the estimated cost and the actual cost shall be paid by or
refunded to the applicant, as the case may be. COSTS, as used in this paragraph
B, shall include, but are not limited to, actual sign costs, plus the labor,
overhead and administrative costs incurred by city in acquiring and installing

   A.   Should a proposed route which is otherwise inadequate be determined to
be adequate if modified or "retrofitted," the applicant may propose such route,
together with a proposed plan for retrofitting, as part of the completed
application. Applicant shall comply with all conditions herein with respect to
the route proposed to be retrofitted. Any approval granted by city with respect
to a route proposed to be retrofitted, shall be conditional, pending approval
by Caltrans and subsequent construction of such modifications in accordance
with all local and state requirements and construction standards, including
those imposed by the California Environmental Quality Act and/or the National
Environmental Policy Act, if applicable. In all cases where such conditional
approval is granted, applicant shall be required to submit plans and
specifications concerning said modifications to the City Engineer, whose
approval thereof shall be obtained, in addition to the applicant's satisfying
all other applicable state and local requirements, prior to any construction of
such modifications commencing.
   B.   City may subject the proposed plan for retrofitting to the city's bid
process, complete the retrofitting as a city project using contractors selected
by city, and thereafter require payment, pursuant to a written agreement
between city and applicant of the entire cost of such retrofitting.
Alternatively, city may authorize applicant to conduct and complete said
retrofitting, whereupon the applicant shall be responsible for obtaining all
necessary permits and for bearing all costs of engineering, construction and
inspection of such modifications. All such modifications shall be done by a
validly licensed contractor acceptable to city, carrying public liability
insurance in a form and amount acceptable to city, and shall be completed to
the satisfaction of the City Engineer. In either case, the applicant shall be
required to indemnify, defend, and hold the city, its elected officials,
officers, employees and agents free and harmless from any and all claims and
lawsuits arising out of or connected with the construction of such
modifications. (Ord. 3180, § 1, 2013; Ord. 3145, § 1 (part), 2010)
8.30.120. Revocation of approval.
   A.   The City Council may revoke any approval granted hereunder if the
terminal located within city, or the approved route, causes traffic safety
problems, including but not limited in, inability of interstate trucks to
safely negotiate the entire route within existing traffic lanes, interstate
trucks creating unsafe driving conditions for other vehicles or pedestrians, or
if due to changed conditions the route is deemed to be no longer "adequate," as
the term is used in this chapter.
   B.   The City Council may also revoke any approval issued hereunder should
the terminal cease to comply with all applicable City, County, State or Federal
rules and regulations, or cease to be used as a terminal for a period of ninety
(90) consecutive days.
   C.   Should Caltrans or any other public agency approving a terminal route,
any portion of which has been approved by the City, revokes its approval with
respect to any of the approval holder's activities occurring on said terminal
route, the approval given hereunder shall be deemed to be revoked automatically
as of the effective date of the underlying revocation.
   D.   Unless immediate revocation is deemed warranted by the City's Traffic
Engineer based upon an immediate and urgent need to protect the health, safety
or welfare of citizens within the city, or due to any subsequently enacted
legislation making any of the activities permitted hereunder a violation of
law, all revocations shall be conducted in accordance with the procedural
provisions of the city's zoning ordinance, as the same may be amended from time
to time. (Ord. 3180, § 1, 2013; Ord. 3145, § 1 (part), 2010)
8.30.130.   Reapplication.
   If denial, revocation or intent to revoke by the City Council is based upon
a denial or revocation of any approval issued by Caltrans or other public
agency for the operation of interstate trucks, the decision of the City Council
shall be final, no findings shall be required, and the aggrieved applicant/
approval holder must appeal to Caltrans or other applicable public agency. Upon
submission of evidence that Caltrans or the other public agency has reissued
its approval with respect to the route(s) previously denied or revoked; the
applicant/approval holder may re-apply for route approval in accordance with
the provisions herein. In such cases, the City Council may waive any or all
requirements imposed herein and may immediately approve a route which it had
formerly approved, subject to any and all conditions imposed by Caltrans and/or
the City Council. (Ord. 3180, § 1, 2013; Ord. 3145, § 1 (part), 2010)

   DEFINITIONS: As used in this section:
   “CITY-CONTROLLED PARKING” means any parking structure, surface lot, or
similar area used for this purpose that is located on City-owned property, the
Downtown Parking District, a City Park, or other locations subject to the City-
exclusive jurisdiction.
   “PARK” when used with respect to a vehicle, means the standing of a vehicle,
whether occupied or not, otherwise than temporarily for the purpose of, and
while actually engaged in, loading or unloading merchandise or passengers.
   “VEHICLE” means a device by which any person or property may be propelled,
moved, or drawn upon a highway; excepting a device moved exclusively by human
power, or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks.
   “STREET” or “HIGHWAY” means a way or place, other than an alley, publicly
maintained and open to the public to use for the movement of vehicles.
   SELECT STREET EXEMPTIONS: Certain areas may be exempted from the provisions
of this section by resolution of the City Council. Such resolutions may be
adopted or amended from time to time by the City Council on its own motion, or
upon application by petition signed by the majority of the owners of the
dwelling units in the area exempted or proposed to be exempted, and with the
advice of the Transportation and Circulation Commission. Exemptions may be
granted for an area having an off-street parking deficiency under law
pertaining to established minimum parking requirements for various residential
zones as it exists at the time any exemption is considered and/or granted by
the Commission or the City Council; or in compliance with policies and
procedures approved by the City Council regarding parking. Contiguous non-
deficient areas may be included in excepted areas in order to create logical
boundaries with regard to law enforcement, signing, and street sweeping. The
smallest area which may be exempted is one city block, either one or both
sides. An exemption issued pursuant to this subsection shall be valid only for
relief from this section, and shall not be construed to allow the violation of
other provisions of this chapter or the California Vehicle Code.
   TEMPORARY EXEMPTION: Short-term parking deficiencies such as, but not
limited to, emergencies, out-of-town visitors, or short-term construction
(driveways, home repair, etc.). The Police Department shall have the option of
granting Temporary Exemption Permits at its sole discretion. Said permit shall
be available in specific calendar-day increments not to exceed 30 days.
   HARDSHIP EXEMPTION: An interim parking deficiency due to changing family/
residents needs as additional drivers come of age. This permit is provided only
to those residents who currently utilize all available off-street parking and
have an interim parking deficiency due to a hardship as defined herein. The
applicability of the requested Hardship Exemption shall be determined and
approved at the sole discretion of the Police Department. Said permit shall be
available in one-year increments from date of issuance.
   PROCEDURES FOR PROCESSING REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FROM EARLY MORNING PARKING
PROHIBITION
   A.   SELECT STREET EXEMPTION: Property owner(s) requesting a Select Street
Exemption for an entire street (block to block), as defined in Section
8.44.080 of the Fullerton Municipal Code (F.M.C.), shall contact the
Engineering Department to establish limits of the area to be requested for
exception and to a obtain petition form. The signed petition is returned to
Engineering Department for verification of signatures against County Assessor's
records. The petition must represent a majority of the combined properties on
both sides of the street(s) requested for exception, and may be signed by the
owner or authorized representative of the owner. In the case that only one side
of the street is requested for exemption, a majority of the property owners on
that side of the street must be in support of the request, as well as the
combined majority of property owners from both sides of the street. In
addition, the petitioner must submit the applicable (non-refundable) fee to the
Engineering Department prior to the request being processed and placed on the
agenda for Transportation & Circulation Commission consideration (T&CC) as
established by Council Resolution.
      The request for exemption will be placed on the agenda of the T&CC for a
public hearing and for receiving possible protests. Notice of the hearing will
be mailed to the property owners as recorded with the County Assessor's office
and, where applicable, to the residents of all affected properties on both
sides of the street(s). This process will give notice of the proposal to owners
who may not have been contacted during circulation of the original petition.
      The City Traffic Engineer will provide a report to the T&CC with all
necessary information regarding the request for an exemption. Chapter 15.17 of
the F.M.C., or any successor provisions thereto, shall be used in determining
the minimum parking requirements for single-family and multi-family residential
zones.
      The T&CC will then review the request and the staff report to determine
if the area is deficient in off-street parking. For the purpose of this review,
the area may be found deficient in parking if the available off-street parking
is less than the current minimum requirement for the same type of land use per
the Municipal Code.
      It shall be assumed that all garages in the petition area are being used
for the parking of vehicles. Those properties with garages being utilized for
anything other than its intended use will not be considered deficient under any
circumstances.
      If the T&CC finds that the area is deficient in off-street parking and
recommends that an exception be granted, a resolution will be prepared for
adoption by the City Council. If the Commission votes to deny the request, the
decision is final unless appealed to the City Council by the applicant. If
appealed, the appeal must be in writing and received by the Engineering
Department within ten business days from the date of the T&CC hearing. The
appeal must include payment, as established by the Fee Resolution, which is
non-refundable without regard to a final decision by the City Council.
      The repeal of a previously approved Select Street Exemption requires the
same procedure and process as outlined above.
   B.   HARDSHIP EXEMPTION: The owner of a single-family residence may apply
for an individual Hardship Exemption, as defined in Section 8.44.080 of the
Fullerton Municipal Code (F.M.C.). Issuance of said exemption is not contingent
upon establishment of an off-street parking deficiency, as defined in
Chapter 15.17 of the F.M.C. A “HARDSHIP” is considered to be a short-term need
based on a family's need for an additional parking space as the children reach
driving age and there are insufficient spaces on site for the added vehicles.
An application for, and denial of, a Select Street Exemption does not preclude
any individual property owner from that street from applying for a Hardship
Exemption.
      The Police Department shall accept, review, approve, and issue or deny a
property owner's request for a Hardship Exemption Permit.
      The Hardship Exemption application requires that the property owner
complete the appropriate application, submit the applicable (non-refundable)
processing and filing fee as established by Council, and submit to an on-site
inspection of the property by the Police Department. At that time the Police
Department will verify that all garage, carport, driveway, and apron parking is
being fully utilized for its intended purpose as vehicle parking for personal
vehicles. All reasonable attempts to increase available parking on site; i.e.,
widening driveways and/or re-setting fence lines to provide additional parking
adjacent to alleys, shall have been considered and deemed unavailable prior to
further consideration of a Hardship Permit. Recreational vehicles, commercial
business vehicles, miscellaneous equipment; and/or building materials, etc.,
shall not be stored on site in these locations, in what could otherwise be used
for vehicular storage.
      Permits are provided only to those residents who currently utilize all
available off-street parking and have a short-term parking deficiency as
determined by the Police Department in accordance with these guidelines.
      The fees for the initial review, permit issuance, and each annual renewal
shall be established by Council Resolution and are not refundable.
      Upon approval by the Police Department that said property is in
compliance with the conditions for a permit, the property owner shall pay, in
addition to the processing/filing fee, the applicable permit fee as required.
      A maximum of one (1) Hardship Exemption Permit may be obtained per
residence for a vehicle licensed and registered to that address, and is not
transferable. A permit will not be issued to a residence that does not have
legal and available street parking immediately adjacent to the front, or side
yard for a corner lot, of the hardship residence. The Police Department will
enter all permits in a database readily accessible to affected Police
Department personnel, and shall include as a minimum the identity of the
applicant, contact information, street address, permit number, and vehicle
license plate number for control, enforcement, and audit purposes. Said permit
shall be available in one-year increments. Sport utility vehicles or pickups
with commercial plates, but acquired for personal use only, may be included in
determining the on-site deficiency if applicable. In the event a resident has a
“company vehicle” that is required to be driven home, the operator must provide
documentation of sufficient detail that confirms this use in order to be
eligible for a permit.
      Each permit may normally be renewed annually for four consecutive years.
Changing family dynamics may require additional renewals, in which case
additional year(s) may be petitioned for and approved by the Police Department.
      The permit shall be posted clearly on the left rear bumper of the
permitted vehicle. In the event a permitted vehicle is sold, or the permit is
damaged, the Police Department will provide a replacement permit upon proof of
sale or damage. Costs for replacement permits are established by separate fee
resolution.
      Specific hours shall be set aside within the Police Department's Traffic
Division to receive requests, and issue or renew permits. These hours will be
posted at the Police Department and included on the Application Guide.
      Police Department personnel will conduct cursory observations, as time
permits, during patrol to determine if there are any indications of non-
compliance.
      Non-compliance with any of the above-mentioned conditions shall subject
the applicant to immediate revocation of the Hardship Exemption Permit. In the
event a permit is revoked, there will be a twelve-month waiting period from the
date of revocation before a resident may apply for a new Hardship Exemption
Permit. Any re-issuance thereafter shall be subject to all original fees and
inspections. The same said revocation of any re-issuance does not constitute a
break in the normal four-year consecutive year criteria.
      If a request for a Hardship Permit is denied, this decision may be
appealed to the Police Department's appointed Hearing Officer. The applicant
shall submit a written appeal within ten business days of the initial
determination. The written submittal must state the basis for the appeal and
provide appropriate photographs, drawings, or sketches that clearly support
this appeal. The Hearing Officer's decision shall be final. The fee for this
appeal shall be established by separate Council Resolution.
   C.   TEMPORARY EXEMPTIONS: Temporary Exemption Permits, as defined in
Section 8.44.080 of the Fullerton Municipal Code (F.M.C.), shall be issued by
the Police Department.
      The Police Department shall have the option of granting a Temporary
Exemption Permit, at its discretion, for short-term parking deficiencies such
as, but not limited to, overnight visitors or short-term construction; i.e.,
driveways, home construction, etc. Said permission shall be granted in specific
calendar-day increments, and generally limited not to exceed two weeks. The
Police Department may extend this period for unusual and non-reoccurring events
that conform to the intent of the ordinance.
      Grantee shall display a notice of the Temporary Exemption in plain view
from the outside of such vehicle on the left side of the windshield, on a
window on the left side, or at the rear of such vehicle, as directed by the
Police Department.
      The Police Department will enter all exemptions in a database readily
accessible to affected Police Department personnel, and shall include as a
minimum the identity of the grantee and street address for audit purposes.
   SEVERABILITY: If the exception provisions of the section are declared
illegal by a court of competent jurisdiction, such declaration shall not affect
the validity of the remainder of this section. It is the intent of the City
Council that such remainder continue in full force and effect in spite of such
declaration.

8.70.060.   Violations of this chapter as a public nuisance.
8.70.070.   Penalty for violation.
8.70.010   Purpose and intent.
   A.   The California Vehicle Code § 22455 allows municipalities to regulate
mobile food vending in order to protect public safety and Article XI, Section 7
of the California Constitution extends to municipalities the police power
authority to regulate in furtherance of public health and welfare.
   B.   The evening operation of mobile food vending trucks in the City of
Fullerton Downtown area, prior to the prohibition of such activity in or about
April, 2010, constituted a significant public safety problem, as evidenced by
the repeated and regular need for law enforcement assistance to address and
resolve public safety problems caused by the congregation of Downtown area bar
patrons at or near mobile food vending trucks parked in the Downtown area
during the evenings.
   C.   Continuing public safety problems are caused by the operation of fast
food establishment and/or inexpensive food establishments operating in the
Downtown area during the evening, which attract Downtown area bar patrons
requiring repeated and regular law enforcement assistance to address and
resolve public safety problems caused by their congregation.
   D.   Mobile food vending vehicles create the potential for safety hazards,
such as blocking sight lines at intersections and crosswalks, encouraging
pedestrians to cross streets mid-block to reach a vending vehicle, and causing
additional conflicts between drivers and pedestrians, especially if the mobile
food trucks are parked and serving customers on streets with posted speed
limits over 35 mph.
   E.   The act of looking for prospective buyers while operating a mobile food
vending vehicle may make the operator less attentive to pedestrian and
vehicular traffic. When done on public roadways, this poses obvious traffic and
safety risks to the public, which the City seeks to prevent.
   F.   Mobile food vendors who fail to park their vehicles correctly during a
transaction attract prospective buyers onto public roadways, creating a further
traffic and public safety hazard.
   G.   The City has an important and substantial public interest in providing
regulations to prevent safety, traffic and health hazards, as well as to
preserve the peace, safety and welfare of the community. (Ord. 3191 § 1, 2013)

policies and objectives will be created as part of the comprehensive update
process;
   B.   A designation of proposed community forestry themes for major traffic
routes and districts within the City consistent with the City's Master Street
Tree Plan, together with a program, schedule and suggested budget for
implementing such treatments;
   C.   An up-to-date inventory of every street tree and any other trees in
public areas deemed necessary, which inventory shall include, as appropriate,
species, DBH, canopy height and spread, condition, maintenance records, names
of adjacent property owners, record of fees and fines, and any other
information necessary or usable in the long-range planning or day-to-day
planting and maintenance of the City's community forest;
   D.   A Master Street Tree Plan, based on an evaluation of species diversity,
growth characteristics and performance as recorded in the inventory, providing
for rotational reforestation of diseased or declining trees and break-up of
potentially problematic monocultures;
   E.   A set of standards for street tree installation, landscape tree
installation, pruning and maintenance, acceptable tree species and any other
standards, criteria or administrative procedures deemed necessary to carry out
the purposes of the ordinance codified in this chapter and the Community Forest
Management Plan;
   F.   A process for continual update and improvement of the Community Forest
Management Plan's elements.
(Ord. 2859 § 2 (part), 1995).
9.06.090   Planting trees.
   The City shall have trees planted in any subdivision developed within the
municipal boundaries.
   A.   No subdivision shall be approved unless the developer/owner is
conditioned to plant street trees in accordance with current City standards and
as approved in writing by the Director.
   In the event a subdivider desires to plant trees within the parkway adjacent
to a new subdivision, he may apply to the Director for a permit. Said permit
may be issued only after the developer/owner has posted a bond, guaranteeing
the planting of all street trees. All such planting shall be done in accordance
with the Community Forest Management Plan.
   B.   Before planting, all street trees must meet specifications for
acceptance as detailed in the Community Forest Management Plan and be inspected
and approved by the Director or his/her designee.
   C.   So the Director of Development Services can determine the tree
requirements for site development, each subdivider or developer shall submit to
the City a plot plan of the proposed development which shall:
      1.   Show clearly all existing trees, noting location, species, size and
condition;
      2.   Note whether existing trees will be retained, removed or relocated;
      3.   Show proposed utilities, driveways, sidewalks and tree planting
locations, and the size and species of proposed street trees; and
      4.   Conform with ground and aerial setback specifications as defined in
the Community Forest Management Plan.
   D.   At least fifty percent of the paved area surface of all new publicly
developed parking areas shall be shaded by tree canopies within fifteen years
of acquisition of building permits. Trees to be planted to develop such a
canopy shall be in accordance with the City's Community Forest Management Plan
and the requirements of the Director. Plans shall show the estimated tree
canopies after fifteen years of growth, the specific names, sizes and locations
of trees to be planted, and the total area in square feet of the area shaded by
tree canopies. In determining the area shaded, the following methodology shall
be used:
      1.   Measure the shaded area on the pavement assuming that the shaded
area is only that area directly under the tree canopy or dripline;
      2.   Landscape planters under the canopy may be counted as shaded area;
      3.   Paved areas shaded by structures and second stories of buildings and
carports may be deducted from the total paved area.
   E.   Any proposed change in the direction or width of a public street shall
incorporate a consideration of street trees within the right-of-way as part of
the general plan of improvements. The City Engineer will consider such planting
during acquisition of right-of-way as well as during the completion of the
final development plans for the project.
(Ord. 2859 § 2 (part), 1995).
9.06.100   Alteration and removal of street trees.
   It is unlawful for any person to alter or remove a tree within a public area
or right-of-way without a permit for such work issued by the Maintenance
Services Department. Any person who desires a permit shall apply to the
Department on the designated form. The permittee shall be responsible for
posting a copy of such permit on or adjacent to subject tree at least ten days
prior to the date of the removal. This posting and waiting period may be waived
by the Director for public health and safety purposes.
   A.   Any application for a permit required by this chapter shall be in
writing, signed by the applicant, and filed with the Director, on a form
furnished by him/her, and shall show:
      1.   The name and address of the applicant;
      2.   The address or location where such work is to be performed;
      3.   A detailed description of the work to be performed;
      4.   The date or dates on which such work is to be commenced and
completed;
      5.   The name and address of any person or persons employed by, or
contracting with, the applicant, for the performance of such work;
      6.   A statement that the applicant will hold the City harmless from any
damage to any property or any injury to any person caused in any way by the
performance of any work for which such a permit is issued.
   B.   The Director shall issue permits to property owners to perform
maintenance on or to remove City street trees directly adjacent to their
property, only if the following conditions are met:
      1.   The property owner has established, to the Director's satisfaction,
that there is need for the proposed work on the tree; and
      2.   The property owner has established, to the Director's satisfaction,
that the persons who are to perform the work are qualified to do so; and
      3.   The Director, in his/her sole discretion, has determined that any
potential detriment to the City street tree population entailed by the proposed
work, is justified in the individual case. In making this determination, the
Director shall consider factors such as the probability that the proposed work
will destroy or seriously injure the tree, the tree's health, the desirability
of that species as a street tree, whether the tree's condition and size
threaten serious damage to property, the condition and number of other City
street trees in the vicinity, whether there are other less onerous means of
accomplishing the applicant's goals, and other related criteria.
   C.   All work performed on City street trees pursuant to a permit issued by
the Director under this section shall be done within a sixty-day period from
the issuance of said permit, or within such longer period as the Director shall
specify.
   D.   The Director shall condition any permit granted pursuant to this
section for the removal of a City street tree, on the permittee removing, and
where the Director determines it to be appropriate, replacing the tree. In such
case, the replacement value of the tree shall be borne by the owner and such
service shall not be provided by the City.
   E.   The Director may condition any permit granted pursuant to this section
on any such conditions as the Director determines to be necessary.
   F.   The provisions of this section shall be complied with whenever a person
seeks a permit to remove or trim a City street tree to facilitate moving any
building or other structure.
(Ord. 2859 § 2 (part), 1995).
9.06.110   Injuring public trees.
   All publicly-owned trees shall be protected from injury by the public.
   A.   No person shall injure or poison any tree in any City right-of-way.
   B.   No person, without a permit from the Director therefor, shall use,
plant, replace, remove, trim or prune any tree growing on any City street or
attach any string, cord, twine, rope, wire, chain, wood, cloth, metal or paper
thereto, except for the temporary protection of such tree.
   C.   No person, with such permit shall make any excavation or install any
building, structure, curb, sidewalk, driveway, foundation, wall or fence within
six feet from the trunk of any such tree.
   D.   No person shall do any act authorized by such a permit, without
providing all protection necessary to prevent unnecessary injury therefrom to
any such tree or to any person or property.
(Ord. 2859 § 2 (part), 1995).
9.06.120   Appeals.
   Any action of the Director may be appealed to and heard by the City
Community Services Commission. A written appeal must be filed within ten days
after the decision of the Director asking for placement on the Commission's
agenda. The appeal shall clearly specify the reasons for which a hearing is
requested. After a hearing, the Commission shall render its decision, which
shall be final unless appealed to the City Council. To be effective, an appeal
to the City Council must be in writing, stating the reasons for the appeal, and
must be filed with the City Clerk within ten working days after notice of the
decision of the City Community Services Commission is mailed to the applicant.
The decision of the City Council shall be final.
(Ord. 2859 § 2 (part), 1995).
9.06.130   Landmark trees.
   The City is desirous of recognizing and protecting landmark trees.
   A.   With the advice of the City Community Services Commission the Director
may propose criteria for the designation of landmark trees to the City Council.
The criteria shall include consideration of the age, size, shape, species,
location, historical association, visual quality or other contribution to the
City's character. Upon the recommendation of the Director, the City Council may
designate as a "Landmark Tree" any tree on property under the jurisdiction of
the City meeting the criteria adopted by the City Council or may rescind such
designations.
   B.   Landmark trees shall be removed only after approval by the City Council
based on a recommendation by the Community Services Commission.
   C.   Removal of landmark trees shall be based upon reasonable standards,
including, but not limited to, the following:
      1.   The condition of the landmark tree with respect to its general
health, damage, status as a public nuisance, danger of falling, proximity to
existing or proposed structures, interference with utility services, and its
status as host for parasitic plants, pests or diseases endangering other
species of trees or plants with infection or infestations;
      2.   The necessity of the requested action to allow construction of
improvements or otherwise allow economic or other reasonable enjoyment of
property;
      3.   The topography of the land and the effect of the requested action on
soil retention, water retention, and diversion or increased surface water;
      4.   The number, species, size and location of existing trees in the area
and the effect of the requested action on shade areas, air pollution, historic
values, scenic beauty and the general welfare of the City as a whole;
      5.   Good forestry practices such as, but not limited to, the number of
healthy trees a given parcel of land will support.
   D.   Conditions may be imposed on the removal of landmark trees including,
but not limited to, any of the following:
      1.   A condition requiring the replacement or placement of additional
trees on the subject property to offset the impacts associated with loss of a
tree, limbs or encroachment into the protected zone of a landmark tree;
      2.   The planting of new tree(s) off-site to offset the loss of a
landmark tree;
      3.   A condition requiring an objectively observable maintenance and care
program be initiated to insure the continued health and care of landmark tree
(s) on the property;
      4.   Payment of a fee or donation of planting stock to the City or other
public agency to be used elsewhere in the community should a suitable
replacement location of the tree not be possible on-site or off-site.
(Ord. 2859 § 2 (part), 1995).
9.06.140   Help for citizens performing tree maintenance--Fee for service.
   On application of any person to whom there has been issued a permit to trim,
prune or remove a tree from a City right-of-way, the Director may trim, prune
or remove such tree described in such permit provided the cost thereof is paid
by the permittee and provided there shall first be deposited with the Director
a sum determined to be the estimated cost of such work. Following completion of
the work, the Director shall determine the actual cost of the work and transfer
that portion of the deposit to the appropriate City fund and return the balance
to the depositor. Should the original deposit be insufficient to cover the
actual cost of the work, the permittee shall be liable to the City for the
unpaid balance and shall promptly pay such amount to the City upon demand of
the Director.
(Ord. 2859 § 2 (part), 1995).
9.06.150   Resolution of conflicts between trees and structures.
   A.   When roots of a tree planted within a City street or other public area
damage curbs, gutters and sidewalks (including driveway ramps), the City shall
be responsible for the appropriate corrective measures. The type of corrective
measures provided shall be determined by the City, but shall be selected and
performed so as to minimize damage to the tree. In the event that root or other
tree-caused damage is so severe that corrective measures cannot be reasonably
accomplished, or the damage recurs soon after corrective measures are
performed, the tree may be removed. The Director shall be responsible for
developing or approving corrective measures.
   B.   When a tree planted on private property causes damage to curbs,
gutters, sidewalks, or utilities, the property owner shall be responsible for
the appropriate corrective measures. The Director shall determine the
appropriate corrective measures. The expense to effect any corrective measures
is the sole responsibility of the adjacent property owner.
(Ord. 2859 § 2 (part), 1995).
9.06.160   Topping prohibited.
   It is unlawful as a normal practice for any person, firm or City department
to top any street tree, park tree or other tree on public property. Trees
severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility
wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical, may
be exempted from the ordinance codified in this chapter at the determination of
the Director, based on standards approved by the City Community Services
Commission.
(Ord. 2859 § 2 (part), 1995).
9.06.170   Public nuisances.
   Trees in the City are public nuisances under the following conditions:
   A.   Any tree on private property that has any contagious infection, disease
or affliction, or any insects, which if left uncontrolled would harm a City
tree;
   B.   Any tree on private property that is growing, dying, dead or standing
in such a manner, or that has had its ground support weakened by rain, wind or
other cause, or that from any other cause is in such condition, that such tree
or any part thereof is dangerous or detrimental to the public health, safety or
welfare, or to any public property or street in the City, or to any person.
(Ord. 2859 § 2 (part), 1995).
9.06.180   Abatement of nuisance.
   Trees determined to be a public nuisance shall be dealt with pursuant to
Chapter 6.01 of this Code.
(Ord. 2859 § 2 (part), 1995).
9.06.190   Penalty provisions.
   A.   Any person found to be in violation of this chapter shall be subject to
the penalties specified in Section
1.08.010 of this code.
   B.   In addition to the penalty set forth above, any person who removes,
damages or destroys a tree in violation of the provisions of this section shall
pay a fee equal to the cost of its replacement value. Any and all amounts paid
or collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into a revolving fund
to be used by the Maintenance Services Department for replacing and planting
trees.
(Ord. 2940 § F, 1998; Ord. 2859 § 2 (part), 1995).
9.06.200   Enforcement.
   The Director or his/her designee is charged with the responsibility for the
enforcement of the ordinance codified in this chapter and may serve notice to
any person in violation thereof or institute legal proceedings as may be
required, and the City Attorney is hereby authorized to institute appropriate
proceedings to that end.
(Ord. 2859 § 2 (part), 1995).
Chapter 9.10
RECREATIONAL TRAIL DESIGN STANDARDS
Sections:
9.10.010.   In general.
9.10.020.   Trail design standards.
Appendix A. Trail Dimensions and Types
Appendix B. Surfacing Specifications
Appendix C. Level of Difficulty
Appendix D. Water Crossings.
9.10.010.   In general.
   A.   Trails included in the City of Fullerton General Plan will be developed
in accordance with the following standards. The term “regional riding and
hiking trails” as used in this chapter is meant to include equestrian,
pedestrian (walking, hiking, and jogging) and mountain biking (non-motorized)
use. However, a specific trail may be restricted from one or more of the
aforementioned user groups for special reasons. Such restrictions are to be
determined on a case-by-case basis by the City of Fullerton (City).
   B.   In special locations where physical constraints preclude the practical
implementation of a trail under the following standards, approval may be given
by the City Engineer and the Parks and Recreation Director to deviate from
these trail standards if public safety is not jeopardized and the purpose of
the General Plan is carried out.
   C.   Strict standardization among regional riding and hiking trails or even
segments of the same trail is impractical because of the vast differences in
topography and other physical characteristics and because of dissimilarities in
kinds and extent of use. Standards are good, but flexibility is necessary.
Therefore, design may vary among different trails or segments of trails
according to development constraints and various special conditions.
Nevertheless, certain basic standards, allowing for flexibility and for the
safety and maintenance of the trail and their related facilities should be
followed.
(Ord. 3182, passed 5-15-2012)
9.10.020. Trail design standards.
   A..   Trail tread width. (See
Appendix A at the end of this chapter.)
      1.   Ten-foot minimum.: Regional Trail and Backbone Recreational Trail.
      2.   Twelve-foot minimum: 15-foot preferred: Regional and Backbone Multi-
recreational Trail.
      3.   Eight-foot minimum: Feeder and Connector Recreational Trail.
      4.   The actual trail tread width needs to be determined according to the
level of use or the expected level of use. However, the trail tread width is
not to be less than the minimum standard.
   B.   Trail types. (See
Appendix A at the end of this chapter.)
      1.   Regional and Backbone Recreational Trail. This trail type is
preferred for multiple-use under most conditions. A majority of the Master Plan
trails are of this type. Service vehicles could use this trail, if necessary.
      2.   Regional and Backbone Multi-recreational Trail. This trail type
serves as a major, multiple-use trail where space and topography are not
limiting factors. This type is ideal for projected high use trails. It provides
adequate space for all uses in a safe, effective manner. Service vehicles could
use this trail, if necessary.
      3.    Feeder and Connector Recreational Trail. This trail type is
appropriate for multiple-use under most conditions. This type is ideal for
projected low use trails and trail connections. Service vehicles could use this
trail, if necessary.
   C.   Right-of-way. (See
Appendix A at the end of this chapter.)
   D.   Setbacks.
      1.   Two-foot minimum setback from existing or future curb face,
retaining walls or fences, edge of sidewalk, or edge of paved or unpaved
shoulder.
      2.   Four-foot minimum buffer separation from bikeway, sidewalk or other
trails.
   E.   Vertical clearance. Fifteen-foot. minimum vertical clearance for
structures and tree limbs and 12-foot minimum for culverts.
   F.   Trail fencing.
      1.   Fencing shall be provided where users need to be firmly confined
within the trail width such as in specific areas of community parks, steep
slope areas, bridges, and other potential hazard or high-traffic and general
public use areas. Golf ball netting shall be provided where necessary to
protect trail users.
      2.   The following are standards for split rail and post fencing when
needed to separate the trails. However, alternative materials and design
standards may be allowed.
 
Material     Vinyl fencing, white three rails
Rail size    2"x 6"x 16'
Post size    5" x 5" x 7'
Post spacing 8'
 
      3.   Other standards:
         a.   Fence height shall not exceed five feet.
         b.   The center to center distance between the top and bottom rails
shall be 21 inches.
         c.   Hitching posts shall be constructed of six-inch square wood
posts, set 18 inches into the ground, reaching a four-foot height. Rings for
tethering horses will be attached to the top of the post.
         d.   Barbed-wire is prohibited as a trail fencing material. In the
event of existing barbed-wire along a trail, additional fencing should be
constructed to protect the trail user from the barbed-wire.
   G.   Trail signs.
      1.   Trail name signs shall be placed at entry points, halfway points and
other points where trail identification is needed.
      2.   Directional signs should be placed, as appropriate, to clarify trail
destination and direction to trail users.
      3.   Signs shall be offset from the trail edge a minimum of two feet.
However, exact location for the best visibility can only be accomplished in the
field.
      4.   Trail user yield signs shall be placed at all trailheads and posted
periodically. Especially at trail crossings and along trails that accommodate a
variety of users.
      5.   Intersection signs shall be placed at intersections to warn both the
trail user and oncoming traffic.
      6.   All trail signs shall be located where they can be easily read from
the trail. The copy shall be large enough so that it is easily legible (two-
inch high letters). Vegetation and other surroundings (usually 40 inches from
the ground to bottom of a sign) should determine height of signs.
      7.   Material:
         a.   Wood, with emblazoned lettering, should be used for trail name
signs. The California State Park System guidelines can be referenced for
further details.
         b.   Metal signs should be used where vandalism may be a problem or
where signs interface with public roadways where standard metal signs are used.
         c.   Concrete or composite signs and markers can also be used as a
less expensive alternative in the construction of trail signs.
   H.   Roadway treatments.
      1.   Street signage to warn motorists of impending trail crossings shall
be located in advance of trail crossings. Signs shall meet City and State
standards.
      2.   Roadways at trail crossings shall have a textured surface.
   I.   Grades. (See
Appendices A and
C at the end of this chapter.)
      1.   Grades of 1% to7% are ideal. The maximum grade for distances greater
than 500 feet is 12%. Maximum grades for distances less than 500 feet are as
follows:
 
Less than 250' 20%
Less than 500' 15%
 
      2.   Long stretches of a steep grade should be avoided. Each stretch of
grade over 12% must be separated by a grade less than 12% for a minimum of 250
feet. The grade should undulate gently to provide natural drainage and to
eliminate monotonous level stretches.
      3.   Grades should be lessened at approaches to switchbacks and the turns
should be as nearly level as practical. Approaches to road crossings should be
nearly level.
   J.   Drainage.
      1.   Drainage requires a special study of precipitation, run-off, springs
and streams in the area. Surface water must be diverted from the trail surface
before it builds up to an erosive force. The method used to drain the trail
will depend on the quantity and speed of the water, the type of soil in the
area, and the grade of the trail. The best and simplest drainage is to slope
the trail surface 2% to 3% to allow the water to sheet off, rather than run in
a stream down the trail. Low grades help prevent drainage problems; steep
grades allow the water to flow faster, building up an erosive force.
      2.   Drainage devices shall not be located in the pathway of the trail.
      3.   Landscaping adjacent to trails can help to facilitate better
drainage. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on the importance of maintaining
the integrity of the trail as part of the landscape design.
   K.   Surfacing materials.
      1.    (See
Appendix B at the end of this chapter.)
      2.   The trail may be treated or surfaced in areas where; the dust caused
by trail use presents a problem, it is needed to prevent erosion, or it is
needed to improve slick or muddy conditions. Surfacing color and type should
always be compatible with the surrounding environment.
   L.   Proximity to roadway. In combined trail systems, the bicycle trail
shall be located closest to a roadway.
   M.   Signalized intersections. Push buttons shall be installed at all
signalized intersections interfacing with trails: one at equestrian height and
another at pedestrian height. Push buttons should be located on the “trail
side” of the signal pole.
   N.   Barriers. To prevent motorized vehicles from using the trails, barriers
(i.e., bollards) shall be placed appropriately at trail entrances.
   O.   Undercrossings.
      1.   Undercrossings shall only be used when safe at-grade crossing is not
feasible.
      2.   The rectangular dimension of a pedestrian culvert should be at least
12 feet high by ten feet wide. The ideal height is 15 feet. Culverts less
than15 feet high, shall have a sign posted that warns riders to dismount and
walk their horses. Undercrossings shall have no bends, be separate from creeks
and have textured surfaces. Adequate drainage and lighting shall be provided as
required for safety.
   P.   Bridges and trestles.
      1.   Bridges/trestles are not usually necessary for crossing water, and
they may be a major expense. They should be used only when there are no
feasible alternatives.
      2.   Prefabricated bridges may be used. The following are minimum bridge/
trestle standards:
         a.   Width:
            Minimum -10 ft.
            Optimum - 20 ft. (i.e., over freeways).
         b.   Side railings: The railings must provide for some type of
physical barrier to prevent one from falling off the bridge or trestle.
         c.   Side railing height: Minimum - 7 ft.
         d.   Camber:
            Slope of bridge: 5% - 8%
            10% maximum for short distances with increased surface texture.
         e.   Surface: Non-skid, textured (i.e. rubber, wood, cement).
         f.    Bridges should never be completely enclosed as that may cause
horses to spook.
   Q.   Water crossing. (See
Appendix D at the end of this chapter.) When surface flows or subterranean
springs are intercepted by a trail, a water culvert may be placed perpendicular
to the trail in such a manner to redirect the water and divert it to the
downhill side of the trail. All culvert outflows shall be directed into the
natural watercourse of the intercepted flow. The size of the culvert should be
sufficient to adequately carry the maximum peak flow of water anticipated and
promote self-cleaning.
(Ord. 3182, passed 5-15-2012)
Appendix A.   Trail Dimensions and Types.

   J.   No installation of non-recirculating water systems in commercial car
wash and laundry systems.
   K.   No installation or operation of single pass cooling system.
   L.   Commercial car wash system. Effective January 1, 2012, all commercial
conveyor car wash systems must have installed operational re-circulating water
systems or must have secured a waiver of this requirement from the City. (Ord.
3299 § 1 (part), 2021)
12.06.070.   Levels of declared water supply shortage.
   The City Manager has authorization to require or impose reductions in the
use of water if such reductions are necessary to comply with Water Supply
Shortage conditions as defined in the City WSCP.
   The WCSP defines the shortage response actions that align with each Level of
Water Supply Shortage and include, at a minimum, all of the following:
   A.   Locally appropriate supply augmentation actions.
   B.   Locally appropriate demand reduction actions to adequately respond to
shortages.
   C.   Locally appropriate operational changes.
   D.   Additional, mandatory prohibitions against specific water use practices
in addition to state-mandated prohibitions and appropriate to the local
conditions.
   E.   For each action, an estimate of the extent to which implementation of
the action will reduce the gap between supplies and demand.
   F.   Each elevated shortage level will include the elements of the previous
shortage level(s), including the mandatory restrictions on water waste detailed
in the WSCP. Each elevated shortage level is intended to be more restrictive
than the previous level(s).
   G.   As deemed necessary, the City may implement an allocation of water
supply under a water supply emergency condition beyond WSCP defined actions
when water supply conditions dictate necessity. (Ord. 3299 § 1 (part), 2021)
12.06.080.   Hardship waiver.
   A.   Undue and Disproportionate Hardship. If, due to unique circumstances, a
specific requirement of this chapter would result in undue hardship to a person
using water or to property upon which water is used disproportionate to the
impacts to water users generally or to similar property of classes of water
users, then the person may apply for a waiver to the requirements as provided
in this section.
   B.   Written Finding. The City may grant or conditionally grant the waiver
only upon a written finding of the existence of facts demonstrating an undue
hardship to a person using water or to property upon which water is used
disproportionate to the impacts to water users generally or to similar property
or classes of water use due to specific and unique circumstances of the user or
the user's property.
   C.   Application. Applicants must request a waiver on a form prescribed by
the City.
   D.   Supporting Documentation. Photographs, maps, drawings and other
information, including a written statement of the applicant as required by the
City, must accompany the application.
   E.   Required Findings for Waiver. The City Manager, or their designee, may
grant a waiver if the City Manager, or their designee, finds, based on the
information provided in the application and supporting documents, or such
additional information as requested, and on water use information for the
property as shown by the records of the City or its agent, all of the
following:
      1.   That the waiver does not constitute a grant of special privilege
inconsistent with the limitations upon other residents and businesses.
      2.   That because of special circumstances applicable to the property or
its use, the strict application of this chapter would have a disproportionate
impact on the property of use that exceeds the impacts to residents and
businesses generally.
      3.   That the authorizing of such waiver will not impose substantial
detriment to adjacent properties, will not materially affect the ability of the
City to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and will not be detrimental to
the public interest.
      4.   That the condition or situation of the subject property or the
intended use of the property for which the waiver is sought is not common,
recurrent or general in nature.
   F.   Approval Authority. The City Manager or their designee must act upon
any completed application no later than ten business days after submittal and
may approve, conditionally approve or deny the waiver. The City must promptly
notify the applicant requesting the waiver in writing of any action taken.
Unless specified otherwise at the time of waiver approval, the waiver will
apply to the subject property during the period of the mandatory water supply
shortage condition. The decision of the City Manager will be final. (Ord. 3299
§ 1 (part), 2021)

prohibited.
   F.   The use of biological additives for grease remediation or as a
supplement to interceptor maintenance, without prior authorization from the FOG
Control Program Manager, is prohibited.
   G.   Discharge of wastes from toilets, urinals, wash basins, and other
fixtures containing fecal materials to sewer lines intended for grease
interceptor service, or vice versa, is prohibited.
   H.   Discharge of any waste including FOG and/or solid materials removed
from the grease control device to the sewer system is prohibited. Grease
removed from grease interceptors shall be wastehauled periodically as part of
the operation and maintenance requirements for grease interceptors.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.060.    FOG Wastewater Discharge Permit required.
   A.   No person shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, any wastewater
from Food Service Establishments directly or indirectly into the sewer system
without first obtaining a FOG Wastewater Discharge Permit pursuant to this
Chapter. Within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this Chapter, all
Food Service Establishments in the City shall file a FOG Wastewater Discharge
Permit Application with the City on a form approved by the City for such
purpose. Except Limited Food Preparation Establishments, as defined in Section
12.20.020(C), which are not subject to the provisions of this Chapter, any
person who wishes to open or operate a new Food Service Establishment following
the effective date of this Chapter shall apply for and obtain a FOG Wastewater
Discharge Permit prior to opening or operating such Food Service Establishment
as provided for below.
   B.   There shall be four types of FOG Discharge Permits granted to Food
Service Establishments by the City:
      1.   Interim Permit: Upon the effective date of this Chapter, all Food
Service Establishments in the City of Fullerton will be subject to the
conditions for a FOG Discharge Permit as described in this Chapter. For a
period of eighteen (18) months following adoption, all Food Service
Establishments will be granted a blanket General Interim Permit until such time
as they are inspected by the City's FOG Control Program staff. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each Food Service Establishment shall comply with the provisions
of Section 12.20.060A, and prior to the expiration of the eighteen month
interim permit period, each Food Service Establishment must have obtained a
formal Regular, Conditional or Variance permit in order to continue discharging
wastewater to the City's sewer system;
      2.   Regular Permit: A permit issued upon the proper installation and
maintenance of a grease interceptor as described in Section 12.10.070 below;
      3.   Conditional Permit: A permit issued upon implementation of Kitchen
Best Management Practices and/or alternative pretreatment technology that is,
at least, equally effective in controlling the FOG discharge in lieu of a
grease interceptor, as described in Section 12.10.074 below;
      4.   Variance: Where it is impossible or impracticable to install,
operate or maintain a grease interceptor, a Food Service Establishment may
apply for a Variance as described in Section 12.20.080 below.
   Proper installation and maintenance of a grease interceptor and application
for a Regular Permit shall be the standard method of compliance with this
chapter. However, existing Food Service Establishments that do not have grease
interceptors may meet the requirements of this chapter by obtaining a
Conditional Permit or a Variance as described below.
   C.   FOG Wastewater Discharge Permits shall be expressly subject to all
provisions of this Chapter and all other regulations, charges for use, and fees
established by the City. The conditions of FOG Wastewater Discharge Permits
shall be enforced by the City in accordance with this Chapter and applicable
State and Federal Regulations.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.070.    Regular Permit.
   Food Service Establishments are required to install, operate and maintain an
approved type and adequately sized grease interceptor necessary to maintain
compliance with the objectives of this Chapter. The grease interceptor shall be
adequate to separate and remove FOG contained in wastewater discharges from
Food Service Establishments prior to discharge to the sewer system. Fixtures,
equipment, and drain lines located in the food preparation and clean up areas
of Food Service Establishments that are sources of FOG discharges shall be
connected to the grease interceptor. Application of this requirement shall be
as follows:
   A.   New Construction of Food Service Establishments. Each newly constructed
Food Service Establishment shall include and install grease interceptors prior
to commencing discharges of wastewater to the sewer system, unless it obtains a
variance, as specified in Section 12.20.080.
   B.   Existing Food Service Establishments.
      1.   An existing Food Service Establishment, which has caused or
contributed to a grease-related blockage in the sewer system or which has been
determined to contribute significant FOG to the system based on inspection or
sampling, shall be deemed to have reasonable potential to adversely impact the
sewer system or have sewer laterals connected to hot spots, as determined by
the FOG Control Program Manager, and shall be required to install a grease
interceptor within 180 days of an order from the FOG Control Program Manager in
the absence of grant of a variance as specified in Section 12.20.080.
      2.   Existing Food Service Establishments undergoing remodeling or a
change in operations as defined in Section 12.20.020 of this Chapter, or Food
Service Establishments that change ownership, shall be required to install a
grease interceptor, subject to the variance provisions of Section 12.20.080.
      3.   An Existing Food Service Establishment which has neither been
specifically ordered by the FOG Control Program Manager to install a grease
interceptor, nor has obtained a Conditional Permit or a Variance Permit as
provided in this Chapter by the termination of its Interim Permit, shall comply
with all requirements of this Chapter and shall obtain a Regular Permit by the
time of the expiration of its Interim Permit, or cease all discharges to the
sewer system until it has obtained a Regular Permit, a Conditional Permit or a
Variance pursuant to this Chapter.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.074.   Conditional Permit.
   A.   A Food Service Establishment may submit an application for a
Conditional Permit to avoid compliance with the grease interceptor requirement
to the FOG Control Program Manager. The Food Service Establishment bears the
burden of demonstrating, to the FOG Control Program Manager's reasonable
satisfaction, that the installation of a grease interceptor is not necessary
and that acceptable alternatives such as, but not limited to, installation of a
grease trap or traps and implementation of kitchen Best Management Practices
will be sufficient to prevent significant FOG discharges from the applicant
Food Service Establishment. Upon determination by the FOG Control Program
Manager that a Conditional Permit may be granted, the permit will be issued or
revised to relieve the Food Service Establishment from the grease interceptor
requirement. Terms and conditions for issuance of a Conditional Permit to a
Food Service Establishment shall be set forth in the permit.
   B.   The Conditional Permit shall be valid only so long as the Food Service
Establishment remains in compliance with all other requirements of this
Chapter, including, but not limited to, the requirements to apply for a new or
renewed FOG Wastewater Discharge Permit and to implement Best Management
Practices.
   C.   A Conditional Permit may be suspended or revoked at any time when any
of the terms and conditions for its issuance is not satisfied or if the
conditions upon which the Conditional Permit was based change so that the
justification for the exception no longer exists. Appeal of any suspension or
revocation may be had, as provided in Sections 12.20.330 and 12.20.340.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.080.   Variance.
   A.   Variance from Grease Interceptor Requirements. An existing Food Service
Establishment may obtain a variance from the grease interceptor requirement to
allow alternative pretreatment technology that is at least equally effective in
controlling the FOG discharge in lieu of a grease interceptor, if the Food
Service Establishment demonstrates that it is impossible or impracticable to
install, operate or maintain a grease interceptor. The FOG Control Program
Manager's determination to grant a variance will be based upon, but not limited
to, evaluation of the following conditions:
      1.   There is no adequate space for installation and/or maintenance of a
grease interceptor.
      2.   There is no adequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing
fixtures and the grease interceptor and/or between the grease interceptor and
the private collection lines or the public sewer.
      3.   The Food Service Establishment can demonstrate that the alternative
pretreatment technology is equivalent or better than a grease interceptor in
controlling its FOG discharge. In addition, the Food Service Establishment must
be able to demonstrate, after installation of the proposed alternative
pretreatment, its effectiveness to control FOG discharge through downstream
visual monitoring of the sewer system, for at least three months, at its own
expense. A variance may be granted if the results show no visible accumulation
of FOG in its lateral and/or tributary downstream sewer lines.
      4.   The Food Service Establishment installs grease trap(s), as specified
in Section 12.20.220.
      5.   The Food Service Establishment agrees to be placed at the Tier II
rate (high volume discharge rate) of the Sewer Service Surcharge Fee Schedule
for Food Service Establishments to cover the City's costs for additional
inspection and line cleaning.
   B.   Period of Validity. The variance shall be valid only so long as the
Food Service Establishment remains in compliance with all requirements of this
Chapter, including, but not limited to, the requirements to apply for a new or
renewed FOG Wastewater Discharge Permit and to implement Best Management
Practices. The variance may be suspended or revoked if any of the terms and
conditions for its issuance are not satisfied. Appeal of any suspension or
revocation may be had as provided in sections 12.20.330 and 12.20.340.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.090.   Best Management Practices required.
   All Food Service Establishments shall implement Best Management Practices in
their operations to minimize the discharge of FOG to the sewer system. General
requirements for Best Management Practices are set forth in section 12.20.240,
and more detailed requirements may be specified in the permit.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.100.   FOG pretreatment required.
   All Food Service Establishments shall provide wastewater acceptable to the
City, under the requirements and standards established in this Chapter before
discharging to any public sewer.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.110.   Revocation of Conditional Permit or Variance.
   A Conditional Permit or Permit Variance may be revoked at any time as
provided in this Chapter if the Food Establishment fails to meet any of the
conditions set forth in its Discharge Permit. A Food Service Establishment
whose Conditional Permit or Variance has been revoked will be required, at a
minimum, to install and maintain grease interceptors and re-apply for a Regular
Permit.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.120.   Commercial properties.
   Property owners of commercial properties or their official designee(s) shall
be responsible for the installation and maintenance of the grease interceptor
serving multiple Food Service Establishments that are located on a single
parcel.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.130.   Sewer system overflows, public nuisance, abatement orders and
cleanup costs.
   Notwithstanding the granting of an Interim or other Permit as provided in
Section 12.20.060-12.20.080, Food Service Establishments found to have
contributed to a sewer blockage, SSOs or any sewer system interferences
resulting from the discharge of wastewater or waste containing FOG, shall be
ordered to install and maintain a grease interceptor within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the FOG Manager's order, and may be subject to a plan to abate
the nuisance and prevent any future health hazards created by sewer line
failures and blockages, SSOs or any other sewer system interferences. SSOs may
cause injury to public health, safety, and welfare and threaten life and
property and are hereby declared public nuisances. Furthermore, sewer lateral
failures and SSOs caused by Food Service Establishments alone or collectively,
are the responsibility of the private property owner or Food Service
Establishment, and individual(s) as a responsible officer or owner of the Food
Service Establishment. If the City must act immediately to contain and clean up
an SSO caused by blockage of a private or public sewer lateral or system
serving a Food Service Establishment, or at the request of the property owner
or operator of the Food Service Establishment, or because of the failure of the
property owner or Food Service Establishment to abate the condition causing
immediate threat of injury to the health, safety, welfare, or property of the
public, the City's costs for such abatement shall be entirely borne by the
property owner or operator of the Food Service Establishment, and individual(s)
as a responsible officer or owner of the Food Service Establishment(s) and
shall constitute a debt to the City and become due and payable upon the City's
demand for reimbursement of such costs. The owner or operator of any Food
Service Establishment which has caused or contributed to a Sanitary Sewer
Overflow shall immediately notify the County of Orange Health Department.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.140.   FOG Wastewater Discharge Permit application.
   A.   Any person required to obtain a FOG Wastewater Discharge Permit shall

      2.   Tier II: A fee charged to those Food Service Establishments that do
not or cannot fully comply with this Chapter and which discharge a volume of
FOG in excess of those Food Service Establishments which fall in Tier 1 (High
Volume Dischargers). The quantity of FOG discharge shall be determined by the
FOG Control Program Manager through inspection or other means. After one year
of being assigned to the Tier II level, a Food Service Establishment's fee
level may be returned to the Tier I level if it can demonstrate, to the
reasonable satisfaction of the FOG Control Program Manager, that it is no
longer discharging an excessive amount of FOG into the City sewer system.
Assignment to the Tier II level in no way relieves a Food Service Establishment
of implementing the structural and/or non-structural source control measures
necessary to comply with this Chapter.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.170.   FOG Wastewater Discharge Permit modification of terms and
conditions.
   A.   The terms and conditions of an issued permit may be subject to
modification and change by the sole determination of the FOG Control Program
Manager during the life of the permit based on:

Program Manager to submit waste analysis plans, contingency plans, and meet
other necessary requirements to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the
grease control device or grease interceptor and compliance with this Chapter.
   E.   No Food Service Establishment shall increase the use of water or in any
other manner attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute
for treatment to achieve compliance with this Chapter and the FOG Wastewater
Discharge Permit.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.240.   Requirements for Best Management Practices.
   A.   All Food Service Establishments shall implement best management
practices in accordance with the requirements and guidelines established by the
City under its FOG Control Program in an effort to minimize the discharge of
FOG to the sewer system.
   B.   Best Management Practices shall include, at a minimum, installation of
drain screens, segregation and collection of waste cooking oil, and proper
management, disposal of food waste into the trash or garbage, maintenance of

specified in the FOG Wastewater Discharge Permit.
   C.   All Food Service Establishments shall provide employee training within
180 days of the effective date of the Ordinance adopting this Chapter, to all
new employees within ten days of their employment, and to all employees twice
each calendar year, on the Best Management Practices. Training shall be
documented and employee signatures retained indicating each employee's
attendance and understanding of the practices reviewed. Training records shall
be available for review upon request by the FOG Control Program Manager or an
authorized inspector.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.250.   Grease interceptor maintenance requirements.
   A.   Grease Interceptors shall be maintained in efficient operating
condition by periodic removal of the full content of the interceptor which
includes wastewater, accumulated FOG, floating materials, sludge and solids.
   B.   All existing and newly installed grease interceptors shall be
maintained in a manner consistent with a maintenance frequency approved by the
FOG Control Program Manager pursuant to this section.
   C.   No FOG that has accumulated in a grease interceptor shall be allowed to
pass into any sewer lateral, sewer system, storm drain, or public right of way
during maintenance activities.
   D.   Food Service Establishments with grease interceptors may be required to
submit data and information necessary to establish the maintenance frequency
grease interceptors.
   E.   The maintenance frequency for all Food Service Establishments with a
grease interceptor shall be determined in one of the following methods:
      1.   Grease interceptors shall be fully pumped out and cleaned at a
frequency such that the combined FOG and solids accumulation does not exceed
25% of the total liquid depth of the grease interceptor. This is to ensure that
the minimum hydraulic retention time and required available volume is
maintained to effectively intercept and retain FOG discharged to the sewer
system.
      2.   All Food Service Establishments with a Grease Interceptor shall
maintain their grease interceptor not less than once every six (6) months.
      3.   Grease interceptors shall be fully pumped out and cleaned quarterly
when the frequency described in (1) has not been established. The maintenance
frequency shall be adjusted when sufficient data have been obtained to
establish an average frequency based on the requirements described in (1) and
guidelines adopted pursuant to the FOG Control Program. The City may change the
maintenance frequency at any time to reflect changes in actual operating
conditions in accordance with the FOG Control Program. Based on the actual
generation of FOG from the Food Service Establishment, the maintenance
frequency may increase or decrease.
      4.   The owner/operator of a Food Service Establishment may submit a
request to the FOG Control Program Manager requesting a change in the
maintenance frequency at any time. The Food Service Establishment has the
burden of responsibility to demonstrate that the requested change in frequency
reflects actual operating conditions based on the average FOG accumulation over
time and meets the requirements described in (1), and that it is in full
compliance with the conditions of its permit and this Chapter. Upon
determination by the FOG Control Program Manager that requested revision is
justified, the permit shall be revised accordingly to reflect the change in
maintenance frequency.
      5.   If the grease interceptor, at any time, contains FOG and solids
accumulation that exceeds the maximum allowable limits described in (1), the
Food Service Establishment shall be required to have the grease interceptor
serviced immediately such that all fats, oils, grease, sludge, and other
materials are completely removed from the grease interceptor. If deemed
necessary, the FOG Control Program Manager may also increase the maintenance
frequency of the grease interceptor from the current frequency.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.260.   Monitoring and reporting conditions.
   A.   Monitoring for compliance with permit conditions and reporting
requirements.
   The following may be required by the FOG Control Program Manager when he/she
determines, through inspection, observation, or by evidence of an SSO, that an
FSE is deficient in meeting the requirements of its permit.
      1.   The FOG Control Program Manager may require periodic reporting of
the status of implementation of Best Management Practices, in accordance with
the FOG Control Program.
      2.   The FOG Control Program Manager may require visual monitoring at the
sole expense of the Permittee to observe the actual conditions of the Food
Service Establishment's sewer lateral and sewer lines downstream.
      3.   The FOG Control Program Manager may require reports for self
monitoring of wastewater constituents and FOG characteristics of the Permittee
needed for determining compliance with any conditions or requirements as
specified in the FOG Wastewater Discharge Permit or this Chapter. Monitoring

reports, FOG control monitoring reports, and any other reports deemed
reasonably appropriate by the FOG Control Program Manager to ensure compliance
with this Chapter.
   B.   Record Keeping Requirements.
   The Permittee shall be required to keep all manifests, receipts and invoices
of all cleaning, maintenance, grease removal of/from the grease control device,
disposal carrier and disposal site location for no less than two years. The
Permittee shall, upon request, make the manifests, receipts and invoices
available to any City representative or inspector, including an OCHCA
inspector. These records may include:
      1.   A logbook of grease interceptor, grease trap or grease control
device cleaning and maintenance practices.

Manager to ensure compliance with this Chapter.
   C.   Falsifying Information or Tampering with Process.
   It shall be unlawful to make any false statement, representation, record,
report, plan or other document that is filed with the City, to destroy any
record required to be maintained by this Chapter, or to tamper with or
knowingly render inoperable any grease control device, monitoring device or
method or access point required under this Chapter.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.270.   Inspection and sampling conditions.
   A.   The FOG Control Program Manager may inspect or order the inspection
and/or the sampling of the wastewater discharges of any Food Service
Establishment to ascertain whether the intent of this Chapter is being met and
the Permittee is complying with all requirements. The Permittee shall allow the
City access to the Food Service Establishment premises, during normal business
hours, for purposes of inspecting the Food Service Establishment's grease
control devices or interceptor, reviewing the manifests, receipts, records and
invoices relating to the cleaning, maintenance and inspection of the sewer
conveyance systems, grease control devices or interceptor.
   B.   The FOG Control Program Manager shall have the right to place or order
the placement on the Food Service Establishment's property or other locations
as determined by the FOG Control Program Manager, such devices as are necessary
to conduct sampling or metering operations. Where a Food Service Establishment
has security measures in force, the Permittee shall make necessary arrangements
so that representatives of the City shall be permitted to enter without delay
for the purpose of performing their specific responsibilities.
   C.   In order for the FOG Control Program Manager to determine the
wastewater characteristics of the discharger for purposes of determining the
annual use charge and for compliance with permit requirements, the Permittee
shall make available for inspection and copying by the City all notices,
monitoring reports, waste manifests, receipts, invoices and records including,
but not limited to, those related to wastewater generation, and wastewater
disposal without restriction but subject to the confidentiality provision set
forth in this Chapter. All such records shall be kept by the Permittee a
minimum of two (2) years.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.280.   Right of entry.
   Persons or occupants of Food Service Establishments, whether or not
permitted, where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the FOG
Control Program Manager, or designated City representatives, reasonable access
to all parts of the wastewater generating and disposal facilities of such
establishment for the purposes of inspection and sampling during all times the
discharger's facility is open, operating, or any other reasonable time. No
person shall interfere with, delay, resist or refuse entrance to City
representatives attempting to inspect any facility involved directly or
indirectly with a discharge of wastewater to the City's sewer system. In the
event of an emergency involving an actual or imminent sanitary sewer overflow,
City representatives may access adjoining businesses or properties which share
a sewer conveyance system with a Food Service Establishment in order to prevent
or remediate an actual or imminent sanitary sewer overflow.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.290.   Emergency notification requirements.

reasonable opportunity to know that his/her/its discharge will exceed the
discharge provisions of the FOG Wastewater Discharge Permit or this Chapter,
the discharger shall immediately notify the City by telephone at the number
specified in the Permit. If the material discharged to the sewer has the
potential to cause or result in sewer blockages or SSOs, the discharger shall
immediately notify the Orange County Health Department, and the City.
   B.   Confirmation of this notification shall be made in writing to the FOG
Control Program Manager at the address specified in the Permit no later than
five (5) working days from the date of the incident. The written notification
shall state the date of the incident, the reasons for the discharge or spill,
what steps were taken to immediately correct the problem, and what steps are
being taken to prevent the problem from recurring.
   C.   Such notification shall not relieve the Permittee of any expense, loss,
damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage or loss
to the City or any other damage or loss to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the Permittee of any fees or other liability which may be
imposed by this Chapter or other applicable law.
(Ord. 3051 § 1 (part), 2004).
12.20.300.   Purposes and scope.

laws, regulations, and rules imposed upon it by Regulatory Agencies and to
ensure that the City's sewer facilities are protected and are able to operate
with the highest degree of efficiency, and to protect the public health and
environment, specific enforcement provisions must be adopted to govern the
discharges to the City's system by Food Service Establishments.
   B.   To ensure that all interested parties are afforded due process of law
and that violations are resolved as soon as possible, the general policy of the
City is that:
      1.   Any determination relating to a notice of violation and Compliance

Program Manager will be heard and a recommendation made to the City Manager or
other person designated by the City Manager with a right of appeal of the City
Manager's order by the permittee to the City Council pursuant to the provisions
of Section 12.20.420.

provisions of this Ordinance may be determined by an inspection of grease
control device, grease interceptor and associated manifest and documentation;
and analysis of a grab or composite sample of the effluent of a Food Service
Establishment.
      3.   Any sample taken from a sample point is considered to be
representative of the discharge to the public sewer.

(Ord. 1506 § 2 (part), 1967).
14.01.015   Flood zone development.
   A.   General Provisions.
      1.   Statutory Authority. The Legislature of the State of California has,
in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800, conferred upon local
governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
      2.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable
regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and
privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide [i.e. mudflow] or flood
related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:
         a.   Protect human life and health;
         b.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
         c.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
         d.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
         e.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
         f.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
blighted areas caused by flood damage;
         g.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard;
         h.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      3.   Findings of Fact.
         a.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Fullerton are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
         b.   These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect
of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights
and velocities also contributes to flood losses.
      4.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed,
located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms
of this section and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements
(including violations of conditions and safeguards) shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Fullerton from taking
such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
      5.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This section is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing ordinances including land development
regulations, subdivision regulations, zoning ordinances, stormwater management
regulations, or building codes, nor any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. In the event of an overlap or conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, code, regulation, easement, covenant, or deed
restriction, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
      6.   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
         a.   Considered as minimum requirements.
         b.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body.
         c.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
      7.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
section does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or
uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This section shall not create liability on the part of the City of Fullerton,
any officer or employee thereof, the State of California, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this section or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
      8.   Severability. This section and the various parts thereof are hereby
declared to be severable. Should any part of this section be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the section as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
      9.   Applicability.
         a.   Establishment of Flood Hazard Areas. The areas of special flood
hazard identified by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) for Orange County, California and Incorporated Areas,
dated December 3, 2009, and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), and
all subsequent amendments and/or revisions thereto, are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. Maps and studies that
establish flood hazard areas are on file at the City of Fullerton, Public
Works/Engineering Department at 303 West Commonwealth Avenue, Fullerton, CA
92832 and at the FEMA Map Services Center, https://msc.fema.gov.
         b.   Scope. The following rules and regulations shall apply to all
building permits and other permits to perform any work within flood hazard
areas identified in the City of Fullerton.
         c.   Permit Required. A permit shall be obtained before proceeding
with any construction or development, as defined in [14.01.015.B, Definitions],
within any area of special flood hazard established pursuant to Section 9.A
above.

Insurance Rate Map in which flooding occurs during conditions of a one-hundred-
year frequency storm to a depth of from one to three feet, and where the
product of the flood depth, in feet, and the velocity of the floodwaters in
feet per second, is less than fifteen.
      2.   “Base flood” means the flood having a one-percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the “100-year flood”).
      3.   “Base flood elevation” (BFE) means the elevation shown on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map for Zones AE and AH that indicates the water surface
elevation resulting from a flood that has a 1 percent or greater chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
      4.   "Basement" means any portion of a building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
      5.   "Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to, buildings or other structures,
temporary structures, temporary or permanent storage of materials, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavations, drilling operations, flood
control projects, and other land-disturbing activities.
      6.   "Flood or flooding" means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land from (i) the overflow of
inland or tidal waters; (ii) the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of
surface waters from any source.
      7.   "Variance" means a grant of relief by community from the terms and
conditions of the floodplain management regulations.
      8.   “Flood Insurance Rate map” means an official map of the City of
Fullerton on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has

(FIRM), the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM), the water surface elevation
of the base flood and supporting technical data.
      10.   "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and
nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or
eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and
sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents.
      11.   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one
foot. Also referred to as “Regulatory Floodway.”
      12.   "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the
ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls or foundation
of a structure.
      13.   "Historic structure" means any structure that is:

such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.
      15.   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For
floodplain management purposes the term “manufactured home” also includes park
trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for

chassis, 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-
duty truck, and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. A
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use when it is on its wheels or
jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
      20.   “Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area in the floodplain
subject to a 1 percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is
shown on FIRM as Zone A, AO, AE, A99, or, AH.
      21.   “Start of construction” means and includes substantial improvement,
and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within
one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure.
      22.   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally
above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured
home.
      23.   "Substantial Damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
      24.   "Substantial Improvement" means any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, alteration, addition or other improvement of a building or
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value
of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. When the
structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered
substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include either:
         a.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
         b.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
      25.   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development
to be fully compliant with this section or the flood provisions of the building
code, as applicable. A structure or other development without the elevation
certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in
this section is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   C.   Administration.
      1.   The City Engineer, or his/her designee, is hereby appointed to
administer and implement the regulations of this chapter. The City Engineer
shall coordinate with and provide comments to the Building Official to
administer and enforce the flood provisions of the building code and to ensure
compliance with the applicable provisions of these regulations.
      2.   Duties and Responsibilities of the City Engineer shall include, but
not be limited to:
         a.   Review all permit requests for development, construction and
substantial improvements for and to buildings, structures and properties for
compliance with the goals and objectives of the National Flood Insurance
Program;
         b.   Cooperate with Federal, State, and local agencies and private
firms which undertake to study, survey, map and identify floodplain or flood-
related erosion areas, and to cooperate with neighboring communities with
respect to the management of adjoining floodplain and/or flood-related erosion
areas in order to prevent aggravation of existing hazards;
         c.   Notify the Federal Insurance Administrator in writing whenever
the boundaries of the City have been modified by annexation or deannexation;
         d.   Shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source,
until such data has been provided by the Federal Insurance Administration, as
criteria for evaluating new construction, substantial improvements or other
developments in zone A.
         e.   All Letters of Map Change (LOMC) including Letters of Map
Amendment (LOMA) and Letters of Map Revision (LOMR) are approved and included
in the record prior to issuance of building permits. Building Permits shall not
be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Amendment (CLOMA) or Conditional
Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR).
         f.   Require applicants who submit hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering analyses to support permit applications to submit to FEMA, within
six (6) months of availability, the data and information necessary to maintain
the Flood Insurance Rate Maps when the analyses indicate changes in base flood
elevations, flood hazard area boundaries, or floodway designations;
         g.   Amend the floodplain management regulations and notify FEMA, in
order to include all flood-prone areas within newly acquired areas by means of
annexation, incorporation, or otherwise, of another area to enforce the
provisions of this chapter;
         h.   Submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or
scientific data to FEMA for a LOMR, within six (6) months of information
becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first;
         i.   Review all permit applications to determine if the proposed
development in AE zones adversely affects the flood carrying capacity of the
area of special flood hazard. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely affects"
means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with
all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot to any point;
         j.   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the
State Department of Water Resources prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit copies of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).
         k.   Require that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
         l.   Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries. Make interpretations where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in Section G hereof.
         m.   Require applicants who submit hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering analyses to support permit applications to submit to FEMA the data
and information necessary to maintain the Flood Insurance Rate Maps when the
analyses indicate changes in base flood elevations, flood hazard area
boundaries, or floodway designations.
      3.   Duties and Responsibilities of the Building Official shall include,
but not limited to:
         a.   Permit only substantial new development within the AO, A, and AE
zones which is appropriate in light of the probability of flood damage and the
need to reduce flood losses, is an acceptable social and economic use of the
land in relation to the hazards involved and does not increase the danger to
human life;
         b.   Maintain for public inspection records of all permits,
certificates, variances, and pertinent correspondence relative to the review,
approval or denial of all requests for developments and permits within the
flood hazard areas designated as zones AO, A, and AE on the Flood Insurance
Rate Maps;
         c.   Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request, for the
determination of applicable flood insurance risk premium rates within AO, A,
and AE zones, any certificates of floodproofing and information on the
elevation of the level of the lowest floor including the basement, of all new
or substantially improved structures and include whether or not such structures
contain a basement, and if the structure has been floodproofed, the elevations
to which the structure has been floodproofed;
         d.   Substantial improvement and substantial damage determinations.
For applications for building permits to improve buildings and structures,
including alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, additions,
rehabilitations, renovations, substantial improvements, repairs of substantial
damage, and any other improvement of or work on such buildings and structures,
Building Official, shall:
            i.   Estimate the market value, or require the applicant to obtain
an appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser,
of the building or structure before the start of construction of the proposed
work; in the case of repair, the market value of the building or structure
shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any repairs are
made.
            ii.   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to
repair the damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs
of improvements and repairs, when applicable, to the market value of the
building or structure.
            iii.   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage.
            iv.   Notify the applicant when it is determined that the work
constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that
compliance with the flood resistant construction requirements of the building
code is required and notify the applicant when it is determined that work does
not constitute substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage.
         e.   Review all permit applications for substantial improvements or
new construction within the AO, A, and AE zones to determine whether proposed
building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. Upon review of a permit
application, the Building Official may approve the application by his
endorsement of the building permit application or by issuance of an appropriate
permit or certificate, may conditionally approve the permit application, or may
deny the permit.
   D.   Elevation Data. All development or permit applications submitted for
properties within the AO, A, and AE zones shall be accompanied with elevation
data, based upon city datum, showing the property, and the elevation
relationship between the proposed improvement and the depth number (AO) and
base flood elevation (A and AE) shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map. Upon
completion of any such development or improvement, the as-built elevation of
the first floor level and the basement, if any, shall be submitted to the
Building Official. No development, structure, or property improvement shall be
finally approved or accepted until this as-built data has been satisfactorily
submitted and recorded.
   E.   Other Permits Required. The applicant shall obtain all other required
state and federal permits prior to initiating work authorized by these
regulations and shall provide documentation of such permits to the Building
Official. Such permits include but are not limited to the California State
Water Resources Control Board for activities that affect wetlands and alter
surface water flows, in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers;
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
   F.   Development Standards.
      1.   General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazard, all new
construction and substantial improvements, including erection and placement of
prefabricated buildings and manufactured homes shall be:
         a.   designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure or improvement;
         b.   constructed with materials and utility equipment and services
resistant to flood damage;
         c.   constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
         d.   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.
         e.   All new construction and substantial improvements within zones AH
or AO shall be required to have adequate drainage paths on slopes to guide
floodwater around and away from structures.
      2.   Subdivisions.
         a.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
         b.   Where the proposed development is greater than fifty (50) lots or
five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, and base flood elevations are not
included on the FIRM, they shall be determined by the applicant;
         c.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
         d.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided
to reduce exposure to flood damage.
      3.   Utilities. All on-site sewer, water, gas, electrical, and other
utility service and systems, and all repairs, alterations or modifications
thereto within the special flood hazard area shall be constructed and installed
to minimize or eliminate flood damage to them and to minimize or eliminate
infiltration into them. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to
avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding.
      4.   Building Requirements.
         a.   Residential. All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated at least 1 foot above the base flood elevation in AE zone; elevated
above the highest adjacent grade to a height at least 1 foot above the depth
number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least 3 feet above the
highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified in AO zone; elevated to
or above the base flood elevation in A zone (base flood elevation shall be
determined in accordance with Section C.2.d). Upon the completion of the
structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and
verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such
certification and verification shall be provided to the Building Official.
         b.   Nonresidential. All new construction and substantial improvements
of nonresidential structures within flood hazard zones shall either be elevated
to conform with Section 4.a, above or, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level, so that
any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to passage of water, and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
         c.   Manufactured Homes. All new and replacement manufactured homes,
including substantial improvement of manufactured homes installed in flood
hazard zones, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above one foot above the base
flood elevation, and shall be securely fastened to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. Methods
of anchoring are authorized to include, but are not limited to, use of over-
the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind loads and
seismic loads.
      5.   Design. All methods and details of floodproofing nonresidential
structures as required above shall be based upon calculations and design
prepared by a registered civil engineer or architect who shall certify
floodproofing methods are adequate to withstand the flood depth, pressures,
velocities, impact and uplifted forces and other factors associated with depth
of flooding in the AO, A, and AE zones shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
Such certification shall be provided to the Building Official. For all new
construction and substantial improvements, fully enclosed areas below the
lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered design professional or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings on at least two walls
having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot
of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all
openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped
with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they
permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Buildings with more than
one enclosed area must have openings on exterior walls for each area to allow
flood waters to pass automatically.
      6.   Recreational Vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed in flood
hazard zones will either (1) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive
days; or (2) be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or (3) meet the
permit requirements and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
manufactured homes in Section 4.c. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions.
      7.   Floodways. Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to
the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and
erosion potential, the following provisions apply.
         a.   Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction,
substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be
permitted within Zone AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect
of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than 1 foot at any
point within the City of Fullerton.
         b.   Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the City of Fullerton
shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided, demonstrating through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any
increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         c.   If items 7.a and 7.b. above are satisfied, all new construction,
substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with
all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.
   G.   Variance Procedure.
      1.   Variances from the rules and regulations contained herein for the
regulation of construction and building within identified flood hazard areas
may be considered, upon application, in accordance with the following
procedures:
         a.   Form. Any person requesting a variance shall submit a written
application to the Director of Community and Economic Development Department.
The application shall contain all relevant data and shall clearly state the
applicant's basis of appeal.
         b.   A Flood Area Variance Board is appointed, comprised of Planning
Manager, City Engineer, and Building Official. Upon receipt of a request for
variance, Variance Board, or its designees, shall consider the evidence
presented, and based upon the review criteria included in this section, shall
render a decision, and notify the applicant, in writing, of such decision. All
such decisions shall be rendered within thirty days of receipt of the
application.
         c.   An applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice, signed by the Director of Community and Economic Development
Department, of the granting of the variance and any conditions applied thereto
by the Flood Area Variance Board. Such notice shall also contain the fact that
construction below the flood levels indicated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
may increase risk to life and property and may result in increased flood
insurance premium rates.
         d.   When it is alleged there is an error in any decision or
determination made by the team comprised of City Engineer, Building Official,
and Planning Manager, in the interpretation or enforcement of these
regulations, the applicant shall file the written appeal the Director of
Community and Economic Development within fifteen days of the written action.
The application, along with a staff report setting forth the requirements and
other information regarding the requested variance, shall then be sent to the
Planning Commission, who shall hear the appeal. A copy of the report shall also
be sent to the owner or applicant making the appeal at least three days prior
to any hearing or action by the Planning Commission. Upon receipt of the
report, the Planning Commission shall review the matter at its first regular
meeting held, but not less than ten days after its receipt. The decision of the
Planning Commission approving, conditionally approving, or denying the appealed
variance or conditions thereof shall be final unless a further appeal to the
City Council is made within ten days after action by the Planning Commission.
If a further appeal is made, the written appeal shall be filed with the City
Clerk and shall set forth the grounds and reasons for appeal. The City Council
may sustain, modify, or overrule any such requirements, ruling, finding or
disapproval of the Planning Commission. The City Council shall consider such
appeal within thirty days of its filing with the City Clerk. Notification by
mail of the time and place at which the appeal will be considered by Council
shall be sent to the applicant or owner not less than ten days prior to the
meeting at which the appeal will be considered. The decision of the City
Council shall be final, and upon making its decision, the City Clerk shall make
a written report of the outcome directly to the applicant or owner and to the
various City departments.
      2.   Considerations for Issuance of Variances. In reviewing applications
for variances, all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other
requirements of these regulations and the building code, as applicable, and the
following shall be considered:
         a.   The danger to life and property due to possible flooding and
erosion.
         b.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners.
         c.   The importance of the services rendered to the community by the
proposed facility.
         d.   The availability of alternate locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
         e.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         f.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         g.   The expected heights, velocity, and duration of the floodwaters
expected at the site of the proposed development.
         h.   The relationship of the proposed use to the City general plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
         i.   The costs of providing services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public facilities and utilities
such as streets, sewers, water mains, gas and electrical systems.
         j.   The danger that materials and debris from the site may be swept
by floodwaters onto other lands to the detriment and injury of others.
         k.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements, as hereinafter defined, to be erected on a lot or
parcel of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots
or parcels with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, as
shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, providing the above items have been
fully considered. As the lot or parcel size increases beyond the one-half acre,
the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. Upon
consideration of the above factors and any evidence presented by the applicant,
the Flood Area Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this section.
      3.   Requirements for the Granting of Variances. Variances shall only be
issued upon the following:
         a.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         b.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         c.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in hardship to the applicant.
         d.   A determination that the granting of the variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict
with other City codes.
         e.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated AO, A, and AE
zones if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
      4.   A variance shall not be issued for any proposed development in a
floodway when any increase in flood levels would result during the base flood
discharge.
      5.   A variance may be authorized to be issued for the repair,
improvement, or rehabilitation of a historic structure upon a determination
that the proposed repair, improvement, or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
      6.   The Building Official will maintain a permanent record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued to FEMA upon request.

   GRADING PERMIT ISSUANCE
   J112.1 General. The provisions of Section J104 are applicable to grading
permits. No person shall do or cause or permit to be done, on any property
under such person’s control, any grading work between the first day of October
of any year and the 15th day of April of the following year unless there shall
have been first provided on the property to be graded all of the temporary or
permanent protective devices, installations, and measures required to be shown
on the plans for such work by Section 105, with the exception of such grading
work as may be necessary to provide said protection. No person in control of
any such required protection shall fail to maintain it in such a condition that
it will continue to serve its purpose in the same manner as, or better than,
when it was installed. No person shall remove, damage or destroy, or cause or
permit to be removed, damaged or destroyed, except for repair, improvement or
replacement, any such required protection without a written permit from the
Building Official certifying that such protection is no longer reasonably
needed.
   J112.2 Performance Bond. A grading permit shall not be issued for work
which, if not completed in accordance with the approved plans and
specifications, is likely to result in a hazardous condition, unless the
permittee shall first file with the Building Official an agreement in writing
executed by the applicant together with a performance bond in an amount
sufficient to cover the cost of storm protection devices and corrective work
necessary to remove and eliminate all hazards.
   J112.3 Liability Bond. Where the work referred to in Section J112.2, above,
may expose adjacent private or public property to damage or cause injuries or
death to others, the agreement and performance bond shall be accompanied by a
certificate of insurance, verifying Comprehensive General Liability Policy with
minimum combined single limits of $500,000 per occurrence or insured’s current
limits, whichever is greater. The City of Fullerton shall be endorsed as an
additional insured on the policy and said policy shall not be materially
changed or terminated without a minimum of thirty (30) days’ notice in writing
to the City.
   J112.4 Cash Deposit. Where the grading permit approves the export of excess
material away from the site of grading, or approves the import of material to
the site, the Permittee, in addition to compliance with Sections J1113.2 and
J113.3, above, shall, prior to grading permit issuance, obtain in written form
from the Director of Public Works, a permit for such export or import, which
permit shall:
   1.   Set standards and criteria for the hours of operation, routes to be
taken, and traffic control, detour, and safety measures to be undertaken during
the export or import operations;
   2.   Require the Permittee to clean up and remove all spillage or deposits
of dirt, mud, silt, or other materials or debris resulting from the grading and
export or import;
   3.   Require as a guarantee of said cleanup and repair of any City right-of-
way improvement damaged during grading or hauling, the deposit of a cash bond,
in an amount equal to $500 or 5% of the valuation of the export and/or import
yardage. The amount required for this bond may be adjusted as deemed necessary
by the Director of Community Economic Development or the Director of
Engineering. All or any part of said amount may be used by the City to clean up
or repair City streets and easements should the Permittee fail to do as
required above. This cash deposit, less any City expenses and costs, shall be
returned to the Permittee upon satisfactory completion of the grading work
described on the grading permit, together with the City’s release of any bonds
or securities held therefor.
   J112.5 Form. Such agreement performance bond, liability bond or certificate
of insurance, and export/import permit and cash bond shall be in a form, and
executed in a manner, approved by the City Attorney before acceptance thereof
by the Building Official.
   J112.6 Review. Review all proposed grading shall be reviewed by the Director
of Community and Economic Development, Planning Commission, and/or City
Council, as applicable for conformance with the intent and specific
requirements of this Section. Unless specifically waived by the Planning
Commission or City Council because of specific physical constraints or
unaesthetic results, failure to suitably conform to the intent or requirements
of this Section shall be cause for denial of the proposed grading or of the
proposed project of which the proposed grading is a part. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Chapter, any such denial by the Director of Community
and Economic Development is appealable to the Planning Commission, and any such
decision of the Planning Commission is appealable to the City Council. The
decision of the City Council shall be final and shall make reference to
Sections 1094.5 and 1094.6 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.
   J112.7 Contoured Grading.
      J112.7.1 Definition.
      Contour or landform grading utilizes variable slopes designed to simulate
the appearance of and blend into the surrounding natural terrain.
      J112.7.2 Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to preserve the natural
terrain, quality, environment and aesthetic character of the City, while
encouraging creative innovative and safe residential development with a variety
of housing types. This section applies to hillside grading where the City
desires that new grading and construction blend into the existing hillside
environment.
      J112.7.3 Design Objectives. In hillside areas characterized by steep
topography and wildlife habitat, slopes shall be landform graded. Said landform
grading shall utilize individually designed, creative and innovative techniques
to as nearly as possible simulate natural landforms, including variable
horizontal and vertical slope ratios, contour grading, planter pockets, “swale”
and “knob” landforms, extensively rounded “corners”, “blending” with the
natural terrain where applicable, undulating (both vertically and horizontally)
terraces where applicable, and camouflaged down drains. Innovative land
planning, such as single-loaded streets with split level or “upside down”
housing is also encouraged.

or chain link fence, the maximum opening formed by the diagonal members shall
be no more than 2-1/4 inches. Posts shall be spaced at not over eight feet on
center. The bottom wire of a chain link fence shall be staked to the ground,
between support posts, unless provided with a bottom rail or pipe.
      7.   Access gates shall have a width no greater than four feet. Gates
shall be self closing and self-latching and swing in the direction of exit from
the pool area. The latching device shall be capable of keeping the gate
securely latched at all times when not in use.
      8.   The barrier shall be so arranged and constructed so that no
impediment to a required exit is created, and a minimum of a three-foot-wide

Earthquake Hazard Reduction in Existing Buildings, Unreinforced Masonry
Buildings, to read as follows:
"CHAPTER 88
"EARTHQUAKE HAZARD REDUCTION IN
EXISTING BUILDING
"UNREINFORCED MASONRY BUILDINGS
"SECTION 8801. PURPOSE
   "The purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety and welfare by
reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of
earthquakes on unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings and multi-story in-
fill unreinforced masonry buildings constructed prior to 1934. Such buildings
have been widely recognized for sustaining life-hazardous damage, including
partial or complete collapse during moderate to strong earthquakes.
   "The provisions of this chapter are intended as minimum standards for
structural seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of life
loss or injury. Compliance with these standards will not necessarily prevent
loss of life or injury or prevent earthquake damage to rehabilitated buildings.
This chapter does not require alteration of existing electrical, plumbing,
mechanical or fire safety systems unless they constitute a hazard to life or
property as determined by the building official.
   "This chapter provides systematic procedures and standards for
identification and classification of unreinforced masonry bearing wall
buildings based on their present use. Priorities, time periods and standards
are also established under which these buildings are required to be
structurally analyzed and anchored. Where the analysis finds deficiencies, this
chapter requires the building to be strengthened or demolished.
   "Qualified Historical Buildings shall comply with the State Historical
Building Code (SHBC) established under Part 8, Title 24 of the California
Administrative Code.
   "SECTION 8802. SCOPE
   "(a)    GENERAL. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all buildings
constructed or under construction prior to 1934 or for which a building permit
was issued prior to 1934, which on the effective date of this ordinance have
unreinforced masonry bearing walls, frame buildings having unreinforced masonry
in-fill bearing or non-bearing walls, unreinforced hollow clay tile bearing or
non-bearing walls as defined herein.
   "EXCEPTIONS: This chapter shall not apply to detached one- or two-family
dwellings and detached apartment houses containing less than five (5) dwelling
units and used solely for residential purposes.
   "(b)    ALTERATIONS OR ADDITIONS. All buildings which are subject to the
provisions of this chapter may not be added to or structurally altered without
complying in full with all provisions of this chapter for earthquake hazard
reduction.
   "EXCEPTIONS:
   "1.    Single-story buildings having an H/t of 13 or less.
   "2.    The Building Official may determine that the work is minor in nature
and not require full seismic work.
   "(c)    HISTORICAL BUILDINGS. The provisions of Section 8805 apply to
historical buildings except that a demolition order may be stayed provided:
   "1.    the building is vacated, and
   "2.    all utilities are disconnected, and
    "3.    the building has pedestrian protection installed as specified by
Chapter 44, and
   "4.    the property owner has entered into an agreement with the
Redevelopment Agency for restoration and seismic safety of the building.
   "(d)    EFFECTIVE DATES. The provisions of this chapter shall be in effect
upon adoption by the City Council. Specific time frames for enforcement shall
be established by City Council resolution.
   "SECTION 8803. DEFINITIONS.
   "For purposes of this chapter, the applicable definitions in Sections 2302
and 2312 of the 1988 State Building Code and the following shall apply.

provided in Section 8806(b), to the owner of each building within the scope of
this chapter in accordance with the minimum time periods for service of such
orders as set forth in City Council resolution. Upon receipt of a written
request from the owner, the building official shall order a building to comply
prior to the normal service date for such building set forth in this section.
   "(b)    Contents of Order. The order shall be in writing and shall be served
either personally or by certified or registered mail upon the owner as shown on
the last equalized assessment, and upon the person, if any, in apparent charge
or control of the building. The order shall specify that the building has been
determined by the Building Official to be within the scope of this chapter and,
therefore, is required to meet the minimum seismic standards of this chapter.
The order shall specify the rating classification of the building and time
limits for compliance.
   "(c)    Appeal Form Order. The owner or person in charge or control of the

   "(d)    Recordation. At the time that the aforementioned order is served,
the Building Official shall file with the office of the County Recorder a
certificate stating that the subject building is within the scope of Chapter 88
- Earthquake Hazard Reduction in Existing Buildings. The certificate shall also
state that the owner thereof has been ordered to structurally analyze the
building and to structurally alter or demolish it where it is not found to
comply with Chapter 88.
   "If the building is found not to be within the scope of this chapter, or as
a result of structural alterations or an analysis is found to be structurally
capable of resisting minimum seismic forces required by this chapter; or is
demolished; the Building Official shall file with the office of the County
Recorder a certificate terminating the status of the subject building as being
classified within the scope of Chapter 88 - Earthquake Hazard Reduction in
Existing Buildings.
   "(e)    Enforcement. If the owner or other person in charge or control of
the subject building fails to comply with any order issued by the Building
Official pursuant to this chapter within any of the time limits set forth in
City Council resolution, the Building Official shall order the entire building
vacated and remain vacated until such order has been complied with. If
compliance with such order has not been accomplished within 90 days after the
date the building has been ordered vacated, or by such additional time as may
have been granted by (the Appeals Board), the Building Official may order
demolition of the building in accordance with the Uniform Code for the
Abatement of Dangerous Buildings.
    "SECTION 8807. ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
    "(a)    General. Every structure within the scope of this Division shall be
analyzed and reinforced to resist minimum total lateral seismic forces assumed
to act nonconcurrently in the direction of each of the main axes of the
structure in accordance with the following equation:

   "2.    An unreinforced masonry wall which carries no design loads other than
its own weight and has an H/t ratio not exceeding the limitation in Table 88-
G may be considered as veneer if it is adequately anchored to the new
supporting elements.
   "(g)    Combination of Vertical and Seismic Forces.
   "1.    New Materials. All new materials introduced into the structure to
meet the requirements of this section which are subjected to combined vertical
and horizontal forces shall comply with Section 2303(f).
   "2.    Existing Materials. When stresses in existing lateral force resisting
elements are due to a combination of dead loads plus live loads plus seismic
loads, the allowable working stress specified in the Uniform Building Code may
be increased 100 percent. However, no increase will be permitted in the
stresses allowed in Section 8808, and the stress in members due only to seismic
and dead loads shall not exceed the values permitted by Section 2303(d) of the
Uniform Building Code.
   "3.    Allowable Reduction of Bending Stress by Vertical Load. In
calculating tensile fiber stress due to seismic forces required by this
chapter, the maximum tensile fiber stress may be reduced by the full direct
stress due to vertical dead loads.
   "SECTION 8808. MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION
   "(a)    General. All materials permitted by the currently-adopted edition of
the Uniform Building Code including the appropriate allowable stresses and
those existing configurations of materials specified herein may be utilized to

is composed of solid headers extending not less than 4 inches into the backing.
The distance between adjacent full-length headers shall not exceed 24 inch
vertically or horizontally. Where the backing consists of two or more wythes
the header shall extend not less than 4 inches into the most distant wythe, or
the backing wythes shall be bonded together with separate headers whose area
and spacing conform to the foregoing.
   "Tension stresses due to seismic forces normal to the wall may be neglected
if the walls do not exceed the height to thickness ratio in Table No. 88-E and
the in-plane shear stresses due to seismic loads as set forth in Table No. 88-
H.
   "If the wall height-thickness ratio exceeds the specified limits, the wall
may be supported by vertical bracing members designed in accordance with
Section 8807. The deflection of such bracing member at design loads shall not
exceed one-tenth of the wall thickness.
   "EXCEPTION: The wall may be supported by flexible vertical bracing members
designed in accordance with Section 8807(b) if the deflection at design loads
is not less than one-quarter nor more than one-third of the wall thickness.
   "All vertical bracing members shall be attached to floor and roof
construction for their design loads independently of required wall anchors.
Horizontal spacing of vertical bracing members shall not exceed one-half the
unsupported height of the wall nor ten feet whichever is less.
   "The wall height may be measured vertically to bracing elements other than a
floor or roof. Spacing of the bracing elements and wall anchors shall not
exceed four feet. Bracing elements shall be detailed to minimize the horizontal
displacement of the wall by components of vertical displacements of the floor
or roof.
   "2.    Existing Roof, Floors, Walls, Footings and Wood Framing. Existing
materials including wood shear walls utilized in the described configuration
may be used as part of the lateral load resisting system, provided that the
stresses in these materials do not exceed the values shown in Table No. 88-F.
   "(c)    Strengthening of Existing Materials. New materials including wood
shear walls may be utilized to strengthen portions of the existing seismic
resisting system in the described configurations provided that the stresses do
not exceed the values shown in Table No. 88-G.
   "(d)    Alternate Materials. Alternate materials, designs and methods of
construction may be approved by the Building Official in accordance with the
provisions of the Uniform Building Code.
   "(e)    Minimum Acceptable Quality of Existing Unreinforced Masonry Walls.
    "1.    General Provisions. All unreinforced masonry walls utilized to carry
vertical loads and seismic forces parallel and perpendicular to the wall plane
shall be tested as specified in this subsection. All masonry quality shall
equal or exceed the minimum standards established herein or shall be removed
and replaced by new materials. Alternate methods of testing may be approved by
the Building Official. The quality of mortar in all masonry walls shall be
determined by performing in-place shear tests or by testing eight-inch diameter
cores. Alternative methods of testing may be approved by the Building Official.
Nothing shall prevent pointing with mortar of all masonry wall joints before
the tests are first made. Prior to any pointing the mortarjoints must be raked
and cleaned to remove loose and deteriorated mortar. Mortar for pointing shall
be Type S or N except that masonry cements shall not be used. All preparation
and mortar pointing shall be done under the continuous inspection of a
Registered Deputy Building Inspector. At the conclusion of the inspection, the
Inspector shall submit a written report to the licensed engineer and/or
architect responsible for the seismic analysis of the building setting forth
the result of the work inspected. Such report shall be submitted to the
Building Official for approval as part of the structural analysis. All testing
shall be performed in accordance with the requirements specified in this
subsection by a testing agency approved by the Building Official. An accurate
record shall be kept of all such tests and of their locations in the building,
and these results shall be submitted to the Building Official for approval as
part of the structural analysis.
   "2.    Number and Location of Tests. The minimum number of tests shall be
two per wall or line of wall elements resisting a common force; or 1 per 1,500
square feet of wall surfaced, with a minimum of eight tests in any case. The
exact test or core location shall be determined at the building site by the
licensed engineer or architect responsible for the seismic analysis of the
subject building.
   "3.    In-Place Shear Test. The bad joints of the outer wythe of the masonry
shall be tested in shear by laterally displacing a single brick relative to the
adjacent bricks in that wythe. The opposite head joint of the brick to be
tested shall be removed and cleaned prior to testing. The minimum quality
mortar in 80 percent of the shear tests shall not be less than the total of 30
psi plus the axial stress in the wall at the point of the test. The shear
stress shall be based on the gross area of both bed joints and shall be that at
which movement of the brick is first observed. Test locations shall not be
above or below any opening within unsupported height of the wall.
   "4.    Core Tests. A minimum number of mortar test specimens equal to the
number of required cores shall be prepared from the cores and tested as
specified herein. The mortar point of the outer wythe of the masonry core shall
be tested in shear by placing the circular core section in a compression
testing machine with the mortar bed joint rotated 15 degrees from the axis of
the applied load. The mortar joint tested in shear shall have an average
ultimate stress of 20 psi based on the gross area. The average shall be
obtained from the total number of cores made. If test specimens cannot be made
from cores taken, then the shear value shall be reported as zero.
   "(f) Testing of Shear Bolts. One-fourth of all new shear bolts and dowel
embedded in unreinforced masonry walls shall be tested by a Registered Deputy
Building Inspector using a calibrated torque wrench to the following minimum
torques:
   1/2" diameter bolts or dowels - 40 foot-lbs.
   5/8" diameter bolts or dowels - 50 foot-lbs.
   3/4" diameter bolts or dowels - 60 foot-lbs.
   "No bolts exceeding 3/4" shall be used. All nuts shall be installed over
malleable iron or plate washers when bearing on wood and heavy cut washers when
bearing on steel.
   "(g)    Determination of Allowable Stresses for Design Methods Based on Test
Results.
   "1.    Design Shear Values. Design seismic in-plane shear stresses shall be
substantiated by tests performed as specified in Section 8808(e) 3 and 4.
   "Design stresses shall be related to test results obtained in accordance
with Table No. 88-H. Intermediate values between 3 and 10 psi may be
interpolated.
   "2.    Design Compression and Tension Values. Design compression stresses
for unreinforced masonry having a minimum design shear value of 3 psi shall not
exceed 100 psi. Design tension values for unreinforced masonry shall not be
permitted.
   "(h)    Twenty-five percent of the existing rod anchors utilized as all or
part of the required wall anchors shall be tested in pullout by an approved
testing laboratory. The minimum number tested shall be four per floor, with two
tests at walls with joists parallel to the wall. The test apparatus shall be
supported on the masonry wall at a minimum distance of the wall thickness from
the anchor tested. The rod anchor shall be given a preload of 300 lbs. prior to
establishing a datum for recording elongation. The tension test load reported
shall be recorded at one-eighth inch relative movement of the anchor and the
adjacent masonry surface. Results of all tests shall be reported. The report
shall include the test results as related to the wall thickness and joist
orientation. The allowable resistance value of the existing anchors shall be 40
percent of the average of those tested anchors having the same wall thickness
and joist orientation. If more than five percent of the rod anchors tested
fail, all must be tested.
   "(i)    Qualification test for devices used for wall anchorage shall be
tested with the entire tension load carried on the enlarged head at the
exterior face of the wall. Bond on the part of the device between the enlarged
head and the interior wall face shall be eliminated for the qualification
tests. The resistance value assigned the device shall be 20 percent of the
average of the ultimate loads.
   "SECTION 8809. INFORMATION REQUIRED ON PLANS
   "(a)    General. In addition to the seismic analysis required elsewhere in
this Chapter, the licensed engineer or architect responsible for the seismic
analysis of the building shall determine and record the information required by
this Section on the approved plans.
   "(b)    Construction Details. The following requirements with appropriate
construction details shall be made part of the approved plans:
   "1.    All unreinforced masonry walls shall be anchored at the roof level by
tension bolts through the wall as specified in Table 88-G, or by approved
equivalent at a maximum anchor spacing of four feet.
   "All unreinforced masonry walls shall be anchored at all floors with tension
bolts through the wall, by existing rod anchors or by approved equivalent at
the maximum anchor spacing of four feet. All existing rod anchors shall be
secured to the joists to develop the required forces, the method of which is to
be designed and detailed for review by the City of Fullerton Building
Department. The Building Official may require testing to verify the adequacy of
the embedded ends of existing rod anchors. Tests when required shall conform to
Section 8808(h).
   "When access to the exterior face of the masonry wall is prevented by
proximity of an existing building, wall anchors conforming to Items 5 and 6 in
Table No. 88-I may be used.
   "Alternative devices to be used in lieu of tension bolts for masonry wall
anchorage shall be tested as specified in Section 8808(i).
   "2.    Diaphragm chord stresses of horizontal diaphragms shall be developed
in existing materials or by addition of new materials.
   "3.    Where trusses and beams other than rafters, joists, or trusses spaced
at 32 inches on center or less are supported on masonry, ledgers, columns,
ports or beams shall be installed to support vertical loads of the roof or
floor members.
   "EXCEPTION: Where trusses or beams are not embedded in a wall and are
supported by masonry piers which are row-locked into the masonry wall, no
additional support is required when bearing and anchorage can be shown to be
adequate.
   "4.    Parapets and exterior wall appendages not capable of resisting the
forces specified in this chapter shall be removed, stabilized or braced to
ensure that the parapets and appendages remain in their original position.
   "The maximum height of an unbraced, unreinforced masonry parapet above the
lower of either the level of tension anchors or roof sheathing, shall not
exceed one and one-half times the thickness of the parapet wall. If the
required parapet height exceeds this maximum height, a bracing system designed
for the force factors specified in Table No. 88-C and Table No. 23-J for walls
shall support the top of the parapet. Parapet corrective work must be performed
in conjunction with the installation of tension roof anchors.
   "The minimum height of a parapet above the wall anchor shall be 12 inches.
   "EXCEPTION: If a reinforced concrete beam is provided at the top of the
wall, the minimum height above the wall anchor may be 6 inches.
   "Whenever parapets are removed or altered, the minimum height of the parapet
shall be in accordance with Section 1709. Materials used for an extension of
the parapet above the masonry wall shall be as required for the fire
resistivity of the exterior wall. The connection shall be designed to resist
all lateral forces.
   "5.    All deteriorated mortar joints in unreinforced masonry walls shall be
pointed with Type S or M mortar (Masonry cements shall not be used). Prior to
any pointing, the wall surface must be raked and cleaned to remove loose and
deteriorated mortar to a minimum depth of 1/2" from the face of the brick. All
preparation and pointing shall be done under the continuous inspection of a
Registered Deputy Building Inspector certified to inspect masonry. At the
conclusion of the project, the inspector shall submit a written report to the
Building Official setting forth the portion of work inspected. It should be
noted that the presence of the Inspector in no way removes the standard
inspection requirement of the City of Fullerton.
   "6.    Repair details shall be prepared for any cracked or damaged
unreinforced masonry wall required to resist forces specified in this chapter.
   "(c)    Existing Construction. The following existing construction
information shall be made part of the approved plans:
   "1.    The type and dimension of existing walls and the size and spacing of
floor and roof members.
   "2.    The extent and type of existing wall anchorage to floors and roof.
   "3.    The extent and type of parapet corrections, if any, which were
performed in accordance with the Uniform Building Code.
   "4.    Accurately dimensioned floor plans and masonry wall elevations
showing dimensioned openings, piers, wall thickness and heights.
   "5.    The location of cracks or damaged portions of unreinforced masonry
walls requiring repairs.
   "6.    The type of interior wall surfaces and whether the points need
pointing.
   "7.    The general condition of the mortar joints and whether the joints
need pointing.

14.11.020   Chapter 89--Earthquake hazard reduction for existing tilt-up
buildings.
   The 1988 State Building Code is amended by the addition of Chapter 89,
Earthquake Hazard Reduction for Existing Tilt-up Buildings, to read as follows:
"CHAPTER 89
"EARTHQUAKE HAZARD REDUCTION FOR
EXISTING TILT-UP BUILDINGS
"SECTION 8901. PURPOSE
   "The purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety and welfare by
reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of
earthquakes on concrete tilt-up buildings constructed or issued a building
permit prior to the adoption of the 1973 Edition of the Uniform Building Code.
Such buildings have been widely recognized for sustaining life-hazardous
damage, including partial or complete collapse during moderate to strong
earthquakes, due to inadequate wall anchorage to the horizontal diaphragm.
   "The provisions of this chapter are intended as minimum standards for
structural seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of life
loss or injury by the installation of wall anchors and connections to the
horizontal diaphragms. Compliance with these standards will not necessarily
prevent loss of life or injury or prevent earthquake damage to rehabilitated
buildings. This chapter does not require alteration of existing electrical,
plumbing, mechanical or fire safety systems unless they constitute a hazard to
life or property as determined by the Building Official.
   "This chapter provides systematic procedures and standards for
identification and classification of concrete tilt-up wall buildings based on
their present use. Priorities, time periods and standards are also established
under which these buildings are required to be structurally analyzed and
anchored. Where analysis finds deficiencies, this chapter requires the building
to be strengthened or demolished.
   "SECTION 8902. SCOPE
   "(a)    GENERAL. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all buildings
constructed or under construction prior to April 6, 1974 or for which a
building permit was issued prior to April 6, 1974, and which on the effective
date of this ordinance has concrete tilt-up bearing walls as defined herein.
   "(b)    ALTERATIONS OR ADDITIONS. All buildings which are subject to the
provisions of this chapter may not be added to or structurally altered without
complying in full with the provisions of this chapter for earthquake hazard
reductions.
   "EXCEPTION: The Building Official may determine that the proposed work is
minor in nature and essential to the continued business operation and not
require compliance as a condition of permitting the new work.
   "(c)    EFFECTIVE DATES. The provisions of this chapter shall be in effect
upon adoption by the City Council. Specific time frames for enforcement shall
be established by City Council resolution.
   "SECTION 8903. DEFINITIONS
   "For purposes of this chapter, the applicable definitions in Sections 2302
and 2312 of the 1988 State Building Code shall apply. Buildings shall be
defined by occupancy type or function as specified in Table No. 23-K of the
1988 State Building Code.
   "TILT-UP CONCRETE WALL: A concrete wall having all of the following
characteristics:
   "1.    Provides the vertical or lateral support for a floor or roof.
   "2.    The total superimposed vertical load is over 100 pounds per linear
foot or greater.
   "3.    The concrete panels are site cast horizontally and erected by
mechanical means into a vertical position.
   "SECTION 8904. RATING CLASSIFICATIONS
   "The rating classifications shown in Table No. 23-K of the 1988 State
Building Code are hereby established and each building within the scope of this
chapter shall be placed in one such rating classification by the Building
Official. The total occupant load of the entire building as determined by
Section 3302(a) shall be used to determine the rating classification.
   "EXCEPTION: For the purpose of this chapter, portions of building
constructed to act independently when resisting seismic forces may be placed in
separate rating classifications.
   "SECTION 8905. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
   "The owner of each building within the scope of this chapter shall cause a
structural analysis of the building to be made by a civil or structural
engineer or architect licensed by the State of California. If the building does
not meet the minimum earthquake standards specified in this chapter, the owner
shall either cause it to be structurally altered to conform to such standards;
or cause the building to be demolished.
   "The owner of a building within the scope of this chapter shall comply with
the requirements set forth above by submitting to the Building Official for
review within the time limits established by City Council resolution.
   "After plans are submitted and approved by the Building Official, the owner
shall obtain a building permit, commence and complete the required construction
within the time limits established by City Council resolution. These time
limits shall run from the date the order is served in accordance with Section
8906(a) and (b).
   "SECTION 8906. ADMINISTRATION
   "(a)    Service of Order. The Building Official shall issue an order, as
provided in Section 8906(b), to the owner of each building within the scope of
this chapter as specified in the time limits established by City Council
resolution from the effective date of Chapter 89. Upon receipt of a written
request of the owner, the Building Official shall order a building to comply
prior to the normal service date for such building set forth in this section.
   "(b)    Contents of Order. The order shall be in writing and shall be served
either personally or by certified or registered mail upon the owner as shown on
the last equalized assessment, and upon the person, if any, in apparent charge
or control of the building. The order shall specify that the building has been
determined by the Building Official to be within the scope of this chapter and,
therefore, is required to meet the minimum seismic standards of this chapter.
The order shall specify the rating classification of the building and time
limits for compliance.
   "(c)    Appeal Form Order. The owner or person in charge or control of the
building may appeal to the Planning Commission acting as the Board of Appeals
the Building Official's initial determination that the building is within the
scope of this chapter. Such appeal shall be filed with the Board within 60 days
from the service date of the order described in Section 8906(b). Any such
appeal shall be decided by the Board no later than 60 days after the date that
the appeal is filed. Such appeal shall be made in writing upon appropriate
forms provided therefor, by the Building Official and the grounds thereof shall
be stated clearly and concisely. Each appeal shall be accompanied by a filing
fee as set forth in the City Council resolution which establishes fees for
building activities.
   "Appeals and requests for slight modifications from any other
determinations, orders or actions by the Building Official pursuant to this
chapter, shall be made in accordance with the normal appeal procedures
established in this code.
   "(d)    Recordation. At the time that the aforementioned order is served,
the Building Official shall file with the office of the County Recorder a
certificate stating that the subject building is within the scope of Chapter
89. The certificate shall also state that the owner thereof has been ordered to
structurally analyze the building and to structurally alter or demolish it
where it is not found to comply with Chapter 89.
   "If the building is not found to be within the scope of this chapter, or as
a result of structural alterations or an analysis is found to be structurally
capable of resisting minimum seismic forces required by this chapter; or is
demolished; the Building Official shall file with the office of the County
Recorder a certificate terminating the status of the subject building as being
classified within the scope of Chapter 89.
   "(e)    Enforcement. If the owner or other person in charge or control of
the subject building fails to comply with any order issued by the Building
Official pursuant to this chapter within any of the time limits set forth in
the City Council resolution, the Building Official shall order the entire
building vacated and remain vacated until such order has been complied with. If
compliance with such order has not been accomplished within 90 days after the
date the building has been ordered vacated, or by such additional time as may
have been granted by the Board of Appeals, the Building Official may order
demolition of the building in accordance with the Uniform Code for the
Abatement of Dangerous Buildings provisions of this code.
   "SECTION 8907. ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
    "Every structure within the scope of this chapter shall be analyzed and
reinforced to resist minimum total lateral seismic forces as determined in
accordance with Section 2312(h) 2-H and I, of the 1988 edition of the State
Building Code.
   "SECTION 8908. MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION
   "All materials permitted by the currently-adopted edition of the Uniform
Building Code including the appropriate allowable stresses may be utilized to
meet the requirements of this Chapter.
   "SECTION 8909. INFORMATION REQUIRED ON PLANS
   "(a)    General. In addition to the seismic analysis required elsewhere in
this Chapter, the licensed engineer or architect responsible for the seismic
analysis of the building shall determine and record the information required by
this Section on the approved plans.
   "(b)    Plans and Specifications. Plans, engineering calculations, diagrams
and other data shall be submitted in two or more sets with each application for
a building permit.
   "(c)    Information on Plans and Specifications. Plans and specifications
shall be drawn to scale upon substantial medium and shall be of sufficient
clarity to indicate the location, nature and extent of the work proposed and
show in detail that it will conform to the provisions of this Chapter and all
relevant codes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. Plans for buildings
shall also indicate how required structural and fire-resistive integrity will
be maintained where a penetration will be made for electrical, mechanical,
plumbing and communication conduits, pipes and similar systems.
   "(d)    Existing Construction. The following existing construction
information shall be made part of the approved plans:
   "1.    The type and dimension of existing walls and the size and spacing of
floor and roof members.
   "2.    The extent and type of existing wall anchorage to floors and roof

non-discretionary permit within 3 business days for over-the-counter
applications or within 5 business days for electronically filed applications. A
building official may require an applicant to apply for an administrative
conditional use permit if the official finds, based on substantial evidence,
that the solar energy system could have a specific, adverse impact upon the
public health and safety. Such decisions may be appealed to the Planning
Commission.
   B.   Review of the application shall be limited to the building official’s
review of whether the applicant meets local, State and Federal health and
safety requirements.
   C.   If an administrative conditional use permit is required, a building
official may deny an application for the use permit if the official makes
written findings based upon substantive evidence in the record that the
proposed installation would have a specific, adverse impact upon public health
or safety and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid
the specific, adverse impact. Such findings shall include the basis for the
rejection of the potential feasible alternative for preventing the adverse
impact. Such decisions may be appealed to the Planning Commission.
   D.   Any condition imposed on an application shall be designed to mitigate
the specific, adverse impact upon health and safety at the lowest possible

Building and Safety Division of the Community Development Department. An
applicant’s electronic signature will be accepted on all forms, applications,
and other documents in lieu of a wet (ink) signature.
   C.   The Building Official, or designee, will adopt a checklist of all
requirements with which the Electric Vehicle Charging Station and/or Hydrogen
Fueling Station must comply to be eligible for expedited review. The electric 5
2 6 7 vehicle permit process, standard(s) and checklist(s) may refer to the
recommendations contained in the most current version of the “Zero-Emission
Vehicles in California: Community Readiness Guidebook” published by the Office
of Planning and Research, including the checklist and standards contained in
the “Plug-In Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Permitting Checklist.” The City’s
adopted checklist shall be published on the City’s website.

pursuant to this Chapter. A completed application does not authorize an
applicant to energize or utilize an Electric Vehicle Charging Station and/or
Hydrogen Fueling Station until approval and all necessary permits are granted
by the City.
(Ord.3332 § 2 (part), 2024)
14.30.060.   Permit review requirements and appeals.
   A.   Review of an Electric Vehicle Charging Station or Hydrogen Fueling
Station Permit application is limited to whether the application meets local,
state, and federal health and safety requirements. If the application meets the
requirements of the approved checklist and standards, and the proposed Electric
Vehicle Charging Station and/or Hydrogen Fueling Station does not pose any
specific, adverse impact upon public health or safety, the Building Official
must approve the application.
   B.   If the Building Official determines, based on the application, that the
proposed Electric Vehicle Charging Station and/or Hydrogen Fueling Station
could have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health and safety, the
Building Official may require an “Electric Vehicle Charging Station Use Permit”
or a “Hydrogen Fueling Station Use Permit.” The permit may include conditions
designed to mitigate the specific, adverse impact upon health and safety at the
lowest possible cost.
   C.   The Building Official must notify an applicant whether the application
has been approved, or, alternatively, whether the applicant must obtain an
“Electric Vehicle Charging Station Use Permit” or a “Hydrogen Fueling Station
Use Permit”, within 30 days after the submission of a complete application.
Notwithstanding the expedited permit processing set forth in this Chapter, the
Building Official retains authority at all times to identify and address higher
priority life-safety situations.
   D.   An application for an “Electric Vehicle Charging Station Use Permit” or
a “Hydrogen Fueling Station Use Permit” can only be denied if the Building
Official finds that (1) the proposed installation would have a specific,
adverse impact upon public health or safety, and (2) there is no feasible
method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the adverse impact. These findings
must be presented in writing, must include the basis for the rejection of the
potential feasible alternative for preventing the adverse impact, and must be
based upon substantial evidence in the record.
   E.   An application is considered approved if, within 20 business days for
up to 25 stations and 40 business days for more than 25 stations after being
deemed complete, the following actions have not occurred: the City has not
given its approval; the building official has not identified any potential
public health or safety risks or requested a use permit; the permit has not
been denied, and; no appeal has been filed with the City's planning commission.
   F.   A feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific,
adverse impact may include, but is not limited to, any cost-effective method,
condition, or mitigation imposed by the City on a prior successful application
for an “Electric Vehicle Charging Station Use Permit” or a “Hydrogen Fueling
Station Use Permit”, where the proposed Charging Station is similarly situated
to the Charging Station in that prior successful application.
   G.   Any decision by the Building Official or his/her designee made pursuant
to this Chapter may be appealed to the Planning Commission in accordance with
the procedure set forth in Title 15 of the Fullerton Municipal Code.

location, size and capacity, public service facilities such as streets, drains
and sewers, in order to adequately and permanently meet the ultimate
requirements as determined by a defined intensity and type of land use; to
require an orderly arrangement of essential related facilities with particular
reference to the traffic pattern and well designed off-street parking areas

establish the geographical location and boundaries of the areas or zones to
which the different classifications will apply.

areas, yards and open spaces, and building forms as a means of providing a
suitable environment for living, business and industry, to ensure compatibility
with the existing development context, and for the purpose of maintaining
reasonable population densities and reasonable intensities of land use all for
the general purpose of conserving public health, safety, morals, conveniences
and general welfare. It is the intent of the City Council in adopting this
title to retain and to use all power delegated to the City by the state of
California.
(Ord. 3229 (part), 2016; Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.08.020. Zone classifications and degree of restrictiveness.
   A.   In order to accomplish the purpose of this chapter, 26 use
classifications are established in each of which regulations are prescribed
concerning the permissible uses, the height and bulk of buildings, the area of
yards and other open spaces about buildings, and density of population. Such
classifications are known as follows:

restrictive.
      2.   All other uses are less restrictive in the order they are first
permitted in the zones in the following sequence: PRD, R-2P, R-2, R-G, R-3R, R-
3P, R-3, R-4, R-5, O-P, C-G, C-3, C-M, M-P, and M-G.
   C.   Except as provided in this title, no building shall be erected,
reconstructed or structurally altered, nor shall any building or land be used
for any purpose except as hereinafter specifically provided and allowed in the
same zone in which such building, land or use is located or proposed to be
located.
(Ord. 3232 (part), 2016; Ord. 3229 (part), 2016; Ord. 3222 § 3, 2015; Ord.
2982, 2001).
15.08.040. Establishment of zone classifications by Zoning Map.
   The location and boundaries of the various zones are such as are shown and
delineated on the "Zoning Map" of the City of Fullerton as adopted originally
by Ordinance No. 475 and subsequently amended and which map, by reference, is
made a part of this chapter.
(Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.08.050. Required lot area shown on Zoning Map.
   Where a number follows the zoning symbol on the Zoning Map, it shall
represent the number of thousands of square feet of area required in lieu of
the minimum areas established in each zone as herein defined. Pursuant to §
15.17.050 no new lot shall be created in any R-1 or R-1P zone which is less in
area than the minimum lot size indicated on the city's official Zoning Map for
the area in which it is located, except as provided in Title 16 of the
Fullerton Municipal Code. If no number follows the zoning symbol, the areas
prescribed in the chapter governing such zone shall apply. The minimum lot
sizes as shown on the Zoning Map are further defined as follows:
   R-1-6 – minimum lot size of 6,000 square feet.
   R-1-7.2 – minimum lot size of 7,200 square feet.
   R-1-8 – minimum lot size of 8,000 square feet.
   R-1-8.5 – minimum lot size of 8,500 square feet.
   R-1-9 – minimum lot size of 9,000 square feet.
   R-1-10 – minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet.
   R-1-12 – minimum lot size of 12,000 square feet.
   R-1-13 – minimum lot size of 13,000 square feet.
   R-1-15 – minimum lot size of 15,000 square feet.
   R-1-20 – minimum lot size of 20,000 square feet.
   R-1-40 – minimum lot size of 40,000 square feet.
   M-P-30 – minimum lot size of 30,000 square feet.
   M-P-40 – minimum lot size of 40,000 square feet.
   M-P-80 – minimum lot size of 80,000 square feet.
   M-P-100 – minimum lot size of 100,000 square feet.
   M-P-200 – minimum lot size of 200,000 square feet.
(Ord. 3232 (part), 2016; Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.08.060. Changes in boundaries.
   A.   Changes in the boundary of the zones shall be made by ordinance
adopting an amended Zoning Map, or part of said Map, or unit of a part of said
Zoning Map, which said amended Map, or parts or units of parts, when so
adopted, shall be published in the manner prescribed by law and become a part
of this chapter.
   B.   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundary of any zone shown upon a
Zoning Map or any part or unit thereof, the following rules of construction
shall apply:
      1.   Where such boundary is indicated as approximately following street
and alley lines or lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be such
boundary.
      2.   In the case of un-subdivided property, andwhere a boundary divides a
lot, the location of such boundary, unless dimensions indicate the same, shall
be determined by use of the scale appearing on said Zoning Map.
      3.   Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned,
the area comprising such vacated street or alley shall acquire the zone of the
property to which it reverts.
      4.   Areas of dedicated streets or alleys and railroad rights-of-way,
other than such as are designated on the Zoning Map as being classified in one
of the zones provided in this chapter, shall be deemed to be unclassified and,
in the case of streets shall be permitted to be used only for purposes lawfully
allowed and, in the case of railroad rights-of-way, shall be permitted to be
used solely for the purpose of accommodating tracks, signals, other operative
devices and the movement of rolling stock.
      5.   Any property which, for any reason is not designated on the Zoning
Map as being classified in any of the zones established hereby, or any property
annexed to or consolidated with the City subsequent to July 3, 1953, shall be
deemed to have an R-1-20,000 zone unless or until the same shall have been
otherwise classified in the manner set forth in this title.
      6.   The legislative body may upon recommendation of the Planning
Commission invoke a zone other than R-1-20,000 (single-family residential) on
properties being annexed to or being consolidated with the city of Fullerton by
adopting an interim ordinance.
(Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.08.090. Pre-zoning of properties outside of the City.
   A.   The City Council recognizes the fact that a city's social and economic
life is seldom limited to the area within its corporate limits; that real need
exists to consider zoning and physical planning on the basis of the existing
and developing area rather than only the areas currently within the city
limits; that state law, through the medium of the state planning law,
recognizes the existence of the relationship between a city and the areas
adjacent thereto and has incorporated in such state planning law a mandate that
cities shall preplan areas contiguous thereto if, in the opinion of the city,
such areas bear a relationship to its planning.
   B.   In recognition of such policy and purpose and the possibility of
annexation of adjoining lands, the City under-takes to establish an expansion
of a consistent land use pattern that shall prevail if and when areas contained
with such expanded plans annex to the city. For that purpose pre-zoning maps
may be developed and adopted in the same manner prescribed by this title for
the zoning or rezoning of property within the city.
   C.   If a pre-zoning map for an area has been adopted, such annexing
property contained therein shall, upon becoming a part of the city, possess the
zone indicated on the detailed pre-zoning map, and such portions of the pre-
zoning map governing properties so annexed shall become a part of the city's
Zoning Map and thereafter be subject to all of the provisions of this title.
(Ord. 2982, 2001).

15.10.010.    Intent and Purpose.
   A.   Within the City's Zoning Ordinance, certain Zoning Classifications
include a regulatory framework based upon a combination of Building Types,
Frontage Types, and in some instances Architectural Styles, to ensure that
proposed development is consistent with the City's goals for preservation of
neighborhood character, compatibility with existing development context, and
integration of compatible uses.
   B.   The purpose of this chapter is to establish the range of Building Types
that correspond to the appropriate Zoning Classifications and to establish
general standards applicable to all Building Types.
   C.   This chapter also identifies the standards unique to each Building
Type.
(Ord. 3229 (part), 2016).
15.10.020.    Building Types General Provisions.
   A.   A site shall be designed utilizing one or more of the Building Types in
Table 15.10.020.A when identified as eligible by a Zoning Classification.
   B.   Building Types denote the building form, not building function or use.
   C.   Development by Building Type shall comply with the following:
   a.   The attributes of use, density, and lot size identified in Table
15.10.020.A.,
   b.   The General Standards for all Building Types in
15.10.030,
   c.   The unique standards for the applicable Building Type(s) beginning in
15.10.040.

1.   Identifies if this building type corresponds to development for multi-
family residential use.
2.   Identifies if this building type corresponds to development for mixed-use
within the building. The degree of mixed use (and types of uses to be mixed)
depends on the particular Zoning Classification. A building designated "No" may
be used as a component of a mixed-use site development that uses multiple
single-use buildings on a property (horizontal mixed-use).
3.   Identifies the density range that corresponds to each building type.
Density is calculated in dwelling units per gross acre du/ac). The range
provides a guideline by Building Type but it is not a standard.
Notwithstanding, the density range may not exceed the density for the property
as identified in Table 14 of The Fullerton Plan.
4.   Lot dimensions are for site design purposes only as related to selecting
the corresponding Building Type(s) and may or may not relate to the size of the
underlying parcel(s). Lot width is measured along the front property line of
the lot. Lot depth is the greatest distance measured perpendicular to the front
property line of the lot. These dimensions provide a guideline by Building Type
but are not a standard.
5.   The carriage house is a secondary Building Type for use in combination
with another Building Type. When used for a residential use, the carriage house
will count as a unit for purposes of calculating density.
(Ord. 3229 (part), 2016).
15.10.030.    Building Types General Standards.
   A.   Applicability. All Building Types are subject to the following
development standards.
   B.   Building Orientation and Frontage Standards.
   i.   Buildings shall be located in accordance with setback and orientation
standards as established by the Zoning Classification.
   ii.   Building frontages shall comply with the standards for Frontage Types
contained in
Chapter 15.12 and identified as eligible for the Zoning Classification.
   iii.   For Building Types with ground floor dwelling units, these units
shall be designed so that social areas, such as the living room, family room,
dining room, rather than sleeping and bathing rooms are oriented toward the
building frontage to the degree possible.
   iv.   On rear elevations, pedestrian entries on the same wall as a garage
door shall be either set back or recessed so as not to be flush with the garage
doors.
   C.   Residential Adjacency Standards.
   i.   Buildings adjacent to R-1 and R-2 Zoning Classifications (whether or
not separated by an alley) shall maintain a building footprint scaled to the
abutting residential neighborhood.
   ii.   The height of buildings adjacent to R-1 and R-2 Zoning Classifications
(whether or not separated by an alley) shall be required to be compatible with
the allowable height of the abutting residential neighborhood.
   D.   Access Standards.
   i.   Sites shall be designed to accommodate separate on-site vehicular and
pedestrian circulation systems that provide access throughout the site, connect
to the public right-of-way, and avoid conflicts between the modes.
   ii.   Internal streets, drive aisles, walkways and pedestrian paseos shall
be designed in compliance with standards herein and in Chapter 15.16.
   iii.   Vehicular site access shall be designed to minimize impacts to public
streets and sidewalks. Additionally, vehicular site access shall be appropriate
for the Building Type and Zoning Classification.
   iv.   In order of priority and subject to approval by the Community
Development Director and the City's Traffic Engineer, access shall be provided
from (a) an alley, rear street, or perimeter drive aisle, (b) a side street,
(c) an existing or relocated access point on a front street, and (d) a new
access point on a front street.
   v.   Vehicular access may utilize on-site internal streets and/or internal
drive aisles to connect a parking area to the public street. Internal streets
and internal drive aisles shall be designed according to applicable standards.
   vi.   Clear zones are required to provide adequate line of sight for
drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians at (a) the intersection of a driveway with
a street (public or internal), or alley; (b) the intersection of two streets
(public or internal); and (c) the intersection of a street (public or internal)
and an alley. The clear zone shall consist of an isosceles right triangle with
15 foot sides beginning with a measurement point at the property line. Site and
building features, including the ground floor, utilities, mechanical equipment,
walls and fences, landscaping, and signage taller than 3 feet are prohibited in
the clear zone. Awning and upper floors may extend over the clear zone so long
as a vertical clearance of 15 feet is maintained.
   E.   Service Standards.
   i.   Utility meters and connections, air conditioning condensers, ducting/
venting, panels, roof ladders, and similar equipment shall be screened from
view from the street (public and internal) and shall not be located within any
required open space or setback area. Screening techniques range from the use of
landscaping to placement in concealed rooms or closets for equipment on the
ground. Roofs shall be of a form or height to provide screening for roof-
mounted equipment. Alternatively, roof screening that is consistent with the
architecture of the building may be used. Roof access should be provided from
the interior of the building.

discrete building elements and components. Surface detailing shall not
substitute for distinctive massing.
   ii.   Building facades greater than 2 stories shall include one or more of
the following:
      a.   Variation in roof element or form, including but not limited to
varying the number of stories along the street frontage, and/or
      b.   Changes in material or building articulation, such as horizontal
bands, reveals, trim, awnings, eaves, overhangs, upper level setbacks or other
ornamentation.
   iii.   Individual buildings shall be massed such that individual building
planes or architectural masses do not exceed 150 feet in length. Sites shall
utilize walkways, internal streets, paseos, and/or common open space to
separate individual buildings and create suitably scaled buildings rather than
a singular mass. Internal walkways shall be a minimum width of 8 feet with an
additional 2 feet of landscaping on either side. Paseo proportions shall not be
less than 1:1 ratio between the width of the paseo and height of the building.
Internal streets shall be consistent with the standards in Chapter 15.16 and
common open space shall be based on requirements for the specific building
type.
   iv.   Stories and floor heights shall be in accordance with Table

garage. When located above the garage, the floor height shall be 9 feet.
 
   G.   Building Design and Materials Standards.
   i.   Buildings shall be composed of a cohesive design that is reflected and
detailed on all elevations. While additional details may occur on the ground
floor facing the street, similar and complementary massing, materials, and
details shall be incorporated into side and rear facades.
   ii.   Building materials shall convey a sense of permanence and complement a
building's architectural style. Materials shall be durable, authentic and
applied with consistency. Material changes at outside corners shall be avoided,
as shall any application appearing as glued on. Facade elements constructed of

shall be incorporated to create visual interest and the aggregate mix of the
stucco shall be no less than 20/30 with a sand float finish or smooth steel-
trowel finish.
      •   The finish, texture, and color of materials, including windows, shall
be compatible with the overall architectural theme.
      •   Windows shall be of high quality and afford shadow line and depth.
This may be achieved through inset windows with an integral frame or recessing
the window into the exterior wall. Windows installed flush with the exterior
building material are prohibited.

15.12.010.    Intent and Purpose.
   A.   Within the City's Zoning Ordinance, certain Zoning Classifications
include a regulatory framework based upon a combination of Building Types,
Frontage Types, and in some instances Architectural Styles, to ensure that
proposed development is consistent with the City's goals for preservation of
neighborhood character, compatibility with existing development context, and
integration of compatible uses.
   B.   The purpose of this chapter is to establish the range of Frontage Types
that correspond to the appropriate Zoning Classifications and to establish
general standards applicable to all Frontage Types.
   C.   This chapter also identifies the standards unique to each Frontage
Type.
(Ord. 3229 (part), 2016).
15.12.020.    Frontage Types General Provisions.

proposed Building Type shall be designed with one or more of the Frontage Types
identified in this section.
   C.   The unique standards beginning in Section

15.17.010. Intent and Purpose.
   This chapter establishes the city's residential zones, including permitted
uses and physical development standards.
(Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.17.015. Residential Zones.
   The following residential zones are established:
   A.   R-1 (single-family residential) is designed for neighborhoods of
single-family type residences on individual lots. Minimum lot sizes within the
R-1 zone are further described in §
15.08.050 and as they appear on the Zoning Map.
   B.   R-1P (single-family residential preservation) is designed for mature
single-family neighborhoods where the existing housing and environment is a
valuable asset to the city and should be preserved.
   C.   R-2 (two-family residential) is designed for neighborhoods where a
limited increase in population density is acceptable by permitting two dwelling
units on a single lot. This zoning is applicable primarily to older
neighborhoods with deep lots.
   D.   R-2P (two-family residential preservation) is designed for mature
neighborhoods where the existing housing and environment is a valuable asset to
the city and should be preserved, and where a limited increase in population
density is acceptable by permitting two dwelling units on a single lot.
Opportunities for additional and replacement housing are also provided where
appropriate.
   E.   R-G (garden-type multiple-family residential) is designed for
neighborhoods where limited-density apartment and condominium development must
fit compatibly within an area of single-family type residences.
   F.   R-3R (restricted multiple-family residential) is designed for use where
limited density apartment and condominium development must fit compatibly in
close proximity to an area of single-family type residences.
   G.   R-3P (multiple-family residential preservation) is designed for mature
neighborhoods where the existing housing and environment is a valuable asset to
the city and should be preserved, while opportunities for additional and
replacement housing are also provided where appropriate.
   H.   R-3 (limited-density multiple-family residential) is designed for use
where apartment and condominium development can be physically separated from
single-family type residences by a street or terrain feature.
   I.   R-4 (medium-density multiple-family residential) is designed for use
where physical separation from single-family residential areas is possible,
where proximity to shopping and service centers is available, and where
frontage exists on major, primary, or secondary collector streets for
facilitating the flow of heavier residential traffic.
   J.   R-5 (maximum-density multiple-family) is designed for high-rise
apartments and condominiums to meet the specialized needs for high-density
housing. Locations that would be close to the colleges or to central business
districts and isolated where possible from single-family residential areas are
considered most appropriate for such high-density zoning.
   K.   R-MH (Mobile Home Park) is designed for mobile home neighborhoods and
compatible activities associated therewith.
(Ord. 3232 (part), 2016; Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.17.020. Permitted uses.
   A.   Land uses in residential zones shall be in accordance with Table
15.17.020.A and Section
15.17.030 of this chapter.
   B.   The more restrictive of any additional qualifications, limitations, or
conditions set forth in the use definitions of
Chapter 15.04 of this title shall apply.
   C.   Any activity or use not specifically listed in Table 15.17.020.A shall
be considered an unpermitted use unless determined by the Community Development
Director to be similar to a listed permitted use in the zone and consistent
with the zone's purpose.

require-ments of this chapter and title are met.
      2.   The following additional requirements shall apply:
         a.   Manufactured homes shall have exterior siding extending to the
ground or to the top of a solid foundation and consisting of materials found by

       2.   The storage of a mobile home or house trailer is regulated by
Subsection 15.17.030.Q of this chapter.
   E.   Transitional and Supportive housing:
      1.   Transitional and Supportive housing shall be considered a
residential use of property, permitted in dwellings designed for non-transient
occupancy, and shall be subject to the development standards of the zoning
district in which they are located.
      2.   Transitional or supportive housing which cannot be made to comply
with the underlying zoning standards may be permitted by Conditional Use
Permit. In such case, the Conditional Use Permit will be evaluated based on the
factors listed in Subsection 15.70.040.C of this Title and the following:

   A group home or a 24-hour care facility means a dwelling licensed by the
state of California to accept and care for six or fewer mentally disordered or
otherwise handicapped persons or dependent and neglected children. A small
residential care facility for the elderly means a dwelling licensed by the
state of California to accept six or fewer residents who are over 60 years of
age, which provide varying levels and intensities of care and supervision or
personal care.

constitute a nuisance to surrounding or adjoining residential properties.
   G.   Small family child-care home:
   Small family child-care home means a detached single-family dwelling,
comprising the only dwelling on a residentially zoned lot, which provides
licensed family child-care to eight or fewer children, including children who

regulations of these facilities.
   H.   Large family child-care home:
   A large family child-care home (caring for between nine and 14 children,
inclusive) may exist in detached single-family dwellings, comprising the only
dwelling on a residentially zoned lot, and shall be subject to the following
conditions:
      1.   No large family child-care home shall locate closer than three
hundred linear feet to any other child-care home or child-care center
regardless of size. A large family child-care home that is operated on property
of a religious institution or a college is exempt from this provision. A large
family child-care home located within 300 feet of another child-care facility

through a Conditional Use Permit when findings of insignificant impact can be
made.
      2.   A large family child-care home shall provide off-street vehicular
loading areas with on-site circulation such that children may be safely loaded
and unloaded from vehicles off the street, and pedestrian/vehicle conflicts are
minimized. Under no circumstances shall children be required to cross a street
to access the facility.
      3.   One off-street parking space shall be provided for each day care
worker on duty, in addition to the parking originally required for the
dwelling. One guest space shall also be provided for each six children, or
portion thereof, cared for by the facility. The spaces shall not be located in
a required street setback area, but may be located in tandem when site
conditions make it infeasible to provide the required parking otherwise.
      4.   A large family child-care home shall maintain an outdoor play area
that adjoins any residentially zoned property in such a manner so as not to
constitute a nuisance to the residential use. A solid six-foot high masonry
wall shall be constructed along the perimeter of the facility adjacent to all
such outdoor play areas in the side and rear yards to mitigate noise.
      5.   A large family child-care home shall comply with noise and
maintenance regulations of the zone andwill be subject to applicable abatement/
nuisance procedures if necessary to mitigate incompatibility with the
surrounding neighbor-hood and the intent of these regulations.
   I.   Accessory buildings and structures
The requirements for a one-story accessory building or structure are indicated

requirements:
         a.   It shall comply with the front yard setback and height
requirements for the main building on the property.
         b.   When physically attached to the main building, it shall also
comply with the side and rear setback requirements for the main building on the
property.
         c.   When detached from the main building:
            (i.)   If less than 600 square feet in area and not more than ten
feet in height at the property line, it shall be exempt from side and rear yard
setback requirements for the main building on the property, provided all
drainage is directed to the property on which the building is located and the
building meets applicable fire separation requirements per the Fullerton
Building Code. Within a required side or rear yard, height of the building may
increase one foot for each foot of setback from the property line, with maximum
height not to exceed the requirements of the zone in which it is located.
            (ii.)   If 600 or more square feet in area or more than ten feet in
wall height, it shall be located in accordance with setback requirements for
the main building on the property. A minor reduction in side or rear-yard
setback may be granted subject to approval of a Minor Exception pursuant to
Chapter 15.66 of this title.
         d.   The architectural design shall be visually compatible with the
main dwelling unit on the property and with the neighborhood character, as
determined by the Community Development Director or his or her designee. The
determination may be appealed to the Planning Commission.
         e.   Applicant shall prepare a Land Use Agreement for the property,
subject to review and approval by the Community Development Director, that
prohibits the conversion of any or all of the accessory building to a separate
dwelling unit. Once approved, the applicant shall provide an executed and
notarized Agreement to the City to be recorded with the Orange County Recorder,
and future sale of the property shall be subject to the Agreement.
      2.   A non-habitable accessory building is subject to the following
requirements:
         a.   It shall comply with the front yard setback and height
requirements for the main building on the property.
         b.   When physically attached to the main building, it shall also
comply with the side and rear setbacks as specified for the main building on
the property.
         c.   When detached from the main building:
            (i.)   If less than 600 square feet in area and not more than ten
feet in height at the property line, it shall be exempt from side and rear yard
setback requirements for the main building on the property, provided all
drainage is directed to the property on which the building is located and the
building meets applicable fire separation requirements per the Fullerton
Building Code. Within a required side or rear yard, height of the building may
increase one foot for each foot of setback from the property line, with maximum
height not to exceed the requirements for the main building on the property.
            (ii.)   If 600 or more square feet in area or more than ten feet in
wall height, it shall be located to meet setback requirements for the main unit
on the property. A minor reduction in side or rear yard setback may be granted
subject to approval of a Minor Exception pursuant to
Chapter 15.66 of this title. Rear yard setbacks do not apply where a rear
property line does not abut a property with a residential zone classification.
         d.   The architectural design shall be visually compatible with the
main dwelling unit on the property and with the neighborhood character, as
determined by the Community Development Director or his or her designee. The
determination may be appealed to the Planning Commission.
      4.   A detached two-story habitable or non-habitable accessory building
may be allowed in the R-1 and R-1P zones provided that it complies with the
development standards for the main building on the property and its
architectural design is visually compatible with the main dwelling unit on the
property and with the neighborhood character, as determined by the Community
Development Director or his/her designee. The Director’s determination
regarding architectural compatibility may be appealed to the Planning
Commission. Applicant shall prepare a Land Use Agreement for the property,
subject to review and approval by the Community Development Director, that
prohibits the conversion of any or all of the accessory building to a separate
dwelling unit. Once approved, the applicant shall provide an executed and
notarized Agreement to the City to be recorded with the Orange County Recorder
and future sale of the property shall be subject to the Agreement.
      5.   The area of all accessory buildings shall be included in
calculations for lot coverage, floor/area ratio requirements and usable open
space requirements for the zone in which it is located. The area of all
accessory structures shall not be included in calculations for lot coverage
requirements of Section
15.17.050.C and may be included in calculations for usable open space
requirements of Section
15.17.050.E when designed for outdoor living or recreation.

the limitations in this provision will require the approval of a Conditional
Use Permit.
         III.   Duplexes, apartments, condominiums or mobile homes: Two adult

livestock shall erect and/or maintain a fence as herein described to contain
and confine all livestock kept or maintained on his premises.
      a.   Such fence shall be sufficiently good, strong and substantial as to
prevent the ingress and egress of livestock. No wire fence is a good and

15.17.040. General site development standards.
   The following development standards apply in residential zones. Additional
standards that are specific to individual zones are found in Sections
15.17.050 through
15.17.070 of this chapter.
   A.   Area of land developed to multiple dwellings considered as constituting
a single lot:
   For the purposes of this section, any area of land -- whether a single lot,
a combination of lots, or un-subdivided acreage -- which is developed to
multiple dwellings under the standards required in this chapter shall be
considered as constituting a single lot, and the component lots or parcels of
land constituting the lot shall be considered as parts of a whole.
   B.   Lots shall be combined when a building is proposed over two or more
lots:
   When a building is proposed over two or more lots, the lots shall be
combined as prescribed in Title 16 of this code.
   C.   Usable open space:
      1.   "Usable open space" means an open area or recreational facility
designed and intended for outdoor living and/or recreation. Common usable open
space shall not exceed a grade of 20 percent, shall have a minimum dimension of
at least ten feet, and may include landscaping, walks, recreational facilities,
and small decorative objects such as artwork and fountains.
      2.   Open space that does not meet the above requirements but provides
visual relief, such as landscaped slopes and planter areas -- and in the R-
1 and R-1P zones only, private individual driveways -- may be counted on a one-
for-three basis in meeting up to one-third of the common usable open space
requirement. Water-oriented visual amenities such as lakes and streams may be
counted on a one-for-one basis but shall be included in the same one-third
limitation for visual open space.
      3.   Areas underneath external stairways shall not be counted as common
usable open space. Inaccessible or partially enclosed areas under building
overhangs, second floor decks or patios may be counted as common usable open
space, subject to the approval of the Director of Development Services.
      4.   Common usable open space shall not include any portion of off-street
parking space, driveways (except in the R-1 and R-1P zones), turnaround areas,
the required street setback area, or any accessory building or roof tops,
except those portions thereof used for outdoor living or recreational purposes.
   D.   View clearance:
      1.   No structure or landscaping shall be placed within a "cut-off" area,
as defined in this subsection in a manner that obstructs a clear view of
traffic.
         a.   In the case of a lot at the intersection of two streets, the cut-
off area is a triangle with one point at the intersection of the street lines
(or their prolongations) and the other points located 15 feet from that point
along each of the street lines (see Figure1).

            Figure 1
Vision clearance for street-to-street condition
         b.   In the case of a lot located at the intersection of a street and
an alley, the cut-off area is a triangle with one point at the intersection of
the street and alley lines (or their prolongations), one point 15 feet from
that point along the street line, and the other point ten feet from the origin
point along the alley line (see Figure 2).

            Figure 2
Vision clearance for street-to-alley condition
         c.   For a driveway located in a side yard of a corner lot, the cut-
off area is comprised of two triangular areas on either side of the driveway
(see Figure 3). The triangles shall originate at the intersections of the side
lot line and either side of the driveway, and project 15 feet from those origin
points along both the side of the driveway and the side yard line.

         Figure 3
Vision clearance for driveway-to-street condition
      2.   The Planning Commission may hold a public hearing pursuant to
Chapter 15.76 of this title to consider and to issue orders for a property
owner to remove any obstruction from any cut-off area that creates a condition
that is found to be dangerous to the safety of drivers and occupants of
vehicles or to pedestrians.
   E.   Front yard setback on cul-de-sac:
   The front yard setback on a cul-de-sac shall be measured from the closest
point of the cul-de-sac and shall be one-half of the setback prescribed by the
residential zone classification of the subject property.
   F.   Setbacks on through lots:
   The front yard setback required by the underlying zone shall apply on both
street frontages of a through lot, except that fences no more than eight feet
in height, non-habitable buildings, and detached accessory structures are
permitted at the rear yard property line of a through lot that has an R-1, R-
1P, R-2 or R-2P zone, when all vehicular access rights on that street frontage
side have been dedicated to the city or have been restricted by parcel map,
site plan, or tract map.
   G.   Features that may encroach into a setback:
      1.   Fireplace structures not wider than eight feet, bay windows, and
eave overhangs that are incorporated as part of a roof may encroach into a
required setback to a maximum of 18 inches.
      2.   Mechanical equipment such as air conditioning units and hot water
heaters may encroach into a side and rear yard setback but are subject to noise
restrictions as provided in
Chapter 15.90 of this title.
      3.   Landscaping, including trees, hedges or shrubs of any height, may be
planted within a required side or rear setback area that is not within a cut-
off area as defined by Subsection 15.17.040.D. Within a front yard setback,
when not within a cut-off area as defined by Subsection 15.17.040.D,
landscaping of any height is permitted, except that continuous hedges over
three feet in height are not permitted.
   H.   Acoustic analysis required:
   All residential developments proposed within a projected annual CNEL contour
(as defined in Title 4, Subchapter 6 of the California Administrative Code) of
60 dB(A) or greater (as indicated in the Fullerton General Plan Community
Health and Safety Element) shall require an acoustical analysis (as defined in
Title 25, Chapter 1, Article 4 of said Administrative Code) demonstrating and
certifying that all required usable open space areas other than visual open
space shall be provided with noise-mitigating measures sufficient to reduce the
noise levels therein to 60 dB(A) CNEL. The Planning Commission, Redevelopment
Agency or City Council, as appropriate, may approve projected exterior levels
of not to exceed 65 dB(A) CNEL for areas where the acoustical analysis
demonstrates that achieving a level of 60 dB(A) CNEL is clearly not feasible.
(Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.17.050. Site development standards for R-1, R-1P, R-2 and R-2P zone

      2.   The front yard building setback shall be no less than the average of
the front setbacks for the two adjacent homes. The front yard setback specified
in Table 15.17.050.A shall be the requirement when the average of the front
yard setbacks for the adjacent homes is less than that specified in Table
15.17.050.A. In the case of a corner lot, the setback shall not be greater than
the predominant setback of the street side on which the lot fronts.
      3.   In the case of a key lot on a property with an R-1, R-1P, R-2 or R-
2P zone, the front yard building setback shall be at least 15 feet regardless
of the minimum lot size.
      4.   The following are exemptions, possible reductions or allowable
encroachments to the required building setback:
      a.   A reduction in the building setback not exceeding 20 percent of the
requirements in Table 15.17.050.A may be allowed with approval of a Minor
Exception pursuant to
Chapter 15.66 of this title. A request for a greater building setback reduction
shall be reviewed as a variance pursuant to
Chapter 15.68 of this title.

15.17.060. Additional site development standards and review for residential
preservation zone classifications (R-1P, R-2P and R-3P).
   The following development standards for R-1P, R-2P and R-3P zones are in
addition to the applicable standard contained in Sections 15.17.040, 15.17.050,
and 15.17.070.
   A.   All proposed development, including the rehabilitation of existing
structures, will be reviewed for compliance with established design criteria
and standards, specific to the preservation zones and identified significant
properties. These adopted design criteria and standards, entitled "Design
Guidelines for Residential Preservation Zones," are intended to serve as a
baseline -- a set of elementary guidelines -- by which a proposal will be
evaluated.
   B.   All proposed development shall be subject to the following types of
review and approval. Routine maintenance of existing improvements (e.g.,
repainting of a structure, duplicating damaged or deteriorated exterior
architectural features) is exempt from these review procedures as long as the
original design is retained.
      1.   Those projects listed below which the Community Development Director
determines are consistent with the design criteria and standards established or
the residential preservation zones shall be subject to administrative review
and approval by the Community Development Director.
         a.   Minor alterations, including the addition, change, or removal of
exterior architectural features and existing hardscape.
         b.   Minor improvements such as air conditioning units, skylights,
solar panels, greenhouse windows, roof mounted equipment, arbors, trellises and
fences.
         c.   All development wherein structures are enlarged by less than 50
percent of the existing floor area, the total addition is less than 500 square
feet, and such addition is not readily visible from the public street.
         d.   The demolition of accessory structures which have a floor area
less than 500 square feet.
         e.   The construction of an accessory structure in a location that is
behind or partially behind the main residence, when the architectural features
of the accessory structure match those of the main residence including, but not
limited to, siding, windows, trim, roofing and vents, in accordance with the
Design Guidelines for Residential Preservation Zones.
      2.   Those projects listed below will be reviewed as a Site Plan in
accordance with Sections
15.47.025 and
15.47.040 of this title:
         a.   All new development that proposes the creation of additional
residential units on the lot.
         b.   Any combination of alterations and additions which result in a
structure being enlarged by 50 percent or more of the existing floor area or
more than 500 square feet.
         c.   Any addition to an existing structure wherein such an addition is
readily visible from the public street.
         d.   The construction or demolition of an accessory structure which
has a floor area of 500 square feet or more, or the construction of multiple
accessory structures which have a cumulative floor area of 500 feet or more,
unless
15.17.060.B.1.e applies.
      3.   Those projects listed below will be reviewed by the Landmarks
Commission as a Site Plan in accordance with Sections
15.47.025 and
15.47.040 of this title:
         a.   The demolition of a residential structure in a preservation zone
wherein more than 50% of the structure will be removed from a site either by
relocation or destruction, or when any portion of the street facing elevation
is demolished.
         b.   The demolition or alteration of any Significant Property or
Historical Landmark.
      4.   A Community Development Director determination pursuant to
15.17.060.B.1 or 2 above may be appealed to the Landmarks Commission.
   C.   Proposed new construction will be subject to the following site
development standards:
      1.   All buildings shall be encouraged to have a minimum front yard
setback of 20 feet. In the R-2P and R-3P zones, proposals requesting a building
setback less than 20 feet shall be subject to approval by the Landmarks
Commission as a Minor Site Plan in accordance with
Chapter 15.47 of this title. In the R-1P zone, proposals requesting a front
setback less than the predominant setback on the street shall be subject to
approval by the Landmarks Commission as a Minor Site Plan in accordance with
Chapter 15.47 of this title.
      2.   Half of the required amount of parking may be in the form of a
carport and/or an open, paved space. No parking area, however, shall be allowed
in front of any principal building.
      3.   An existing driveway that no longer serves as access to a garage may
be used for a parking space as long as the parking space is behind the front
yard setback. A new driveway for the purpose of
providing an open parking space will be discouraged and subject to the approval
of the Director of Community Development.
      4.   The total gross floor area of all dwelling units on the property
shall not exceed 40 percent of the net lot area of any property on which at
least one existing dwelling unit is preserved and shall not exceed 35 percent
of the net lot area where no existing dwelling units are preserved.
   D.   The decision to approve or deny any proposed development will be guided
by the following objectives:
      1.   The primary objective shall be the city’s commitment, as directed by
state legislation and enunciated in the Housing Element of its General Plan, to
the preservation and rehabilitation of existing affordable housing and
neighborhood lifestyle. Additionally, the intent is to protect and enhance the
historic character of development found within these preservation zones.
      2.   If the existing housing is clearly deteriorated or dilapidated
beyond rehabilitation, or if a residential structure does not contribute to, or
is not compatible with, the established character of the neighborhood, said
housing may be removed.
      3.   In any case where new construction is proposed, said construction
shall be reviewed in the context of the existing intensity and diversity of
development and lifestyle in the neighborhood. Where proposed new construction
is found to be incompatible with such by reason of obtrusiveness, excessive
bulk, over development, inappropriate architectural style or nonresidential
character, such a proposal shall be modified or denied.
      4.   For improvements involving an existing structure, the recommended
policy shall be to retain, repair or restore original architectural elements,
rather than to replace them. If such elements cannot be repaired or restored,
the replacement should be made with the materials that are the same type as
those used at the time of original construction when possible, but when
necessary, substitutions may be made with materials that match in design,
texture and color. Original materials shall be proven to be deteriorated beyond
reasonable repair before substitute materials can be considered.
   E.   Notwithstanding the requirements for R-1P, R-2P and R-3P zones, the
Landmarks Commission may consider a Site Plan application from a property owner
and upon review of the application, facts, and consideration of alternatives at
a noticed public hearing, may waive on a selective and limited basis the
“preservation” requirements of this section that cause undue hardship.
(Ord. 3267 §5, 2018; Ord. 3232 (part), 2016; Ord. 2982, 2001).

      2.   If the multiple-family structures are down slope from an adjacent
property that is zoned R-1 or R-1P and a grade differential of more than ten
feet exists between the building pad elevations, the height limitations of the
multiple-family structures are two stories within 50 feet of the R-1 or R-1P
zoned property and three stories within 50 to 100 feet of the R-1 or R-1P zoned
property. If a grade differential of more than 20 feet exists, a three-story
multiple-family building is allowed within 50 feet of R-1 and R-1P zoned
property.
      3.   In the multiple-family residential zones R-3, R- 3P, R-3R, R-4 and
R-5, where subterranean parking is used, and such parking area is a basement as
defined in
Chapter 15.04, then the story above said basement shall be considered the first
story of the structure.

   F.   Use of parking:
      1.   All parking required for apartments, four or more units in size, in
a multi-family residential zone classification by this section is, and has been
established as, necessary to accommodate the needs of residents and guests of
the project for which the parking is required. The specific intent of this
provision is to ensure that all tenants have access to parking in connection
with their rental of an apartment unit, to the extent that it exists, and to
ensure that all existing parking is used only by the tenants of the
corresponding rental unit, except as otherwise provided in this section.
      2.   Each resident parking space shall be specifically and exclusively
assigned to a rental unit according to the requirements of Sections
15.17.050(F) and
15.17.070(E). Residential parking at apartment buildings or complexes four or
more units in size must be assigned according to the charts in Sections
15.17.050(F) and
15.17.070(E), such that each apartment unit has reserved for its sole and
exclusive use that whole number of parking spaces mandated by these sections.
   The tenants of each rental unit will have sole and exclusive use of that
unit's assigned parking spaces, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Guest parking shown on plans for the apartment units/complex at the time of
site plan or other approval and any additional guest parking required by
subsequent approvals shall be maintained exclusively for guests of tenants.
      3.   (A)   Such required resident parking shall not be (i) rented, let or
used for storage which would impede use of the resident parking space for
parking, or occupancy of any kind by nonresidents of the project, (ii) rented
or let by tenants to other tenants or to the landlord, or (iii) rented, let or
used for storage of any kind which would impede use of the resident parking
space for parking by the landlord to any other tenant within the same building
or complex, unless a Conditional Use Permit is approved to allow such uses and
occupancy. However, as to any tenant who does not require a vehicle parking
space, the landlord may allow that tenant's assigned parking space to be used
by another tenant of the building or complex provided that no fee or charge may
be made for such use.
         (B)   Required guest parking shall not be (i) rented, let or used for
storage or other than temporary occupancy by tenants and guests of the project,
(ii) rented or let by tenants to other tenants or to the landlord, or (iii)
rented, let or used for storage of any kind by the landlord to any other tenant
within the same building or complex, unless a Conditional Use Permit is
approved to allow such uses and occupancy.
      4.   For any apartment building or complex consisting of four or more
units which was built prior to 1950 and which does not have at least one on-
site parking space per unit, no unit shall be assigned more than one on-site
parking space so long as the legal non-conformity exists, and those on-site
spaces which are available shall be assigned exclusively to tenants, on an
equitable basis, such as by seniority of residence, drawing by lot, issuance of
one parking decal or permit to each tenant and allowing tenant parking on a
first come first served basis for permitted vehicles, or similar equitable
methodology. Any tenant who does not require a vehicle parking space need not
be included in the equitable distribution system.
      5.   All landlords and tenants affected by any changes to this section
must comply with these provisions within ninety (90) days of the effective date
of this section. Thereafter, violations of these provisions shall be punished
pursuant to Section
1.08.010 of the Fullerton Municipal Code.
      6.   Amortization. Any landlord who is unable to comply with the
provisions of this section due to the existence of insufficient on-site parking
spaces to comply with this section, or because of the existence of a lawful and
valid agreement for rental of parking spaces to non-tenants or for more than
the required number of spaces to particular tenants, which provides for a fixed
term and was entered into prior to March 1, 2005, may seek an extension of time
to comply with the provisions of this section. The purpose of an extension of
time shall be to provide a reasonable opportunity to amortize the property
owners investment in cases of economic hardship while making every effort to
insure that parking spaces are made available to tenants as required herein as
expeditiously as possible. The Application for Extension provides a process for
the City to review the applicant's statement relating to alleged economic
hardship arising from compliance with this section, the nonconformity's impact
on the community and consistency with current City goals and policies, and to
provide an opportunity for the owner of such a property to address his plans
for the property and the reasons why amortization of the investment involved
could not be accomplished in the ninety day amortization period provided in
this Chapter.
      7.   The owner of property who seeks to extend the period in which to
comply with the provisions of this section, or his authorized agent, may file
an application for extension of the amortization period. Such applications
shall be filed and considered pursuant to the following procedures:
         (A)   Extensions by Development Services Director. The Development
Services Director may extend the original amortization period, upon the filing
of an Application for Extension in accordance with this Chapter demonstrating
reasonable need, in the following circumstances:
            1.   Where there is insufficient on-site parking spaces to comply
with this section and the owner demonstrates a need for additional time to
implement an equitable allocation of existing spaces among tenants; and/or
            2.   The owner/landlord entered into an agreement for rental of
parking spaces to non-tenants or for more than the required number of spaces to
particular tenants, which provides for a fixed term (i.e., is not month to
month) and was entered into prior to March 1, 2005.
         (B)   To receive such extension consideration, the property owner
shall request an extension in writing on forms prepared for that purpose, no
later than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the amortization period
as set forth in this Chapter, including a full explanation of the reason why
the extension should be granted. Applications for Extension shall be filed with
the Director of Development Services. Any decision of the Director of
Development Services under this Section may be appealed to the Planning
Commission within ten (10) days of issuance of the written notice of the
Director's decision. In the absence of a timely filing of an appeal of the
decision of the Development Services Director to the Planning Commission, the
decision of the Development Services Director shall be final and conclusive as
of the date it is mailed to the property owner. Upon any timely appeal to the
Planning Commission, its decision shall be final and conclusive as of the date
of the adoption of the resolution granting or denying extension.
         (C)   Extension Findings. The following shall constitute the findings
for granting an Application for Extension. The hearing body may grant the
extension only upon making all of the required findings based upon the evidence
presented at the hearing. The applicant shall have the burden of proof to show,
by relevant evidence, the existence of facts supporting the conclusion that the
findings as set forth below can be made:
            1.   The property owner or applicant or both will suffer severe
economic hardship unless an extension of the amortization time is granted; and
            2.   The severe economic hardship is not the result of actions
undertaken voluntarily by the property owner or applicant; and
            3.   The property owner and applicant have taken all reasonable and
necessary steps to bring the property into conformity or mitigate the effects
of its nonconformity within the amortization period permitted; and
            4.   It is not reasonably feasible to provide the minimum number of
parking spaces required by the Fullerton Municipal Code and to allocate them
for tenants' use only as required, or it is not reasonably feasible to
terminate existing parking space lease agreements which extend beyond ninety
(90) days from the effective date of this section.
         (D)   No extension of amortization may be granted if continuation of
noncompliance with the requirements of this Chapter will unreasonably interfere
with the use, possession, or enjoyment of surrounding and adjacent properties,
or the harm caused by allowing extension of the amortization period outweighs
any demonstrated hardship upon the property owner seeking an extension. Under
no circumstances shall an extension of the amortization period be granted for a
period longer than one (1) year. For apartment building owners who are unable
to comply with this section due to physical limitations of the existing
property and buildings thereon, a variance from the provisions of this Chapter
must be sought prior to the expiration of the amortization period and any
extension thereof.

residential condominium project as defined in Sections 783 and 1351 of the
California Civil Code, Community Apartment Project as defined in Section 11004
of the California Business and Professions Code, or Stock Cooperative, as
defined in Section 11003.2 of the California Business and Professions Code
(collectively referred to as "residential conversion"), shall comply with the
provisions and standards of the following subsections.
   B.   Current building and zoning code requirements to be met:
   No proposed residential conversion shall be approved unless the Development
Services Department reports to the Planning Commission and/or the City Council
that, based upon examination of the original site and building plans, the
project meets all current Zoning and Building Code requirements and the Council
and/or Planning Commission finds such report to be true.
   C.   Vacancy rate limitation:
   No proposed residential conversions, as previously defined, shall be
approved when the last vacancy rate, as established by the annual Federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development apartment survey -- or a similar
survey approved by the Director of Development Services -- for apartments being
offered for lease or rent within the City of Fullerton, is equal to or less
than three percent. However, a proposed residential conversion involving a
project where there is an agreement with the Fullerton Redevelopment Agency or
the City of Fullerton to provide affordable housing may be approved even if the
vacancy rate is below three percent.
   D.   Tenant relocation:
      1.   Prior to filing a tentative map or tentative parcel map for a
residential conversion, the sub-divider shall prepare a report describing steps
they intend to take in order to ensure the successful relocation of each tenant
in the event that conversion takes place. The report, to be submitted to the
City and to be given to all tenants along with a notice of the proposed
conversion, shall specifically state what assistance will be provided to
tenants such as the elderly, the handicapped, or families with children who may
encounter difficulty finding new quarters.
      2.   In order to reduce the number of tenants being displaced, the
residential sub-divider shall consider incentives and inducements that would
permit tenants to become owners in the converted project. The sub-divider shall
also consider allowing hard to relocate tenants to remain as tenants, or giving
such tenants additional time for permanent relocation.
      3.   The report shall also include a list of apartment vacancies within
Fullerton or within a five-mile range of the project, at least equal in number
to the units that would be converted, which are in the same rental range.
      4.   The residential sub-divider shall certify that all tenants have been
delivered a copy of said report within the last 30 days preceding filing of the
tentative map for said conversion.

   The Planning Commission shall use certain criteria to determine whether a
Conditional Use Permit shall be approved. Such criteria shall include, but not
be limited to the following:
      1.   The number of planned residents shall, at a minimum, comply with
Section 503.2 of the Uniform Housing Code and shall be appropriate considering
the size of the house and property.
      2.   The number of available parking spaces shall be adequate for the
number of planned residents and visitors shall, at a minimum, comply with the
parking requirements set forth in Subsection
15.17.080.A.3 of this chapter. In addition, the applicant shall provide an
auxiliary parking plan for visitor parking. Said plan shall include a
description of the frequency and length of time estimated for visitor parking
and the availability of on-site and other public and private parking for the
property. The number of other available public and private parking shall bear a
reasonable relationship to the frequency and length of time estimated for
visitors.
      3.   Traffic and congestion in excess of that which would be generated by
multiple family residential use, if such use were allowable, shall not be
unreasonable. The capacity of any affected streets and the frequency and
duration of any such additional traffic shall also be considered.
      4.   Other significant, demonstrable incompatibility problems with the
location of the sorority or fraternity house in the proposed neighborhood that
cannot be mitigated through the imposition of additional conditions.
      5.   A finding that the proposed use as a sorority or fraternity house
shall not be injurious or unreasonably incompatible with the type of uses
permitted in the surrounding area and, further, that the proposed use shall not
otherwise be detrimental to the public health, safety or general welfare.
   C.   Periodic review of Conditional Use Permit:
   Any Conditional Use Permit approved hereunder shall, at a minimum, be
subject to an annual review in the form of a public hearing for the first two
years following the original approval to establish whether the Conditional Use
Permit shall be continued, revoked or additional conditions imposed. After the
first two year annual reviews, a Conditional Use Permit shall be reviewed when
deemed necessary, or according to any schedule as imposed by the Planning
Commission.
   D.   Revocation or suspension:
   Failure of any applicant to abide by and faithfully comply with any of the
conditions that may be attached to the approval of a Conditional Use Permit
shall constitute grounds for the revocation of said Conditional Use Permit by
the Planning Commission.
   E.    Grounds for revocation or suspension:
   The Planning Commission shall use certain criteria at any annual review, or
other hearing as may be scheduled for revocation or suspension to determine
whether a Conditional Use Permit shall be revoked or suspended. Such criteria
shall include, but not be limited to the following:
      1.   Whether the sorority or fraternity has generated an excessive number
or verifiable complaints from neighborhood residents against it or its
residents, members or visitors.
      2.    Whether the sorority or fraternity is in compliance with all fire,
building and zoning codes.
      3.   The responsiveness of the sorority or fraternity to any correction
notices issued by the city.
      4.   Compliance with all conditions of the Conditional Use Permit in
question.
   F.    Distance separation requirements:
   A Conditional Use Permit for a sorority or fraternity house shall not be
approved if the proposed sorority or fraternity site is within one 1,000 feet
of another property with a valid Conditional Use Permit for a sorority or
fraternity house. A list of property addresses with a valid Conditional Use
Permit for a sorority or fraternity shall be maintained in the Development
Services Department for public review.

15.17.120. Density bonus.
   A.   The availability of housing for California's diverse and growing
population is a matter of statewide importance. State statutes recognize that
cooperation between government and the private sector is critical to attainment
of the state's housing goals, among which are to promote and assist in
development of housing for various special needs groups, among which are the
homeless, low- and moderate- income households and senior citizens. Section
65915 of the California Government Code establishes the framework for granting
a density bonus and/or development incentive(s) or concession(s) for housing
developments for lower, very-low or moderate income households, senior
citizens, transitional foster youth, disabled veterans, and homeless persons.
In addition, it contains provisions for a density bonus or development
incentive/concession when a child care facility is to be included with an
affordable housing development, or when land is donated for affordable housing
under specified conditions.

low income households, where income does not exceed 50 percent of Area Median
income pursuant to Section 50105 of the Health and Safety Code.

and residents are 62 years of age or older, or 55 years of age or older in a
senior citizen housing development pursuant to Section 51.3 of the Civil Code,
or a mobile home park that limits residency based on age requirements for
housing for older persons pursuant to Section 798.76 or 799.5 of the Civil
Code.
      5.   Ten percent of the total dwelling units in a common interest
development, for persons and families of moderate income, where income does not

Health and Safety Code, provided that all units in the development are offered
to the public for purchase.
      6.   Ten percent of the total units of a housing development for
transitional foster youth, as defined in Section 66025.9 of the Education Code,
disabled veterans, or homeless persons, as defined in the federal McKinney-
Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 11301 et seq.). The units
described in this subparagraph shall be subject to a recorded affordability
restriction of 55 years and shall be provided at the same affordability level
as very-low income units.
         a.   For the purposes of this subsection "transitional foster youth"
means a person whose dependency was established or continued by the court on or
after their sixteenth birthday, and who is no older than 25 years of age
pursuant to Section 66025.9 of the Education Code

veteran who is currently declared by the United States Veterans Administration
to be 10 percent or more disabled as a result of service in the armed force
pursuant to Section 18541 of the Government Code.
   C.   An applicant requesting a density bonus, concession(s), incentive(s) or
waiver(s) shall make such request at the time an application is first submitted
for review and approval.

      4.   Evidence that the incentives and/or concessions will result in
identifiable and actual cost reductions to provide for affordable housing
units.
      5.   All requested waivers of development standards.
      6.   Evidence that each standard for which a waiver is requested
physically precludes the project at the density or with the incentives or
concessions allowed under this section.
   E.   For a project meeting one or more of the criteria identified in
15.17.120.B above, the City shall grant a density bonus as follows:

to
15.17.120.B above, an applicant shall elect whether the bonus shall be awarded
on the basis of subparagraph 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.
      2.   The amount of the density increase to which the applicant is
entitled shall vary according to the percentage of units to be provided for
income levels or types as shown in the tables below. In each of the following
circumstances, all density calculations resulting in fractional units shall be
rounded up to the next whole number.
      3.   Any density bonus granted pursuant to this section shall be subject

15.20.000. Intent and purpose.
   This chapter establishes the city's planned residential development zones,
including permitted uses and physical development standards.
(Ord. 3229 (part), 2016).
15.20.005. Planned residential development zones.
   The following planned residential development zones are established:
   A.   PRD (planned residential development) is intended to provide
development standards for dwelling units in hillside and other areas to provide
common open space, recreational areas and/or conservation of natural terrain.
PRD is also intended to implement the Greenbelt Concept of the Fullerton
General Plan. Sections
15.20.010 through
15.20.090 pertain to the PRD classification.
   B.   PRD-I (planned residential development - infill) is intended to provide
development standards for vacant or underutilized sites which may be located
within existing residential neighborhoods or on sites identified in the General
Plan as appropriate for residential development. PRD-I also includes
opportunities for non-residential development on the ground floor in certain
areas. Sections
15.20.110 through
15.20.160 pertain to the PRD-I classification.
(Ord. 3229 (part), 2016).
15.20.010. Intent and purpose.
   A.   The PRD zone is intended to minimize grading and facilitate development
in hillside and other areas, where achieving a higher unit density under the
existing zoning and traditional development patterns would normally result in
the loss of natural terrain or other important site features.
   B.   The PRD zone utilizes flexible development standards that permit
smaller individual lots and clustering of dwelling units, which in turn
facilitates the conservation of natural terrain and other important site
features such as common open space and recreational areas. It is not the intent
of the PRD zone to provide a means for obtaining densities significantly higher
than those that could be obtained by conventional zoning on the same land.
   C.   The PRD zone is also intended to implement the Greenbelt Concept of the
Fullerton General Plan for those PRD-zoned sites located in the Greenbelt
Concept areas.
(Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.20.020. Permitted uses.
   Uses in the PRD zone shall be limited to the following:
   A.   Dwelling units:
   Attached and detached dwelling units with open space and/or recreational
areas.
   B.   Accessory buildings and structures:
   Accessory buildings and structures, including private garages, work sheds,
noncommercial greenhouses, patio covers and additions, with their location
subject to the approval by the Director of Development Services.
   C.   House pets with the following provisions:
      1.   In detached single units, any combination of dogs and cats, not to
exceed four adult animals, four months of age or older.
      2.   In attached duplex or cluster units, one dog and one cat (or two of
either) not to exceed two adults, four months of age or older.
      3.   Fish and birds excluding livestock and exotic varieties as defined
by Subsection
15.17.030.K of this title.
      4.   This section shall not take precedence over a more restrictive
management or association agreement/regulation regarding the keeping of
animals.
   D.   Home businesses as defined in
Chapter 15.04 of this title.
   E.    In detached single units only, a Small Family Child-Care Home as
defined in
Chapter 15.04 of this title and as regulated by California Health and Safety
Code.
   F.   Swimming pools, tennis courts, clubhouses and similar recreational
facilities for the sole use of the occupants of the PRD and their guests.
   G.   A Type VII retirement complex as defined in
Chapter 15.04 of this title. Whenever the PRD zone and the accompanying concept
plan for such a complex are approved, the property involved shall be designated
on the official Zoning Map with an "LC: (Life Care)" suffix; i.e., PRD-LC.
Notwithstanding Section
15.20.050 of this chapter, the development standards of parking and density for
a retirement complex are specified in
Chapter 15.55 of this title. Open space provisions shall be evaluated at the
time of concept plan review.
   H.   Residential beekeeping as defined by Subsection
15.17.030.S of this title.
(Ord. 3255 § 6, 2018; Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.20.025. Temporary uses.
   The following temporary uses shall be permitted in the PRD zone, for a
period not to exceed 90 days after the sale of the last unit in the PRD:
   A.   One temporary tract sales office and temporary parking areas for
contractors' equipment, with the location subject to approval by the Director
of Development Services.
   B.   Agricultural nurseries, as an interim use for the cultivation of
landscape materials within the boundary of the concept plan.
   C.   Real estate signs relating to the sale, lease or other disposition of
the real property on which the sign is located. Real estate signs shall conform
to the provisions of
Chapter 15.49 of this title.
(Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.20.030. Homeowners' Association requirements.
   A.   The unencumbered, fee simple title and ownership of all common open
space, easements, and recreational areas or facilities in a PRD shall be
conveyed and transferred to an independent Homeowners' Association structured
as a California nonprofit mutual benefit corporation. The primary objective of
the Homeowners' Association shall be the permanent retention and maintenance of
the common open space, recreation and other common areas and facilities for the
continued common use of the owners and occupants of the development, as
required by this chapter.
   B.   Each Homeowners' Association created for the purpose of this subsection
shall be established by procedures and documents approved by the City Attorney
at the time of, and as a condition of the approval for, the PRD concept plan.
   C.   Each dwelling unit in a PRD shall be irrevocably attached to one
membership in the Homeowners' Association. Each membership shall be transferred
with, and to the recipient of, each conveyance of its associated dwelling unit.
The total number of memberships shall be equal to the total number of dwelling
units. No one shall be a member of the Homeowners' Association except an owner
of a dwelling unit in the PRD, and each owner shall be a member.
   D.   Owners and occupants of any dwelling unit in a PRD shall have, during
the ownership or occupancy thereof, the right to use all of the common spaces,
areas and facilities.
   E.   Each Homeowners' Association shall establish procedures and documents
to enforce the payment of assessments or liens that may be levied by the
Homeowners' Association or the city.
(Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.20.040. Consistency with Greenbelt Concept of the General Plan.
   A.   For a residential development located within a Greenbelt Concept area,
the PRD zone is intended to implement the goals and policies of the Greenbelt
Concept designation in the Land Use Element of the Fullerton General Plan. This
concept states, in part, as follows:
   "Residential development is to be designed in such a way as to limit the
amount of grading required, employ contour grading where grading is necessary,
be unobtrusive as viewed from the open spaces and surrounding areas, and
contain those amenities that contribute to a feeling of open space. Such
amenities could include large lots, small lots with large common areas, low
densities, open recreational areas, internal greenbelts and trails, and other
similar aesthetic treatments."
   B.   In accordance with the Greenbelt Concept, a PRD located in the General
Plan Greenbelt Concept area will fall into one of the following three
categories:
      1.   Single-family Greenbelt.
      Single-family Greenbelt includes developments of single-family detached
dwelling units on lots of varying sizes. Internal open spaces in the form of
greenbelts, trails and common recreational areas are provided with many of the
privately owned facilities (see Figure 9A).

         Figure 9A
      2.   Detached Cluster:
      Detached Cluster includes those single-family, patio or other detached
housing type developments where the units are clearly placed into greenbelt
cluster environments with commonly owned open space (see Figure 9B). Greenbelts
are dispersed with common pedestrian access between all dwelling units. A
balance between private and common open spaces is maintained with a variety of
recreational facilities contained in common open spaces.

            Figure 9B
      3.   Attached Cluster:
      Attached Cluster includes attached townhouse or duplex dwelling units
arranged in large areas of open space with greenbelt connections between areas
(see Figure 9C). A balance between private and common open spaces is still
maintained, with a heavy emphasis placed on common open space and the
recreational opportunities that are contained within them.

15.20.050. Development standards.
   A.   General. The development standards listed below apply to any PRD.
      1.   Lot area:
      Lots in a PRD zone are exempt from the minimum lot area and width
requirements of this title; however, there shall be a ground lot for each
dwelling unit.
      2.    Density:
         a.   The density of a PRD zone shall be determined at the time of
concept plan approval in accordance with Section
15.20.080 of this chapter.
         b.   In all cases the concept plan must be compatible with the
topography of the site, the surrounding area, the General Plan, and Specific
Plan if applicable, so that the common open space and recreational area and the
enclosed private outdoor space provide adequate benefit to the occupants of
such developments. Where applicable, the concept plan shall also be consistent
with the Greenbelt Concept of the General Plan.
         c.   In cases where the site involves significant topographic
variation, the Planning Commission and/or City Council may require an example
of a conventionally-designed project using the existing or surrounding zoning
on the site in order to evaluate what density would realistically be obtainable
on the site under conventional zoning.
      3.    Permissible site coverage:
         a.   The maximum area that may be covered by dwelling units, parking
areas, and interior driveways shall not exceed 60 percent of the net land area
of the PRD. Net land area is defined as the gross land area minus any
dedications or an easement that effectively prohibits construction in the
easement area.
         b.   Remaining oil production facilities, when shown as open space on
the concept plan in accordance with Section
15.20.080 of this chapter, shall remain common open space in perpetuity and
shall be so specified in a Development Agreement.
      4.    Setbacks:
         a.   When the PRD has a common property line with another residential
zone, the buildings in the PRD zone shall be set back at least 20 feet from the
common property line.
         b.   A setback for a building in a PRD zone with ground floor line
elevations lower than the ground floor line elevations of buildings on adjacent
residential property may be reduced one-half foot for each foot difference in
the ground floor line elevations.
         c.   When the PRD has a common property line with a non-residential
zone or with land specified as private common open space, a building on the
PRD-zoned lot shall be set back at least 10 feet from the rear property line
and shall be set back at least 5 feet from the side property line.
         d.   All buildings in a PRD zone shall be set back at least 15 feet
from any perimeter public right-of-way. Perimeter walls shall be set back at
least ten feet from any public right-of-way, and the intervening area shall be
landscaped.
         e.   Open lattice patio covers shall be set back at least five feet
from a side and rear property line.
         f.   The setback for a garage that faces an interior street shall be
either less than ten or more than 20 feet from the back of sidewalk (or curb
face where there is no sidewalk).
         g.   The Director of Development Services may waive setback
restrictions for an accessory structure from a property line with a common area
lot.
      5.    Height:
         a.   The height of the buildings shall be considered as part of the
concept plan approval, subject to a maximum of two stories or 30 feet in
height, except that a building constructed into hillside of greater than 20
percent slope may be a maximum of three stories or 40 feet in height.
         b.   A basement or garage with more than one-half of its height under
natural grade as defined in
Chapter 15.04 of this title shall not count as a story.
      6.   Acoustic analysis required:
      All residential developments shall be subject to an acoustical analysis
as specified by Subsection
15.17.040.H of this title.
   B.   Specific standards for a Single-family Greenbelt development:
   The development standards listed below shall apply to Single-family
Greenbelt developments and are in addition to those listed in subsection
15.20.050.A of this chapter.

front on streets built to full city street standards.
         b.   Single-family Greenbelt dwelling units shall have minimum
separations of 40 feet rear-to-rear, 30 feet side-to-rear, and ten feet side-
to-side.
         c.   Specific locations of the homes on the lots may be altered from
the approved concept plan, subject to the above criteria and the approval of
the Director of Development Services.
      2.   Pedestrian access:
         a.   All dwelling units shall be connected to the common recreational
areas and perimeter public streets by a pedestrian walkway system located,
where possible, in separate greenbelts. Where a dwelling unit faces both sides
of conventional streets, sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of said
streets. The entire sidewalk and walkway system shall be depicted on the
concept plan and specifically approved.
         b.   A PRD of ten or less residential lots that meets or exceeds the
minimum lot area of the preexisting and surrounding zoning of the site may have
the pedestrian access requirements reduced or waived upon request to the
Planning Commission and/or City Council as part of the concept plan approval
process specified in Section
15.20.080 of this chapter.
      3.   Open space:
         a.   Every project shall have a minimum of 800 square feet of usable
open space per dwelling unit, plus an additional 200 square feet of usable open
space for each bedroom over one in said dwelling unit.
         b.   At least 40 percent of the total required usable open space shall
be in common in accordance with the definition and limitations contained in
Subsection
15.17.040.E of this title with the exception that one area of common usable
open space of at least 10,000 square feet shall be provided in a primary common
recreational area. Multiple common open space recreational areas shall be
dispersed throughout the project.
         c.   Remaining usable open space shall be distributed on individual
lots in the form of fenced yards, patios, decks, balconies and similar outdoor
areas.
         d.   A PRD of ten or fewer residential lots that meets or exceeds the
minimum lot area of the preexisting and surrounding zoning of the site may have
the common usable open space requirement reduced or waived upon request to the
Planning Commission and/or City Council as part of the concept plan approval
process specified in Section
15.20.080 of this chapter.
      4.   Floor/area ratio:
      The total floor area, including garages and lofts of all dwelling units
proposed in any phase of a PRD, shall not exceed .5 the total net area of the
lots on which the dwelling units are proposed. However, lots adjacent to, or
within 500 feet of and having direct access (without the necessity of crossing
any streets) to a common developed recreational area or a separated walkway/
greenbelt system leading to a common developed recreational area may be
developed up to .6 of the total net lot area. A common developed recreational
area means an area at least 10,000 sq. ft. and improved with a combination of
passive and active recreation for the enjoyment of the residents of the PRD.
   C.   Specific standards for a Detached Cluster development.
   The development standards listed below shall apply to a Detached Cluster
development in addition to those listed in Subsection
15.20.050.A of this chapter.

streets, shall be no further than across the cluster or across the street from
a pedestrian walkway system connecting to the common recreational areas and
perimeter public streets, and located, where possible, in separate greenbelts.
The entire sidewalk and walkway system shall be depicted on the concept plan
and specifically approved.
      3.    Private open space:
      A minimum of 500 square feet of private, enclosed and on-lot usable open
space shall be provided for each dwelling unit in the form of fenced yards,
patios, decks, balconies and similar outdoor areas. Countable private open
space areas must have a minimum dimension in any direction of at least ten feet
except that decks and balconies that are six feet or more in depth may be
counted as private open space.
      4.    Common open space:
         a.   At least 33 percent of the total lot area of a Detached Cluster
PRD project shall be provided as common usable open space, meeting the
requirements of Subsection
15.17.040.E of this title.
         b.   Common open space shall not include any fenced oil production
facilities.
         c.   The street setback along perimeter public streets may be counted

specified in
Chapter 16.05, at the discretion of the City, a setback greater than identified
in the above table may be required to effectively result in the required
sidewalk width.
2 Pertains to actual side property lines created for an ownership of land (fee
simple lot) as well as boundaries identified under condominium ownership.
3 The provision of open space, access, building separations and/or compliance
with Building and Fire Codes, may dictate a larger setback.

15.21.010. Intent and purpose.
   The purpose of the Specific Plan District (SPD) zone is to provide for the
orderly, systematic, detailed and enhanced implementation of particular areas
of the General Plan where a variety or combination of land uses are being
proposed over a substantial amount of land. The Specific Plan District (SPD)
zone provides for the establishment of physical development standards and
regulations for land uses that may be unique to the particular area where a
Specific Plan is being adopted. The preparation, review and adoption of a
Specific Plan within a Specific Plan District (SPD) zone shall be in accordance
with California Government Code Sections 65450 through 65457, incorporated
herein by reference as if fully set forth, and this chapter.
(Ord. 2982, 2001)
15.21.020. Application.
   A.   The Specific Plan District (SPD) zone shall be applied only to an area
where a Specific Plan is being proposed.
   B.   A Specific Plan must meet the following conditions:
      1.   The total area covered by the Specific Plan shall be 40 acres, or a
minimum size acceptable to the City Council.
      2.   The site shall have unique characteristics which necessitate the
need to be designated Specific Plan District, such as a unique mix of land uses
or specific community design objectives.
(Ord. 2982, 2001: Ord. 3009, 2002).
15.21.030. Initiation of Amendment for a Specific Plan District (SPD) zone.
   A.   The City Council shall identify those portions of the city where the
application of the Specific Plan District (SPD) zone is appropriate in
accordance with Section
15.21.020 of this chapter.
   B.   A Specific Plan for that area of land shall accompany an application
for an Amendment that requests a Specific Plan District (SPD) zone. At the
discretion of the City Council, a Specific Plan may be prepared by the City or
submitted by persons representing property owners.
   C.   When the City Council determines that a Specific Plan District (SPD)
zone is an appropriate method of planning for the future development of
property and implementing the General Plan, the cost of preparation of the
Specific Plan shall be borne by the affected property owner, unless the City
Council determines otherwise.
   D.   The procedure to adopt a Specific Plan District (SPD) zone shall be
subject to
Chapter 15.72 of this title.
(Ord. 2982, 2001)
15.21.040. Adoption of a Specific Plan.
   A.   A Specific Plan shall be adopted in the manner provided in this article
and in accordance with Section 65453 of the California Government Code. Such
Specific Plan shall be consistent with and implement the General Plan.
   B.   Each Specific Plan shall include the specific land uses including open
space, development standards and regulations, criteria for development, and
maintenance and use of the property subject to the Specific Plan. Development
standards shall include but not be limited to the street naming and numbering,
height, setback, landscaping, lot coverage, floor area ratios, utilities and
parking requirements.
   C.   Each Specific Plan shall include the purpose, type, location, extent
and financing of public and private improvements, including but not limited to
infrastructure facilities, schools, and flood control and transportation
facilities and any other measures considered appropriate or necessary to insure
the execution of the General Plan.
   D.   A Specific Plan shall be adopted concurrently with or after the
adoption of a Specific Plan District (SPD) zone for any particular area.
   E.   The review and adoption of a Specific Plan shall be subject to the
provisions and procedures outlined in Chapters 15.72 and 15.76 of this title.
   F.   The provisions of the Specific Plan shall supersede and control over
any conflicting provisions.
(Ord. 2982, 2001)
15.21.050. Approval of land uses.
   With respect to any property for which a Specific Plan has been adopted, no
tentative tract map or tentative parcel map may be approved nor may any permit,
license or other entitlement for use be granted or issued unless such map,
permit, license or other entitlement is consistent with such Specific Plan.
(Ord. 2982, 2001)
15.21.055. Design review.
   When any Specific Plan makes reference to the Redevelopment Design Review
Committee or Design Review Committee as part of a development review procedure,
the provisions of this title which the Community Development Director
determines are most similar to the intent of design review under the Specific
Plan shall apply. (Ord. 3267 §7, 2018)
15.21.060. Landscaping requirements.
   A.   All public right-of-way setbacks shall be landscaped except for
pedestrian and vehicular access ways, parking areas, or other non-irrigated
areas designed for non-development (e.g. existing native vegetation).
   B.   All open parking areas (e.g. non-structured, non-garage) shall be
landscaped such that:
      a.   Planters with a total landscaped area equaling a minimum of 25
square feet per parking space, or 8% of the square footage of the open parking
area, whichever is greater, shall be provided and distributed throughout the
open parking area; and
      b.   Trees with a total shaded area (e.g. the area under the tree canopy
or dripline 15 years after installation) equaling a minimum of 50% of the
square footage of the open parking area shall be provided and distributed
throughout the open parking area.
   C.   Landscaping and irrigation shall be provided for landscaped areas
pursuant to
Chapter 15.50 for the following:
      a.   Installation of new landscaped areas; or
      b.   Rehabilitation of existing landscaped area where affected landscaped
area is equal to or greater than 2,500 square feet; or
      c.   Installation of a new landscape area or areas less than 2,500 sq.
ft. in aggregate may opt to comply instead with the prescriptive measures
contained in
Chapter 15.50 Appendix A.; or
      d.   New or rehabilitated projects using treated or untreated graywater
or rainwater captured on site, any lot or parcels within the project that has
less than 2,500 square feet of landscape area and meets the lot or parcel’s
landscape water requirement (Estimated Total Water Use) entirely with the
treated or untreated graywater or through stored rainwater captured on site is
subject only to Appendix A Section (5).
   D.   The governing documents of a common interest development (e.g.
community apartment projects, condominium projects, planned developments, and
stock cooperatives per Civil Code Section 1351) shall not prohibit or include
conditions that have the effect of prohibiting the use of low-water use plants
as a group or restricting compliance with a local water-efficient landscape
ordinance or water conservation measure.

   A.   This zone is intended to minimize conflicts when existing oil
facilities are proposed for inclusion in new residential development.
   B.   This zone is an overlay zone, to be used only with a underlying
residential base zone.
   C.   Different standards and requirements are established, depending on
proximity of facilities to dwelling units, access to the facilities and whether
facilities are integrated into private or public open space areas or not.
   D.   The O-G (oil-gas) zone will continue as the basic oil operations zone
where continued production of and new drilling for oil, gas and other
hydrocarbon substances is permitted and encouraged.
   E.    The requirements imposed by this zone are intended to supplement those
requirements for oil and gas operations and abandonment procedures mandated by
the State Public Resources Code Section 3106 et seq. and the regulations
promulgated under that statutory authority.
(Ord. 2982, 2001)
15.22.020. Overlay zone.
   A.   The application of this zone shall be signified by the designation of
an "O" suffix following the base zone designation on the official zoning map.
For example, the use of this zone in conjunction with the planned residential
development zone would be designated as "PRD-O."
   B.   Approval of the overlay zone shall be obtained by the applicant for the
residential development prior to or concurrent with the recordation of a
residential tract map on the subject property.
   C.   However, the provisions of Sections 15.22.060, 15.22.080, and 15.22.090
shall take effect only when homes are occupied within three hundred feet of the
well in question.
(Ord. 2982, 2001)
15.22.030. Definitions.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following meanings shall apply:
   ABANDONMENT shall be as defined by the regulations of the Division of Oil
and Gas of the California Department of Conservation and include the
restoration of the drill site as required by said regulations.
   DERRICK means any framework, tower or mast, together with all parts of and
appurtenances to such structure, including any foundations.
   DESERTED WELL shall be as defined in Section 3237 of the Public Resources
Code; i.e., a well that has had no production or injection equipment or
facilities utilized in connection with it for a consecutive period of two years
or more.
   DRILLING means digging a hole in the earth for the production of oil and
gas.
   IDLE WELL means a well with no active production or injection equipment or
facilities operating in connection therewith, but not yet qualified as a
deserted well.
   INJECTION WELL means a well used for the purpose of injecting water,
wastewater, hydrocarbons, gas, steam or any other substance under pressure into
an underground stratum.
   RECOMPLETION means work performed on a well to change production intervals
that does not require redrilling or deepening.
   REDRILLING means the deepening of an existing oil well or otherwise drilling
beyond the extremities (to the side) of the existing well casing.
   REWORKING means routine work performed on a well after its completion, in an
effort to secure production where there has been none, restore production that
has ceased, or increase production. As an example, cleaning out a well that has
silted up, including the pulling up of the rods or tubing is a typical
reworking operation.
   SUMP or SUMP-PIT means an earthen pit lined or unlined for the discharge of
oil field wastes.
   WELL means a hole drilled into the earth for the purpose of exploring for or
extracting oil, gas or other hydrocarbon substances or for the purpose of
injecting fluids for enhanced secondary recovery or otherwise related to such
purposes.
(Ord. 2982, 2001)
15.22.040. Plan required.
   A.   The proposed residential developer shall, together with any required
zone change and/or tentative tract map request, provide a plan showing how
existing oil well facilities will be protected and integrated into the proposed
residential development.
   B.   The developer shall also submit a plan of the ultimate use of the land
after abandonment of the wells.
   C.   The plans shall be submitted to the city, the State Division of Oil and
Gas and the oil operator. Comments from the latter two shall be submitted for
consideration by the Planning Commission at least two weeks prior to the public
hearing on the requested zone change and/or tentative tract map. Division of
Oil and Gas and operator shall be notified of the public hearing by the
Development Services Department at the earliest possible date, but not less
than 20 days prior to the hearing. The public hearing should be held no sooner
than 60 days after the plan is submitted to the city, the State Division of Oil
and Gas and the oil operator.

intended for public or assembly occupancy (such as recreation buildings or
clubhouses).
   D.   The developer shall design the residential development to assure that
these requirements are met. Any buildable lot containing an area which may not
be built upon because of this requirement shall be encumbered by the developer

The tank and all such materials shall be removed forthwith from the drill site
upon completion of such operation.
   E.   If the City Council has approved and adopted a Development Agreement
wherein the developer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the City harmless
for any and all liabilities, costs or expenses incurred as a result of any
claim or legal action taken by any person on the basis of any muds, waste or
soil contamination on the property covered by the Development Agreement, such
muds and wastes may be remediated on site rather than removed, providing that
the developer's soils engineer certifies that it has been done so in accordance
with applicable rules and regulations of county and state agencies.
(Ord. 2982, 2001)
15.22.080. Hours of operation.

Chapter 15.90 of this title shall be complied with at all times. In the event
of allegations submitted to the Development Services Department that any
operation violates said chapter, and the Director of Development Services
determines that noise measurements should be performed, the City shall engage
the services of a qualified noise consultant to take the necessary noise
measurements to determine the validity of such allegation and to report thereon
to the Director of Development Services.
   B.   If the measurements confirm the alleged violation, the oil operator
shall deposit with the Director of Development Services a sum equal to the
costs of the services of the noise consultant. In addition, noise protection
measures shall be implemented to the satisfaction of the Director of
Development Services.
   C.   The Director may require that noise measurements be performed again to
confirm that the mitigation measures have brought the operation into compliance

   C.   Location of parking:
      1.   All required on-site parking spaces shall be located on the same lot
or building site, except that such spaces may be permitted at other locations
when and as authorized by a Conditional Use Permit when and if authorized for
restaurants within the Restaurant Overlay District as set forth by Chapter
15.67.
      2.   Parking shall not be located within any setback area.
      3.   Required parking spaces may overhang two feet over landscaped areas
and walkways, other than street rights-of-way, provided the total depth of any
such landscaped area or walkway is at least six feet.
      4.   All required parking spaces shall have separate access to a public
street or alley.
      5.   Each right angle parking space or angled parking space with an angle
greater than 60 degrees having direct access to an abutting alley, 20 feet wide
or less, shall be separated or set back from said alley right-of-way line by a
minimum of five feet.
      6.   Mechanical and automated parking devices may be used in any
commercial zone classification provided the devices are enclosed within a
building designed for such use. Such devices may be used outside of a building
provided they are not visible from the street or from adjacent properties,
subject to the approval of a Site Plan application pursuant to Section
15.47.025 of this Title.
   D.   Mixed-use occupancies and joint use of parking
      1.   The total on-site parking spaces required on any property when more
than one class of use is proposed (for either the same property or within the
same occupancy) shall be equal to the sum of the spaces required in this title
for each of such separate classes of use.
      2.   A Minor Exception may be granted to reduce the required parking for
mixed-use occupancies (i.e., a joint use of parking), based upon the submission
of Shared Parking Analysis as defined in Chapter 15.04 and enforceable
documents guaranteeing that the uses will be operating during mutually
exclusive hours, and upon such other circumstances or criteria as the Planning
Commission, or City Council on appeal, may require.
      3.   The Planning Commission or City Council/ Redevelopment Agency shall
consider the following when evaluating joint use parking applications:
         a.   The nature and location within the development of the proposed
uses, as well as their size compared to that of the overall development.
         b.   Assurances as to the non- overlapping nature of the non-retail
and retail peak-activity periods.
         c.   The provision of peak- hour parking beyond the property
boundaries.
         d.   The location and adequacy of the parking in the particular
portion of the development wherein joint use of parking is proposed.
   E.   Parking requirement for change of use:
   In the case of a proposed change of use for an existing building where the
parking does not meet current standards for the proposed use, so long as the
proposed use is permitted by right in the zone, no expansion is being made to
the building envelope and the property does not have any open Code Enforcement
cases, no increase in parking will be required.
   F.   Reduction in required parking:
   For those developments that must comply with Section
15.30.100 of this chapter, the Planning Commission may, by Conditional Use
Permit, reduce the number of required carpool and vanpool parking spaces to a
maximum of 30 percent of what would otherwise be required under Subsection
15.30.060.G of this chapter.
   G.   Carpool/vanpool parking:
      1.   A minimum of ten percent of employee parking spaces, as defined
below, shall be reserved (through signage or other means) for the exclusive use
of carpools and vanpools. The spaces shall be located as close as practical to
the entrance(s) of the use they are intended to serve.
      2.   The total number of employee parking spaces for calculating the
vanpool/carpool parking space requirement shall be determined by one of the
following:
                        Percent of Total Parking
      Type of Use               Devoted to Employee
      Commercial                  30%
      Office Professional               85%
      Hotel/Motel                  30%
      3.   Alternatively, the applicant, subject to the approval of the
Director of Development Services, may provide the total number of employee
spaces intended for each use in the project.
   H.   Public parking districts:
      1.   A public parking district may consist of an area or structure that

revocation of a CUP or ARUP. (Ord. 3270 (part), 2019)
15.31.050.   Nuisance businesses.
   A.   Any business which sells alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption in
the City that does not have a CUP or an ARUP or was opened without any city use
permits required at the time of opening, will be considered a nuisance business
if the Planning Commission or City Council, as the case may be, determines that
the business has been operated in such a fashion as to cause an adverse impact
on the neighboring businesses and/or residences, the City’s Police Department,
the Maintenance Services Department, or in violation of the law or any permit
which it may have been issued.
   B.   The criteria for determining whether a business is a nuisance shall be
the same types of occurrences specified in Section
15.31.040.B.
   C.   The Planning Commission or City Council shall conduct a public hearing
in order to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to declare the
business a nuisance. If a business is declared a nuisance business by the
Planning Commission, that decision may be appealed, in writing, to the City
Council within ten (10) business days of the Planning Commission’s action.
   D.   If a business is declared a nuisance business by the Planning
Commission and no timely appeal is filed, the decision becomes final ten (10)
business days after issuance of the decision.
   E.   If an appeal of a Planning Commission determination is filed within the
specified timeframe, the City Council shall conduct a new public hearing on the
matter and issue a decision as soon as possible, but no later than sixty (60)
days after the conclusion of its deliberations. If the City Council upholds the
determination that the business is a nuisance business, that decision becomes
final upon issuance of the City Council’s decision.
   F.   If a business operating without a CUP or ARUP is declared a nuisance
business, the Planning Commission or City Council, as the case may be, may
require the business to apply for a CUP or ARUP, as may be appropriate based on
the operational characteristics of the business, subject to the imposition of
conditions which will, in the judgment of the Commission or Council, mitigate
or address the type(s) of nuisance activity which has been found to occur at
the business. (Ord. 3270 (part), 2019)
15.31.060.   Discontinuance.
   Any use permit for a business with On-Site Alcohol Sales shall be
automatically deemed revoked if the use is discontinued for three-hundred and
sixty-five (365) consecutive days or if the ABC license for the establishment

15.35.030.   Review of development project.
15.35.050.    Site development standards.
15.35.010. Intent and purpose.
   The Commercial Greenbelt (C-G) zone is intended to be applied only to areas
designated on the land use element of the Fullerton general plan as "Greenbelt
Concept." The zone shall be used to identify property where, due to its scenic
environment and proximity to residential areas, only restrictive commercial
activities should be allowed to take place. The Commercial Greenbelt (C-G) zone
shall require that proposed development consist of only highly aesthetic,
unobtrusive buildings or structures and related improvements, blended into a
heavily landscaped setting.
(Ord. 2982, 2001)
15.35.020. Specific plan and permitted uses.
   A Specific Plan shall be adopted for all property with the Commercial
Greenbelt (C-G) zone. The Specific Plan shall identify allowable uses for the
property and shall impose use restrictions and development standards applicable
to the unique circumstances of each individual site. All such restrictions and
standards shall be enforced as part of this zone.
(Ord. 2982, 2001)
15.35.030. Review of development project.
   A.   Specific proposals to use, develop, redevelop, or modify the property
in accordance with the adopted Specific Plan shall be reviewed as a Major
Development Project, pursuant to
Chapter 15.46.
   B.   Factors that shall be considered in the review of a specific proposal
are 1) noise of operation; 2) hours of operation; 3) traffic generated; 4)
access safety; and 5) compatibility with the characteristics of the site as
well as the surrounding area.
(Ord. 2982, 2001)
15.35.050. Site development standards.
   A.   Permitted building height and appearance:
      1.   No building or structure shall exceed a height of one story or 20
feet, whichever is less; however, two stories not to exceed 30 feet may be
approved as a design feature for a minor portion of a building, or when unusual
circumstances exist in connection with the location or terrain of the site, and
the height is not incompatible with the surrounding area.
        2.   In all cases, a residential style of architecture shall be
required.
   B.   Permitted site coverage:
      1.   All buildings, and paving, including accessory buildings and
structures and any area used to provide parking or vehicular circulation, shall
cover not more than 60 percent of the site. However, driveways not providing
turnaround or circulation areas for any parking spaces may exceed said 60
percent by not more than an additional five percent of the site if the use of
such driveways results in a site layout that more closely conforms to the
intent and criteria of this zone than would otherwise be the case.
      2.   Any area not covered by buildings or required paving shall be
landscaped, irrigated, and thereafter permanently maintained. The 40 percent of
the site required to be landscaped shall include the setback landscaping and
shall include landscaping of at least ten percent of the parking and other
paved areas, reasonably distributed throughout said area.
   C.   Setback requirements:
      1.   Setback requirements shall be determined in connection with the
approval of the Specific Plan. A proposed development should maintain an
average landscaped setback of at least 20 feet in depth adjacent to any street
and any interior property line abutting a lot with a residential zone
classification.
      2.   Where the minimum setback is unfeasible because of terrain or other
unusual circumstances, consideration shall be given to mitigating measures such
as special treatment of buildings or walls or the provision for courtyards or
other features.
   D.   Screening Requirement:
      Special consideration shall be given to screening by the use of
decorative block walls or other suitable features along a property line
abutting a lot with a residential zone classification.
   E.   Lighting:
      Only ground-level indirect lighting devices shall provide all exterior
lighting.
   F.   Parking:
      Parking shall be provided in accordance with Section
15.30.060 of this title.

of materials compatible with the building design and shall not exceed six feet
in height or 25 square feet in area.
      2.   Wall signs shall be discouraged but, when permitted, shall be raised
letter only, unlighted or dimly back-lighted, not to exceed one-half square
foot in area per front foot of building, or 50 square feet total area per
building, whichever is less. In all other respects
Chapter 15.49 of this title shall apply.
      3.   Banners, pennants and streamers are specifically prohibited.
   H.   Transportation Demand Management (TDM) requirements:
      TDM improvements and standards shall be provided in accordance with
Section
15.30.100 of this title.
   I.   Floor/area ratio (FAR):
      1.   The base floor/area ratio (FAR) for the total area of all habitable
space on the property shall be .30.
       2.   All restrictions and review procedures pertaining to the FAR for
property with a commercial zone classification, as specified in Subsection
15.30.050.E of this title, shall also apply to a proposal on property with the
Commercial Greenbelt (C-G) zone.
   J. Landscape requirements.
      1.   All street setbacks shall be landscaped except for pedestrian and
vehicular access ways, parking areas, or other non-irrigated areas designed for
non-development (e.g. existing native vegetation);
      2.   All open parking areas (e.g. non-structured) shall be landscaped
such that:
         a.   Planters with a total landscaped area equaling a minimum of 25
square feet per parking space, or 8% of the square footage of the open parking
area, whichever is greater, shall be provided and distributed throughout the
open parking area; and
         b.   Trees with a total shaded area (e.g. the area under the tree
canopy or dripline 15 years after installation) equaling a minimum of 50% of
the square footage of the open parking area shall be provided and distributed
throughout the open parking area.
      3.   Landscaping and irrigation shall be provided for landscaped areas
pursuant to
Chapter 15.50 for the following:
      a.   Installation of new landscaped areas; or
      b.   Rehabilitation of existing landscaped areas where affected
landscaped area is equal to or greater than 2,500 square feet; or
      c.   Installation of a new landscape area or areas less than 2,500 sq.
ft. in aggregate may opt to comply instead with the prescriptive measures
contained in
Chapter 15.50 Appendix A.
      d.   New or rehabilitated projects using treated or untreated graywater
or rainwater captured on site, any lot or parcels within the project that has
less than 2,500 square feet of landscape area and meets the lot or parcel’s
landscape water requirement (Estimated Total Water Use) entirely with the
treated or untreated graywater or through stored rainwater captured on site is
subject only to Appendix A Section (5).

   A.   At the time a Rural Street Overlay is established for a neighborhood,
design guidelines shall be prepared for review by the Planning Commission and
adoption by the City Council.
   B.   The design guidelines may be amended periodically. Unless an amendment
to the design guidelines would significantly restrict the development rights of
an impacted property owner, no public notice is required to revise the
guidelines.

approval of the Major Site Plan shall run with the life of the vesting
tentative map. Notwithstanding Subsection E of this section, no extension of
time for the Major Site Plan shall be required unless the vesting tentative map
expires. At the time of expiration of the vesting tentative map, all
proceedings shall terminate and a new application for the subdivision and a
Major Site Plan shall be required.

Landmark" or property within a designated "Landmark District."
   A.   All proposed development, including the rehabilitation of existing
structures, will be reviewed for compliance with established design criteria
and standards which shall serve to conserve, maintain, and protect the special
characteristics of the particular "Historical Landmark" or "Landmark District,"
and therefore prevent those alterations that would detrimentally compromise the
historic or aesthetic integrity of said property or its relationship to its
natural setting. The primary concern is with the exterior of the building or
structure unless there are interior features that greatly contribute to the
significance of the property. As a general guide, the Secretary of the
Interior's "Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Properties" and the State
Historic Building Code shall be used as the design criteria for reviewing
proposed development.
   B.   Every attempt shall be made to achieve restoration or modification in
keeping with the historic nature of theproperty, but not so as to burden said
property with requirements that are not practically or economically available
in current markets. Except in the case of an identified "Significant Property",
alterations or changes to buildings or structures within a designated "Landmark
District" shall be reviewed as to consistency and compatibility rather than
total restoration.
   C.   All proposed development for a designated “Historical Landmark” or a
property within a designated “Landmark District” will be subject to the
following types of review and approval. Routine maintenance of existing
improvements (e.g., repainting of a structure, duplicating damaged or
deteriorated exterior architectural features) is exempt from these review
procedures as long as the original design is retained.
      1.   Those projects listed below which the Community Development Director
determines are consistent with the design criteria of the Secretary of the
Interior’s “Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Properties” and the State
Historic Building Code are subject to administrative review and approval by the
Community Development Department:
         a.   Minor alterations, including the addition, change, or removal of
exterior architectural features and existing hardscape.
         b.   Minor improvements such as air conditioning units, skylights,
solar panels, greenhouse windows, roof mounted equipment, arbors and fences.
         c.   All development wherein a landmark building or structure is being
enlarged by less than 10 percent of the existing floor area and such addition
is not readily visible from the public street.
         d.   The construction or demolition of accessory structures which have
a floor area less than 500 square feet and are not readily visible from the
public street.
      2.   Those projects listed below are subject to review and approval by
the Community Development Director as a Site Plan in accordance with Sections
15.47.025 and
15.47.040 of this title:
         a.   Any proposed development that involves the construction of a new,
detached building or structure on the lot which has a floor area of 500 square
feet or more and that is not readily visible from the public street.
         b.   Any combination of alterations and additions which result in a
landmark building being enlarged by more than 10 percent but less than 50
percent of the existing floor area and does not exceed 500 square feet, when
the alterations and additions are not readily visible from the public street.
      3.   Those projects listed below are subject to review and approval by
the Landmarks Commission as a Site Plan in accordance with Sections
15.47.025 and
15.47.040 of this title.
         a.   The construction or demolition of accessory structures which are
readily visible from the public street.
         b.   Any proposed development that involves the construction of a new,
detached building or structure on the lot where it is readily visible from the
public street.
         c.   Any alterations or additions to a Landmark building or structure
wherein such modifications are readily visible from the public street.
         d.   The demolition of a Landmark building or structure wherein all or
part of it will be removed from a site either by relocation or destruction.
      4.   When the Community Development Director determines that a project is
inconsistent with the design criteria of the Secretary of Interior’s “Standards
for Rehabilitation of Historic Properties” and/or the State Historic Building
Code, the Director’s determination may be appealed to the Landmarks Commission.
(Ord. 3267 §13, 2018; Ord. 3232 (part), 2016; Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.48.080. Procedures for review of proposals of an identified "Significant
Property."
   A.   A proposal to demolish or relocate a designated “Significant Property”
shall be subject to the approval of the Landmarks Commission.
   B.   A proposal to alter, add, reconstruct, rehabilitate or restore a
designated “Significant Property” shall be subject to a review by the Landmarks
Commission.
   C.   Routine maintenance of existing improvements and minor alterations or
additions that are out of public view (e.g., the re-roofing of a structure, the
replacement of damaged or deteriorated exterior architectural features; the
construction of an accessory structure at the rear of the property) may be
administratively approved by the Community Development Director.
   D.   A determination of the Community Development Director that a proposal
would substantially change the architectural style of the building or would
create a condition or design feature that subsequently could not easily be
removed or altered may be appealed to the Landmarks Commission.
(Ord. 3267 §14, 2018; Ord. 3232 (part), 2016; Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.48.090. Facade easements.
   A.   At the request of the property owner, the city may accept in dedication
an easement for public protection of the facade of an identified "Significant
Property" or designated "Historical Landmark" in order to assure its continued
preservation and maintenance. Said easement shall be granted in the form of a
deed and shall in effect make the city the owner of the facade.
   B.   Unless otherwise agreed by both parties, maintenance of said facade
shall be the responsibility of the property owner, but no alterations or
changes of any kind to the facade shall be permitted without city approval.

(Ord. 3226, 2015; Ord. 3134, 2009)
15.50.035.   Water efficient landscape calculations.
   A.   Water efficient landscape calculations shall be prepared by and bear
the signature of a professional appropriately licensed in the State of
California to provide professional landscape design services; the signature
shall be accompanied by a date and the following statement: "I have complied
with the City of Fullerton Landscape Ordinance in preparing the Water Efficient

* The values in this table were derived from the California Irrigation
Management Information System (CIMIS) Spatial CIMIS data by zip code based on
the monthly average for zip codes in the City of Fullerton.
   C.   The licensed landscape professional shall calculate the Estimated
Applied Water Use (EAWU) for the total landscaped area to determine the total
annual irrigation water need of the project as required to keep plants in a
healthy state. The EAWU shall be calculated using the formula and methodology
established in Appendix C to the Fullerton Landscape Ordinance. A separate
worksheet shall be prepared for each point of connection. Seasonal calculations
can be aggregated for an annual total.
   D.   The EAWU for the total landscaped area shall not exceed the MAWA.
      1.   The EAWU shall be calculated using a Reference Evapotranspiration
Rate (ETo) in accordance with Table 15.50.035A.
      2.   The EAWU shall be calculated using the plant water use factor
according to protocols defined in detail in the Water Use Classification of
Landscape Species (WUCOLS) or from a source approved by the California
Department of Water Resources. The plant factor ranges from 0 to 0.1 for very
low water use plants, 0.1 to 0.3 for low water use plants, 0.4 to 0.6 for
moderate water use plants, and 0.7 to 1.0 for high water use plants. The
species factor shall be determined for each hydrozone based on the highest-
water-use plant species within the zone.
         a.   The area of a special landscaped area (SLA) or water feature
shall be defined as a high water use hydrozone with a species factor of 1.0
unless a plant factor according to protocols defined in detail in the WUCOLS is
available. For calculation of the EAWU, the ETAF for SLA shall be calculated as
the SLA plant factor divided by the SLA irrigation efficiency factor.
         b.   A temporarily irrigated hydrozone area, such as an area of highly
drought-tolerant native plants that are not intended to be irrigated after they
are fully established, shall be defined as a very low water use hydrozone with
a species factor of 0.1.
      3.   The EAWU shall be calculated using an Irrigation Efficiency
assumption by head type in accordance with Table 15.50.035B. Other values may
be used when supported by manufacturer's specifications or landscape
professional's calculations when derived from measurements and estimates of
irrigation system characteristics and management practices.

15.50.040.   Soil and Stormwater Management.
   A.   All planted landscape areas are required to have friable soil to
maximize retention and infiltration. On engineered slopes, only amended
planting holes need meet this requirement.
   B.   The licensed landscape professional shall submit soil samples to a
certified agronomic soils laboratory for analysis and recommendations in order
to ensure the landscaped area is designed to drain to promote healthy plant
growth and to prevent excessive erosion and runoff. These samples shall be
taken when the soil conditions of the landscape areas will no longer be
impacted by grading or other earthmoving activities.
   C.   Soil sampling shall be conducted in accordance with laboratory
protocol, including protocols regarding adequate sampling depth for the
intended plants.
   D.   The minimum information to be included in the report shall be:
      1.   Soil texture;
      2.   Infiltration rate determined by laboratory test or soil texture;
      3.   Infiltration rate table;
      4.   pH;
      5.   Total soluble salts;
      6.   Sodium;
      7.   Percent organic matter; and
      8.   Recommendations to ensure landscaped areas are designed to drain to
promote healthy plant growth and to prevent excessive erosion and runoff.
   E.   In projects with multiple landscape installations (i.e., production
home developments) a soil sampling rate of 1 in 7 lots or approximately 15% of
the site will satisfy this requirement.
   F.   Information and recommendations from the Soil Management Report shall
be incorporated into the Certified Landscape and Irrigation Design Plans, and
implemented in the installation of the landscape project as set forth in
Sections
15.50.045 and
15.50.050.
   G.   It is strongly recommended that landscape areas be designed for capture
and infiltration capacity that is sufficient to prevent runoff from impervious
surfaces (i.e. roof and paved areas) from additional capacity as required by
any applicable local, regional, state, or federal regulation and/or one of the
following: the one inch, 24-hour rain event or the 85th percentile, 24-hour
rain event.
   H.   It is recommended that storm water projects incorporate any of the
following elements to improve on-site stormwater and dry weather runoff capture
and use:
      1.   Grade impervious surfaces, such as driveways, during construction to
drain into vegetated areas.
      2.   Minimize the area of impervious surfaces such as paved areas, roof,
and concrete driveways.
      3.   Incorporate pervious or porous surfaces (e.g. gravel, permeable
pavers or blocks, pervious or porous concrete) that minimize runoff.
      4.   Direct runoff from paved surfaces and roof areas into planting beds
or landscape areas to maximize site water capture and reuse.
      5.   Incorporate rain gardens, cisterns, and other rain harvesting or

contamination of the water supply due to the reverse flow of water from the
irrigation system.
“Check valve” or “anti-drain valve” means a valve located under a sprinkler
head, or other location in the irrigation system, to hold water in the system
to prevent drainage from sprinkler heads when the sprinkler is off.
“Certified Landscape Irrigation Auditor” means a person certified to perform
landscape irrigation audits by an accredited academic institution, a
professional trade organization or other program such as the US Environmental
Protection Agency’s WaterSense irrigation auditor certification program and
Irrigation Association's Certified Landscape Irrigation Auditor program.
“Certification of Design” means the certification included as Exhibit E of
these Guidelines that must be included in the Landscape Documentation Package
pursuant to Section 2.1 of these Guidelines.
“City” means the City of Fullerton or its authorized designee.
“Common interest developments” means community apartment projects, condominium
projects, planned developments, and stock cooperatives per Civil Code Section
1351.
“Distribution Uniformity” or “DU” is a measure of how uniformly an irrigation
head applies water to a specific target area and theoretically ranges from zero
to 100 percent.
“Drip” irrigation means any non-spray low volume irrigation system utilizing
emission devices with a flow rate measured in gallons per hour. Low volume
irrigation systems are specifically designed to apply small volumes of water
slowly at or near the root zone of plants.
“Emitter” means a drip irrigation emission device that delivers water slowly
from the system to the soil.
“Estimated Applied Water Use” or “EAWU” means the annual total amount of water
estimated to keep plants in a healthy state. It is based on factors such as
reference evapotranspiration rate, the size of the landscape area, plant water
use factors, and the irrigation efficiency within each hydrozone.
“Evapotranspiration adjustment factor” or “ETAF” means a factor of 0.7, that,
when applied to reference evapotranspiration, adjusts for plant factors and
irrigation efficiency, two major influences upon the amount of water that needs
to be applied to the landscape. A combined plant mix with a site-wide average
of 0.5 is the basis of the plant factor portion of this calculation. For
purposes of the ETAF, the average irrigation efficiency is 0.71. Therefore, the
ET Adjustment Factor is (0.7)=(0.5/0.71). ETAF for a Special Landscape Area
shall not exceed 1.0. ETAF for existing non-rehabilitated landscapes is 0.8.
“Evapotranspiration rate” means the quantity of water evaporated from adjacent
soil and other surfaces and transpired by plants during a specified time.
“Flow rate” means the rate at which water flows through pipes, valves and
emission devices, measured in gallons per minute, gallons per hour, or cubic
feet per second.
“Hardscapes” means any durable material or feature (pervious and non-pervious)
installed in or around a landscape area, such as pavements or walls. Pools and
other water features are considered part of the landscape area and not

found in California that spread outside cultivated areas and can damage
environmental or economic resources. Invasive plant species may be regulated by
county agricultural agencies as noxious species.
“Irrigation audit” means an in-depth evaluation of the performance of an
irrigation system conducted by a Certified Landscape Irrigation Auditor. An
irrigation audit includes, but is not limited to: inspection, system tune-up,
system test with distribution uniformity or emission uniformity, reporting
overspray or runoff that causes overland flow, and preparation of an irrigation
schedule.
“Irrigation Management Efficiency” or “IME” means the measurement used to
calculate the irrigation efficiency of the irrigation system for a landscaped

soil moisture sensors, and other methods that will adjust irrigation run times
to meet plant water needs.
“Irrigation efficiency” or “IE” means the measurement of the amount of water
beneficially used divided by the amount of water applied to a landscape area.
Irrigation efficiency is derived from measurements and estimates of irrigation
system characteristics and management practices. The minimum average irrigation
efficiency for purposes of these Guidelines is 0.71. Greater irrigation
efficiency can be expected from well designed and maintained systems. The
following irrigation efficiency may be obtained for the listed irrigation heads

   The City Council finds and determines as follows:
   A.   Section 7901 authorizes telephone and wireless corporations to
construct telephone or wireless telecommunication lines along and upon any
public road or highway, along or across any of the waters or lands within this
state and to erect poles, posts, piers or abatements for supporting the
insulators, wires and other necessary fixtures of their lines, in such manner
and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the road or highway or
interrupt the navigation of the waters.
   B.   California Public Utilities Code Section 7901.1 confirms the right of
municipalities to exercise reasonable control as to the time, place and manner
for access to roads, highways and waterways, which control must be applied to
all entities in an equivalent manner and may involve the imposition of fees.
Specifically, the courts have determined that a municipality has authority to
regulate the placement and appearance of telecommunications equipment installed
on its public rights-of-way and that a municipality need not grant wireless
providers blanket permission to install their equipment throughout a
municipality, but may require wireless providers to go through a site-specific
permitting process provided the process does not create a burden that it runs
afoul of section 7901.

      1.   Requirements for Ministerial Approval of Small Wireless Facilities.
The Director shall ministerially approve, subject to the conditions stated in
Section
15.53.100, a complete and duly filed application for a Wireless Permit if the
Director determines that:
         a.   the proposed project is a small wireless facility, and
         b.   the proposed project would not be located on a structure within
the boundaries of the Central Business District (CBD) and would not be located
on a new pole or support structure within a Residential Preservation Zone (P),
and
         c.   either: (i) the proposed project would meet the requirements of
Section
15.53.060 (regarding preferred locations and structures) as compared to the
other substantially different potential alternatives within 500 feet of the
proposed project or (ii) any more-preferred location(s) and support structure
(s) within 500 feet would be technically infeasible, and
         d.   the proposed project complies with Municipal Code Section
15.53.070, (“Small Wireless Facility Setback Requirements”) requirements, and
         e.   the proposed project will be in planned compliance with all
applicable FCC regulations and guidelines for human exposure to RF emissions,
and

standard plans and all other applicable standards in this Code.
      2.   Findings for Discretionary Approval of Small Wireless Facilities and
other Wireless Facilities. If the proposal is for a telecommunications facility
that does not meet all of the requirements of subsection B.1, immediately
above, the Director shall issue the permit if the following findings are made
after conducting a public hearing (if a public hearing is required):
         a.   The proposed location for the facility is reasonable when
considering both (i) the federal mandate to not regulate personal wireless
service facilities in a manner that would “prohibit or have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services” and (ii) the city’s
legitimate related policy objectives relating to the location of wireless
facilities.
         b.   The proposed facility is substantially compatible with existing
or planned developments and uses in the same general area and would not be
substantially detrimental to existing or planned developments or uses within
the general area.
         c.   The proposed facility will not be materially detrimental to the
health, safety and general welfare of the public (excluding any environmental
effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply
with the Federal Communication Commission’s regulations concerning such
emissions).
         d.   Antennas and any poles or other structures erected to support
antennas are visually compatible with their surroundings.
      3.   Conditional Approvals, Denials Without Prejudice. Subject to any
applicable federal or California laws, except to the extent contrary to a
statement in this code, nothing in this code is intended to limit the ability
to conditionally approve or deny without prejudice any Wireless Permit
application as may be necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance with this
code.

infrastructure deployments that involve RF transmitters must include signage
that accurately identifies the site owner/operator, the owner/operator’s site
name or identification number and a toll-free number to the owner/operator’s
network operations center. Small wireless facilities and other infrastructure
deployments may not bear any other signage or advertisements unless expressly
approved by the City, required by law or recommended under FCC or other United
States governmental agencies for compliance with RF emissions regulations.
Signs shall be no larger than required or recommended by FCC or other United
States governmental regulations.
   F.   Site Security Measures. Small wireless facilities and other
infrastructure deployments may incorporate reasonable and appropriate site
security measures, such as locks and anti-climbing devices, to prevent
unauthorized access, theft or vandalism.
   G.   Compliance with Health and Safety Regulations. All small wireless
facilities and other infrastructure deployments shall be designed, constructed,
operated and maintained in compliance with all generally applicable health and
safety regulations, which includes without limitation all applicable
regulations for human exposure to RF emissions and compliance with the federal
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. Section 12101 et seq.) and
similar laws.
   H.   Antennas. The provisions in this subsection (H) apply to all antennas.
      1.   Shrouding. All antennas, radio transmission equipment (e.g., radio
remote units or “RRUs”), and associated cables, jumpers, wires, mounts, masts,
brackets and other connectors and hardware, must be installed within a single
shroud or radome or within the pole.
         a.   Pole -Top Mounted. The shroud height for a pole-top mounted
facility shall not exceed 84 inches and the shroud width shall not have a
diameter in excess of 18 inches. The shroud must be uniform in diameter. Unless
it is infeasible to do so, or would otherwise violate another city requirement,
all small wireless facilities on utility poles shall be pole-top mounted.
         b.   Side-Mounted. If a small wireless facility cannot be pole-top
mounted and is on a new pole that cannot feasibly serve as a streetlight pole,
it shall be side mounted. The total volume of a shroud for a side mounted
facility shall not exceed six cubic feet, and the greatest distance between two
points on the shroud shall not exceed four feet. Side-mounted antennas shall
not project: (i) more than 24 inches from the support structure, or (ii) over
any abutting private property. If applicable laws require a configuration
different than specified herein, configuration shall be no greater than
required for compliance with such laws.
      2.   Overall Height. No antenna may extend more than 84" above the
support structure, plus any minimum separation between the antenna and other
pole attachments required by applicable health and safety regulations. The
height of a non-utility pole replacement or new non-utility pole shall not
exceed the height of adjacent poles of like kind or 37 feet, whichever is more
restrictive.
   I.   Undergrounded Accessory Equipment.
      1.   Undergrounding. Accessory equipment (other than any emergency
disconnect switches) shall be placed underground. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, the Director may grant an exception when the applicant demonstrates
by clear and convincing evidence that compliance with this section would be
technically infeasible.
      2.   Vaults. Unless infeasible, no above-ground accessory equipment is
allowed on the surface of the public right-of-way. Accessory equipment which is
to be undergrounded must be installed within the parkway landscaped or
hardscaped area in a flush to grade underground vault that is load-rated to
meet disabled access and City standards. Pull boxes must be installed with
approved traffic lids. Underground vaults must be constructed with a slip-
resistant cover. Vaults shall be placed within landscaped parkways where such
area exists. All new construction must meet current disabled access
requirements and City standards.
   J.   Utilities. The provisions in this subsection (J) are applicable to all
utilities and other related improvements that serve small wireless facilities
and other infrastructure deployments.
      1.   Vertical Cable Risers. Unless it would violate General Order 95 or
applicable law, all cables, wires and other connectors must be routed through
conduits within the pole or other support structure, and all conduit
attachments, cables, wires and other connectors must be concealed from public
view. To the extent that cables, wires and other connectors cannot be routed
through the pole, such as with wood utility poles, applicants shall route them
through a single external conduit or shroud that has been finished to match the
underlying pole.
      2.   Spools and Coils. To reduce clutter and deter vandalism, excess
fiber optic or coaxial cables shall not be spooled, coiled or otherwise stored
on the pole outside equipment cabinets or shrouds.
      3.   Electric Meters. Unless technically infeasible, small wireless
facilities and other infrastructure deployments shall use flat-rate electric
service or other method that obviates the need for a separate above-grade
electric meter.
      4.   Existing Conduit or Circuits. To reduce unnecessary wear and tear on
the public rights-of-way, applicants are encouraged to use existing conduits
and/or electric circuits whenever available and technically feasible.
   K.   Prohibited Support Structures. Small wireless facilities may not be on
existing street light poles, decorative poles, banner poles or any utility pole
scheduled for removal or relocation within 18 months from the time the Director
acts on the small wireless facility application on strands or wires between any
structures.
   L.   Encroachments Over Private Property. No small cell antennas, accessory
equipment or other improvements may encroach onto or over any private or other
property outside the public rights-of-way without the property owner's express
written consent.
   M.   No Interference with Other Uses. Small wireless facilities and any
associated antennas, accessory equipment or improvements shall not be located
in any place or manner that would physically interfere with or impede access to
any: (1) worker access to any above-ground or underground infrastructure for
traffic control, streetlight or public transportation, including without
limitation any curb control sign, parking meter, vehicular traffic sign or
signal, pedestrian traffic sign or signal, barricade reflectors. (2) access to
any public transportation vehicles, shelters, street furniture or other
improvements at any public transportation stop, (3) worker access to above
ground or underground infrastructure owned or operated by any public or private
utility agency, (4) fire hydrant or water valve, (5) access to any doors,
gates, sidewalk doors, passage doors, stoops or other ingress and egress points
to any building appurtenant to the rights-of-way or (6) access to any fire
escape.
   N.   Replacement Poles.
      1.   All replacement poles must:
         a.   be located in a manner consistent with City Standard 550 as it
maybe amended from time to time
         b.   be aligned with the other existing poles along the public rights-
of-way
         c.   maintain the prior-existing street light illumination pattern
         d.   comply with all applicable standards and specifications by the
Director.
      2.   Additionally, if the applicant proposes to replace an existing high-
voltage pole:
         a.   The existing high-voltage pole shall be replaced with a low
voltage pole, unless doing so is technically infeasible
         b.   The replacement pole shall be installed directly across the
street, unless doing so is technically infeasible, or the director approves an
alternate location in close proximity to the pole that is being removed
         c.   The replacement pole shall include an operational light arm,
unless the director indicates that the director prefers that the pole instead
merely be capable of allowing the addition of a light arm which can be added at
a later date
         d.   The permittee shall offer the ownership of the new pole to City.
(Ord. 3315 § 2 (part), 2022)
15.53.090.   Application Processing.
   A.   Zoning Review Process. The Wireless Permit shall be subject to the

depending on the nature of the proposed change.
      2.   Permit Term. This permit will automatically expire ten years and one
day from its issuance unless (1) the City makes finding of public safety
reasons or substantial land use reasons to justify a specified shorter duration
or (2) California Government Code Section 65964(b) is revised to establish a
presumptive period shorter than ten years in which case the period shall be
automatically reduced to that shorter period. Any other permits or approvals
issued in connection with any collocation, modification or other change to this
wireless facility, which includes without limitation any permits or other
approvals deemed-granted or deemed-approved under federal or state law
(including any “eligible facilities request”), will not extend this term limit
unless expressly provided otherwise in such permit or approval or required
under federal or state law.
      3.   Permit Renewal. Not more than one year before this Wireless Permit
expires, the permittee (hereafter, a permittee shall mean permittee or its
successors) may apply for permit renewal. The permittee must demonstrate that
the subject wireless facility or other infrastructure deployment complies with
all the conditions of approval associated with this Wireless Permit and all
applicable provisions in the Fullerton Municipal Code that exist at the time
the decision to renew or not renew is rendered. The Director may modify or

15.53.040.A.7 for applicable requirements). Such documentation shall include
without limitation GIS data and site photographs. Such documentation shall also
include a report from a California licensed electrical engineer confirming that
on-site RF testing was completed after the permittee commenced full, unattended
operations and which testing confirmed compliance with all applicable RF
requirements and the RF compliance report.
      5.   Build-Out Period. This Wireless Permit will automatically expire 18
months after the approval date unless the permittee commences construction
within that period or the Director grants, in writing, one extension of time
for a period of not more than six months. The applicant shall request an
extension pursuant to this subdivision in writing and demonstrate justifiable
cause for the extension. If this build-out period expires, the permit shall be
automatically void but the permittee may immediately or thereafter submit a new
and complete application, including all application fees, for the same or
substantially similar project.
      6.   Site Maintenance. The permittee shall keep the site, which includes
without limitation any and all improvements, equipment, structures, access
routes, fences and landscape features, in a neat, clean and safe condition in
accordance with the approved construction drawings and all conditions in the
Wireless Permit. The permittee shall keep the site area free from all litter
and debris at all times. The permittee, at no cost to the City, shall remove
and remediate any graffiti or other vandalism or remediate conditions that
violate the permit at the site within 48 hours after the permittee receives
notice or otherwise becomes aware that such graffiti or other vandalism
occurred. Applicant shall obtain an Encroachment Permit from the Public Works
Department for any work on public rights-of-way, as determined by the Director.
      7.   Compliance with Laws. The permittee shall maintain compliance at all
times with all federal, state and local statutes, regulations, orders or other
rules that carry the force of law (“laws”) applicable to the permittee, the
subject property, the wireless facility or other infrastructure deployment or
any use or activities in connection with the use authorized in this Wireless
Permit, which includes without limitation any laws applicable to human exposure
to RF emissions. If the City determines that the wireless facility is operating
in violation of applicable RF emission standards, the facility shall
immediately shut down and not re -start operations until the city confirms that
the facility has been returned to full compliance with federal RF emission
standards. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that this obligation
is intended to be broadly construed and that no other specific requirements in
these conditions are intended to reduce, relieve or otherwise lessen the
permittee’s obligations to maintain compliance with all laws. No failure or
omission by the City to timely notice, prompt or enforce compliance with any
applicable provision in the Fullerton Municipal Code, any permit condition or
any applicable law or regulation, shall be deemed to relieve, waive or lessen
the permittee’s obligation to comply in all respects with all applicable
provisions in the Fullerton Municipal Code, any permit, any permit condition or
any applicable law or regulation.
      8.   Adverse Physical Impacts on Other Properties. The permittee shall
use all reasonable efforts to avoid any and all unreasonable, undue or
unnecessary adverse physical impacts on nearby properties that may arise from
the permittee’s or its authorized personnel’s construction, installation,
operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal and/or other activities
on or about the site. The permittee shall not perform or cause others to
perform any construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance,
repair, removal or other work that involves heavy equipment or machines except
during normal construction work hours authorized by the Fullerton Municipal
Code. The restricted work hours in this condition will not prohibit any work
required to prevent an actual, immediate harm to property or persons or any
work during an emergency declared by the City or other state or federal
government agency or official with authority to declare an emergency within the
City. The Director may issue a stop work order for any activities that violates
this condition in whole or in part. Permittee agrees to fully cooperate with
the City in assisting the City to achieve its accommodation obligations under
the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988
and other applicable laws.
      9.   Inspections, Emergencies. The Permittee expressly acknowledges and
agrees that the City’s officers, officials, staff, agents, contractors or other
City designees may enter onto the site and inspect the improvements and
equipment upon reasonable prior notice to the permittee. Notwithstanding the
prior sentence, the City’s officers, officials, staff, agents, contractors or
other City designees may, but will not be obligated to, enter onto the site
area without prior notice to support, repair, disable or remove any
improvements or equipment in emergencies or when such improvements or equipment
threatens actual, imminent harm to persons or property. The permittee, if
present, may observe the City’s officers, officials, staff or other designees
while any such inspection or emergency access occurs.
      10.   Permittee’s Contact Information. Within ten days from the final
approval, the permittee shall furnish the City with accurate and up-to-date
contact information for a person responsible for the wireless facility or other
infrastructure deployment, which includes without limitation such person’s full
name, title, direct telephone number, mailing address and email address. The
permittee shall keep such contact information up-to-date at all times and
promptly provide the City with updated contact information if either the
responsible person or such person’s contact information changes. Such contact
information shall be made publicly available on the City website to permit the
public to contact the site operator to address any concerns, including but not
limited to, excess noise. The Permittee shall display its contact information
on the pole.
      11.   Indemnification. The permittee and, if applicable, the property
owner upon which the wireless facility or other infrastructure deployment is
installed shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City, City Council and
the City’s boards, commissions, agents, officers, officials, employees and
volunteers (collectively, the “indemnitees”) from any and all (i) damages,
liabilities, injuries, losses, costs and expenses and from any and all claims,
demands, lawsuits, writs and other actions or proceedings (“claims”) brought
against the indemnitees to challenge, attack, seek to modify, set aside, void
or annul the City’s approval of this Wireless Permit and (ii) other claims of
any kind or form, whether for personal injury, death or property damage, that
arise from or in connection with the permittee’s or its agents’, directors’,
officers’, employees’, contractors’, subcontractors’, licensees’ or customers’
acts or omissions in connection with Wireless Permit or the wireless facility
or other infrastructure deployment. In the event the City becomes aware of any
claims, the City will use best efforts to promptly notify the permittee and the
private property owner (if applicable) and shall reasonably cooperate in the
defense. Permittee agrees that the City shall have the right to approve, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the legal counsel providing the
City’s defense and the property owner and/or permittee (as applicable) shall
promptly reimburse the City for any costs and expenses directly and necessarily
incurred by the City in the course of the defense. Permittee agrees that the
permittee’s indemnification obligations under this condition are a material
consideration that motivates the City to approve this Wireless Permits, and
that such indemnification obligations will survive the expiration, revocation
or other termination of this Wireless Permit.
      12.   Surety Bond. Before the City issues any permits required to
commence construction in connection with this permit, the permittee shall post
a bond from a surety company authorized to transact business in the State of
California in a form acceptable to the Director in an amount equal to the
estimated amount of performing the work, plus 50%, to cover the cost to remove
the improvements, restore all affected areas based on a written estimate from a
qualified contractor with experience in wireless facilities or other
infrastructure removal. The written estimate must include the cost to remove
all equipment and other improvements, which includes without limitation all
antennas, radios, batteries, generators, utilities, cabinets, mounts, brackets,
hardware, cables, wires, conduits, structures, shelters, towers, poles,
footings and foundations, whether above ground or below ground, constructed or
installed in connection with the wireless facility, plus the cost to completely
restore any areas affected by the removal work to a standard compliant with
applicable laws, including any street cuts or pavement restoration
requirements. In establishing or adjusting the bond amount required under this
condition, the Director shall take into consideration any information provided
by the permittee regarding the cost to remove the wireless facility or other
infrastructure deployment to a standard compliant with applicable laws. The
bond shall expressly survive the duration of the permit term to the extent
required to effectuate a complete removal of the subject wireless facility or
other infrastructure deployment in accordance with this condition.
      13.   Permit Revocation. Any permit granted under this code may be
revoked in accordance with the provisions and procedures of Municipal Code
Section 15.70.090 (“Revocation”) except that references to a conditional use
permit shall be considered references to a wireless permit.
      14.   Record Retention. Throughout the permit term and for a period of
four years after the expiration or earlier termination of the permit, the
permittee must maintain a complete and accurate copy of the written
administrative record, which includes without limitation the Wireless Permit
application, Wireless Permit, the approved plans and photo simulations
incorporated into this approval, all conditions associated with this approval,
any ministerial permits or approvals issued in connection with this approval
and any records, memoranda, documents, papers and other correspondence entered
into the public record in connection with the Wireless Permit (collectively,
“records”). If the permittee does not maintain such records as required in this
condition, any ambiguities or uncertainties that would be resolved by
inspecting the missing records will be construed against the permittee. The
permittee shall protect all records from damage from fires, floods and other
hazards that may cause deterioration. The permittee may keep records in an
electronic format provided that hard copies or electronic records kept in the
City’s regular files will control over any conflicts between such City-
controlled copies or records and the permittee’s electronic copies and complete
originals will control over all other copies in any form. The requirements in
this condition shall not be construed to create any obligation to create or
prepare any records not otherwise required to be created or prepared by other
applicable laws. Compliance with the requirements in this condition shall not
excuse the permittee from any other similar record-retention obligations under
applicable law.
      15.   Abandoned Facilities and Cessation of Operation. The wireless
facility or other infrastructure deployment authorized under this Wireless
Permit shall be deemed abandoned if not operated in its permitted manner for
any continuous six-month period. Within 90 days after a wireless facility or
other infrastructure deployment is abandoned or deemed abandoned, the permittee
and/or property owner shall completely remove the wireless facility or other
infrastructure deployment and all related improvements and shall restore all
affected areas to a condition compliant with all applicable laws, which
includes without limitation the Fullerton Municipal Code. In the event that
neither the permittee nor the property owner complies with the removal and
restoration obligations under this condition within said 90-day period, the
City shall have the right (but not the obligation) to perform such removal and
restoration with or without notice and the permittee and property owner shall
be jointly and severally liable for all costs and expenses incurred by the City
in connection with such removal and/or restoration activities. The Permittee
shall obtain a separate encroachment permit from the Public Works Department
for any work related to the abandonment of existing wireless facilities.
      16.   Landscaping. The permittee shall protect existing street tree(s)
and not impact its growth patterns. The permittee shall replace any landscape
features damaged or displaced by the construction, installation, operation,
maintenance or other work performed by the permittee or at the permittee’s
direction on or about the site. If any trees are damaged or displaced, as
determined by the City, the permittee shall hire and pay for a licensed
arborist to select, plant and maintain replacement landscaping in an
appropriate location for the species, subject to
Chapter 9.06 (“Community Forestry”), and especially Section
9.06.100 (“Alteration and removal of street trees”). See also
Chapter 15.50 (“Landscaping and Irrigation Requirements”). Only workers under
the supervision of an International Society of Arboriculture certified arborist
shall be used to install the replacement tree(s).
      17.   Cost Reimbursement. The permittee acknowledges and agrees that (i)
the permittee’s request for authorization to construct, install and/or operate
the wireless facility will cause the City to incur costs and expenses; (ii) the
permittee shall be responsible to reimburse the City for all reasonable costs
incurred in connection with the permit, which includes without limitation costs
related to application review, plan checking, permit issuance, site inspection
and any other costs reasonably related to or caused by the request for
authorization to construct, install and/or operate the wireless facility or
other infrastructure deployment, including any third party costs; (iii) any
application fees required for the application may not cover all such
reimbursable costs and that the permittee shall have the obligation to
reimburse the City for all such costs ten days after a written demand for
reimbursement and reasonable documentation to support such costs and (iv) the
City shall have the right to withhold any permits or other approvals in
connection with the wireless facility until and unless any outstanding costs
have been reimbursed to the City by the permittee.
      18.   Underground Equipment. Unless infeasible, no above-ground accessory
equipment is allowed on the surface of the public Right-of-Way. Accessory
equipment which is to be undergrounded must be installed within the parkway
landscaped or hardscaped area in a flush to grade underground vault that is
load-rated to meet disabled access and City standards, if applicable. Pull
boxes must be installed with approved traffic lids. Underground vaults must be
constructed with a slip -resistant cover. Vaults shall be placed within
landscaped parkways where such area exists. All new construction must meet
current disabled access requirements and City standards.
      19.   Future Undergrounding Programs. Notwithstanding any term remaining
on any Wireless Permit, if other utilities or communications providers in the
public rights-of-way underground their facilities in the segment of the public
rights-of-way where the permittee’s small wireless facility or other
infrastructure deployment is located, the permittee must also underground its
equipment, except the antennas and any approved electric meter, at
approximately the same time. Accessory equipment such as radios and computers
that require an environmentally controlled underground vault to function shall
not be exempt from this condition. Small wireless facilities and other
infrastructure deployments installed on wood utility poles that will be removed
pursuant to the undergrounding program may be reinstalled on a streetlight that
complies with the City’s standards and specifications. Such undergrounding
shall occur at the permittee’s sole cost and expense except as may be
reimbursed through tariffs approved by the state public utilities commission
for undergrounding costs.
      20.   Electric Power Meters. If the commercial electric utility provider
has or in the future adopts or changes its rules obviating the need for a
separate or ground-mounted electric meter and enclosure, including but not
limited to the use of an unmetered connection to the electrical power grid, the
permittee on its own initiative and at its sole cost and expense shall remove
the separate or ground-mounted electric meter and enclosure. Prior to removing
the electric meter, the permittee shall apply for any encroachment and/or other
ministerial permit(s) required to perform the removal. Upon removal, the
permittee shall restore the affected area to its original condition that
existed prior to installation of the equipment.
      21.   Rearrangement and Relocation. The permittee acknowledges that the
City, in its sole discretion and at any time, may: (A) change any street grade,
width or location; (B) add, remove or otherwise change any improvements in, on,
under or along any street owned by the City or any other public agency, which
includes without limitation any sewers, storm drains, conduits, pipes, vaults,
boxes, cabinets, poles and utility systems for gas, water, electric or
telecommunications and/or (C) perform any other work deemed necessary, useful
or desirable by the City (collectively, “City work”). The City reserves the
rights to do any and all City work without any admission on its part that the
City would not have such rights without the express reservation in this
Wireless Permit. If the Director determines that any City work will require the
permittee’s wireless facility located in the public rights-of-way to be
rearranged and/or relocated, the permittee shall, at its sole cost and expense,
do or cause to be done all things necessary to accomplish such rearrangement
and/or relocation. If, for example, the permittee places a new standalone pole
in the right of way and the city later replaces its existing high-voltage
streetlights with low -voltage streetlights, the city may require permittee, at
permittee’s sole expense, to promptly cause the removal of permittee’s pole; in
such event, the City will offer the use of one or more nearby city owned pole
(s) for use by the applicant to the same extent, and under the same terms and
conditions that such poles would be made available to any new applicant for a
wireless facility. If the permittee fails or refuses to either permanently or
temporarily rearrange and/or relocate the permittee’s wireless facility or
other infrastructure deployment within a reasonable time after the Director’s
notice, the City may (but will not be obligated to) cause the rearrangement or
relocation to be performed at the permittee’s sole cost and expense. The City
may exercise its rights to rearrange or relocate the permittee’s wireless
facility or other infrastructure deployment without prior notice to permittee
when the Director determines that City work is immediately necessary to protect
public health or safety. The permittee shall reimburse the City for all costs
and expenses in connection with such work within 30 days after a written demand
for reimbursement and reasonable documentation to support such costs.
      22.   Truthful and Accurate Statements. The permittee acknowledges that
the City’s approval relies on the written and/or oral statements by permittee
and/or persons authorized to act on permittee’s behalf. In any matter before
the City in connection with the Wireless Permit or the wireless facility or
other infrastructure approved under the Wireless Permit, neither the permittee
nor any person authorized to act on permittee’s behalf shall, in any written or
oral statement, intentionally provide material factual information that is
incorrect or misleading or intentionally omit any material information
necessary to prevent any material factual statement from being incorrect or
misleading.
   B.   Modified Conditions. The Director may modify, add or remove conditions
to any Wireless Permit the Director deems appropriate to: (1) protect and/or
promote the public health, safety and welfare, (2) tailor the standard
conditions in subsection (A), of this section, above, to the particular facts
and circumstances associated with the deployment and/or (3) memorialize any
changes to the proposed deployment need for compliance with the Fullerton
Municipal Code, generally applicable health and safety requirements and/or any
other applicable laws. To the extent required by applicable FCC regulations,
the Director shall ensure that any different conditions applied to wireless
facilities are no more burdensome than those applied to other infrastructure
deployments.
   C.   Reservation of Rights. The City reserves all rights that it now
possesses or may later acquire with respect to the regulation of any cable or
telecommunications service that is provided, or proposed to be provided, by a
telephone corporation. These reserved rights may relate, without limitation, to
the imposition of reasonable conditions in addition to or different from those
set forth in this section, the exaction of a fee or other form of consideration
or compensation for use of public rights-of-way, execution of a leasing
agreement, and related matters; provided, however, that such regulatory rights
and authority must be consistent with federal and state law that is applicable
to cable or telecommunications services provided by telephone corporations.

15.53.110.      Eligible Facilities Requests.
   Consistent with Municipal Code Section

modification of an existing wireless tower or base station for the collocation
of new transmission equipment or removal or replacement of existing
transmission equipment shall not require a Wireless Permit provided that such

discretionary permit for the tower or base station. However, any modification
to a wireless tower or base station which substantially changes the physical
dimensions of either the tower or base station, and any other modification to a
wireless telecommunications facility that does not qualify as a wireless tower
or base station (as defined in this section) shall obtain any required Wireless
Permit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any eligible facilities request must
obtain any other required permit(s) (e.g., encroachment permit). Encroachment
permits for any eligible facility shall not be issued unless the applicant

to reimburse the City for its reasonable costs incurred in connection with the
application within ten days after the City issues a written demand for
reimbursement.

15.53.110 will be subject to all conditions required by the Director.
Additionally, such encroachment permit shall include all standard conditions
for Wireless Permits (See Section
15.53.100):
      1.   all references in the standard conditions to Wireless Permits shall
be deemed to be references to the encroachment permit
      2.   notwithstanding Section
15.53.100.A.5 (Build Out Period), the encroachment permit build-out period will
automatically expire six months after the approval date unless the permittee
commences construction within that period
      3.   notwithstanding subsection
15.53.100.A.13 (Permit Revocation), the encroachment permit may be revoked in

requirement for this type of facility shall be determined on a case-by-case
basis as part of the review of the Conditional Use Permit.
   H.   Retirement complex:
      1.   "Retirement complex" means any place or facility housing seven or
more persons developed pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of
this title. Such a facility may or may not be licensed by the State of
California Department of Social Services as a retirement facility for the
elderly, and is operated for and strictly limited to the non-medical
residential needs of ambulatory clientele aged 55 years and older.
Notwithstanding the above, a Type VII retirement complex, as defined in this
section, will provide licensed medical care via their residential care facility
for the elderly and health facility components. Retirement complexes may be of
the following types:
Type I – Independent Detached Cluster Units. Included within this category are
non-licensed single-family development arranged in clusters of detached units.
These may take the form of patio homes, single-family or other creative cluster
design with reasonable amounts of privately owned and maintained open space and
recreation area.
Type II – Independent Attached Cluster Units. Allows for a variety of non-
licensed housing types: garden apartments, condominiums and townhouses with
density dependent on zoning classification and specific/general plan
designation. Some open space may be privately used, but the majority of open
space and recreational areas are for common use.
Type III – Congregate Low-Rise Multi-Unit. Typified by a structure subject to a
two-story and thirty-foot height limitation, these facilities and characterized
by independent living units (owned or rented) of one or two bedrooms with
limited food storage/preparation areas, considerable amenity packages which
include recreational/leisure areas for social interaction and special resident
events. Design emphasis is on a non-institutional appearance that will visually
complement surrounding residential uses.
Type IV – Congregate Low-Rise Retirement Hotel. A congregate facility subject
to a two-story and thirty-foot height limitation, with individual beds/bedrooms
rented to clients on a monthly basis. Bedrooms do not have food preparation
storage facilities. Congregate meeting, recreational and dining facilities are
provided as an integral part of the development.
Type V – Congregate Mid/High-Rise Multi-Unit. Similar in configuration,
construction and amenities to Type III facilities, but constructed in excess of
the height or story limitation of Type III complexes.
Type VI – Congregate Mid/High-Rise Retirement Hotel. A congregate facility
constructed in excess of the height limitation of Type IV facilities with
individual beds/bedrooms rented to clients on a monthly basis that have no
individual food storage/ preparation facilities. Congregate meeting,
recreational and dining facilities are provided as an integral part of the
development.
Type VII – Community/Village Concept. Provides for flexibility in development,
creative and imaginative design, and the development of parcels of land as
coordinated projects involving a mixture of retirement complex, residential
care facility for the elderly and health facility types, congregate social
facilities and open spaces (both private and public). A Planned Residential
Development (PRD) zone will be required for the establishment of a Type VII
residential complex. The intent of a Type VII facility is to accommodate those
applications for a life-care environment with the residential use being
predominant.
   A "life-care environment" is described as a coordinated facility
incorporating different levels of residential and medical care. Clients may
enter the facility at the residential, intermediate medical care or skilled
nursing level and are assured of care for life by contract. Clients will be
provided various levels of care as demanded by their individual medical need.
Any residential care facility for the elderly or health facility included as
part of a Type VII development is to be strictly a secondary use to the
primarily residential focus of the development, and shall be subject to
requirements for permanent maintenance under life care contracts.
      2.   A retirement complex proposed within a residential or commercial
zone classification shall be developed in accordance with all the following
criteria and requirements.
         a.   Maximum building height. Type I, II, III or IV retirement
complexes shall not be constructed in excess of two stories above grade.
Overall height of Type I, II, III and IV structures shall not exceed 30 feet
above grade.
         b.   Lot coverage. Lot coverage shall not exceed 50 percent in zones
R-1 through R-3R. For all other zones, coverage shall not exceed 60 percent.
         c.   Equivalency. Due to the varied nature of retirement complex types
and their physical configuration (beds vs. rooms vs. units), the following
equivalencies are established for determining density, open space and/or
parking requirements.
         Two beds = one room = one unit
         d.   Density. The density figures outlined in Subsection G of this
section shall be used as a base for computing the maximum number of units for a
property. California Government Code Section 675915 requires that cities grant
density bonuses to housing developments of five or more dwelling units designed
in part for low or low-moderate income households, or for other qualifying
senior residents as defined. In keeping with that mandate, the City will add a
25 percent density bonus to the density figures outlined in Subsection G of
this section for a development of a retirement complex. A developer is
encouraged to contact city staff prior to any submittal of a proposed
retirement complex for the purpose of calculating density figures.
         e.   Appearance and architectural style. The construction of new
buildings or alterations to existing structures as part of a proposed
retirement complex shall be encouraged to have a design with a residential
character and an arrangement of buildings compatible with surrounding
development types.

R-5                     200/unit
PRD (Type VII only)               Established by general or
                     specific plan designation
                        of the site
Any Commercial zone            300/unit
   Indoor common recreational areas may contribute up to one third of the
usable open space requirements. The remaining usable open space areas shall be
subject to the limitations of Subsection 15.17.070.D of this title. Types I,
II, III, and V shall provide private patios, decks or balconies as required in
the multiple-family residential zones.
         g.   Parking. The evaluation of each retirement complex shall include
traffic and/or parking studies in a form and content acceptable to the Director
of Development Services specifying potential traffic and parking impacts of the
project. Parking require-ments will be determined by the type of retirement
complex and in part by the results of the parking and traffic study submitted
pursuant to this section. The minimum amount of parking for each type of
development shall be as follows:
   Type         Required Parking
   Type I         1.50 space/unit with 1 or fewer bedrooms
               2.00 space/unit with 2 bedrooms
               2.50   space/unit with 3 or more bedrooms

               requirement above that most
               closely matches proposal design.
NOTE: The total amount of parking will be split so that approximately 80
percent is secured and reserved for tenants and 20 percent is unreserved and
accessible to visitors.
These standards may be reduced through the Conditional Use Permit process
contained in
Chapter 15.70 of the Fullerton Municipal Code, if the characteristics of the
project show fewer parking spaces can be justified based on an empirical
parking demand study that assesses similarly sized and situated projects with
similar characteristics such a proximity to transit and services, project size
and unit size and mix.
      3.   Each retirement complex shall be encumbered with covenants,
conditions and restrictions or other documents or written policy, which shall
be effective during the entire life of the building and which shall be
consistent with Section 51.3 of the California Civil Code. The CC&Rs shall not
limit occupancy, residency or use on the basis of age more proscriptively than
to require that one person in residency be a senior citizen (as defined in said
Section 51.3) and that each other resident, if any, except the spouse or
cohabitant of, or a person who resides with and provides primary physical or
economic support to, the senior citizen, shall be at least 45 years of age.

15.56.050. Fullerton Airport Environs Land Use Plan.
   A.   Definition:
The Fullerton Airport Environs Land Use Plan (AELUP) is formulated by the
Airport Land Use Commission for Orange County (ALUC) under the authority of
Section 21675 of the Public Utilities Code of the State of California. The
intent of this land use plan is to safeguard the general welfare of the
inhabitants within the vicinities of the airport and to ensure the continued
operation of the airport. The plan establishes land use guidelines, development
standards and operational regulations "to protect the public from the adverse
effects of aircraft noise, to ensure that people and facilities are not
concentrated in areas susceptible to aircraft accidents, and to ensure that no
structures or activities adversely affect navigable airspace."
   B.   Planning Area Boundary:
As part of the AELUP, the ALUC designates and adopts a "planning area" or
"airport influence area". The planning area includes all points within 10,000
feet from the nearest point of the runway.

IMAGES/0-0-0-6740.png]
   C.   Compliance with Airport Environs Land Use Plan:
Proposed development and activities that would take place within the planning
area are subject to a review by the ALUC, as specified in Chapters 2, 3 and 4
of the AELUP. Furthermore, development projects which will exceed 200 feet
above ground level at their sites must undergo FAA review and may require
referral to the ALUC. Additionally, any amendment to a City's General or
Specific Plan, Airport Master Plan, or Zoning Ordinance must be submitted to
the ALUC for a determination prior to its adoption by the City.

(Ord. 3232 (part), 2016; Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.64.020. Definitions.
   The following definitions of a nonconforming land use shall apply:
   A.   Nonconforming development standards:
Development sites and structures are subject to numerous standards, most of
which are defined in physical terms and subject to measurement. A nonconforming
standard of development occurs when a use or structure that was previously
lawful no longer complies with certain standards, either as of the effective
date of this title or as a result of subsequent applicable amendments. The
applicable development standards are:
      1.   Lot area per dwelling unit, minimum.
      2.   Lot coverage, maximum.
      3.   Location of structures.
      4.    Separation between buildings, minimum.
      5.    Setbacks, minimum.
      6.     Height limits, maximum.
      7.    Usable open space, minimum.
      8.    Parking and loading requirements.
      9.    Landscaped area requirements.
   B.   Nonconforming sign:
   The definition and regulations for a nonconforming sign are contained in
Chapter 15.49 of this title.
   C.   Nonconforming lot:
   Nonconforming lot means a specific type of nonconforming land use where the
lot does not conform to the district regulations with respect to lot area or
lot width or both. See Section
15.64.090.
   D.   Nonconforming use:
   Nonconforming use means the use of land or structures, where the existing
use was previously lawful but currently is no longer in compliance with the
regulations of the zone in which it is located, either as of the effective date
of this title or as a result of subsequent applicable amendments.
(Ord. 3232 (part), 2016; Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.64.030. Calculation of time periods.
   Unless otherwise excepted, all time periods affecting a nonconforming
property shall begin on the effective date of this or prior code amendments, or
subsequent amendments thereto, or a change in the zoning map, whichever is the
cause of such nonconforming use.
(Ord. 3232 (part), 2016; Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.64.040. Continuation.
   A nonconforming property may be continuously maintained provided there is no
structural alteration or addition to any structure which results in the
enlargement of area, space or volume to the nonconforming property, except as
otherwise provided in this title.
(Ord. 3232 (part), 2016; Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.64.050. Maintenance.
   Ordinary repairs, maintenance and remodeling may be made to a structure of a
nonconforming property, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   The maintenance shall not include structural alterations resulting in
the enlargement of area, space or volume, except those required by law, or
except those to make the structure and use conform to the standards and use
regulations of the zone in which it is located.
   B.   The remodeling, ordinary repairs or repairs or replacement of
nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing may be performed, but in no case
shall the structure be enlarged, except as provided in this chapter.
   C.   Except as may be provided in Section
15.64.120, nothing contained in the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed
to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of any
structure or part thereof that has been declared to be unsafe by an officer of
the City charged with protecting the public safety.
(Ord. 3232 (part), 2016; Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.64.060. Enlargement, extension or relocation.
   A.   A structure with a nonconforming use shall not be enlarged in volume
nor increased in area. However, in the case of a structure that is
nonconforming to development standards only:
      1.   The Community Development Director may administratively allow an
increase in area or length to the structure if this increase is not more than
ten percent of the existing structure, provided that all other regulations of
the zone are met.
   B.   When the use is nonconforming due to parking requirements, the
structure subject to the nonconforming use may not be enlarged or altered to
create additional dwelling area, guest rooms, seating capacity or floor area,
unless additional parking is provided to meet current parking requirements
except as otherwise provided in FMC 15.30.060.E. The foregoing shall not
restrict the expansion of a single-family residence in any residential zone
that is nonconforming only by virtue of less than the currently required
garage, provided that the residence was legally constructed and has since been
legally maintained with less than the current requirement.
   C.   Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, a proposal to add units to a
property zoned for or improved with an existing multiple-family residential
development shall be required to provide additional parking for the additional
units in accordance with standards in effect at the time the units are
proposed. In the case where the total number of units on the property does not
exceed four, the proposed development shall not have to provide parking for the
existing units other than what was required when constructed. In the case where
the number of units on the property is five or more, the proposed development
shall be required to provide parking for the existing units in accordance with
current parking standards.
(Ord. 3232 (part), 2016; Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.64.065. Prior construction in excess of development standards.
   Any development constructed in excess of development standards at the time
of its construction, yet meeting current development standards, may not be
expanded or extended if it would create a nonconforming situation with regard
to the current development standards.
(Ord. 3232 (part), 2016; Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.64.070. Change of use.
   A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other use except to one that
is permitted in the zone in which the property is located. No use shall be
changed to another use that would create or increase a nonconforming situation
in parking standards except as otherwise provided in FMC
15.30.060.E.
(Ord. 3232 (part), 2016; Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.64.090. Nonconforming lot.
   Any lot or parcel existing prior to annexation or prior to June 18, 1953,
and any lot or parcel created since that date by city approval of a lot
division or subdivision application and subsequent recordation in accordance
therewith, having less area or width than required by its subsequent zone
classification may be improved or used in accordance with such classification
regardless of its deficiency in area or width.
(Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.64.100. Nonconforming use connected with public acquisitions.
   In the case of a nonconforming use created by a public acquisition, the
following shall apply:
   A.   If a structure is located upon a lot, a portion of which is acquired
for any public use (by condemnation, purchase, dedication or otherwise) by any
governmental entity, such structure may be maintained upon the remaining
portion of said lot, and may thereafter be used, maintained or repaired without
relocating or altering the same to comply with the development standards of
this title.
   B.   If such structure is partially located upon the property being acquired
for public use, it may be relocated upon the same lot or premises without
observing the required setback adjacent to the new lot line created by such
acquisition, and without reducing the number of dwelling units to conform to
the development standards of the zone in which it is located.
   C.   If a lot does not comply with the development standards of the zone due
to an acquisition of a portion thereof for public use, or if a legally existing
nonconforming lot is reduced in size due to an acquisition of a portion thereof
for public use, the remainder of said lot (so long as the remainder is smaller
in area or width than one-half of the minimum area or width required for the
zone in which it is located) may continue to be utilized as a conforming lot.
However, all other development standards shall still apply to any construction
thereafter.
(Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.64.110. Structures under construction.
   Any structure under construction (for which a foundation has been poured)
and for which a valid building permit has been issued prior to the date of this
title, or amendment thereto, which makes such structure a nonconforming
situation, may be completed and used in accordance with the provisions of this
title or any amendment thereto, provided that:
   A.   Construction or proposed use of such structure is not in violation of
any other ordinance or law.
   B.   Such structure is completed within one year of the date the valid
building permit was issued.
   C.   Such structure is completed in accordance with the plans and
specifications that such building permit was issued.
(Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.64.120. Restoration of damaged nonconforming uses.
   A.   A nonconforming structure that is damaged or destroyed by fire,
explosion or natural disaster may be restored and the occupancy or use of such
structure existing at the time of such destruction, may be continued or
resumed, provided:
      1.   Such restoration is of equal or lesser degree of non-conformity; and
      2.   Such restoration or reconstruction is started within a period of one
year and is completed within a period of two years from the date the structure
was damaged or destroyed.
   B.   In the event such damage or destruction exceeds 50% of the fair market
value of the structure, based upon its fair market value immediately prior to
the occurrence of the damage, the structure shall not be reconstructed except
in conformity with all use and development standard regulations for new
structures in the zone in which it is located; provided, however, nonconforming
dwelling units legally erected pursuant to a city building permit may be
restored to an equal or lesser degree of nonconformity within one year of
destruction, even if such destruction does exceed 50% of the prior value of
such nonconforming dwelling unit.
   C.   All determinations under this section, including the fair market value
of the structure and the amount of damage incurred, shall be made by the
Director of Development Services or his or her designee. Any decision by the
Director of Development Services may be appealed to the Planning Commission in
writing within 10 days of the decision by the Director of Development Services
or his or her designee. The Planning Commission shall then hold a public
hearing concerning the value and the amount of damage incurred, allowing both
the City and the property owner the opportunity to introduce evidence and to
cross-examine witnesses. The Planning Commission shall then issue a decision in
writing with findings of fact within 21 days of the public hearing. The
decision of the Planning Commission may be appealed to the City Council in
writing within 10 days of the decision of the Planning Commission. The City
Council shall review the matter de novo.
(Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.64.130. Termination of a nonconforming use.
   A.   Under the following conditions a nonconforming use terminates the right
to operate:
      1.   When a nonconforming use changes to a conforming use; however, a
single-family residence that has been converted to a conforming use in the O-
P zone may be reconverted back to a nonconforming status as a single-family
residence, provided the height limitations, parking and usable open space
provisions of an R-1 zone are provided on the site.
      2.   When a nonconforming use has not continued to be in operation for a
consecutive period of six months or for an intermittent period totaling one
year over a span of three years.
   B.   This section does not apply to a structure that is nonconforming to
development standards only.
(Ord. 2982, 2001).
15.64.140. Application to designated historic landmarks.

REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION
Sections:
15.65.010.   Intent and purpose.
15.65.020.   Definitions.
15.65.030.   Application and fees.

15.65.050.   Time limits.
15.65.060.   Appeals.
15.65.010.   Intent and purpose.
   In compliance with federal and state fair housing laws, this chapter sets
forth a process by which the City may make reasonable accommodations in land
use, zoning and building regulations, policies, practices, and procedures for
persons with disabilities. The intent is to allow disabled persons with
physical or mental impairments an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a
dwelling.
(Ord. 3195 § 4, 2013)
15.65.020.   Definitions.
   Unless otherwise noted, the definitions or terms used in this section shall
have the same meaning as defined in the California Fair Employment and Housing
Act, California Government Code Section 12926 et seq. The terms listed below
are illustrative of how they may be understood with respect to housing, for the
purposes of this section.
   DISABLED PERSON shall mean a person who has a physical or mental impairment
which limits one or more major life activities or makes achievement of a major
life activity difficult.
   MAJOR LIFE ACTIVITY shall include physical, mental and social activities,
which may include but are not limited to self care, mobility or sensory
perception. A temporary condition such as a broken bone, use of crutches, etc.
does not qualify as a physical or mental impairment, and thus does not qualify
one as a disabled person.
   REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION means providing flexibility in the application of
land use and zoning and building regulations, policies, practices and
procedures, up to waiving certain requirements, when it is necessary to
construct or adapt dwelling units that are readily accessible to and usable by
disabled persons.
(Ord. 3195 § 4, 2013)
15.65.030.   Application and fees.
   A.   An application for reasonable accommodation shall be made upon a form
to be provided by the Community Development Department, together with any
applicable environmental information, forms, and plans. The application shall
include, but not necessarily be limited to the following:
   1.   Documentation that the applicant is a disabled person, is representing
a disabled person, or is a developer or provider of housing for one or more
disabled persons;
   2.   Authorization by the legal owner of the real property subject to the
request;

Restaurant Overlay District (ROD), has been established as a tool for the City
to use when implementing its redevelopment goals, objectives and programs under
the provisions of the Community Redevelopment Law, Section 33000 et seq. of the
California Health and Safety Code.

need to provide on-site parking or to obtain a Conditional Use Permit as part
of the City's broader effort to revitalize the downtown.
   C.   The Restaurant Overlay District affects only those properties depicted
in Section 15.67.020, which are in and around the Central Business District and
have hereby been determined by the City Council to be within a reasonable
distance of the City's existing ample public parking supply.
   D.   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to a "restaurant" as that
term is defined by Section
15.04.040 so long as the "restaurant" is located within the geographic

   A.   When practical difficulties, unnecessary hardship, or results
inconsistent with the general purpose of this title result through the strict
and literal interpretation and enforcement of the provisions hereof, the
Planning Commission shall have authority to grant, a variance from the
provisions of this title.
   B.   The sole purpose of any variance shall be the modification of the
specific regulations of this title granted by resolution of the Planning
Commission in accordance with the terms of this title for the purpose of
assuring that no property, because of special circumstances applicable to it,
shall be deprived of privileges commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same vicinity and zone.
   C.   No variance shall be granted which would have the effect of granting a
special privilege not shared by other property in the same vicinity and zone.

by the Development Services Department, and shall be accompanied by the

the quorum present, except that a tie vote shall constitute a denial of the
Variance. Upon a majority vote therefor, the Commission may, before the
adjournment of any meeting, set aside any action taken at such meeting.
   B.   If the Variance is granted, the following findings must be made:
      1.   Because of special circumstances applicable to the property,
including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict
application of the zoning ordinance deprives such property of privileges
enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning
classification.
      2.   The adjustment thereby authorized does not constitute a grant of
special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in
the vicinity and zone in which such property is situated.

otherwise expressly authorized by the zone regulation governing the parcel of
property.

decision of the City Council shall be final and, upon making its decision, the
City Clerk shall make a written report of the outcome directly to the applicant
or owner and to the various City departments.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.02.040   Final maps.
   Final tract maps of the subdivision whose tentative maps have been approved
or conditionally approved shall be submitted, reviewed and processed in
conformance with this section.
   A.    Time Limit for Filing. Within a period of twenty-four months after the
date upon which the Planning Commission or the City Council granted its
approval or conditional approval of a tentative subdivision tract map, the
subdivider may cause the subdivision, or any portion thereof, to be surveyed
and a final map to be prepared, filed with the City and recorded, as provided
in this chapter, in accordance with the tentative map as approved.
   B.    1.   Limitation of Approval. The approval or conditional approval of a
tentative tract map shall be valid for a period of twenty-four months after the
date upon which the Planning Commission or the City Council, whichever is
applicable, granted approval or conditional approval of the subdivision. Upon
written application, filed with the Director of Development Services within the
twenty-four-month period following approval or conditional approval of the
subdivision, extension beyond the twenty-four-month period may be granted by
the Planning Commission. The sum of all such extensions granted shall not
exceed a total of twenty-four months. If the request for extension is denied,
then the applicant or owner may appeal to the City Council.
      2.   Conditions of Approval. At the time any tentative tract map is
extended, the Planning Commission or the City Council on appeal, whichever is
applicable, may add any new conditions as they see fit as a condition of the
extension of the tentative approval period. The Clerk of the Planning
Commission and the Clerk of the City Council shall notify in writing, the
applicant or subdivider of the respective actions of the Planning Commission or
City Council within ten days of the decision made. If no final map for all or
any of the land shown on the approved tentative tract map is recorded within
the initial twenty-four-month approval period or within any subsequent
extensions as provided in this section, then all proceedings shall terminate,
and no final tract map shall be filed or recorded without first processing a
new tentative tract map.
   C.    Filing of Final Map. For the purposes of filing a final tract map, the
subdivider shall submit to the City Engineer an original final map tracing, and
three blue-line prints thereof. One print shall be returned to the subdivider,
showing any corrections to be made or with a statement by the City Engineer
that the map is correct. The remaining copies shall be used for other
departmental purposes. When the final map is found to be correct and the
subdivider has posted all agreements and improvement securities as elsewhere
provided in this title or as required by State law and City codes and when the
balance of fees, as described in Title 21 of this code, have been paid and all
other conditions precedent to the approval of the tentative map have been met,
the final map tracing shall be certified by the City Engineer in a statement
declaring its correctness, its substantial conformance to the approved
tentative map, and the fact that all requirements imposed by the Subdivision
Map Act and City codes in effect at the time of approval of the tentative map
have been complied with. After signature by the City Engineer the final map
shall be put before the City Council for final approval. The City Council,
within a period of ten days after the City Engineer has filed the map with them
for approval or at the next regular meeting held after its receipt, whichever
is later, shall consider the final map. The Council shall approve the final map
if it finds that it substantially conforms to the tentative map and to all the
applicable sections of the Subdivision Map Act, and local codes and ordinances
in effect at the time the tentative map was approved or conditionally approved.
If it does not so conform, the Council shall disapprove the final map. If the
City Council does not approve or disapprove the final map within the prescribed
time, or any authorized extension thereof, and the map conforms to the
requirements, it shall be deemed approved, and the City Clerk shall certify its
approval thereon. If the final tract map is found not to conform to the
aforesaid requirements and its failure to conform is the result of a technical
or inadvertent error, the City Council may find that the error does not
materially affect the validity of the map, and thereupon approve the final map.
   D.    Acceptance of Dedications. At the time of final map approval, the City
Council shall accept all dedications, accept them subject to their improvement,
or reject them, or any combination thereof. The City Clerk shall certify on the
map the action of the Council. The Council, at the time of final map approval,
shall also approve the execution of any required performance agreements entered
into by the subdivider as a guarantee of the completion of any public
improvements required as a condition precedent to the approval of the tentative
map. Upon completion of the required certificates by the City Clerk, the final
map shall be returned to the subdivider's title company for transmittal to the
County Recorder. After recordation, the subdivider shall provide the Public
Works Department with one print thereof, on mylar or other material as approved
by the City Engineer, and one reproducible copy which shall both be permanently
filed in the office of the City Engineer.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.02.045   Required information on final map.
   The final map shall contain the following:
   A.    Title Sheet. The title sheet of the final map shall contain the number
of the tract, the description of the land being subdivided together with the
words, "In the City of Fullerton", or "Partly Within the City of Fullerton and
Partly Within (unincorporated territory of Orange County or other City)". Below
the title shall be a subtitle consisting of a general description of the
property being subdivided or reverted to acreage. The title sheet shall contain
appropriate certificates and acknowledgments for execution by the owners of the
record of the property, the City Engineer, the City Clerk, the County Surveyor,
and such others as required by State, County or City codes. Where streets,
highways, easements and other interest in property are being dedicated to the
City or being offered for a dedication, appropriate certificates shall clearly
indicate same. A separate note explaining and describing the basis of bearings
upon which the survey of the tract was made shall be shown on the title sheet,
along with a legend showing the type and character of all monuments found, set
or to be set, which affect the survey of the subdivision. The title sheet shall
show the name and state the registration number of the civil engineer or land
surveyor responsible for the survey and preparation of the map. A certificate,
signed by the responsible engineer or surveyor, shall also be shown on the
title sheet which shall indicate if the monuments shown have been set or when
such monuments will be set.
   B.    Title sheet and/or map sheets:
      1.    If more than three sheets are used, an index showing the entire
subdivision, with lots, streets, etc., shall be included on the title sheet, if
there is room, or on the second sheet;
      2.    The number of the tract, and a statement as to whether it is the
first, successive or final increment of an approved tentative tract of a
different number;
      3.    Surveyor's/engineer's name and registration number;
      4.    Total acreage being subdivided;
      5.    The number of lots in the subdivision;

         c.    Adjoining and nearby streets, alleys and easements.
      10.    A legend showing the type and character of all monuments found,
set, or to be set, which affect the survey of the subdivision shown on each map
sheet or on one map sheet with reference thereto on all map sheets;
      11.    Basis of bearings note on each map sheet or on one map sheet with
reference thereto on all other map sheets;
      12.    Dimensions shall be in feet and decimals of a foot, to the closest
hundredth;
      13.    The dimensions of all lots;
      14.    Each lot shall be numbered; each block, may be lettered or
numbered. Each lot shall be shown entirely on one sheet;
      15.    Centerline data on streets, easements, alleys, etc., including
bearing distances and curve data;
      16.    The exterior boundary of the land included in the subdivision
shall be indicated by distinctive symbols, and clearly so designated;
      17.    Ditto marks shall not be used on the final map. All figures,
numbers, and writing thereon shall be of such size and clarity so that copies
made from the original will be legible.
   C.    Record of Easements. The final map shall show the centerline data,
width, sidelines and curve data for all easements to which the lots in the
subdivision are subject. All easements, both existing and of record, and those
to be dedicated or to be offered for dedication, shall be clearly shown and
identified with respect to their present or intended use, and if of record,
proper reference to the record date given. Private easements may, but need not
be, shown on the final map, so long as their presence does not confuse or
detract from the purpose of the final map.
   D.    Required Survey Data. The final map shall show the centerlines and
sidelines for all streets, highways, and alleys; with their lengths and
bearings; length, radii, tangent lengths and central angles, with radial
bearings for all curves and segments; the total width of each street and
easement, with the width of any portion being dedicated and that of any
existing portion in relation to centerline; and the widths of rights-of-way for
railroads, freeways, flood control channels and all other easements. Surveys
made for the preparation of maps for land divisions shall be made in accordance
with the Land Surveyors' Act, and the standard practices and principles of land
surveying, under the supervision of a civil engineer or land surveyor licensed
in the state. A traverse of the boundaries of the tract, or the lots or blocks
therein, or along the centerlines or sidelines of the streets and easements
shown, shall close within the tolerances and to the degree of accuracy as
required by the City Engineer.
      1.    New Monuments. Sufficient permanent monuments shall be set so that
the survey or any part thereof may be readily retraced. Such monuments shall
generally be placed at the corners and angle points of the exterior boundary of
the subdivision, at beginnings and endings of curves, at centerline
intersections of streets, alleys and public service easements and at other
points of control as required by the City Engineer. Stakes shall be at all lot
corners, but shall not be considered permanent. The character, type and
positions of all monuments to be set shall be noted on the map and shall
conform to the requirements of the City Engineer. All monuments set shall be
tagged with the engineer's or surveyor's State license number and designation.
Interior monuments and points need not be set at the time the final map is
recorded if the engineer or surveyor certifies on the title sheet of the final
map that the monuments will be set on or before a specified later date, and if
the subdivider furnishes to the City Council a cash bond and posts a suitable
agreement guaranteeing the setting of the monuments and payment for the cost
thereof.
      2.    Existing Monuments and Survey Information. The final map shall
clearly show all stakes, monuments, ties or other evidence found while making
the survey to determine the tract boundaries. The corners of adjoining lots,
subdivisions and parcels shall be shown and identified, with ties thereto.
Reference shall also be made to all subdivisions, records of surveys, parcel
maps, and other maps and data of record upon, adjoining or near the property
being divided, combined or reverted to acreage. Other survey data and
calculations, if required by the City Engineer shall be shown on the final map
in accordance with his standards and policies.
      3.    Established Lines and Points. Whenever the City Engineer or County
Surveyor has established the centerlines of streets, alleys or easements or has
located specific points or monuments, such data shall be considered in making
the survey and all monuments and points found and used shall be indicated on
the map with proper references made to field books, surveys, tie books, or
other maps or information of public record. If the points were reset by ties or
if record points were not found, that fact shall be clearly noted and a note
made of any new point set in its place. The final map shall also show and tie
in the locations of any city boundaries crossing or adjoining the subdivision.
      4.    Survey Data for Lots. Dimensions of lots shall be the net
dimensions. Each lot shall be shown fully on a sheet. All lots containing
three-quarters of an acre or more shall show net acreage, and when required by
the City Engineer, the gross acreage. Whenever acreages are shown for lots,
blocks, or for the total tract area, they shall be shown to the nearest
thousandth of an acre, and when required by the City Engineer, in square feet,
to the nearest hundredth of a square foot.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.02.050   Lots.
   The size, dimensions and configuration of lots or parcels created by any
division of land shall conform to this section.
   A.   Lot Numbers. The lots or parcels shall be numbered consecutively
commencing with the number one, with no omissions or duplications. Block
numbers or letters may be used, but not preferred.
   B.   Lot Area. The minimum net lot area shall be that prescribed for the
zone in which the property is located. In a division by parcel map or tract
map, if the average lot area, as calculated in this subsection, is not less
than the minimum lot area prescribed for the zone, then the minimum lot area
requirement shall be deemed to have been met. Calculation of average lot area
shall be in the following manner:
      1.   No lot having an area of less than eight percent of the minimum lot
area for the zone in which the property is located shall be created.
      2.   No lot having an area equal to or greater than two hundred percent
of the minimum lot area permissible in the zone shall be included in either the
total area calculation or the total lot number calculation when determining
average lot areas.
      3.   The procedure for calculation of average lot size is:
         a.   Sum the area of all lots in the tract or parcel map, taking into
account the exclusions listed in this subsection and also excluding from the
sum all lot area in excess of one hundred twenty percent of the minimum lot
area of the zone.
         b.   Total all of the lots involved, taking into account the
exclusions listed in this subsection;
         c.   Divide the sum of the areas by the total number of eligible lots.
The quotient of this division is the average lot area and shall not be less
than the minimum lot area for the zone in which the property is located. Where
only a portion of the area covered by an approved tentative map is to be
recorded, the average lot area of the lots shown on that increment shall not be
less than the minimum lot area of the zone. When land is divided by a zoning
line, then the calculations shall be made separately, using the minimum lot
size for each appropriate portion of the land being divided.
   C.   Public Street Frontage. All lots created by the division of land,
whether by tract or parcel map, shall have frontage on a dedicated public
street, unless it is determined by the Director of Engineering that said access
is not feasible, or cannot be reasonably provided. The owner/developer may
obtain a review and determination from the Director of Engineering by
submitting a written request that clearly establishes the site restrictions
that necessitate this action. The Director's review and decision is final and
may not be appealed.
   If approved, an irrevocable mutual access agreement shall be recorded by
separate instrument, and filed concurrently with the map. Said easement shall
be referenced and delineated on the final map.
   In the case of condominiums, or planned residential developments with lot
areas owned in common, the street frontage requirement for individual lots may
be satisfied by the individual lot's ownership in common lot, if the common lot
has frontage on the public street.
   D.   Lot Width. The width of lots shall conform to standards of development
as defined by the City zoning ordinance or other ordinances or official plans
adopted pursuant to law, and the following criteria:
      1.   The minimum width of interior lots shall be not less than sixty
feet, measured on a line parallel with and twenty-five feet from the street
right-of-way line. For a curved or other irregular street right-of-way line,
this minimum width shall be measured parallel with, and twenty-five feet from a
straight line drawn between front lot corners.
      2.   The lot width shall be not less than forty-five feet measured along
the line closest and parallel to street right-of-way line. If the Director of
Engineering grants a waiver as provided in Subsection C of this section, the
minimum lot width along the closest first line parallel to the street right-of-
way line shall be forty-five feet.
      3.   Corner lots shall have a minimum width of sixty-five feet measured
the same as interior lots.
      4.   For a subdivision of land which is zoned with a minimum lot size
less than seven thousand two hundred square feet, the minimum widths and
dimensions specified herein in subdivisions 1, 3 and 5 of this subsection may
be reduced from sixty feet down to forty-five feet, and from sixty-five feet
down to fifty feet, respectively.
      5.   The minimum widths of odd-shaped lots which result from extreme
topography, difficult terrain, street alignments or widths, previous irregular
boundaries, or prior divisions or other unavoidable circumstances shall be
subject to individual determination and may be approved; provided however, that
the width along the closest first line parallel to the street right-of-way line
frontage of any such lot created should not be less than twenty feet, and the
lot width measured along the building line should not be less than sixty feet.
If the Director of Engineering grants a waiver as provided in subsection C of
this section, the minimum lot width along the closest first line parallel to
the street right-of-way line shall be twenty feet and the lot width measured
along the building line should not be less than sixty feet.
   The above provisions governing minimum lot widths shall not apply to
residential or common lots within a planned residential (PRD) zone. Lot sizes
and widths therein shall conform to the standards as set forth in Title 15 of
this code, or the approved concept plan or site plan for the particular
development, whichever applies.
   Small odd-shaped lots or parcels resulting from the separation of land by
streets or easements, or lots burdened by easements, utilities, or other
facilities to a degree which minimizes their value or use for other purposes,
or parcels subject to flooding, or portions of railroad rights-of-way, or other
lots or parcels which because of their size, shape, topography, use or location
are unable to be built upon or developed, shall, upon the determination of the
City Engineer, be exempted from the above requirements as to lot widths and
areas.
   E.    City Boundary. No lots shall be divided by the boundary line of the
city.
   F.    Side Lines. The side lines of lots shall be approximately at right
angles to the street lines on straight streets and shall be approximately
radial on curved streets.
(Ord. 2888 § 1, 1996; Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).

consideration of the effect of the division on the community and as required by
State or City laws.
   B.    Certificate of Owner. When a tentative parcel map is filed with the
Director of Development Services, the applicant shall certify in writing that
he is the record owner of property or properties to be divided, and that he
consents to the proposed division. Such certificate shall be in a form as
prescribed by the Director of Development Services, and all signatures thereon
shall be acknowledged by a notary public. Signatures of parties owning the
types of interest described in Section 66436 of the Subdivision Map Act need
not appear on the certificate form if the subdivider supplies their names, the
nature of their interests and evidence of their knowledge and consent to the
division prior to approval and recordation of the final parcel map.
   C.    Examination and Report on Tentative Parcel Map. Each tentative parcel
map filed shall be examined by the City Engineer and Director of Development
Services for its correctness and compliance with City ordinances and policies.
A written report of their findings and recommendations shall be delivered to
the Planning Commission within fifty days of the filing of the tentative parcel
map.
   This limit may be extended upon mutual consent of the persons submitting
said map and both the City Engineer and the Director of Development Services.
When a revised tentative map is submitted prior to Planning Commission action,
the time limitation period as defined in Section
16.02.030(C) shall be based upon the revised map submittal.
   Their report shall also be sent to the applicant of record at least three
days prior to any action taken on the tentative parcel map by the Planning
Commission. The Planning Commission (and City Council, if appealed)
consideration of said map shall be a public hearing, noticed as provided in
Section
15.76.060.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.03.030   Action by Planning Commission.
   At its first regular meeting held after receipt of the written report and
recommendations, the tentative parcel map, together with the report, shall be
presented to the Planning Commission which shall thereupon approve,
conditionally approve or disapprove the tentative parcel map. Such action shall
be in the form of a written resolution which shall specify the facts and
reasons for the decision made with a finding as to whether or not the division,
along with its improvement and design, conforms to the City's General Plan. The
Clerk of the Planning Commission shall thereafter report the Commission's
action in writing to the applicant within ten days of the action. Such action
by the Planning Commission shall become final in the absence of any appeal.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.03.040   Appeals.
   If any interested party or the applicant who filed the tentative parcel map
is dissatisfied with any requirement, ruling, finding, approval or disapproval
by the Planning Commission with respect to the map or the kinds, nature and

after such action, appeal in writing to the City Council for relief. The
written appeal shall be filed with the City Clerk and shall set forth the
grounds and reasons for appeal. The City Council may sustain, modify, or
overrule any such requirements, ruling, finding or disapproval of the Planning
Commission and may modify the kinds, nature and extent of any improvements
required. The City Council shall consider such appeal within thirty days of its
filing with the City Clerk. Notification by mail of the time and place at which
the appeal will be considered by Council shall be sent to the applicant or
owner not less than ten days prior to the meeting at which the appeal will be
considered. The decision of the City Council shall be final, and upon making
its decision, the City Clerk shall make a written report of the outcome
directly to the applicant or owner and to the various City departments.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.03.050   Limitation of approval.
   The approval or conditional approval of a tentative parcel map shall be
valid for a period of twenty-four months after the date upon which the Planning
Commission or the City Council, whichever is applicable, granted approval or
conditional approval of the division. During this time, the owner or applicant
may cause the parcel or parcels to be surveyed and a final map to be prepared
and submitted to the City Engineer for approval and subsequent recordation.
Upon written application, filed with the City Engineer within the twenty-four
month period following approval or conditional approval of the lot division,
extensions beyond the twenty-four month period may be granted by the Planning
Commission. The sum of all such extensions granted shall not exceed a total of
twenty-four months. If the request for extension is denied, then the applicant
or owner may appeal to the City Council in the same manner as outlined in
Section
16.02.040(B) of this title. At the time any tentative parcel map is extended,
the Planning Commission may add any new conditions as they see fit as a
condition of the extension of the tentative approval period, subject to appeal
to the City Council.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.03.060   Final parcel map.
   When a tentative parcel map has been approved or conditionally approved in
accordance with this chapter, a final map thereof, which shall be in
substantial conformance with the approved tentative map, shall be prepared,
approved and signed by the City Engineer and filed with the County Recorder for
recordation. Recordation shall be made within the twenty-four month period
above provided, or within any subsequent extension duly approved. If no final
parcel map is submitted for approval and recorded within the time limits
provided, then all proceedings shall terminate, and no final parcel map of any
portion of the land within the tentative parcel map shall be approved or
recorded without first processing a new tentative parcel map.
   A.    Filing. For the purpose of filing a final parcel map with the City,
the owner or applicant shall submit to the City Engineer an original final map
tracing and three blue-line prints thereof. One print shall be returned to the
owner or applicant thereafter, showing any corrections to be made, or a
statement that the map is correct. When the final map is found to be correct,
and the applicant or owner has posted all agreements, improvement securities
and fees, as described in Title 21 and elsewhere in this title, and all other
conditions precedent to the approval of the tentative parcel map have been met,
the final parcel map shall be certified by the City Engineer. The map will then
be transmitted to the County Recorder by the City Clerk.
   B.    Required Information of Final Parcel Map. The final parcel map shall
contain all of the same information and data as required on a final tract map
and shall be prepared following the format as described in the Subdivision Map
Act. Appropriate certificates for signature by the City Engineer, the County
Surveyor, and the engineer or surveyor who prepared the map, shall be provided
in a form as required by the City Engineer and the Subdivision Map Act. The
location and description of existing monuments or established lines, the
setting of new points and monuments before or after map recordation and the
required survey data to be shown and provided shall all be done in a similar
manner to that required by a final tract map, and as required by the City
Engineer. The delineation of lots and parcels, their minimum frontages and
widths, and the method of averaging lot sizes shall also conform to the same
standards and codes as if the division of land were a subdivision of over five
lots. All information shown on the final parcel map shall be based upon a field
survey made in conformance with good engineering and survey practices and with
the State Land Surveyors Act. Final maps for lot line adjustments, as defined
in this chapter may be based upon record data, if approved by the City
Engineer. Certificates for signature by the City Engineer, and others required
by law and this code, shall be shown on the final parcel map, except that a
certificate signed and acknowledged by all parties having record title interest
in the property to be divided by the parcel map is not required.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.03.070. Urban lot split - approval process.
   A.   Application. Tentative maps shall include the information specified in
Section
16.03.020 of this code. Any other relevant information which may be necessary
pursuant to
16.03.020.A.9 shall be specified in application submittal requirements so that
it is available and known to the applicant prior to submittal.
   B.   Approval. An application for a tentative parcel map for an urban lot
split is approved or denied ministerially, by the City Engineer, without
discretionary review, following technical review by Planning, Building, Fire,
and Public Works for compliance with Government Code section 66411.7, this
Ordinance, and applicable provisions of the Subdivision Map Act. The city shall
ministerially approve a parcel map for the split of a single-family residential
lot into two parcels if the following requirements are met, in addition to the
requirements of section
16.03.080:
      1.   Zoned Single Family. The property is located with a zoning of R-1.
      2.   Two Parcels Maximum. The parcel map divides an existing parcel to
create no more than two new parcels of approximately equal lot area, provided

(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.05.040   Public improvements.
   The following standards and criteria shall apply for the design and
construction of all public improvements required under this title:
   A.    Streets and Highways:
      1.    Right-of-Way and Roadway Width. Streets shall substantially conform
to the Circulation Element of the General Plan or an adopted Specific Plan.
Requirements may exceed General Plan requirements at the request of the
developer with concurrence of the City Engineer. In the absence of a General
Plan or Specific Plan, the street system shall relate in location and width to
the existing streets in the area adjoining the development or project.
Additional right-of-way may be required for public facilities, including, but
not limited to bikeways, recreation trails, bus ways or bus lanes, parking
lanes and treatment of intersections based on a traffic analysis which shows
the need for added through lanes and/or turning lanes, dual left-turn lanes,
and/or separate right-turn lanes.
Right-of-Way and Roadway Width
 
Type of Street                  R/W Width (feet) Roadway Width (feet between
                                                 curb faces)
Local residential (without      50 min.          36 min.
sidewalks)
Local                           54--60           36--40
Local collector                 60--84           40 min.
Secondary and primary arterials 80--100          64--84
(without parking)
Primary and major arterials     100 min.         84
(without parking)
Special sections                See below        See below
 
   Streets or highways not falling clearly into listed types or private streets
with public service easements may have widths different than those listed as
approved by the City Engineer. Roadway widths at intersections and places of
other public facilities may be wider than listed above as determined by the
City Engineer.
   Certain streets have been designated by Specific Plan as rural streets. The
widths, public improvement requirements and maintenance obligations for these
streets shall conform to this Specific Plan.
      2.    Dead-End and Cul-de-Sac Streets. Cul-de-sac streets shall not
exceed five hundred feet in length measured along the street centerline of the
intersecting street to the radius point of the turn-around or bulb end of the
cul-de-sac. The property line radius at the terminus of the cul-de-sac shall be
designed so as to provide a uniform parkway width. The curb radius shall be a
minimum of thirty-nine feet. Dead-end streets, to be extended at some later
date, shall not exceed three hundred feet in length, measured along the street
centerline from the centerline of the intersecting street to the terminus of
the dead-end street. The ends of dead-end streets shall be improved with
temporary turn-arounds as required by the City Engineer.
      3.    Frontage Roadways. Along major highways, limited access highways or
freeways, a frontage road separated from the main roadway by an acceptable
divider strip may be required. All such dimensions, widths and curve radii on
such multiple roadways shall be subject to determination by the City Engineer.
      4.    Curved Streets. The centerline radii of curves of streets or
highways, except where physical conditions and other special circumstances make
compliance impractical, shall be not less than:
         a.    One thousand feet on arterial highways;
         b.    Five hundred feet on local collector streets;
         c.    Two hundred feet on all other streets.
      5.    Grades. Street grades shall not be less than two-tenths percent for
such distances as topographical conditions make a greater grade impractical.
Street grades shall not exceed six percent on arterial highways or eight
percent for all other streets. Steeper grades may be constructed for short
distances only where topographical conditions make a lesser grade impractical
as determined by the City Engineer.
      6.    Intersections. Street intersections shall be as near to right
angles as practicable. In no case shall the angle between centerlines
(produced) be less than fifty degrees. Where new streets intersect existing
"tee" intersections, the new centerline shall align as closely as possible with
that of the opposite street.
      7.    Continuation of Existing Streets. Streets which are a continuation
of streets on contiguous property shall be aligned so as to assure that their
centerlines shall coincide. In cases where straight continuations are not
physically possible, such centerline shall be continued by curves.
      8.    Curb Return and Property Line Radii. At the intersections of all
streets, where one street has a right-of-way of eighty feet or greater, the
radius of the curb return shall be no less than thirty-five feet. Curb return
radii on all other intersecting streets, where both streets have right-of-way
widths less than eighty feet, shall be twenty-seven feet. The property line
radius at the above intersections shall be equal to the curb return radius,
less the width of the narrower parkway of the two intersecting streets with the
minimum radius of fifteen feet. In no case shall the parkway width around a
curb return be less than six feet wide. At the intersection of a private street
or a public service easement with a public street where the width of the
private street or public service easement exceeds twenty-five feet in width,
the curb return shall be no less than twenty-seven feet in radius.
   B.    Sidewalks and Walkways. Concrete sidewalks shall be installed on both
sides of all arterial highways and through streets, except where special
conditions, such as hillside development, slopes, single-loaded streets or a
rural neighborhood atmosphere makes such sidewalk construction impractical or
undesirable. Widths shall be designated by the City Engineer, but shall not be
less than four feet wide, clear of obstructions, in residential areas and five
feet wide in multiple-residential zones. Sidewalks may be eliminated in
parkways on streets fronting property zoned for industrial or manufacturing
use, where approved by the City Engineer, provided the parkway is suitably
landscaped and irrigated in lieu thereof. In residential zones of R-1-15,000 or
greater, sidewalks may be eliminated from cul-de-sac and local streets where
approved by the City Engineer. Full width sidewalks shall generally be provided
on arterial highways and in commercial zones. Walkways between blocks or
streets or at such other locations as required by the City Engineer, shall be
dedicated and improved for the convenience of pedestrian traffic and shall be
not less than five feet in width, clear of obstructions. Public walkways shall
be improved in a manner and to the extent as required by the City Engineer.
Sidewalks, improved to the standards and at the locations specified by the City
Engineer, shall be provided and installed within common lot areas, between
lots, and along private streets and easements in planned residential
developments (PRD), and planned unit developments (PUD), and in condominium
projects.
   C.    Street Lighting and Common Area Lighting. Street lights shall be
provided and installed on all streets. The lighting system shall be constructed
to City standards and shall be City-owned and operated. Private streets and
common areas within planned residential and planned unit developments and
within condominium projects shall be improved by the construction of street and
area lighting systems which shall be privately owned and operated systems
designed to City standards or Edison-owned systems, as approved by the City
Engineer.
   D.    Street Names and Street Name Signs. All new streets shall be named and
all private streets within planned unit and planned residential developments
shall be named. The names shall be chosen by the City, or by the subdivider or
developer, subject to the review and approval of the City Engineer. Street name
signs, bearing block numbers shall be installed at intersections of all streets
and highways and private named streets, and at such other locations designated
by the City Engineer. All street name signs shall conform to the standards as
established by the City Engineer as to size, color, height, lettering and other
details. Fees to pay for the furnishing and installation of street name signs
by City forces shall be collected from the developer or subdivider, unless
otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
   E.    Parkway Trees. Parkway trees shall be installed along all streets and
highways. The trees shall be installed in the manner and shall conform to the
size and species specified by the City Engineer. In full width sidewalks, tree
wells shall be provided as required for the trees. On streets adjacent to
industrial, manufacturing or planned residential zones, parkway trees may not
be required, provided they are replaced by trees or other suitable landscaping
planted on adjacent properties in conjunction with on-site landscaping.
   F.    Median Islands. Raised median islands shall be required where traffic
conditions, property access, public safety, or other reasons, as determined by
the City Engineer, require same. Medians shall be constructed to the width,
length and alignment as determined by the City Engineer and shall when he
requires, be provided with landscaping and a suitable irrigation system.
   G.    Alleys and Public Service Easements. Alleys may be required on all
sites zoned for or to be used for commercial or multiple-family purposes when
the lot layout, safety of access, provision of legal access or public service
needs makes such public access necessary. Where the lot is large, under single
ownership and the conditions applicable for public alleys are not present, a
public service easement, improved to City standards, may be required in lieu of
an alley. The purpose of the public service easement is to provide an easement
for all public and private utilities, including cable television, and to
provide an access easement for all public service vehicles, including, but not
limited to, emergency vehicles, police patrol, fire inspection and refuse
collection trucks. The property owner may otherwise control access and shall be
responsible for maintenance of the roadway improvements within the public
service easement. Alleys or public service easements may be required at the
rear of all property fronting directly upon major highways and secondary
streets and may be required at other locations where necessary to prevent undue
interference with traffic. Where alleys or public service easements intersect,
the corners shall be provided with cutoffs to provide a sight-distance and to
facilitate turning. Cutoffs shall be triangular-shaped, having fifteen feet
(minimum) sides on each alley, or spandrel-shaped, having a twenty-five foot
(minimum) radius. Alley and public service easement dedications shall include
the cutoff areas.
   All alleys and public service easements shall be subject to determination by
the City Engineer as to design, alignment, width and method of improvement,
with the minimum width of any alley or public service easement being twenty
feet. As a condition of tentative or final map approvals or the issuance of
building or use permits, existing alleys in need of reconstruction or
upgrading, where determined by the City Engineer, may be required to be
reconstructed or upgraded, or in lieu thereof, a reasonable cash deposit in the
amount of the estimated cost of improvement, shall be deposited with the City
Engineer.
   H.    Drainage and Grading Improvements. Drainage facilities shall be
provided and installed as necessary to protect the lots, parcels, buildings or
structures involved from flooding and to prevent excessive flooding of the
public streets therein or abutting. The facilities shall be designed to prevent
flooding of the first floor level, as defined by the Federal Insurance
Administration from storm runoff emanating from a one hundred-year frequency
storm. Public streets shall be protected from flooding from runoffs of a ten-
year frequency storm, in accordance with policies and criteria determined by
the City Engineer. Protection to higher levels may be required by the City
Engineer, dependent upon the degree of flood risk involved, the topography,
location, local drainage patterns, and the requirements of the Orange County
Flood Control District. Hydrologic and hydraulic calculations and studies for
all such facilities shall be subject to the review and approval, of the City
Engineer.
   All grading done in conjunction with the development of the tract or
property concerned shall be performed in conformance with the City Building and
Grading Code and with good engineering practices. On and off-site storm drain
facilities and the site grading shall be so designed and constructed to prevent
undue erosion of the site or off-site properties and to prevent excessive
deposits of mud, silt or debris upon any public street or easement or within
any channel, storm drain facility, swale or water course. Fees may be required
as a condition of the final approval of a subdivision map, parcel map or the
issuance of a building or use permit, for the purpose of defraying the actual
or estimated costs of constructing planned drainage facilities for the removal
of surface and storm drain waters from local or neighborhood drainage areas.
The fee, if any, shall be set by the Council at the time of the approval of the
development based upon the cost of the system required, the contributing
drainage area and the flooding potential involved.
   I.    Sewerage Facilities. Sewer mains, manholes, and appurtenances shall be
constructed to serve the subdivision, lot, parcel, building or structure, and
individual laterals shall be provided to each lot and parcel therein. All such
facilities shall be installed prior to the paving of the streets and alleys or
improvement of the easements within the development. Sanitary sewers shall be
constructed to the sizes, lines, grades and design as approved by the City
Engineer and as required by any Master Plan of Sewers or element of the General
Plan in effect. Fees may be required as a condition of the final approval a
subdivision map, parcel map, or the approval of issuance of a building or use
permit for the purpose of constructing planned sanitary sewer facilities for
local sanitary sewers in accordance with the City's Master Sewerage Plan or any
applicable element of the City's General Plan. The fee, if any, shall be set by
the Council at the time of the approval of the development based upon the cost
of the system required, the contributing area and the overloading potential
involved.
   J.    Water Supply System. Water shall be provided from the City's water
utility. Water mains, services, meters, cross connection control, valves, fire
protection facilities and all other appurtenances of the water system shall be
to the sizes, lines, grades and design as determined by the City Engineer and
as specified in Title 12 and applicable State law. All mains, services and
appurtenances shall be installed prior to the paving of the streets or alleys
or easements within the development. Connection charges, water main
reimbursements, front footage charges and all other fees related to water
systems shall be paid to the water utility in accordance with Title 12 of this
code.
   K.    Driveways and Access. The location of driveway depressions and access
points within a subdivision, planned residential or planned unit development
project or other development shall be as shown on the approved tentative map,
concept plan or site plan or, in their absence, as determined by the City
Engineer. Driveways and access points shall be improved in the manner and to
the extent as determined by the City Engineer, subject to the following general
provisions:
      1.    Driveway depressions shall be a minimum of ten feet wide.
      2.    Driveway depressions on a single parcel or lot shall be separated
by at least twenty feet of full curb height.
      3.    Maximum width of driveway depressions in R-1 zones:
         a.    Where lot has a one or two-car garage, twenty-two feet;
         b.    Where lot has a three-car garage, twenty-six feet;
      4.    Maximum width of driveway depressions in other higher zones, thirty
feet, except as otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
      5.    No part of a driveway depression or transition shall encroach onto
adjoining property frontages.
      6.    Driveways shall be constructed symmetrically and shall be at right
angles to the centerline of the street or radial to the street or curved
streets. Where alleys are available to provide access to a parcel or a
property, or where other access is available to a local street, the approval of
driveway access or the issuance of a permit for a driveway from said parcel or
property to any street designated as major, primary or secondary street on the
Circulation Element of the General Plan may be prohibited by the City Engineer.
His decision in this regard may be appealed to the Transportation and
Circulation Commission, whose decision in the matter shall be final. Where the
construction or widening of any street, or the development of any parcel or
property requires the striping or restriping of any pavement, the painting of
turn pockets, medians, edge lines, or other pavement markings or the
installation of warning or advisory signs, in order to provide safe traffic
flow or access to or from the property, parcel or development, all such work
shall be done at no cost to the city, in accordance with the standards of the
City Engineer, the State Department of Transportation, Vehicle Code, and other
applicable codes.
   L.    Landscaping. The open space and other areas owned in common in planned
residential, planned unit developments, and condominium projects shall be
provided with landscaping and irrigation facilities in accordance with plans to
be approved by the Director of Development Services. These improvements shall
be included in the improvement securities posted for any subdivision or
development requiring same.
   M.    Traffic Signals. Construction, of modification or upgrading of traffic
signals and appurtenances may be required as a condition of the approval of any
subdivision, land division, use or building permit, if the additional traffic
generated by the tract or development, the safety of the traveling public, the
increased use of the streets or other unusual circumstances require the
construction. Where the development of a subdivision or other project will be
phased over a period of time, and, in the opinion of the City Engineer, the
full effect of the increased burden on the streets will not be felt for a
period of time, the subdivider or developer may be required to deposit a cash
amount in the estimated value of the traffic signal improvements ultimately to
be made, which sum shall be used at such time as the construction of the signal
and appurtenances is warranted. The exact amount, details and timing of the
deposit and future construction shall be subject to an agreement between the
City and the subdivider or developer.
   N.    Walls. A masonry wall shall be constructed along the sides of all
arterial, primary and secondary highways, where the abutting residential lots
or parcels have alternate access to other streets, and where access rights to
the arterial, primary or secondary highway from the abutting lots have been or
are required to be dedicated to the City. The exact type of construction,
design and height of the walls shall be determined by the City Engineer and by
the Director of Development Services, as each applies. At the bottoms of slopes
along streets and highways improved or to be improved with sidewalks, a slough
wall shall be required to be installed to prevent sloughing off of dirt, mud,
or other deposits from the hillside of slope onto the sidewalks. The exact type
of construction, design and height shall be determined in the same manner as
above. In lieu of the slough wall requirement, the bottoms or toes of the
slopes shall be set back from the sidewalk area a reasonable distance as is
determined by the City Engineer (Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.05.050   Supplemental improvements -- Reimbursement.
   Improvements installed or required to be installed as a condition of a
subdivision, tract, division of land or the approval of a use or building
permit may be required by the City Engineer to contain supplemental size,
capacity, number or amount for the benefit of adjoining or nearby properties
not within the tract, lot division, or development for which the use or
building permit is requested. All such additional or supplemental facilities
shall be dedicated to the City for public use in a manner approved by the City
Engineer. When such additional or supplemental improvements or facilities are
required, the City may enter into a reimbursement agreement with the subdivider
or developer, in a form approved by the City Attorney, which shall provide for
reimbursement to the subdivider or developer from all future parties or
properties benefitted by the presence, use or availability of the additional
improvements or facilities. The amount of the reimbursement shall be equal to
the difference in cost between the total actual cost of the improvements
including the additional or supplemental facilities and the cost of the
improvements had not the additional or supplemental items been required.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.05.060   Underground utilities and service lines.
   Pursuant to the requirements of this section, whenever:
   A.    Any tentative tract or parcel map or map for the reversion of lots to
acreage is filed; or
   B.    A use or building permit is requested for the development or
redevelopment of new or relocated buildings or structures; or
   C.    The addition of floor area equal to or in excess of twenty-five
percent of the existing floor space of an existing building or structure is
proposed in any zone except R-1; or
   D.    The installation of a new electrical service for any existing building
or structure is proposed in any zone except residential zones where a stubout
is provided for future use; or
   E.    The conversion of a residential building to a nonresidential use is
proposed; then all new or proposed electrical, telephone, community antenna
television and similar wires, cables, service and appurtenances which provide
direct service to the property being subdivided, divided or developed, shall be
installed underground, and all existing facilities providing direct service to
the building, structure, or development being added to or rebuilt shall be
undergrounded as a condition precedent to the approval of such tentative or
final parcel map, subdivision tract map, use or building permit by the Planning
Commission, City Council, Director of Development Services, City Engineer, or
City staff, whichever is applicable. All new line extensions of existing
electric power, telephone, communication and cable television lines,
hereinafter constructed in the city shall be placed underground. All utility
undergrounding shall be installed and performed at no expense to the City,
subject to the applicable rules, regulations and tariffs of the respective
utility or utilities on file with the California Public Utilities Commission.
      1.    Exceptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
         a.    Any municipal equipment or facilities installed under the
supervision of and to the satisfaction of the City Engineer;
         b.    Poles, overhead wires and cables and associated overhead
structures and appurtenances used for the transmission of electrical power at
nominal voltages in excess of thirty-four thousand five hundred volts;
         c.    Antennas, receivers, associated equipment and supporting
structures used by a utility for communication services;
         d.    Equipment appurtenant to underground facilities, such as surface
mounted transformers, pedestals, terminal boxes, meter cabinets, vents and the
like;
         e.    Temporary poles, wires and overhead structures and associated
equipment used or to be used in conjunction with construction projects, or
installed and maintained for a period of ten days or less for emergency
reasons;
         f.    Any equipment or facilities owned or operated by the State or
the Federal government.
      2.    Existing Facilities. The provisions of this section shall not
prohibit the maintenance and operation of existing overhead utility facilities,
nor prohibit the installation of overhead service lines to facilities already
served overhead by the same utility when approved by the City Engineer, nor
prohibit the connection of underground service lines to overhead existing
distribution equipment. A utility may intersect additional poles or other
supporting structures or increase the height of existing poles or other
supporting structures if such work takes place within the existing easements
and pole lines of existing overhead facilities, and may continue to maintain,
repair, replace and reinforce any facility or structure existing on or before
the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.
      3.    Appeal. Where the enforcement of the provisions of this section
would result in undue hardship on the part of a utility, subdivider or
developer, application for exception from the provisions herein may be made in
the following manner. Conditions imposed by the Planning Commission or by the
City Council are excluded from this appeal process.
         a.    Written application shall be filed with the Department of
Development Services, with a copy to the City Engineer;
         b.    Such written application shall include all information, facts
and figures necessary to properly advise and inform the Development Services
Director and the City Engineer of the circumstances which require such appeal
and create the hardship;
         c.    The Director of Development Services shall consider the
application and the facts thereon, and shall, within twenty days after its
filing, grant or deny the appeal or modify the requirements which caused the
appeal and shall notify the appealing party in writing of his decision. Any
action or decision taken or made by the Director of Development Services may be
appealed to the Planning Commission and thereafter to the City Council, if
necessary, in the same manner as required for appeals from the requirements of
a use or building permit. For subdivision, tracts and lot divisions, any
exception and appeal shall also be approved by the State Public Utilities
Commission, if so required by the Director of Development Services.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.05.065   Soils report.
   Unless otherwise specified in this title, a preliminary soils report
prepared by a civil engineer registered in the state shall be required for
every division of land for which a tract map or a parcel map is required. The
Director of Development Services may waive the requirement for such report if,
due to reports on file or his knowledge of the existing soil conditions and
qualities within the land to be divided, he finds that such a preliminary
report is not necessary. If the number of lots or parcels involved in the
division is small or if their development is to be deferred, the Director of
Development Services may also defer the requirement for a soils report until
such time as grading or building permits are requested on the lots or parcels.
Unless specifically required otherwise, a preliminary soils report shall not be
required for the approval of a map for the reversion of divided land to
acreage. Any such preliminary soils report shall be based upon sufficient test
borings and shall indicate the character and quality of the land and soils
within the area being divided. If the preliminary soil report indicates the
presence of critically expansive soils, or conditions indicating slippage, soil
movement, lack of compaction, seismic activity, or any other condition, which
if not corrected could lead to possible structural damage or defects to
structures or dwellings built upon the land, then the Director of Development
Services may require a soils investigation on each lot or parcel in the
proposed division. The report shall recommend corrective actions to be taken
which are likely to prevent the defects or damage, and such recommendations
shall be required to be implemented as conditions precedent to the issuance of
building permits for dwellings or structures on the lots or parcels involved.
When a soils report is required, it shall be completed and submitted to the
Director of Development Services prior to the City Council approval of the
final tract map and prior to the City Engineer's approval of any final parcel
map.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.05.070   Inspection of public improvements.
   All construction of improvements under this title shall be subject to
inspection and testing by the City Engineer or his authorized representatives
to insure compliance with the standards and specifications specified and
required by this title. All work and improvements must be found to conform to
the standards and specifications as a condition of the City's acceptance of
them and the release of any improvement securities held therefor. No
construction shall commence or continue without first having arrangements made
with the City Engineer or his staff for inspection. The City Engineer and his
authorized representative shall have the right to stop any work or refuse to
inspect any work or reject any or all work and construction if it is found that
the work is unauthorized, is unsafe in any way to the workmen or the public, is
inferior in materials or workmanship, was performed without inspection, or does
not meet or comply with City standards, specifications or City-approved
construction plans. Reasonable access to the construction and work shall be
provided at all times so that full knowledge of the progress, workmanship and
character of the materials used in the work can be gained.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.05.080   Improvement plans, drawings and related items.
   All public or private improvement plans, profiles, descriptions, studies,
calculations, notes, surveys and drawings required under the provisions of this
title shall be provided at no expense to the City and shall be prepared in
accordance with this section and as required by the City Engineer. Construction
plans for street, alley, drainage, sewer and water improvements and for any
other improvements as required, shall be drawn on standard City mylars in black
opaque ink, and shall be filed with the City Engineer for his checking and
review prior to their approval. All maps, sketches, descriptions, estimates,
plats and other drawings and items required to fulfill the requirements of this
title shall also be provided in the form, content, number and detail as
specified by the City Engineer. The plans and profiles of all required and
proposed public and private improvements in a subdivision tract shall be
furnished to the City Engineer, and shall be ready for his approval before a
final tract map of the subdivision is presented to the City Council for
approval or prior to the City Engineer signing the final parcel map. No
construction or work shall commence on any of the improvements shown on any
construction or improvement plans required in this chapter until the plans have
been reviewed and approved and signed by the City Engineer. After approval and
signature by the City Engineer, all original mylars shall become the property
of the City and may be released thereafter for reproduction or other purposes
only to bonded blueprinting or reproduction agencies, firms or individuals as
approved by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.05.090   Safety and public convenience.
   All public and private improvements constructed in the city shall be built,
provided and worked on in a safe manner. Workmen, pedestrians and vehicular
traffic shall be protected as required by the regulations and provisions of the
State Division of Industrial Safety, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health
Act and by City codes. No person, firm, corporation, partnership, association,
contractor or subcontractor shall conduct his work or operations in any way
which presents a clear and present danger or hazard to life and property or
which unreasonably interferes with the rights of the citizens of the city or
the public. Any such person, firm, etc., found to be in violation of this
section by any police officer, peace officer or by the City Engineer or his
authorized representatives is guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be cited in
accordance with law.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.05.095   Reservation of land for public uses.
   Real property within the boundaries of a final subdivision tract map or
parcel map shall be reserved for parks, recreational facilities, fire stations,
libraries or other public uses, subject to the following conditions:
   A.    Standards for Reservations. The requirement for a reservation of real
property shall be based upon a duly adopted Specific Plan or an adopted General
Plan containing a Community Facilities Element, a Recreation and Parks Element
or a Public Building Element and the required reservations shall be in
accordance with definite principles and standards contained therein. The
reserved area shall be of such size and shape to permit the balance of the
property within which the reservation is located to develop in an efficient and
orderly manner and the amount of land reserved shall not make development of
the remaining land held by the subdivider or developer economically unfeasible.
The reserved area shall conform to the adopted Specific or General Plan and
shall be in such multiples of streets, lots and parcels as to permit an
efficient division of the reserved area in the event that it is not acquired
within the prescribed period; in such an event, the subdivider or developer
shall make those changes as are necessary to permit the reserved area to be
developed for the intended purpose, consistent with good subdividing practices.
   B.    Procedure. The City or other public agency for whose benefit an area
has been reserved shall at the time of approval of the final tract map or
parcel map enter into a binding agreement, in a form approved by the City
Attorney, to acquire such reserved area within two years after the completion
and acceptance by the City of all improvements required as condition of the
approval of the map, or, if no improvements were required, within two years
from the date of recordation of the tract map or parcel map, unless such
periods of time are extended by mutual agreement.
   The purchase price shall be the fair market value of the reserved land,
determined at the time of the filing of the tentative map or parcel map, plus
the taxes against the reserved area from the date of the reservation and any
other costs incurred by the subdivider or developer in the maintenance of the
reserved area, including interest costs incurred on any loan covering such
reserved area.
   C.    Termination of Reservation. If the City or other public agency for
whose benefit an area has been reserved does not enter into such a binding
agreement, the reservation of such area shall automatically terminate.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.05.096   Dedication of elementary school sites.
   Any subdivider who develops or completes the development of one or more
subdivisions in one or more elementary school districts shall be required to
dedicate to the school district or districts within which the subdivisions are
to be located such land as the City Council deems necessary for the purpose of
constructing thereon such elementary schools as are necessary to assure the
residents of the subdivision adequate public school service. The amount of land
to be dedicated shall not exceed that which would make the development of the
remaining land held by the subdivider economically unfeasible or exceed the
amount of land ordinarily allowed under the procedures of the State Allocation
Board.
   A.    This requirement shall not apply to a subdivider who has owned the
land being divided for more than ten years prior to filing of the tentative
tract map or maps in accordance with this title.
   B.    The requirement of dedication shall be imposed at the time of approval
of the tentative tract map by the City Council or tentative parcel map by the
Planning Commission. If, within thirty days after the approval of the tentative
map upon which the school site dedication requirement has been imposed, the
elementary school district does not offer to enter into a binding commitment
with the subdivider to accept the dedication, the requirement for dedication
shall be terminated automatically. The required dedication may be made any time
before, concurrently with, or up to sixty days after, the filing and
recordation of the final map with the County Recorder.
   C.    The school district shall, in the event it accepts the dedication,
repay to the subdivider or his successors the original cost to the subdivider
of the dedicated land, plus a sum equal to the total of the following amounts:
      1.    The cost of any improvements to the dedicated land since
acquisition by the subdivider;
      2.    The taxes assessed against the dedicated land from the date of the
elementary school district's offer to enter into the binding commitment to
accept the dedication;
      3.    Any costs incurred by the subdivider in the maintenance of such
dedicated land, including interest costs incurred on any loan covering such
land;
   D.    If the dedicated land is not used by the school district as a school
site within ten years after the dedication, the subdivider shall have the
option to repurchase the property from the district for the amount paid
therefor.
   E.    1.    The elementary school district to which the property is
dedicated shall record a certificate with the County Recorder of Orange County,
which certificate shall contain the following information:
         a.    The name, address, zip code and telephone number of the
subdivider dedicating the property;
         b.    A legal description of the real property dedicated;
         c.    A statement that the subdivider dedicating the property has an
option to repurchase the property if it is not used by the school district as a
school site within ten years after dedication;
         d.    Proof of the acceptance of the dedication by the school
district, and the date of the acceptance.
      2.    The certificate shall be recorded not more than ten days after the
date of acceptance of the dedication. The subdivider shall have the right to
compel the school district to record such certificate, but until such
certificate is recorded, any rights acquired by any third party dealing in good
faith with the school district shall not be impaired or otherwise affected by
the option right of the subdivider.
   F.    If any subdivider is aggrieved by, or fails to agree to the
reasonableness of any requirement imposed pursuant to this section, he may
bring a special proceeding in the superior court pursuant to Article 3 of
Chapter 7 of Division 2 of Title 7 of the State Government Code (Section
66499.37).
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.05.100   Dedication of land for public use.
   The purpose of this section is to describe the manner in which dedications
to the City shall be required and processed and to describe and set standards
for the various kinds of dedications and easements required.
   A.    General. The public need, safety, increased traffic, orderly
development of the surrounding area and general welfare requires that
dedications, offers of dedication and irrevocable offers of dedication of real
property for various public uses be made to the City as conditions precedent to
the approval or conditional approval of subdivision tract maps, parcel maps,
reversions to acreage, and consolidations and combinations of lots and parcels
and for the approval or issuance of use permits, building permits, public works
permits or any other action or event requiring evidence of official City
approval. Dedications may be required for streets, highways, alleys, public
service easements, ways, courts, walkways, bicycle trails, bridle trails,
recreation trails, abutter's rights, vehicular and pedestrian access rights,
slopes, storm drains, watercourses, floodplains, sewers, waterlines, water
rights, public utilities, traffic signal facilities, environmental enhancement,
landscaping, parks, recreation areas and for all other public uses not
specified, if found to be required to conform to or implement the City General
Plan or any element thereof. Dedications may also be required by the City on
behalf of any other public agency or district.
   B.    Dedication Requirements. Dedications for streets and highways shall be
to the widths designated in Section
16.05.040(A)(1) of this title and as designated on the Circulation Element of
the City General Plan or as designated on an approved Specific Plan, Government
Specific Plan (GSP) or other official plan. Deviations may be allowed for
streets and highway widths not shown on the Circulation Element or on any
approved Specific Plan based upon the land use, traffic volumes, and other
factors as determined by the City Engineer. Additional right-of-way may be
required for public facilities, including, but not limited to, bikeways,
recreational trails, bus ways or bus lanes, parking lanes, and treatment of
intersections based on a traffic analysis which shows the need for added
through lanes, and/or turning lanes, dual left-turn lanes, and/or separate
right-turn lanes. Dedications for other public easements shall be based upon
the need for service, accessibility, topography, clearances available and other
circumstances and factors as determined by the City Engineer. Easements for
sewers, drains and the waterlines shall generally not be less than ten feet
wide.
   C.    Method of Dedication. All dedications shall be made to the City in
conformance with the following:
      1.    By Final Subdivision Tract Map or Parcel Map. All streets,
highways, alleys, easements and parcels offered for dedication or to be
dedicated shall be clearly indicated on the final map. They shall be clearly
described in the appropriate certificate on the title sheet of the map. Access
rights dedications shall likewise be shown and described on the final map. The
certificate shall be signed and acknowledged by all those parties having any
record title interest in the property being subdivided, as specified in Section
66436 of the Subdivision Map Act.
      2.    By Separate Instrument. Where dedications are made requirements of
the final approval of a lot consolidation, or the approval and issuance of a
use permit, building permit or any other permit, and no final tract or parcel
map is required to be filed and recorded as a condition thereof, then the
required dedications shall be made by separate instrument in a form approved by
the City Attorney, which shall be signed, executed and acknowledged by all
parties having title interest in the property or rights being dedicated.
Preparation, execution and delivery of the fully executed instrument shall be
made prior to the final approval by the City of the consolidation or permit
being requested.
   D.    Acceptance or Rejection of Dedications.
      1.    By Subdivision Tract Map. At the time of final map acceptance and
approval by the City Council, the Council may accept, accept subject to
improvement or reject any or all dedications or offers of dedication. The City
Clerk shall certify on the map the action by the Council. If at the time the
map is approved, any dedications for streets, paths, alleys or other purpose
are rejected, the offer of dedication made by the owners shall remain open and
the City Council may by resolution at any later date and without further action
by or notice to the subdivider, rescind its action and accept and open the
streets, paths, alleys or other dedications and easements for public use, which
resolution of acceptance shall be recorded with the County Recorder.
      2.    By Parcel Map or Separate Instrument. If dedications are offered on
the title sheet of a parcel map or are made by separate instrument to the City,
they shall be accepted or rejected by a City official(s) authorized by City
Council resolution(s), and shall thereupon be delivered to the County Recorder
for recordation.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.05.110   Agreements and improvement securities.
   A.    Agreements. The construction of all public improvements required as a
condition of the approval of a subdivision tract map, a parcel map, a use
permit or a building permit, or any other type of permit or required as the
condition of approval of a reversion to acreage or a lot consolidation, shall
be guaranteed by the execution of a suitable agreement in a form prescribed in
this title and approved by the City Attorney. All such agreements shall contain
the terms and conditions to be met by the subdivider, developer or permittee
and shall specify a reasonable time in which to construct the improvements or
perform the requirements and obligations of the agreement. The time allowed for
the completion of the work shall be as specified by the City Engineer and shall
depend upon the amount and complexity of the work involved, the type of
development and any other factors he may deem important. All agreements shall
be executed by the owner or developer or the subdivider of the property or land
being divided or developed. The signatures shall be acknowledged before a
notary public and the agreements shall be accompanied by evidence
substantiating the signer's position, title and authority to bind the person,
company, partnership, corporation, joint venture or other entity to the actions
and obligations contained in the agreement.
   Prior to the expiration of the time allowed by the agreement in which to
perform or complete the obligations contained therein, the subdivider, owner,
or developer who executed the agreement may request, in writing, that the City
Engineer extend the term of the agreement. The written request shall contain
the reasons for the requested additional time, the length of the additional
time requested and any other data deemed necessary or informative. Upon
consideration of the written request and the evidence presented, the request
shall be acted upon and shall be either approved, rejected or modified. The
request for extension may be handled at the staff level with written approval
of the action by the City Administrator, or if the City Engineer feels the
matter is of special interest or of unusual importance, he may place the
request before the City Council for their consideration.
   B.    Improvement Securities. Improvement securities shall be required to be
posted as a guarantee of the performance of any act or obligation required as a
condition of the approval of any final tract map, parcel map, reversion to
acreage, lot consolidation, or any use, or building permit. Unless otherwise
provided in this title, all such improvement securities shall be one of the
following:
      1.    A cash deposit made with the City;
      2.    A time certificate of deposit or a savings passbook, made out to or
assigned to the City in a form approved by the City Attorney and City
Treasurer;
      3.    A bond or bonds from a duly authorized corporate surety;
      4.    Irrevocable letter of credit.
   Cash bonds, certificates, surety bonds, and irrevocable letters of credit
shall be in a form prescribed by the City Engineer, subject to the approval of
the City Attorney. Improvement securities shall be in the amount of the total
estimated cost of all the required improvements and conditions, which amount
shall include an amount equal to ten percent of the total estimated cost for
the purpose of securing payment to the City for construction, contingencies,
and its costs for overhead, administration and other costs and expenses
pertaining to the subdivision, division or project.
   C.    Improvement Securities for Land Divisions. Improvement securities
posted as a guarantee of the performance of an agreement or act made a
condition of the approval of land division or reversion requiring a parcel map
or tract map, shall be in the following amounts for the following purposes:
      1.    An amount determined by the City Engineer, equal to one hundred
percent of the total estimated cost of all of the required public and private
improvements within the land division or reversion conditioned upon the
faithful performance of the agreement, act or contract;
      2.    An additional amount determined by the City Engineer, not less than
fifty percent of the total estimated cost of all the required public and
private improvements within the land division or reversion securing payment to
the contractor, his subcontractors and to persons furnishing labor, materials
or equipment to them for the improvement or the performance of the required
act.
   D.    Improvement Securities for Use Permits, Building Permits, Lot
Consolidations and Other Permits. Improvement securities posted as a guarantee
of the performance of any agreement, act or contract made a condition of the
approval or issuance of a use permit, building permit or lot consolidation or
other permit, shall be in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the total
estimated cost of all of the required public and private improvements. Surety
bonds therefor shall be in the form as prescribed by the City Attorney and the
City Engineer.
   E.    Release and Reduction of Improvement Securities. The securities posted
in conformance with subsections C and D of this section may be released in
whole or in part, as specified in Section 66499.7 of the State Government Code,
upon receipt of a written request from the principal. The City Engineer shall
determine the validity of the request, and if all of the work has been
satisfactorily completed, and all of the requirements imposed have been met,
and all cash fees, charges, and assessments have been paid in full, and all
required departmental releases have been granted, then the improvement
securities may be released in the manner specified by law and the improvements
and work accepted by filing of a written instrument with the City Clerk, signed
by the City official so designated and empowered to do so by the City Council.
If only a portion of the work has been completed, the City Engineer may
recommend the reduction of the face amount of the security held for faithful
performance to an amount equal to the estimated total cost of the improvements
remaining. Such reduction shall be approved upon the filing of a written
instrument with the City Clerk, signed by the City official so designated and
empowered to do so by the City Council.
   No reduction in the amount of improvement securities held shall be
authorized or approved for an amount less than twenty percent of the total
estimated cost of the remaining improvements, and the total amount of
securities held shall not be reduced to an amount less than twenty percent of
the total securities until final completion and acceptance of the work. In no
event shall a reduction or release of improvement security be approved which
would reduce such security to an amount below that required to guarantee
completion of the act or other obligation imposed by this title, the
improvement agreement or the Subdivision Map Act. No reduction in the amount of
any improvement security shall be construed as City acceptance of any or all of
the improvements constructed at the time of the reduction. It shall only be
construed as an acknowledgment of the completion of a portion of the required
work:
   F.    Additional Amounts of Security Required. All improvement securities
shall also secure the faithful performance of any changes or alterations in the
work to the extent that the changes or alterations do not exceed ten percent of
the total estimated cost of the required improvements.
   G.    Exceptions. Under special circumstances, as determined by the City
Engineer, the requirement for improvement securities required for the guarantee
of an act, obligation or agreement made a condition of a building or use
permit, lot consolidation or other act or process not involving a subdivision
tract map or parcel map may be waived, provided a suitable agreement
guaranteeing completion of the required act or obligation is executed. Such
circumstances may include or be related to the size of the proposed building,
structure, or addition, its permit valuation, the estimated value or cost of
the required improvements, the condition and makeup of the surrounding or
adjacent areas, the likelihood of other improvements in the area, the status of
other public improvements in the area, and the demonstrated financial
responsibility of the developer or applicant involved.
   H.    In the event a tentative map is filed over the same, or any portion
of, property being conditionally developed pursuant to any other provision of
this code, the improvement security provisions regarding subdivision by tract
map or parcel map shall prevail. Upon posting the securities required as a
condition of approval of the final tract map or final parcel map, the developer
may request, and the City Engineer may approve, release of securities
previously posted pursuant to any other provisions of this code.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
Chapter 16.06
PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT BY BUILDING AND USE
PERMITS
Sections:
16.06.010   Purpose.
16.06.020   Scope.
16.06.030   Exemption.
16.06.040   Appeals.
16.06.050   Deferral of improvements.
16.06.010   Purpose.
   Dedication and construction of streets, alleys, and other public easements
and improvements, as described in this section, are found to be required by
reason of the fact that new construction or reconstruction or alteration of
residential, commercial or industrial buildings and structures increases the
traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian, and increases the use of and need for
other public improvements such as streets, sewers, water facilities, drains,
street lighting and sidewalks in the same manner and to the same extent as a
subdivision or division of land increases these needs. It has therefore been
determined by the City Council that the public interest, convenience, safety
and necessity require, as a condition of approval and issuance of property use
permits and building permits, that certain public dedications and public
improvements be imposed as a condition of the approval of or issuance of such
permits, in the manner described in this chapter.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.06.020   Scope.
   The scope of and extent of the dedications, public improvements, and their
design requirements, for the purpose of this chapter, shall be the same as
would be required and imposed upon the developer or owner of the property
involved if the property were the subject of, or included in, a division of
land by subdivision tract map, and as permitted by and described in the
Subdivision Map Act, and in
Chapter 16.05 and elsewhere in this code.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.06.030   Exemption.
   Where a use or building permit is requested pursuant to this chapter and the
work or land improvement to be performed under such permit is minor in nature
or certain of the dedications and improvements required are not reasonably
related to the work or improvement to be done, the City Engineer may waive
those certain requirements that are not reasonably related.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.06.040   Appeals.
   Any person or property owner aggrieved by or in disagreement with a
requirement or a decision made by the City Engineer pursuant to this chapter
may file an appeal from such decision or requirement to the City Council. The
appeal shall be in written form, filed with the City Clerk, and shall describe
the decision made and the reasons for the appeal. Such appeal shall be filed
prior to the issuance of the building permit on the property in question or
within the time specified in Title 15 of this code for use permits. Upon
receipt of the written appeal, the City Clerk shall set the matter before the
City Council for its consideration within thirty days from its receipt. The
City Clerk shall give the appealing party at least five days written notice of
the time and place at which the City Council will consider the matter. At the
Council meeting the appealing party and the City Engineer shall present their
facts and evidence and the City Council shall sustain, modify or overrule any
such requirement or decision and may modify the kinds, nature and extent of any
improvements or dedications required. The decision of the City Council shall be
final and upon making its decision, the City Clerk shall make a written report
of the outcome directly to the appealing party and to the various City
departments concerned.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.06.050   Deferral of improvements.
   Where the required public improvements, if constructed ahead of other
adjacent improvements, would, in the opinion of the City Engineer, cause a
safety hazard, maintenance problem, drainage problem or result in an
inconsistent or unreasonably short reach or section of improvements or if other
circumstances are present which preclude the construction of the required
improvements in a reasonable manner, then the City Engineer shall make a
finding of same and may defer the improvements for the period and under the
conditions specified in a written agreement prepared by the City Engineer and
executed by the owner of the real property upon which the improvement is
required. Such agreement shall be executed prior to the final approval or
issuance of the use or building permit. The City Engineer may require that the
agreement be guaranteed by the posting of securities in the amount and form he
deems necessary. Such agreements, after execution and acknowledgment, shall be
placed before the City Council for acceptance and shall then be recorded with
the County Recorder and their terms, conditions and requirements shall
thereafter run with the land.

thousand dollars, a surety bond may be posted for that amount exceeding five
thousand dollars as approved by the City Engineer.
   The cash sums are to bond for the excavation of the City right-of-way and to
guarantee that the work is done correctly and in conformance with City
standards and specifications.
   If the work is not performed as specified in the agreement or permit or not
completed, the City Engineer may cause any or all of the work to be done, and
shall deduct the costs of same, including expenses for overhead and
administration, from the cash bond amount. In addition, he may deduct from the
cash bond the necessary amount to cover inspection and other labor charges and
expenses incurred in the completion or repair of the work.
   No work shall be performed in a greater amount or quantity than that
specified in the application and described on the permit. No work for which a
permit has been issued shall be commenced unless the applicant or permittee has
notified the City Engineer twenty-four hours before commencing work, specifying
the day, hour and location at which the work will take place.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.07.040   Grades and lines.

16.07.050   Pipelines and underground facilities.
   A.    All underground facilities located or installed in public rights-of-
way in the City shall be constructed and maintained with a depth of cover
established by the City Engineer. The City Engineer may determine and require
in particular cases, that public safety or convenience requires that depths be
variable, facilities be concrete encased, that installations be by jacking,
boring and tunneling and the hours and days of work be restricted.
   B.    Whenever construction, reconstruction or maintenance work on any of
the public rights-of-way requires the change in grade or alignment of pipeline
or conduit, the same shall be immediately moved at the sole expense of the
permittee upon the request of the City Engineer.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).

then the applicant or owner may appeal to the City Council.
   C.    Limitations of Approval after the Vesting Map is Recorded.
      1.    If the final vesting map is recorded within the time limits set
forth in this section, the rights established by the vested map shall last for
an initial time period of one year.
      2.    The developer will have one year after the recording of the final
vesting map to apply for a building permit, and the Planning Commission may
extend that for one additional year to a total of two years.
      3.    The developer may apply for a one year extension at any time before
the initial time period set forth in subsection (C)(1) of this section,
expires. If the extension is denied, the subdivider may appeal that denial to
the City Council within fifteen days.

the life of the building permit, including any extension the Planning
Commission grants to the permit.

periods B and C of this section, expire, the vesting rights shall also expire
and the developer is then treated the same as if he or she were an ordinary
applicant without the rights accorded by the vesting map.
   E.    Denials. Notwithstanding Section
16.10.050 of this chapter, the City may condition or deny any permit, approval,
extension or entitlement if it determines any of the following:
      1.    A failure to do so would place the occupants of the subdivision or

safety, or both;
      2.    The condition or denial is required in order to comply with State
or Federal law.
   F.    Time Extension for Processing. The initial time period set forth in
subsection (C)(1) of this section shall automatically be extended by any time
used for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design
or architectural review, if such processing exceeds thirty days, from the date
a complete application is filed.

phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial
time period shall begin for each phase when the final vesting map for the phase
is recorded.

      1.    The time specified in subsection B of this section shall not
include any period of time during which a development moratorium, imposed after
approval of the vesting tentative map, is in existence; provided, however, that
the length of the moratorium does not exceed five years.
      2.    Once a moratorium is terminated, the vesting tentative map shall be
valid for the same period of time as was left to run on the map at the time
that the moratorium was imposed. In no case shall this time be less than one
hundred twenty days.
      3.    For the purpose of this chapter, a development moratorium shall
include actions which regulate land use, development or the provision of
services to the land which thereafter prevents, prohibits or delays the
approval of a vesting tract map or vesting parcel map.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.10.080   Inconsistent zoning.
   A.    Maps which are consistent with current zoning and/or General Plan
designations may be conditionally approved contingent upon concurrent
application for and approval of zone changes(s) and application for and
approval before the Planning Commission and the City Council. The consistency
shall be stated on the face of the map in bold letters. If the zoning and/or
General Plan is approved, terms of rights of the vesting map shall commence on
the approval date of the vesting map, and the approval date of the zoning or
General Plan approval shall not alter this date.
   B.    Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, a property owner or his
assignee may seek approvals or permits for development which depart from the
ordinances, policies and standards referenced in Section
16.10.050 of this chapter, and the City may grant these approvals or issue
these permits to the extent that the departures are authorized under applicable
law.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.10.090   Vesting tentative map amendments.
   A.    At any time prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map
pursuant to Section
16.10.070 of this chapter, the subdivider, or his assignee, may apply for an
amendment to the vesting tentative map.
   B.    In order to file for an amendment, the subdivider must bear the burden
of proof that a substantial change is warranted and that the amendment should
be granted.
      1.    "Substantial change" includes an adverse change in any of the
physical conditions within areas affected by the project including land, air,
water, mineral, flora, fauna, ambient noise and objects of historic or
aesthetic significance. An economic or soil change by itself shall not be
considered a significant effect on the environment. A social or economic change
related to a physical change may be considered in determining whether the
physical change is significant.
      2.    The substantial change however, shall not change or lengthen the
vesting period granted by Section
16.10.070 of this chapter.
(Ord. 2722 (part), 1990).
16.10.100   Compliance with local and State laws.
   A.    This chapter does not enlarge, diminish or alter the types of
conditions which may be imposed by the City on a development, nor in any way
diminish or alter the power of any local agency to protect against a condition
dangerous to the public health or safety.
   B.    The rights conferred by this chapter shall relate only to the
imposition by the City of conditions or requirements created and imposed by law
or ordinance. Nothing in this chapter removes, diminishes or affects the
obligation of any subdivider to comply with the conditions and requirements of
any State or Federal laws, regulations or policies and does not grant any local
agency the option to disregard any State or Federal laws, regulations or
policies.

of public or private improvements, or the compliance with any conditions, or

   C.    Fees for Lot Consolidations and Lot Line Adjustments. Prior to the
preparation of or approval of a Declaration of Covenant for the consolidation
of lots as specified in
Chapter 16.04, or the adjustment of lot lines, there shall be paid to and
collected by the City Engineer and he shall give his receipt therefor, a sum
which shall cover in full the expenses of the City Engineer for the
preparation, checking, review and recordation of any Declaration of Covenant,
or Lot Line Adjustment Certificate, which sum shall be paid prior to the
issuance of any permit or approval of any project on the lots or parcels being
consolidated or adjusted.
   D.    Special Projects. Due to complexity and/or size, other certain
projects, as determined by the City Engineer, may be treated the same as final

section. These special projects may include, but not be limited to: lot line
adjustments, lot consolidations, use permits, building permits or other
permits.
   E.    Engineering Fees. Each application for a public works permit shall be
accompanied by an issuance fee, no part of which shall be returned to the

expenses for inspection and checking the work covered by the permit.
   F.    Certificate of Compliance. Any person owning real property who
requests the preparation and issuance of a Certificate of Compliance, as
described in Section 66499.35 of the State Government Code (Subdivision Map
Act), shall first pay a fee in an amount which shall cover the full payment of
all costs incurred by the City Engineer or the Development Services Department
in preparing the Certificate and recordation of the Certificate. Such fee shall
be paid whether or not the outcome of the investigation and subsequent
Certificate finds that a lot, parcel or property was divided in accordance with
and complies with the provisions of Division 2 of Title 7 of the Government
Code (Subdivision Map Act), Titles 15 and 16 of this code, and other applicable
laws.
(Ord. 2723 § 1, 1990: Ord. 2230 § 1 (part), 1978).
Chapter 21.30
FEES FOR TRAFFIC IMPACT MITIGATION
Sections:
21.30.010   Purpose.
21.30.020   Fees imposed.
21.30.030   Definitions (reserved).
21.30.040   Collection of fees.
21.30.050   Use of funds.
21.30.010   Purpose.
   A.   The purpose of the traffic impact mitigation fee is to implement the
City's general plan growth management element, to ensure that new growth pays
its share of regional traffic mitigation and to implement the City's
circulation/transportation general plan element to improve, maintain and
regulate the network of highways, and streets, to ensure their safe and
efficient use. Adoption of a traffic impact mitigation fee by the City is
mandated by Measure "M," the county-wide traffic improvement and growth
management plan adopted by the voters on November 6, 1990 in order for the City
to remain eligible to receive one-half cent sales tax dollars for
transportation improvements.
   B.   The City Council has determined that there is a reasonable relationship
between new and/or expanded land uses in the city and needed traffic
improvements and that there is a reasonable relationship between the cost of
the needed traffic improvements and the new or expanded land uses as identified
in the City's traffic impact mitigation fee analysis.
(Ord. 2838 § 1 (part), 1993).
21.30.020   Fees imposed.
   A.   There is hereafter imposed upon the following land uses a fee for
traffic impact mitigation:
      1.   Every new residential unit (as defined in Section 15.04.410);
      2.   Every new office, commercial, industrial or institutional building;
      3.   Every newly expanded office, commercial, industrial or institutional
building, with the fee assessed for that portion of the building which has been
expanded.
   B.   Commencing immediately after the effective date of the ordinance
codified in this chapter, the fee levied against the land uses described above
shall be as determined by resolution of the City Council based on the City's
traffic impact mitigation fee analysis and any updates thereto, and shall be
reviewed on an annual basis.
(Ord. 2838 § 1 (part), 1993).
21.30.030   Definitions (reserved).
(Ord. 2838 § 1 (part), 1993).
21.30.040   Collection of fees.
   The fee imposed by this chapter shall be due and payable and shall be
collected by the Director of Development Services at the same time that fees
are paid to the City for the building permit for the construction of the land
uses described in this chapter. If such a building permit is denied, revoked or
surrendered without the construction of the land use for which it was charged,
the traffic impact mitigation fee shall be refunded.
(Ord. 2838 § 1 (part), 1993).
21.30.050   Use of funds.
   All fees imposed by this chapter shall be deposited into a traffic
mitigation fund. The funds collected shall be used for needed traffic
improvements identified in the City's capital improvement plan, the City's
general plan and the City's traffic mitigation fee analysis, and for no other
purpose.
(Ord. 2838 § 1 (part), 1993).
