Preface
   The Murrieta Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company
in 1995, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender and
Company, successor in interest to Book Publishing Company, and then American
Legal Publishing beginning in 2005.
   During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and
indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction
of A. Kay Vinson, city clerk.
   The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor
decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation
without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number
designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus,
Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, located in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. In most
instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine
vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions.
Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion.
   In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying
the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative
history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text
of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they
appear in the codification.
   A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific
code provisions by individual section numbers.
   This supplementation brings the code up to date through Ordinance 617-25,
passed April 15, 2025.

(Ord. 15 § 4, 1991)
1.08.050 Violation--Penalties.
   A.   Violation--Infraction. It is unlawful for any person to violate any
provision or to fail to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter or
the provisions of any ordinance or code adopted by reference by this chapter or
any provision of any ordinance of the city not included within this chapter.
Any person violating any of such provisions or failing to comply with any of
the mandatory requirements of this chapter or any ordinance or code adopted by
reference by this chapter or any other city ordinance shall be guilty of an
infraction, unless such violation is specifically designated as constituting a
misdemeanor. Each such person shall be guilty of a separate offense for each
and every day during any portion of which any violation of any provision of
this chapter, or any provision of any ordinance or code adopted by reference by
this chapter, or of any other city ordinance is committed, continued, or
permitted by such person, and may be punished accordingly.
   B.   Any provision or requirement of this chapter or otherwise as referred
to above, the violation of which or the failure to comply with which, is
designated as an infraction, shall be prosecutable as a misdemeanor upon a
third violation and each violation thereafter of the same provision by the same
individual. In addition, any such violation or failure to comply may be
prosecuted originally as a misdemeanor in the discretion of the city attorney
or any deputy district attorney, upon a showing by the enforcing agency of the
seriousness of the particular alleged violation.

made unlawful, it shall include causing, allowing, permitting, aiding,
abetting, suffering, or concealing the fact of such act or omission.
   D.   Establishment of Offenses as Infractions. Any violation expressly
declared to be punishable, in the discretion of the court, by either a fine, or
by a fine or imprisonment, or both, shall become an infraction for all purposes
under any of the following circumstances:
      1.   Where a judgment imposes a punishment of a fine not exceeding one
hundred dollars ($100.00) in the case of a first offense;
      2.   When the court grants probation to a defendant without the
imposition of a sentence and, at the time of granting probation, or on
application of the defendant or probation officer thereafter, the court
declares the offense to be an infraction; or
      3.   When the city attorney or any deputy district attorney files in a
court having jurisdiction over misdemeanor offenses a complaint specifying that
the offense is an infraction.
   E.   Punishments. Any person convicted of a misdemeanor under the provisions
of this chapter shall be punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00), or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not
exceeding six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.
   F.   Any person convicted of an infraction under the provisions of this
chapter shall be punishable for a first conviction by a fine of not more than
one hundred dollars ($100.00), for a second conviction within a period of one
year by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars ($200.00), and for a third

(Ord. 15 § 5, 1991)
1.08.060 County enactments to remain in effect.
   A.   All ordinances of the county which have been applicable within the
territory now incorporated as the city, to the extent that they applied before
incorporation, and which became ordinances of the city by virtue of the
adoption of Ordinance No. 1 of the city, as the same may have been thereafter
amended or repealed or superseded, are hereby ratified and readopted by this
reference as if fully set forth in this chapter, shall remain in full force and
effect as ordinances of the city.
   B.   Additionally, the resolutions, rules and regulations of the county
which have been so applicable in implementation of the aforesaid ordinances and
state law (such as, but not limited to, the California Environmental Quality
Act, regulations pertaining to traffic, the resolution establishing special
geologic study report zone in the California Oaks area), to the extent that
they applied before incorporation shall remain in full force and effect as
resolutions, rules and regulations, respectively, of the city, and which may be
amended or repealed in the future by any form of enactment (motion, resolution
or ordinance) deemed appropriate by the city council.
   C.   Unless otherwise provided in this chapter or in other enactments of the
city, the granting by the county of Riverside of approvals, permits, and
similar rights, which have not expired or otherwise been revoked or lost, are
recognized as remaining in effect, subject to the right of the city to fully
exercise its police power, and to take such further action as permitted or
reserved to the city by law by any form of enactment (motion, resolution or
ordinance) deemed appropriate by the city council.
   D.   This chapter shall not be construed as adopting the general plan of the
county.
(Ord. 15 § 6, 1991)
1.08.070 Declaration of intent.
   Certain provisions of the county enactments referred to in Sections
1.08.010 and
1.08.060 of this chapter reflect the county governmental structure and contain
references to officials, official titles, commissions, and other designations
which are not a part of the structure of this city's government. In order to
effectively and intelligently administer the county enactments to the extent
that they are continued in effect by this chapter, it is the purpose of this
chapter to provide for the substitution of the appropriate city official,
title, or designation in county enactments.
(Ord. 15 § 7, 1991)
1.08.080 Substitution of appropriate reference to city.
   A.   Whenever in the enactments of the county which are adopted by or
continued in effect by the city there is a reference to "board of supervisors,"
this reference shall be interpreted to mean the "city council of the city of
Murrieta."
   B.   Whenever in the enactments of the county which are adopted by or
continued in effect by the city there is a reference to an office, official
title, or other designation, the reference shall be interpreted to mean that
office, title, or designation in the governmental structure of the city, or if
there is none, any official or titleholder of the city who has been
specifically directed by the city council or the city manager to perform the
functions referred to or the duties imposed.
   C.   Whenever it is appropriate under the circumstances, and in the
enactments of the county of Riverside which are adopted by or continued in
effect by the city, there is a reference to the "County of Riverside,"
"county," or "unincorporated area," or "territory" of the county of Riverside,
such reference shall be interpreted to mean the "city of Murrieta."
   D.   Whenever in the enactments of the county of Riverside which are adopted
by or continued in effect by the city there is a reference to "planning
commission," "board of zoning adjustment," "board of appeals," "zoning
administrator," or any other person or body of the county where the context so
indicates, this reference shall be interpreted to mean the person or body of
the city of Murrieta or the person or body acting as the agent of the city of
Murrieta, as the context would indicate.
(Ord. 15 § 8, 1991)
1.08.090 Enforcement of continuing county ordinances.
   The enforcement of the county ordinances adopted or continuing in effect in
the incorporated area shall be by the city or by the appropriate officers,
persons or agencies thereof; provided, however, services of enforcement
furnished by the county or by appropriate persons, officers or agencies thereof
in accordance with Government Code Section 57384, or other applicable
enactments are recognized and allowed for.
(Ord. 15 § 9, 1991)
1.08.100 Declaration of facts constituting urgency.
   This chapter is an urgency ordinance and is for the immediate preservation
of public peace, health and safety. The facts constituting urgency are these:
pursuant to Section 57376 Government Code, county ordinances adopted pursuant
to the section shall remain in full force and effect until one hundred twenty
(120) days after incorporation. All county ordinances adopted by city Ordinance
No. 1 will thereafter be of no force and effect after October 28, 1991. Since
county ordinances and primary and secondary codes are being adopted by
reference in this chapter after notice and hearing, adoption hereof by a
regular ordinance which would not go into effect for thirty (30) days after
adoption would thereby necessarily leave a gap of time before the county
ordinances and primary and secondary codes could be effective, leaving wholly
inadequate health, safety and welfare regulations in force the city.

codes. The city council further finds that an appropriate method of enforcement
for minor violations is an administrative citation program as authorized by
Government Code Section 53069.4.

criminal, civil or any other legal remedy established by law which may be
pursued to address violations of the municipal code or applicable state codes.
   C.   The city council finds and determines that enforcement of the Murrieta
Municipal Code, other ordinances adopted by the city, conditions on
entitlements and terms and conditions of city agreements are matters of local
concern and serve important public purposes. Consistent with its powers as a
general law city, the city adopts this administrative citation program
provision in order to achieve the following goals:

refuse to comply with the provisions of the municipal code, ordinances,
agreements or terms and conditions on entitlements in the city;

responsible parties in the civil or criminal justice system.

   The city council of the city intends to secure compliance with the
provisions of this code. To the extent that such compliance may be achieved by
less drastic methods of enforcement, the following alternate, separate and
distinct methods may be utilized. Each method set forth herein is intended to
be mutually exclusive and does not prevent concurrent or consecutive methods
being used to achieve compliance against continuing violations. Each and every
day any such violations exist constitutes a separate offense. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this code, each violation of the provisions of this code
may be enforced alternatively as follows:
   A.   Infraction. Any person violating any of the provisions or failing to
comply with any of the mandatory requirements of this code may be prosecuted
for an infraction. Written citations for infractions may be issued by police
officers or nonsafety employees designated by
Section 1.28.020 of this code. Any person convicted of an infraction under the
provisions of this code shall be punishable either by fines as is specified in
the currently adopted Uniform Infraction Bail Schedule used by the Riverside
County Three Lakes Municipal Courts, or where no fine is specified therein by:
      1.   A fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a first
violation;
      2.   A fine not exceeding two hundred dollars ($200.00) for a second
violation of the same ordinance within one year;
      3.   A fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each
additional violation of the same ordinance within one year.
    B.   Misdemeanor. Any person violating any of the provisions or failing to
comply with any of the mandatory requirements of this code may be prosecuted
for a misdemeanor. Written citations for misdemeanors may be issued by police
officers or by nonsafety employees designated by
Section 1.28.020 of this code. Any person convicted of a misdemeanor under the
provisions of this code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or by
both such fine and imprisonment.
   C.   Civil Action. The city attorney, by and at the request of the city
council, may institute an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to
restrain, enjoin or abate the condition(s) found to be in violation of the
provisions of this code, as provided by law.
   D.   Administrative Citation. Upon a finding by the city official vested
with the authority to enforce the various provisions of this code that a
violation exists, he or she may issue an administrative citation under the

1.32.030 Establishment of offenses as infractions.
   Any violation expressly declared to be punishable, in the discretion of the

infraction for all purposes under any of the following circumstances:
   A.   Where a judgement imposes a punishment of a fine not exceeding one
hundred dollars ($100.00) in the case of a first offense;
   B.   When the court grants probation to a defendant without the imposition
of a sentence and, at the time of granting probation, or on application of the
defendant or probation officer thereafter, the court declares the offense to be
an infraction; or
   C.   When the city attorney or any deputy district attorney files in a court
having jurisdiction over misdemeanor offenses a complaint specifying that the
offense is an infraction.

   The prevailing party in any action, administrative proceeding, or special
proceeding to abate a public nuisance, or in any appeal or other judicial
action arising therefrom, shall be entitled to recover its reasonable
attorneys' fees. Recovery of attorneys' fees shall be limited to those actions
or proceedings in which the city elects, at the initiation of that individual
action or proceeding, to seek recovery of its own attorneys' fees. In no action
or proceeding shall an award of attorneys' fees to a prevailing party exceed
the amount of reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the city in the action or
proceeding.
(Ord. 608-24 § 3, 2024; Ord. 299 § 1, 2004)
1.32.060 Civil penalties.
   A.   The council finds that there is a need for alternative methods of
enforcement of the Murrieta Municipal Code and applicable state codes in
addition to the penalties provided by Section
1.32.010. The council further finds that the assessment of civil penalties is a
necessary alternative method of code enforcement. The administrative assessment
of civil penalties established in this section is in addition to any other
remedies established by law which may be pursued to address Municipal Code or
state law violations.
   B.   Civil penalties may be assessed against a responsible party for
continued violations of the municipal code or applicable state codes, whether
of the same section or any combination, that reflect a continuing disregard for
the requirements of such laws. The chief of police or his or her designee may
issue a notice and order to the responsible party assessing a civil penalty
pursuant to this section. The civil penalty may be enforced as a lien pursuant
to subsection (D) of this section.
   C.   Civil penalties may be assessed at a daily rate not to exceed $1,000
per violation per day, and not to exceed a total of $100,000 per tax assessor's
parcel number, in the case of unimproved real property, or $100,000 per each
structure against which violations have existed on a single tax assessor's
parcel number for any related series of violations. In determining the amount
to be imposed on a daily rate, the chief of police or his or her designee shall
consider the following factors:
      1.   Duration of the violation.
      2.   Frequency or occurrence of the violation or other similar
violations.
      3.   Seriousness of the violation in relation to its threat or impact
upon public health, welfare, or safety.
      4.   History of violations.
      5.   Activity taken by the responsible party to obstruct or interfere
with correction of the violation.
      6.   Good faith or bad faith efforts by responsible party to comply.
      7.   The impact of the violation on the surrounding property and
community.
      8.   The financial ability of the responsible party to have corrected the
violation in a timely fashion.
   D.   Civil penalties, as confirmed by resolution of the city council, shall
constitute a special assessment against the property to which it relates, and
after its recording, as thus made and confirmed, the same shall constitute a
lien on the property in the amount of such assessment. After the confirmation
of the statement, a copy thereof shall be recorded in the official records of
Riverside County and shall be transmitted to the assessor and tax collector of
the county by the city clerk. Whereupon it shall be the duty of the assessor
and tax collector to add the amount of such assessment, or assessments, to the
next regular bills of taxes levied against the said respective lot or parcel of
land, and thereafter the amount shall be collected at the same time and in the
same manner as ordinary real property taxes are collected, and shall be subject
to the same penalties and the same procedure for foreclosure and sale in the
case of delinquency as provided for ordinary real property taxes.
   E.   Appeals. Within ten (10) days from the date of giving written notice of
the imposition of civil penalties, the violator may file an appeal to the city
manager. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall identify the property
subject to the notice of civil penalties. The city manager shall then appoint a
hearing officer to hear the appeal. The hearing officer must hear the appeal
within twenty (20) days from the filing of the notice of appeal by the violator
or at such later date as may be mutually agreed to in writing by the appellant
and the city manager. Notice of the date of hearing shall be given in writing.
The date of the hearing shall be no sooner than five (5) days from the date
when notice of the hearing is given to the appellant and to the code
enforcement officer. The decision of the hearing officer shall be final.

2.05.010 Purpose and intent.
   High costs and large campaign contributions associated with campaigns for
local elective office can undermine the public's trust and confidence in the
electoral process. It is the intent of this chapter to promote the small town
atmosphere of local elections consistent with community values by implementing
campaign finance reforms including mandatory contribution limits and an
effective enforcement mechanism.
   In furtherance of those goals, a reasonable campaign contribution limitation
is hereby enacted that are similar to those enacted by other comparable
communities. In those communities, such limitations have not inhibited city
council candidates' ability to conduct meaningful and effective campaigns or
members of the public to meaningfully participate in campaigns as expressed in
the form of campaign contributions, but they have limited the appearance and
incidents of corruption that have been experienced.
   The council finds that the city may enact an ordinance limiting campaign
contributions in municipal elections as provided by Section 10202 of the
Elections Code of the state. Further, pursuant to Section 81013 of the
Government Code of the state, it is determined that the additional requirements
imposed by this chapter do not preclude any person from complying with the
Political Reform Act of 1974, being California Government Code Sections 81000 -
81016. (Ord. 502 § 2, 2014; Ord. 231 § 1 (part), 2001)
2.05.020 Relation to Political Reform Act of 1974.

Government Code and its implementing regulations. Unless otherwise defined in
this chapter, words and phrases have the same meanings here as those given to
them by Title 9 of the California Government Code, and as the same may be

interrupted if the normal procedure were followed. All emergency purchases,
which would otherwise require formal bidding procedures, made pursuant to this
section shall be submitted to the city council for ratification at the next
regular council meeting after the purchase is authorized;

arrangement, or agreement as allowed by law, provided the city council, city
manager, or purchasing agent, at their prescribed authorization levels within
this chapter, determines that participation is in the city's best interests and

3.08.300 Surplus supplies and equipment.
   The purchasing agent, or his or her designee, must be contacted when city
personal property (supplies and equipment) has been deemed excess, obsolete,
worn out, no longer usable, or no longer needed by the city, except as provided
otherwise in this section. Surplus property disposal forms are to be completed
to facilitate transfer of the city property for proper disposal. The city
manager or designee will determine the best avenue for disposal, for the
benefit of the city. Such avenues include, but are not limited to, the
following:
   A.   Sale. For city property deemed suitable for sale, city manager or
designee may offer the city property for sale via the following approved
methods:
      1.   Public Auction. Surplus property may be sold at public auction.
Online auctions are an acceptable auction method. City may contract with a
professional auctioneer, at its discretion.
      2.   Sealed Bids. Sealed bids may be solicited for the sale of surplus
property. Surplus property disposed of in this manner shall be sold to the
highest responsible bidder.
      3.   Selling for Scrap. Surplus property may be sold as scrap if it is
deemed that the value of the raw materials exceeds the value of the property as
a whole.
      4.   Negotiated Sale. Surplus property may be sold outright if it is
determined that only one known buyer is available or interested in acquiring
the property. Advertisement of the sale must be published in a newspaper for at
least two weeks prior to the negotiated sale to ensure no other interested
buyers are available.
   A receipt or other proof of disposal from the outright sale, the contracted
auctioneer, licensed scrap dealer, individual buyer, etc. is required and is to
be forwarded to the Finance Department. City will return proceeds to the
appropriate revenue fund.
   All surplus property is for sale “as is” and “where is”, with no warranty,
guarantee, or representation of any kind, express or implied, as to the
condition, utility or usability of the property offered for sale.
   B.   Trade-in. Property declared as surplus may be offered as a trade-in for
credit toward the acquisition of new property.
   C.   Donation. With the approval of the city manager or designee, the city
may donate usable items with a minimal fair market value (such as outdated
computer equipment and furniture) to a registered charitable organization or
community organization. Surplus property may also be donated to any other
public agency or charitable organization exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code. “Public agency” means the State of California or any
agency or subdivision thereof, including any city, county, special district, or
school district. A letter from the public agency or organization, acknowledging
receipt of the asset(s), is required.
   D.   Return to Manufacturer. Surplus property may, when possible, be
returned to the manufacturer for buy-back or credit toward the purchase of new
property. Documentation related to such a transaction shall be forwarded to the
Finance Department.
   E.   Disposal. When the cost of locating a buyer exceeds the estimated sales
price of surplus property, the property may be recycled, destroyed, or disposed
of as junk.

measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of

requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in

manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part

The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such
charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to

Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the

in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections
referring to the exterior boundaries of the state of California, where the

respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible
personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such
sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the state
under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code,

consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by

purposes:
   A.   To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the
provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1 .7 of Division 2 which
authorizes the city to adopt this tax ordinance which shall be operative if a
majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition
of the tax at an election called for that purpose.

provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of
California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the
requirements and limitations contained in Part 1 .6 of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code.
   C.   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax
and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by the
California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in a manner that adapts
itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation
from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the
California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in administering and
collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes.
   D.   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of Part 1 .6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes,
and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons
subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 540 § 1, 2018)

   Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the California

(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 3.24.010)
3.24.020 Definitions.
   Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this
section shall govern the construction of this chapter:
   "Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is
occupied or intended or designed for use or occupancy by transients, including
but not limited to dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any
hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging
house, roominghouse, apartment house, timeshare project or facility, dormitory,
public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed location, or
other similar structure or portion thereof, duplex, triplex, single- family
dwelling units except any private dwelling house or other individually owned
single-family dwelling house unit rented only occasionally (infrequently) and
incidentally to the normal occupancy by the owner or his or her family;
provided that the burden of establishing that the housing or facility is a
hotel as defined herein shall be upon the owner or operator thereof who shall
file with the tax administrator such information as the tax administrator may
require, to establish and maintain such status.
   "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right or entitlement to the
use or possession, of any hotel, room, rooms or any portion thereof offered for
rent to be used or occupied for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes
regardless of the purpose for which such rooms are rented or provided.
   "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel whether in the
capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee,
timeshare project or facility manager or operator, or in any other capacity.
Where the operator performs his or her or its functions through a managing
agent of any type or character, the managing agent shall also be deemed an
operator for the purpose of this chapter, and shall have jointly and severally
the same duties and liabilities as the principal. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall,
however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or
any other group or combination acting as a unit.
   "Rent" means the amount of the consideration charged or chargeable to the
tenant or person entitled to occupancy, for the occupancy of space, valued in
money whether received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including the full
value of receipts, cash, credits, property or services of any kind or nature,
without any deduction whatsoever. "Rent" may have been, or may be in part,
payable or paid prior to or following (in whole or in part) the occupancy to
which it is attributable, and may have been paid in whole or in part in advance
on a long-term basis, such as in a time- share project or similar arrangement.
It is not the intent of this subsection to make the operator liable for the tax
on uncollected rent. However, uncollected rent must be reported.
   "Tax administrator" means the city manager or his or her designated agent,
whether a city employee or county officer or employee.
   "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to
occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, or other
agreement of whatever nature, for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar
days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any person so
occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient if his or her
actual total period of occupancy does not exceed thirty (30) days. Unless day
of occupancy or entitlement to occupancy by one person are consecutive without
any break, then prior or subsequent periods of such occupancy or entitlement to
occupancy shall not be counted when determining whether a period exceeds the
stated thirty (30) calendar days. (Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code §
3.24.020)
3.24.030 Tax imposed.
   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to,
and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent of the rent charged by the
operator or otherwise payable by the transient. Insofar as the transient is
concerned, the tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the operator or
to the city. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the
tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the
transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If the tax is not paid to the
hotel operator, the tax administrator may require payment directly to him or
her. (Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 3.24.030)
3.24.040 Exemptions.
   A.   No tax shall be imposed upon:
      1.   Any person as to whom or any occupancy as to which it is beyond the
power of the city to impose the tax provided in this chapter;
      2.   Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by
reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.
   B.   No exemptions shall be granted except upon a written claim therefor
made at the time the rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form
prescribed by the tax administrator. Federal, state and local officers and
employees are not exempt.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 3.24.040)

necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he or she may require
further information in the return. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to
this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until

3.24.100 Delinquency.
   Any operator who fails to remit any tax to the city or any amount of tax
required to be collected and remitted to the city including amounts based on
determination made by the tax administrator under
Section 3.24.120 of this chapter, within the time required, shall pay a penalty
of ten percent of the tax or amount of the tax in addition to the tax or amount
of tax plus interest at the rate of one-half percent per month, or fraction

addition to the penalties stated in
Section 3.24.100 of this chapter.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 3.24.110)
3.24.120 Failure to collect and report tax--Determination of tax administrator.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed
in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on
which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax
administrator procures such facts and information as he or she is able to
obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by the chapter
payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and make
such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and assess
against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this
chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a
notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it
in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so
assessed at his or her last known address. Such operator may within ten days
after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the
tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the
operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax,
interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall
become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such
application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days
written notice in the manner prescribed in this chapter to the operator to show
cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein
should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the
operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and
penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator
shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written
notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of the determination and
the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due
shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided
in Section
3.24.130 of this chapter. (Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 3.24.120)
3.24.130 Appeal.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect
to the amount of any tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen
(15) days of serving of the assessment or determination of tax and penalties,
if any, due. The city council shall fix a time and place for hearing the
appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to the operator at his
or her last known address. The findings of the city council shall be final and
conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed
above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be
immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 3 § 1 (part),
1991: prior code § 3.24.130)
3.24.140 Records.
   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and
remittance to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve,
in the city, for a period of three years, records in such form as the tax
administrator may require to determine the amount of such tax. The tax
administrator shall have the right to inspect such records at all reasonable
times and may subpoena the records of any operator who refuses to make them
available for examination.

or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections B and C of this section, provided a claim in writing therefor,
stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is
founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of
payment. The claims shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator.
   B.   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a
credit shall be allowed unless the amount of tax so collected has either been
refunded to the person or credited to rent subsequently payable by the person
to the operator.
   C.   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than
once erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a
claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the
tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the
transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction
of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund
from the operator who collected the tax.
   D.   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the
claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records. (Ord. 3 § 1
(part), 1991: prior code § 3.24.150)

relating to occupancy tax or any rule or regulation of the tax administrator
relating to occupancy tax prescribed and adopted under this chapter, the tax
administrator upon hearing, after giving the operator ten days' notice in
writing specifying the time and place of hearing and requiring him or her to
show cause why his or her permit or permits should not be revoked, may suspend
or revoke any or more of the permits held by the operator. The tax
administrator shall give to the operator written notice of the suspension or
revocation of any of his or her permits. The notices required in this chapter
may be served personally or by mail in the manner prescribed for service of
notice of a deficiency determination. The tax administrator shall not issue a
new permit after the revocation of a permit unless he or she is satisfied that
the former holder of the permit will comply with the provisions of this chapter
relating to the occupancy tax and regulations of the tax administrator. (Ord. 3
§ 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 3.24.160)

3.24.180 Recording certificate--Lien.
   If any amount required to be remitted or paid to the city under this chapter
is not remitted or paid when due, the tax administrator may, within three years
after the amount is due, file for record in the office of the county recorder a
certificate specifying the amount of tax, penalties and interest due, the name
and address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the
operator liable for the same and the fact that the tax administrator has
complied with all provisions of this chapter in the determination of the amount

otherwise discharged. (Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 3.24.180)

this chapter with penalties and interest shall be satisfied first in any of the
following cases:
      1.   Whenever the person is insolvent;
      2.   Whenever the person makes a voluntary assignment of his or her
assets;
      3.   Whenever the estate of the person in the hands of executors,
administrators, or heirs is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the
deceased;
      4.   Whenever the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or
absent person required to pay any amount under this chapter are levied upon by
process law. This chapter does not give the city a preference over any recorded
lien which is attached prior to the date when the amounts required to be paid
became a lien.
   B.   The preference given to the city by this section shall be subordinate
to the preferences given to claims for personal services by Sections 1204 and
1206 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code §
3.24.190)

   At any time within three years after any operator is delinquent in the
remittance or payment of any amount required in this chapter to be remitted or
paid or within three years after the last recording of a certificate under
Section 3.24.160 of this chapter, the tax administrator may issue a warrant for
the enforcement of any liens and for the collection of any amount required to
be paid to the city under this chapter. The warrant shall be directed to any
sheriff, marshal, or constable and shall have the same effect as a writ of
execution. The warrant shall be levied and sale made pursuant to it in the same
manner with the same effect as a levy of and a sale pursuant to a writ of

on account of the seizure and sale. Any seizure made to collect occupancy taxes
due shall be only of property of the operator not exempt from execution under
the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.

   If any operator liable for any amount under this chapter sells out his or
her business or quits the business, his or her successor or assigns shall
withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former

a certificate, or within sixty (60) days from the date the former owner's
records are made available for audit, whichever period expires later, but in

administrator shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the
purchaser at his or her address as it appears on the records of the tax
administrator of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the
certificate. Failure of the tax administrator to mail the notice will release
the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold purchase price as above

obligation became due, give notice thereof personally or by registered mail to
all persons, including the state or any political subdivision thereof, having
in their possession or under their control any credits or other personal
property belonging to the taxpayer. After receiving the withholding notice, the
person so notified shall make no disposition of the taxpayer's credits, other
personal property or debts until the city consents to a transfer or disposition
or until sixty (60) days elapse after the receipt of the notice, whichever
expires earlier. All persons, upon receipt of the notice, shall advise the city
immediately of all such credits, other personal property or debts in their
possession, under their control or owing by them. If such notice seeks to
prevent the transfer or other disposition of a deposit in a bank or other
credits or personal property in the possession or under the control of the
bank, to be effective the notice shall be delivered or mailed to the branch or
office of such bank at which such deposit is carried or at which such credits
or personal property is held. If any person so notified makes transfer or
disposition of the property or debts required to be held hereunder during the
effective period of the notice to withhold, he or she shall be liable to the
city to the extent of the value of the release up to the amount of the
indebtedness owed by the taxpayer to the city. (Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior

guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person required to make, render, sign or verify
any report or claim who wilfully makes any false or fraudulent report or claim
with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by
this chapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 3.24.260)
3.24.270 Extension of time.
   The tax administrator, for good cause, may extend for not to exceed one
month the time for making any return or paying any amount required to be paid
under this chapter. The extension may be granted at any time, provided a
request therefore is filed with the tax administrator within or prior to the
period for which the extension may be granted. Any person to whom an extension

   Such applications shall not be filed unless the applicant is a qualified
organization which has owned or leased property, or has property whose use is
donated to it within the city of Murrieta that was used by the applicant for
the performance of the purposes for which it is organized, for at least 12
months immediately preceding the filing of such application, and the property
upon which the bingo game is to be conducted is property so owned or leased by,
or whose use is donated to, the applicant.
(Ord. 356 § 5, 2006)
5.02.050 Term of license and fees.

(Ord. 356 § 8, 2006)
5.02.080 Limitations.
   A.   A qualified organization shall conduct a bingo game only on property
owned or leased by it, or on property whose use is donated to such
organization, and which property is used by such organization for an office or
for the performance of the purposes for which the organization is organized.
Nothing in this subsection A. shall be construed to require that the property
owned or leased by, or whose use is donated to, the organization be used or
leased exclusively by, or donated exclusively to, such organization.
   B.   No minors shall be allowed to participate in any bingo game.
   C.   All bingo games shall be open to the public, not just to the members of
the qualified organization.
   D.   A bingo game shall be operated and staffed only by members of the
qualified organization which organized it. Only the organization authorized to
conduct a bingo game shall operate such game or participate in the promotion,
supervision or any other phase of such game. Such organization shall have
written policies incorporated in its constitution, articles, by-laws or other
regulations setting forth the manner in which a person may become a member of
the organization, and absent any such written policies, it shall be presumed
that the organization has no members who may operate and staff a bingo game
and, consequently, no license will be issued. This subsection D. does not
preclude the employment of security personnel, who are not members of the
qualified organization, at a bingo game by the organization conducting the
game.
   E.   No person shall receive or pay a profit, wage, salary or percentage
from any bingo game authorized by this chapter.
   F.   No individual, corporation, partnership or other legal entity except
the organization authorized to conduct a game shall hold a financial interest

   G.   With respect to organizations exempt from payment of the bank and
corporation tax by Section 23701(d) of the Revenue and Taxation Code, all
profits derived from a bingo game shall be kept in a special fund or account
and shall not be commingled with any other fund or account. Such profits shall
be used only for charitable purposes, that is, for the purposes for which such
organizations are organized pursuant to their articles of incorporation or for
purposes clearly incidental thereto. With respect to other organizations
authorized to conduct bingo games pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
all proceeds derived from a bingo game shall be kept in a special fund and
account and shall not be commingled with any other fund or account. Such
proceeds shall be distributed to organizations that are tax exempt under
Section 23701(d) of the Revenue and Taxation Code, to be used for charitable
purposes as above defined, except as follows:
      1.   Such proceeds may be used for prizes.
      2.   A portion of such proceeds, not to exceed 20 percent of the proceeds
before the deduction of prizes or two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per month,
whichever is less, may be used for rental of property, overhead, including the
purchase of bingo equipment, administrative expenses, security equipment and
security personnel. The licensee shall keep full and complete accounting
records supported by properly executed contracts, leases, receipts, and other
related documents which pertain to all monies, or other forms of income,
collected in connection with the conduct of any of its bingo games, disbursed
for expenditures in connection therewith and remaining or distributed for
charitable purposes. Such records shall be clearly identified and readily
accessible. Officials of the city of Murrieta shall have the right to examine
and audit such records at any reasonable time, and the licensee shall fully
cooperate with such officials by making such records available. At the end of
any month during which any bingo game is conducted, the licensee shall file
with the Murrieta police department a full and complete financial statement of
all monies collected and disbursed and the amount remaining or distributed for
charitable purposes.
      3.   Such proceeds may be used to pay license fees.
   H.   No person shall be allowed to participate in a bingo game unless the
person is physically present at the time and place in which the bingo game is
being conducted.
   I.   The total value of prizes awarded during the conduct of any bingo games
shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) in cash or kind, or both,
for each separate game which is held.

location while the game of bingo is being played by any of the operators,
managers, board members or players.

peace officer for inspection at all times during any bingo game or during
licensee's normal business hours.
(Ord. 356 § 10, 2006)
5.02.100 Denial of application, license, suspension or revocation.
   A.   The chief of police may deny an application for a bingo license, if he
or she finds:
      1.   That the applicant does not fulfill the specific requirements for
such license as set forth in this chapter; or
      2.   That the applicant, or any agent or representative thereof, has
knowingly made any false, misleading or fraudulent statement of a material fact
in the application or any document in connection therewith; or
   B.   The chief of police may suspend or revoke a license if they find:
      1.   That the licensee has, or any of its members have, violated any of
the provisions of this chapter; or
      2.   That the bingo games will not comport with the public welfare for
any reason or that the same have been conducted in an illegal, improper or
disorderly manner, or in a manner substantially different from that described
in the application, or for any reason for which the license application could
have been denied.
   C.   If, after an investigation, the chief of police, or his or her
designee, determines that a bingo license should be suspended or revoked or
that an application for such license be denied, they shall prepare a notice of
suspension or revocation or denial of application setting forth the reasons for
such suspension, revocation or denial. Such notice shall be served personally
on the licensee or applicant or sent by registered or certified mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested to the licensee's or applicant's last address
as provided in the application.
   D.   Any organization whose bingo license has been revoked may not apply for
a license to conduct any bingo games for a period of one year from the date
notice of such revocation was served on it, or if affirmed on appeal by the
Murrieta city council as provided in this section, from the date of such
affirmation; provided, however, if the reason for revocation is cancellation of
the exemption granted under Section 23701(a), 23701(b), 23701(d), 23701(e),
23701(f), 23701(g) and 23701(l) of the Revenue and Taxation Code, such

such exemption.
(Ord. 356 § 11, 2006)
5.02.110 Appeal.
   Any person who has had an application for a bingo license denied by the
chief of police, or who has had a bingo license suspended or revoked by the
police department, may appeal the decision of the police department by filing
with the city clerk, within 15 days after the date of such decision, a written
notice of appeal briefly setting forth the reasons why such denial, suspension
or revocation is not proper. The city council shall give written notice of the
time and place of the hearing to the appellant. Such appeal shall be heard by
the city council which may affirm, amend or reverse the decision or take such
other action as it deems appropriate. In conducting the hearing, the city
council shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence.
(Ord. 356 § 12, 2006)
5.02.120 Severability.
   If any provision, clause, sentence or paragraph of this chapter or the
application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be held invalid, such

provisions of this chapter which can be given effect without the invalid
provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are
hereby declared to be severable.

(Ord. 466 § 1, 2011: Ord. 447 § 1, 2010: Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code §
5.02.001)
5.04.020 Licenses required.
   There is imposed, upon each business conducted within the city, a business
license fee in the amount hereinafter prescribed. It is unlawful for any person
to conduct any business within the city without first having procured a license
from the city to do so and paid the license fee therefor and without complying
with all applicable provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.003)
5.04.030 Evidence of doing business.
   When any person by use of signs, circulars, cards, telephone book, or
newspapers, advertises, holds out, or represents that such person is conducting
a business within the city, or when any person holds an active license or
permit issued by a governmental agency indicating that such person is in
business within the city, and such person fails to deny by a sworn statement
given to the business license officer that he or she is not conducting a
business within the city, after being requested to do so by the business
license officer, then the foregoing facts shall be considered prima facie
evidence that such person is conducting a business within the city. (Ord. 3 § 1
(part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.005)
5.04.040 Fixing of business license fees.
   The city council from time to time shall set business license fees and
related application and other administrative fees by resolution. The city
council may differentiate in the amount of fees to be charged on the basis of
gross receipts and may utilize the business categories established by
Section 5.04.370 to differentiate between businesses as to the basis of the
business license fee which will be charged. When it deems such action to be
appropriate, the city council may establish flat-rate business license fees for
specific types of businesses or units thereof.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.007)
5.04.050 Schedule of license fees generally.
   A.   Every person who engages in business within the city shall pay a
license fee in the amount or at the rate which the city council may from time
to time set by resolution.

license fee prior to conducting business within the city if such requirement
conflicts with applicable state or federal law.

within the city because of conflict with applicable state or federal law shall
nevertheless obtain a business license upon the commencement of business within
the city.
   D.   Any person claiming exemption pursuant to this section shall file a
sworn statement with the business license officer, stating the facts upon which
exemption is claimed.

section. Issuance under this subsection shall be without payment to the city of
any license fee required by this chapter.
   F.   The business license officer, after giving notice and reasonable
opportunity for hearing to the affected licensee, may revoke any license
granted pursuant to the provisions of this section upon a showing that the
licensee is not entitled to the exemption as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.009)
5.04.060 Charitable activities exemption.
   A business license shall be issued but the provisions of this section shall
not be deemed or construed to require the payment of a business license fee:
   A.   For conducting any business by any nonprofit institution, corporation,
organization, or association organized or conducted for nonprofit purposes
only, when the receipts derived are to be used wholly for the benefit of the
organization, and, except for wages paid to employees of such organization, not
in whole or part for the private gain of any person. The exemption provided for
in this section shall not apply to promoters employed by the nonprofit
institutions, corporations, organizations or associations. 
   B.   For conducting any entertainment, concert, exhibition or lecture on
scientific, historical, literary, religious or moral subjects, whenever the
receipts thereof are to be distributed to any church or school or to any
religious or benevolent purpose within the city.
   C.   For conducting any entertainment, dance, concert, exhibition or lecture
by any religious, charitable, fraternal, educational, military, state, county,
or municipal organization or association whenever the receipts thereof are to
be for the purpose and objects for which such organization or association was
formed, and from which profit is not derived either directly or indirectly by
any person. This provision also applies to the Murrieta chamber of commerce.
   D.   By any business which is exempt from payment of the business license
fee to municipal corporations under, on account, or by virtue of the provisions
of the constitution or laws of the United States of America or of the state of
California.
   E.   Any disabled veteran having honorable discharge papers showing
disability incurred while in service who is unable to earn a livelihood by
manual labor, who is a qualified elector of this city at the time of the
application for a license and who shall have been a bona fide resident of this
city for thirty (30) days immediately preceding the date on which application
for such license is made shall be exempt from the business license fee. This
exemption applies to the veteran personally and shall not apply to a
distributing or other business conducted by such veteran in which others are
employed.
   F.   By any person furnishing full or part time day care service to not more
than fourteen children.
   G.   When a business, otherwise exempt pursuant to this section, is
conducted by a nonexempt person on behalf of such business, the exemption shall
be applicable only with regard to the exempt business, and shall not be
applicable with regard to the business or gross receipts of the nonexempt
person.
   H.   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to exempt any person from
complying with other provisions of this code, or any other law or regulation
requiring a permit or other approval from the city council, or any other public
officer or body to conduct any business.
(Ord. 557 § 2, 2020; Ord. 279 § 1 (part), 2003; Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior
code § 5.02.011)
5.04.070 Filing for exemptions.
   A.   Any person claiming an exemption from licensure requirements under this
chapter shall file a sworn statement with the business license officer stating
the facts upon which exemption is claimed. In the absence of such a statement
substantiating the claim, such person shall be liable for the payment of the
fees imposed by this chapter.
   B.   The business license officer shall, upon a proper showing contained in
the sworn statement, and in such supplement thereto as may be required by the
business license officer, issue a license to the person claiming exemption
under this section without payment to the city of the license fee required in
this chapter.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.013)
5.04.080 Fee adjustments required in cases of interstate commerce.
   A.   None of the license fees provided for in this chapter shall be so
applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative
of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Constitution of the
United States or of the state.
   B.   In any case where a license fee is believed by a licensee or applicant
for a license to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative
of such constitutional clauses, such person may apply to the business license
officer for an adjustment of the fee. Such application may be made before, at
the time of, or within six months after, payment of the prescribed license fee.
The applicant or licensee shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony,
show his or her method of business and the gross receipts or estimated gross
receipts of such business and such other information as the business license
officer may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of undue
burden or violation. The business license officer may then conduct an
investigation, and fix as the license fee for the applicant or licensee an
amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory. If the license fee has already
been paid, the business license officer shall order a refund of the amount over
and above the license fee so fixed. In fixing the license fee to be charged,
the business license officer shall have the power to base the license fee upon
any measure which will assure that the license fee assessed shall be uniform
with that assessed upon businesses of like nature. Any adjusted fee fixed
pursuant to this section shall not exceed the license fee prescribed for
similar businesses as to which no adjustment has been made pursuant to this
section.
   C.   The business license officer may require the applicant or licensee to
submit, either at the time of termination of the applicant's or licensee's
business in the city, or at the end of each three-month or longer period, a
sworn statement of the gross receipts from sources within the city upon which
the license fee adjustment has been based; provided that no additional license
fee during any one licensing year shall be required after the licensee shall
have paid an amount equal to the annual license fee prescribed for businesses
as to which no adjustment has been made pursuant to this section. (Ord. 3 § 1
(part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.015)
5.04.090 Payment of other licenses not excused.
   Any person required to pay a license fee for conducting a business under
this chapter shall not be relieved from the payment of any license fee for the
privilege of conducting such business required under any other provision of
this code or any other ordinance or regulation of the city or other agency, and
such person shall remain subject to such other provisions.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.017)
5.04.100 Effect of chapter on past actions and obligations previously accrued.
   Unless otherwise specifically or by necessary implication provided in this
chapter, neither the adoption of this chapter nor its superseding of any
portion of any other ordinance of the city shall in any manner be construed to
affect prosecution for the violation of any other ordinance committed prior to
the adoption hereof, nor be construed as a waiver of any license requirement or
any penal provision applicable to any such violation, nor be construed to
affect the validity of any bond or cash deposit required by any ordinance to be
posted, filed or deposited, and all rights and obligations thereunto
appertaining shall continue in full force and effect for the term prescribed
therein.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.019)
5.04.110 Separate computation of license fee.
   A.   Where a license fee is imposed upon any business pursuant to this
chapter, and such business is conducted with branch establishments or at
separate fixed places, the fee shall be computed as if each such branch or
place were a separate and independent business.
   B.   A separate license shall be obtained for each branch establishment or
location of the business and for each separate type of business at the same
location. Each license shall authorize the licensee to transact and carry on
only the business licensed thereby, at the location specified in the license,
and in the manner designated in such license.
   C.   Warehouses and distributing plants used in connection with and
incidental to a business shall be deemed to be separate places of business or
branch establishments.
(Ord. 279 § 1 (part), 2003; Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.021)
5.04.120 Business classifiable under different categories.
   Whenever a business may reasonably be classified under two or more separate
categories established by the city council, with differing bases for fee
computation, the fee shall be computed using the basis which will result in the
highest fee.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.023)
5.04.130 License does not permit business otherwise prohibited.
   Persons required to pay a license fee for transacting and carrying on any
business under this chapter shall not be relieved from the payment of any fees
for the privilege of carrying on any similar or related activity required under
any other ordinance of the city and shall remain subject to the regulatory
provisions of other ordinances and laws.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.025)
5.04.140 Other agency review.
   The business license officer may refer to any governmental agency any
statement and all other information submitted by persons subject to the
provisions of this chapter in connection with the conduct of a business
regulated or supervised or otherwise the concern of any such agency, including
agencies concerned with health regulations, zoning conformance, fire safety,
police considerations, or any other safeguard of the public interest. Failure
to comply with conditions required by other agency review shall result in
revocation of the license once granted.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.027)
5.04.145 Police review.
   A.   Certain business practices have historically been subject to abuse by
certain unscrupulous practioners and convicted criminals using the practice to
commit fraud, larceny and other criminal acts upon clients. It is the purpose
of this section to regulate the practice in such a manner as to reduce the risk
of fraud and larceny to clients, while allowing businesses to provide their
services to clients with only minimal restrictions.
   B.   The chief of police has the discretion to require police background
checks for certain business practices. The fee for this background check will
be established by the city council and set by resolution.
   C.   Upon filing of the business license application and payment of the
applicable fees, the police department will investigate, report and recommend
approval of the license. The investigation shall be conducted to verify the
facts contained in the application and any supporting data. The investigation
shall be completed and a report and recommendation made in writing to the
business license officer within thirty (30) days after the filing of the
application and contacting the Murrieta police department support division
supervisor for a background investigation interview, unless the applicant
requests or consents to an extension of the time period. If the report
recommends denial of the permit to the applicant, the grounds for the
recommended denial shall be set forth therein.
(Ord. 279 § 2 (part), 2003)
5.04.150 Unlawful manner of operation.
   The granting of a license for a business shall not be deemed a permit to
conduct the same in an unlawful manner or on premises where such business is
prohibited by law.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.029)
5.04.160 New business license fee--When payable.
   A.   Initial business license fees are due and payable prior to issuance of
the license for which application is made. The fee for the business license
application and for new licenses shall be established by resolution of the city
council. The payment of such fees shall not in any way constitute a right or
permission to begin the operations of said business.
   B.   Unless otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, all fees for
renewal of a business license under the provisions of this chapter shall be due
and payable on the day of the anniversary date on which the license expired.
The annual license fee shall become delinquent on the thirtieth day after the
due date.
(Ord. 279 § 1 (part), 2003; Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.031)
5.04.170 Penalty for failure to pay license fee when due.
   A.   For failure to pay a gross receipts license fee by five p.m. on the day
due, the business license officer shall add a penalty of twenty-five (25)
percent of the license fee on the day following the due date thereof, plus
interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month from the due date
until paid.
   B.   Any flat-rate license fee which has not been paid by five p.m. on the

the due date until paid.
   C.   Any daily license fee which has not been paid by five p.m. on the day

plus interest at the rate of one percent per additional day of delinquency
thereafter.
   D.   If any person has failed to apply for and secure a valid license to
operate a business, the business license fee due shall be that amount due and
payable from the first date on which the person was employed in business in the
city, together with applicable penalties and interest.
   E.   Where an audit or inspection of the books or records of a business
reveals that the amount of license fee paid for any license period is less than
the amount which was actually due pursuant to this chapter, it shall be deemed
for the purposes of this section that, to the extent of such deficiency, there
was a failure to pay a license fee when due. Penalties and interest as provided
in this section shall be assessed from the date when the deficiency should have
been paid pursuant to this chapter.
   F.   Should court action be required to collect any license fee or penalties
or interest, an additional penalty shall be charged equal to costs of suit,
including reasonable attorneys' fees. Such penalty shall be added to the
license fee and shall become due and payable as of the date of final judgment
in such action.
   G.   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter or knowingly
or intentionally misrepresenting to any officer or employee of the city any
material fact in procuring a license provided for in this chapter shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.

license officer.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.035)
5.04.190 Term of license.
   The term of any license issued hereunder shall be limited as follows:
   A.   If the license fee is an annual license fee, the license shall expire
on the anniversary of the date on which the license was last issued or renewed
or as otherwise designated by the chief finance officer.
   B.   If the license fee is a daily license fee, the license shall expire at
eleven fifty-nine p.m. for the day for which the license was issued; provided,
however, that such license may be issued for more than one day at a time. In
respect to daily licenses, the license fee for the entire licensure period

be set by resolution of the city council.
(Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 5.02.041)

5.04.340 Appeals from denial, suspension or revocation of business license or
permit.
   A.   Any person aggrieved by the denial of an application for a business
license or permit, denial of an application for renewal of a business license
or permit, suspension or revocation of a business license or permit, or any
other decision of the city with respect to the issuance or refusal to issue a
license or permit or the suspension or revocation of such license or permit
subject to the appeals provisions of this chapter (“administrative decision”),
may appeal the administrative decision by filing an appeal with the office of
the city clerk within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the notice of
the administrative decision was mailed to the applicant. If the fifteenth day
falls on a Saturday, Sunday or city holiday, the appeal may be filed on the
next day city hall is open for business. The appeal document must be received
by the office of the city clerk within the applicable time period and not just
mailed within such time. This appeal process applies to the denial, suspension
or revocation of those permits referenced in sections
5.26 Alcoholic Beverage Sales,
5.18 Massage Business and Massage Therapists and
5.27 Short-Term Vacation Rental. The person who files such an appeal shall be
known as the “appellant.” Except in those instances where an appeal is filed by
the city manager or other public official in pursuance of official duties, the
written notice of appeal from the action of an administrative official or from
an administrative body of the city, as the case may be, shall be accompanied by
a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) or such other fee as may be required by other
enactment of the city council.
      1.   The appeal shall set forth the administrative decision being
appealed and the reasons why the decision should be reversed or modified. The
city clerk shall promptly forward a copy of the appeal to the city manager and
administrative hearing officer.
      2.   In the event an appeal is timely filed, an administrative decision
concerning the denial of business license or permit, or the suspension or
revocation of a license or permit shall not be effective until a final decision
by the administrative hearing officer has been made pursuant to this section.
Failure of any person to file an appeal in accordance with the provisions of
this section shall constitute a waiver of that person’s right to an appeal. If
no timely appeal is filed, the administrative decision shall become effective
upon expiration of the period for filing an appeal. In the event a notice of
appeal fails to set forth any information required by this section, the city
clerk shall return the same to the appellant with a statement of the respects
in which it is deficient, and the appellant shall thereafter be allowed five
(5) days in which to perfect and refile the notice of appeal.
      3.   Upon receipt of a timely appeal, the city clerk shall make
arrangements for the selection of an administrative hearing officer to conduct
the appeal hearing. The administrative hearing officer shall be a person
knowledgeable in municipal affairs, including, but not limited to, attorneys,
retired judges, a reputable firm providing mediators and arbitrators, local
government officials, or the State Office of Administrative Hearings (or its
successor office). Not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the appeal hearing,
the city clerk shall notify the city manager and the appellant of the name of
the hearing officer who has been selected to hear the appeal. The
administrative hearing officer shall be fair and impartial and shall have no
bias for or against the city or the appellant.
      4.   Any documents or evidence to be used by the city and/or the
appellant during the appeal hearing must be provided to the administrative
hearing officer and the other party for review at least ten (10) days prior to
the appeal hearing.
      5.   At the appeal hearing, the administrative hearing officer shall
receive oral and written evidence from the city and the appellant.
         a.   The evidence presented need not comply with the strict rules of
evidence set forth in the California Evidence Code but shall be the type of
evidence upon which reasonable and prudent people rely in the conduct of
serious affairs.
         b.   The administrative hearing officer shall have broad authority to
control the proceedings and to allow for cross examination of witness in a fair
and impartial manner. The administrative hearing officer shall have authority
to administer oaths to those persons who will provide oral testimony. Each
party shall have the opportunity to offer testimony and evidence and cross-
examine witnesses in support of their case.
         c.   The city shall have the burden of proof to establish by clear and
convincing evidence the facts upon which his or her decision is based.
         d.   The appeal hearing shall be recorded by audio recording. Any
party may, at its sole cost and expense, utilize the services of a certified
court reporter to prepare the verbatim record of the hearing. If a court
reporter is used, the transcript prepared shall be made available for purchase
to both parties. The appellant's failure to appear at a hearing shall
constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing and a forfeiture of the hearing
fee deposit. An appellant's failure to appear at the hearing shall be presumed
an admission of guilt to the municipal code violation charges as indicated on
the administrative decision. Any administrative fine applicable to the
administrative decision, and additional hearing fees, if any, shall be
immediately due and payable to the city.
         e.   The administrative hearing officer may continue the appeal
hearing from time to time, but only upon written motion of a party showing good
cause for the continuance. The party requesting the continuance shall pay the
costs of the hearing officer, if any, for the cancelled hearing.
            i.   The administrative hearing officer may uphold, modify or
reverse the administrative decision of the city.
            ii.   Within ten (10) days of the conclusion of the appeal hearing,
the administrative hearing officer shall render his or her decision and make
written findings supporting the decision. The administrative hearing officer
shall send the decision to the city clerk. Upon receipt of the hearing
officer’s decision, the city clerk shall notify the city manager, the
respective department and the appellant of the decision and provide them with a
copy of the hearing officer’s decision, along with a proof of mailing.
            iii.   The administrative hearing officer’s decision shall be final
and conclusive as to the city and the appellant and no further administrative
appeal from the hearing officer’s decision shall be available. Any legal action
challenging the administrative hearing officer’s decision shall be filed within
ninety (90) days of the date of the proof of service of mailing of the hearing
officer’s opinion, pursuant to Section 1094.5 et seq., of the California Code
of Civil Procedure.
         f.   Any notices which either party may desire to give to the other
party in connection with the appeal under this section must be in writing and
may be given either by: (1) personal service; (2) delivery by a reputable
document delivery service, such as, but not limited to, federal express, that
provides a receipt showing date and time of delivery; or (3) mailing in the
United States mail, first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the address
to the city at city hall or to the appellant at the address set forth in the
notice of appeal. Notice shall be effective on the date of personal delivery or
the date when the notice was deposited in the mail or reputable document
delivery service.
         g.   If the administrative hearing officer overturns the
administrative decision or substantially modifies it in favor of the appellant,
the appeal fee shall be refunded to the appellant.
         h.   The city manager shall have the authority to establish all
appropriate administrative regulations for the fair and efficient
implementation of this section, conducting hearings and rendering decisions
pursuant to this section.
         i.   Notwithstanding the procedures set forth in this section, the
city manager shall have the authority to enter into settlement agreements with

of this title. (Ord. 579, Exhibit A, 2022)

shall be cumulative, and the use of one or more such remedies by the city, or
its duly authorized officers, shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the
purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, whether such remedy is
provided by this chapter or otherwise.

initial application fee, and gross receipts or other assessment shall be set
from time to time by resolution of the city council upon recommendation of the
business license officer.
   D.   Category IV. Category IV businesses are those businesses so designated
by resolution of the city council, which, because of the manner in which their
business is conducted, indicates a special method of assessment. The business
license fee for Category IV businesses shall be set from time to time by
resolution of the city council and shall be not less than the minimum business
license fee for Category I businesses.

coin-operated machines shall not be deemed to apply to:

deemed to have consented to the provisions of this chapter and to the exercise
by the city manager, the chief of police's office and all other city agencies

5.20.010 Purpose.
   The city council finds and declares as follows:
   A.   That unrelated practice of solicitation of unwilling residents for any
purpose jeopardizes the right of residents in the city to enjoy the privacy of
their homes in tranquility and security;
   B.   That the interests of residents in privacy and the quiet enjoyment of
residential premises are protected by reasonable regulation of the time and
manner solicitation may take place at residences in the city;
   C.   That the risk of consumer fraud increases when the solicitor has no
fixed place of business in the city and consumer complaints cannot be resolved
locally and expediently;
   D.   That the distribution of solicitation materials upon residential
property in the city creates widespread litter which is unsightly, unhealthy,
and difficult to remove;
   E.   That the distribution of solicitation materials upon residential
property in the city creates a serious police problem and a threat to public
safety and welfare in that residential property becomes cluttered with an
accumulation of such materials inadvertently advertising the absence of the
owner or occupant and increasing the likelihood of criminal activities on the
property; and,
   F.   That such practices, if not in compliance with the reasonable
regulation thereof, are injurious and contrary to the public health, safety and
welfare of residents of the city, create a public nuisance, and should
therefore be regulated by the city.

5.23.010 Findings and purpose.
   A.   The city council finds and declares as follows:
   1.   Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor
to indoor air pollution;
   2.   Reliable studies have shown that breathing secondhand smoke and vapor
is a significant health hazard for certain population groups, including elderly
people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired
respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway
disease;
   3.   Health hazards induced by breathing secondhand smoke and vapor include
lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased exercise tolerance, decreased
respiratory function, bronchoconstriction, and bronchospasm;
   4.   Nonsmokers with allergies, respiratory diseases and those who suffer
other ill effects of breathing secondhand smoke and vapor may experience a loss
of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick leave because of
adverse reactions to same;
   5.   Numerous studies have shown that a majority of both nonsmokers and
smokers desire to have restrictions on smoking in public places and places of
employment; and
   6.   Smoking is a documented cause of fires, and cigarette and cigar burns
and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures cause economic losses to businesses.
   7.   Use of electronic smoking devices has increased significantly in recent
years among both youths and adults.
   8.   Existing studies on electronic smoking devices’ vapor emission and
cartridge contents have found a number of dangerous substances including
chemicals know to the State of California to cause cancer such as formaldehyde,
acetaldehyde, lead, nickel and chromium; inconsistent labeling of nicotine
levels in electronic smoking device products; and other substances that have
been linked to negative health effects such as skin, eye and respiratory
irritation, neurological effects, damage to reproductive systems and premature
death from heart attacks and strokes.
   9.   The use of electronic smoking devices in smoke free locations threatens
to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverse the progress that
has been made in establishing a social norm that smoking is not permitted in
public places and places of employment.
   B.   Accordingly, the city council finds and declares that the purposes of
this chapter are:
   1.   To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in
public places except in designated smoking areas, and by regulating smoking in
places of employment; and
   2.   To strike a reasonable balance between the needs of smokers and the
need of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air, and to recognize that, where
these needs conflict, the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority.
   3.   To facilitate uniform and consistent enforcement of smoke-free air
laws.
   4.   To reduce the potential for re- normalizing smoking in public places
and places of employment.
   5.   To reduce the potential for children to associate the use of electronic
smoking devices witha normative or healthy lifestyle.

   E.   It shall be unlawful for any person to act as a tobacco retailer
without first obtaining and maintaining a valid tobacco retailers license
pursuant to this chapter for each location at which that activity is to occur.
Tobacco retailing without a valid tobacco retailers license is a public
nuisance.
   F.   A tobacco retailer or proprietor without a valid tobacco retailer
license, including, for example, a revoked license:
      1.   Shall keep all tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia from
public view. The public display of tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia in
violation of this provision shall constitute an "offer for sale" for the
purposes of §
5.24.120.
      2.   Shall not display any advertisement relating to tobacco products or
tobacco paraphernalia that promotes the sale or distribution of such products
from the tobacco retailers location or that could lead a reasonable consumer to
believe that such products can be obtained at that location.
   G.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant any person
obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailers license any status or right other
than the right to act as a tobacco retailer at the location in the city
identified on the face of the permit. For example, nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to render inapplicable, supercede, or apply in lieu of, any
other provision of applicable law including, but not limited to, any provision
of this code, or any condition or limitation on smoking in an enclosed place of
employment pursuant to Cal. Labor Code § 6404.5. For example, obtaining a
tobacco retailer license does not make the retailer a "retail or wholesale
tobacco shop" for the purposes of Cal. Labor Code § 6404.5.
(Ord. 365 § 4, 2006)
5.24.040 Tobacco retailer license application process.
   A.   Application for a tobacco retailer's license shall be submitted in the
name of each proprietor proposing to conduct retail tobacco sales and shall be
signed by each proprietor or any authorized agent thereof. It is the
responsibility of each proprietor to be informed regarding all laws applicable
to tobacco retailing, including those laws affecting the issuance of a tobacco
retailer's license.
   B.   No proprietor may rely on the issuance of a license as a determination
by the city that the proprietor has complied with all laws applicable to
tobacco retailing. A license issued contrary to this chapter, contrary to any
other law, or on the basis of false or misleading information supplied by a
proprietor shall be revoked pursuant to §
5.24.100. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to vest in any person
obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer's license any status or right to
act as a tobacco retailer in contravention of any provision of law.
   C.   All applications shall be submitted on a form supplied by the
department and shall contain the following information:
      1.   The name, address, and telephone number of each proprietor of the
business that is seeking a license;
      2.   The business name, address, and telephone number of the single fixed
location for which a tobacco retailer's license is sought;
      3.   The name and mailing address authorized by each proprietor to
receive all license-related communication and notices (the "authorized
address"). If an authorized address is not supplied, each proprietor shall be
understood to consent to the provision of notice at the business address
specified in subsection C.2. above;
      4.   Proof that the location for which a tobacco retailer's license is
sought has been issued a valid state tobacco retailer's license by the
California Board of Equalization;
      5.   Whether or not any proprietor is a person who has been determined to
have violated this chapter or whose proprietorship has admitted violating, or
has been found to have violated, this chapter, and, if so, the dates and
locations of all such violations within the past six years; and
      6.   Such other information as the department deems necessary for the
administration or enforcement of this chapter.
   7. All information required to be submitted to apply for a tobacco retailers
license shall be updated with the department whenever the information changes.
A tobacco retailer shall provide the department with any updates within ten
business days of a change.
(Ord. 365 § 5, 2006)
5.24.050 License issuance; standards.
   A.   No license may issue to authorize tobacco retailing at other than a
fixed location. For example, tobacco retailing by persons on foot and tobacco
retailing from vehicles are prohibited.
   B.   Upon receipt of an application for a tobacco retailers license and the
license fee required by this chapter, the department shall issue a license
unless substantial evidence demonstrates that one or more of the following
basis for denial exists:
      1.   The application is incomplete, inaccurate, or false. Intentionally
supplying inaccurate or false information shall be a violation of this chapter.
      2.   The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing at a
location for which this chapter prohibits issuance of tobacco retailers
licenses. However, this subsection shall not constitute a basis for denial of a
license if the applicant provides the department with documentation
demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant has acquired
or is acquiring the location or business in an arm's length transaction. Clear
and convincing evidence can be oral or written and must be the kind of evidence
upon which a responsible person would rely in making an important business,
personal, or other decision.
      3.   The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing for a
proprietor to whom this chapter prohibits a license to be issued.
   4   The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing that is
prohibited pursuant to this chapter, that is unlawful pursuant to this code, or
that is unlawful pursuant to any other law.
(Ord. 365 § 6, 2006)
5.24.060 License non-transferable.
   A.   A tobacco retailers license may not be transferred from one person to
another or from one location to another. Whenever a tobacco retailing location
has a change in proprietors, a new tobacco retailers license is required.
   B.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, prior violations
at a location shall continue to be counted against a location, and license
ineligibility periods shall continue to apply to a location unless:
      1.   The location has been fully transferred to a new proprietor or fully
transferred to entirely new proprietors; and
      2.   The new proprietor(s) provide the department with clear and
convincing evidence that the new proprietor(s) have acquired, or are acquiring,
the location in an arm's length transaction.
(Ord. 365 § 7, 2006)
5.24.070 Fees for license; license renewal and expiration.
   A.   License Fees. The fee to issue or to renew a tobacco retailer's license
shall be established by resolution of the governing body of the "department".
The fee shall be calculated as to recover the total cost of both license
administration and license enforcement including, for example, issuing the
license, administering the license program, retailer education, retailer
inspection and compliance checks, documentation of violation, and prosecution
of violators, but shall not exceed the cost of the regulatory program
authorized by this chapter. All fees shall be used exclusively to fund the
program. Fees are nonrefundable except as may be required by law.
   B.   License Renewal. A tobacco retailer license is invalid unless the
appropriate fee has been paid in full and the term of the license has not
expired. The term of a tobacco retailer license is one year. Each tobacco
retailer shall apply for the renewal of his or her tobacco retailer's license
and submit the license fee no later than 30 days prior to the expiration of the
term.
   C.   License Expiration. A tobacco retailer's license that is not timely
renewed shall expire at the end of its term. To reinstate a license that has
expired, or to renew a license not timely renewed pursuant to division B above,
the proprietor must:
      1.   Submit the license fee plus a reinstatement fee of 10% of the
license fee.
      2.   Submit a signed affidavit affirming that the proprietor:
         (a)   Has not sold and will not sell any tobacco product or tobacco
paraphernalia after the license expiration date and before the license is
renewed; or
         (b)   Has waited the appropriate ineligibility period established for
tobacco retailing without a license, as set forth in §
5.24.110 of this chapter, before seeking renewal of the license.

chapter.
   B.   The city, or the city managers designee as described in subsection A.
above, shall endeavor to check the compliance of each tobacco retailer at least
three times per 12-month period. Nothing in this division shall create a right
of action in any licensee or other person against the department or its agents.
   C.   Compliance checks shall determine, at a minimum, if the tobacco
retailer is conducting business in a manner that complies with tobacco laws
regulating youth access to tobacco. When appropriate, the compliance checks
shall determine compliance with other laws applicable to tobacco retailing.
   D.   The city, or the city managers designee as described in subsection A.
above, shall not enforce any law establishing a minimum age for tobacco
purchases or possession against any person who otherwise might be in violation
of such law because of the person's age (hereinafter "youth decoy") if the
potential violation occurs when:
      1.   The youth decoy is participating in a compliance check supervised by
a peace officer or a code enforcement official of the city; or
      2.   The youth decoy is participating in a compliance check funded, in
part, either directly or indirectly through subcontracting, by the city or the

any of the licensee's agents or employees, has violated any of the
requirements, conditions of prohibitions of this chapter or, in a different
legal proceeding, has pleaded guilty, "no contest," or its equivalent, or
admitted to a violation of any law designated in Section
5.24.080 of this chapter.
   B.   New License After Revocation.

shall be revoked if the department finds, after the licensee is afforded a
reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard, that one or more of the bases
for denial of a license under Section

license was issued. The decision by the department shall be the final decision
of the city. The revocation shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new
license application.
(Ord. 365 § 11, 2006)
5.24.110 Tobacco retailing without a license.
   In addition to any other penalty authorized by law, if the department finds
or any court of competent jurisdiction determines, after notice and an

city council may make such revisions or corrections to the report as it deems
just, after which, by resolution, the report shall be confirmed.
      4.   The delinquent charges set forth in the report as confirmed shall
constitute special assessments against the respective parcels of land, and are
a lien on the property for the amount of such delinquent charges plus
administrative costs. A certified copy of the confirmed report shall be filed
with the city clerk, or auditor appointed by the city council, for amounts of
the respective parcels of land as they appear on the current assessment roll.

delinquency as provided for such taxes. All laws applicable to the levy,
collection and enforcement of city ad valorem property taxes shall be
applicable to such assessment.

8.04.070 Nuisance alarms.
   A.   An alarm shall be deemed a nuisance alarm and a public nuisance when it
has been emitting sound continuously for at least one hour, or intermittently
for two hours, and has been reported to the police department as an annoyance
by a person in the vicinity of the alarm, and its owner is not available to
silence the alarm or to cause it to be silenced.
      1.   Any officer or police aide of the police department is authorized to
enter on exterior private property area, and into vehicles on private property
or public streets, for the purpose of silencing a nuisance alarm. Forcible
entry may be made into exterior alarm equipment boxes, and attics and
crawlspace vents, in order to accomplish this purpose. Actions may be taken to
silence vehicle alarms, including the towing of the vehicle, as prescribed in
the California Vehicle Code.
      2.   Neither the city, nor its police officers or police aides, nor any
officer or employee of the city or of a private alarm service contractor
engaged by the police shall be liable for damages to the owner of a nuisance
alarm for silencing the nuisance alarm or for entry on the owner's property for
the purpose of silencing a nuisance alarm or for any damage resulting from a
reasonable effort to silence the nuisance alarm.
      3.   An alarm system shall be deemed a nuisance alarm and a public
nuisance if such alarm system actuates excessive false alarms. Four false
alarms in any ninety-day period is found and determined to be an excessive
number of false alarms at any given location.
      4.   An alarm system shall be deemed a nuisance alarm and a public
nuisance if such an alarm system has been intentionally activated at least once
to summon the police to an incident for which the alarm system was not
intended. This may include, but not limited to, a robbery alarm being
intentionally activated for an incident which is not a robbery, or an alarm
which is intentionally activated merely to see what police response would
result.
      5.   An alarm system shall be deemed a nuisance alarm and a public
nuisance if, upon request of the police department, the responsible party for
such a system refuses to provide a list of persons to be contacted should the
alarm be activated, or upon request of the police department, refuses to
respond to the site of the alarm.
   B.   No Response Status.
      1.   If an alarm system has fallen into the category of a nuisance alarm
as defined in subsection A of this section, the chief of police may, upon the
next activation of that alarm, send a notice of no response to the owner or
person responsible for the nuisance alarm. This notice shall indicate that the
police department shall not respond to future activations of the nuisance alarm
unless a violation of the law is personally reported to the department by a
witness at the scene of the alarm.
      2.   The no response status shall remain in effect until such time that
the owner or person responsible for the nuisance alarm has provided adequate
evidence to the chief of police that the problems causing the alarm to become a
nuisance have been satisfactorily corrected.

8.12.050 Declaration of graffiti as a public nuisance.
   Graffiti on public or private property is a blighting factor which not only
depreciates the value of the property which has been the target of such
vandalism but also depreciates the value of the adjacent and surrounding
properties, and in so doing has a negative impact on the entire city. Section
53069.3 of the Government Code authorizes the city, under certain
circumstances, to provide for the removal of graffiti and other inscribed
materials from private as well as public property. The council finds and
determines that graffiti is obnoxious and a public nuisance and unless it and
other inscribed materials are removed from public and private property, they
tend to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti with the
result that entire neighborhoods are affected and the entire community
depreciates in value and becomes a less desirable place in which to be.
(Ord. 18 § 1 (part), 1991: Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 11.80.010)
8.12.060 Authorization to remove graffiti from both private and public
property.
   Whenever the city manager or his/her designee determines that graffiti or
other inscribed material is so located on public or privately owned, permanent
structures on public or privately-owned real property within the city so as to
be capable of being viewed by a person utilizing any public right-of-way in the
city, the city manager or his/her designee is authorized to provide for the
removal of the graffiti or other inscribed material upon the following
conditions:
   A.   In removing the graffiti or other inscribed material, the painting or
repair of a more extensive area shall not be authorized.
   B.   Where a structure is owned by a public entity other than the city, the
removal of the graffiti or other inscribed material may be authorized only
after securing the consent of the public entity having jurisdiction over the
structure and such entity executed a release and waiver approved as to form by
the city attorney.
   C.   Where a structure is privately owned, the removal of the graffiti or
other inscribed material may be authorized only after securing the consent of
the owner and the owner executes a release and waiver approved as to form by
the city attorney.
(Ord. 18 § 1 (part), 1991: Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 11.80.020)
8.12.070 Alternate procedures.
   In the event that the owner does not give the consent described in
Section 8.12.060 of this chapter, and fails to execute the release and waiver
described in that section, or in the event the owner cannot be located after a
reasonable period of time, the following alternate procedure shall be used by
the city, as set forth in the remaining sections of this chapter.

8.12.090 Service of notice.

equalized property tax assessment rolls of the county. If there is no known

before the report is submitted to the council, a copy shall be served on the
owner by personal service or by regular mail, at least ten days prior to the
hearing, together with a notice of time when the report shall be heard by the
council for confirmation.
   A.   The city council shall set the matter for hearing to determine the

council, shall constitute a special assessment against the respective lot or
parcel of land to which it relates, and upon recordation in the office of the

a lien on the property for the amount of such assessment.
      1.   After such confirmation and recordation, a copy shall be filed with
the assessor and the tax collector of the county, acting for the city, in order
that the county officials may add the amounts of the respective assessments to

land, and thereafter the amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the
same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject to
the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as
provided for ordinary municipal taxes; or
      2.   After such recordation, such lien may be foreclosed by judicial or

8.20.130 Nuisance abatement costs recovery; lien and special assessment.
   A.   Lien procedure.
      1.   Pursuant to California Government Code Section 38773.1, a lien
procedure is adopted to collect any nuisance abatement costs, including the
city’s actual costs of enforcement, any associated penalties, and the city
attorney’s fees and costs as administrative costs. A lien may be recorded on
the real property of each responsible party, jointly and severally, within 30
days of the date the statement of costs becomes a final administrative order of
the city.
      2.   Prior to recording a lien, a notice shall be given to all persons or
entities of record of the parcel of land on which the nuisance is maintained,
based on the last equalized assessment roll or the supplement roll, whichever
is more current. The notice shall be served in the same manner as a summons in
a civil action in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure Part 2,
Title 5, Chapter 4, Article 3 (commencing with Section 415.10). If the
responsible party or parties, after diligent search, cannot be found, the
notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the
property for a period of ten days and by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation published in Riverside County for a period of ten days.
      3.   After notice is given in accordance with the above, a lien shall be
recorded in the Riverside County recorder's office and shall constitute a lien
on the real property for abatement costs. From the date of recording, the lien
shall have the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien.
      4.   A lien recorded pursuant to this section shall specify the amount of
the lien, the name of the agency on whose behalf the lien is imposed, the date
of the abatement order, the street address, the legal description and the
assessor's parcel number of the parcel on which the lien is imposed and the
name and address of the recorded owner of the parcel.
      5.   In the event the lien is discharged, released or satisfied, either
through payment or foreclosure, notice of the discharge containing the same
information as the notice of lien shall be recorded in the Riverside County
recorder's office by the city.
   B.   Special assessment.
      1.   As an alternative to the lien procedure set forth in Section
8.20.130(A), the city may make the cost of abatement of a nuisance, including
penalties, enforcement costs, and attorneys’ fees and costs, a special
assessment against the subject property, in accordance with California
Government Code Section 38773.5, or as otherwise permitted by law.
      2.   Notice requirements.
         a.   Notice under this section shall be provided by certified mail, to
the property owner, if the property owner’s identity can be determined from the
county assessor’s or county recorder’s records.
         b.   Notice shall be given at the time of imposing the assessment and
shall specify that the property may be sold after three years by the tax
collector for unpaid delinquent assessments.
         c.   Notices shall contain the following information:
            i.   A legal description, street address, assessor's parcel number
and other description sufficient to identify the premises affected;
            ii.   A description of the violations of the code on the real
property which caused the issuance of a citation;
            iii.   A description of any proceeding under which penalties,
costs, and/or fees were imposed, including any final administrative order of
the hearing officer or appeals board, or other confirmation process; and
            iv.   The total amount to be assessed.

   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the city council from
ordering the city attorney to commence a civil action or other judicial or
administrative proceeding to abate the alleged nuisance or to obtain any other
appropriate remedy in addition to, as an alternative to, or in conjunction with
the procedures authorized by this chapter. Nor shall the implementation of this
chapter be deemed to prevent appropriate authorities from commencing a criminal
action based upon the conditions constituting the alleged nuisance.
(Ord. 105 § 1 (part), 1993: Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 6.04.140)

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, whenever the city
manager determines that any real property or any building, structure or
condition thereon is dangerous or constitutes an immediate threat to public
health or safety, he or she shall, without being required to observe the
provisions of this chapter with reference to abatement procedures, immediately
and forthwith abate such public nuisance. Where such condition and the
abatement is immediately required, the city manager shall prepare a statement
of costs in respect thereto, and the provisions of Sections
8.20.100 through
8.20.120 of this chapter shall apply. (Ord. 105 § 1 (part), 1993: Ord. 3 § 1
(part), 1991: prior code § 6.04.150)

   The City of Murrieta finds and declares the following:
   A.   Assembly Bill (“AB”) 939 of 1989, the California Integrated Waste
Management Act of 1989 (California Public Resources Code Section 40000, et
seq., as amended, supplemented, superseded and replaced from time to time),
requires the city to reduce, reuse, and recycle (including composting), solid
waste generated in the city to the maximum extent feasible before any
incineration or landfill disposal of waste, to conserve water, energy, and
other natural resources, and to protect the environment.
   B.   AB 341 of 2011 (approved by the Governor of the State of California on
October 5, 2011, which amended Sections 41730, 41731, 41734, 41735, 41736,
41800, 42926, 44004, and 50001 of, and added Sections 40004, 41734.5, and
41780.01 and Chapter 12.8 (commencing with Section 42649) to Part 3 of Division
30 of, and added and repealed Section 41780.02 of, the Public Resources Code,
as amended, supplemented, superseded and replaced from time to time), places
requirements on businesses, and Multi-Family property owners, that generate a
specified threshold amount of solid waste to arrange for recycling services and
requires the city to implement a mandatory commercial recycling program.

businesses, and multi-family property owners, that generate a specified
threshold amount of solid waste, recycling, and organic waste per week to
arrange for recycling services for that waste, and requires the city to
implement a recycling program to divert organic waste from such businesses
subject to the law.
   D.   Senate Bill (“SB”) 1383 of 2016, the Short-lived Climate Pollutant
Reduction Act of 2016, requires CalRecycle to develop regulations to reduce
organics in landfills as a source of methane. These regulations, adopted in

counties and cities; single-family residential households; commercial
businesses, including multi-family property owners; commercial edible food
generators, haulers, including self haulers; food recovery organizations; and
food recovery services to support achievement of statewide organic waste
disposal reduction targets. The SB 1383 Regulations further require the city to
adopt and enforce an ordinance or other enforceable mechanism to implement
relevant provisions of the SB 1383 Regulations.
   E.   This chapter implements the requirements of the SB 1383 Regulations and
helps reduce food insecurity by requiring commercial edible food generators to
arrange to have the maximum amount of their edible food, that would otherwise
be disposed of, be recovered for human consumption.

8.28.170   Enforcement.
   A.   Violation of any provision of this chapter shall constitute grounds for
issuance of a notice of violation and assessment of a fine by the enforcement
official in accordance with 14 CCR Section 18995.4. Enforcement actions under
this chapter are issuance of an administrative citation and assessment of a
fine. The city’s procedures on imposition of administrative fines set forth in
this code are hereby incorporated in their entirety, as modified from time to
time, and shall govern the imposition, enforcement, collection, and review of
administrative citations issued to enforce this chapter and any rule or
regulation adopted pursuant to this chapter, except as otherwise indicated in
this chapter. Other remedies allowed by law may be used, including civil action
or prosecution as a misdemeanor or infraction. The city may pursue civil
actions in the state courts to seek recovery of unpaid administrative
citations. The city may choose to delay court action until such time as a
sufficiently large number of violations, or cumulative size of violations exist
such that court action is a reasonable use of city staff and resources.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in addition to any notice of violation, for
incidences of prohibited container contaminants found in containers, city or
its authorized collector will issue an informational notice of contamination to
any generator or responsible party found to have prohibited container
contaminants in a container. Such notice will be provided via a cart tag,
electronic notice, or other communication immediately upon identification of
the prohibited container contaminants or within sixty (60) days after
determining that a violation has occurred. Prohibited container contaminants in
a responsible party’s containers on more than three (3) consecutive occasions
may subject the generator to a contamination processing fee or enforcement
action.

hundred dollars ($500) per violation.
   D.   Compliance deadline extension considerations. The city may extend the
compliance deadlines set forth in a notice of violation if it finds that there
are extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the respondent that make
compliance within the deadlines impracticable, including the following:
      1.   Acts of God such as earthquakes, pandemics, epidemics, wildfires,
flooding, and other emergencies or natural disasters;
      2.   Delays in obtaining discretionary permits or other government agency
approvals; or

   A.   All weeds, dry grasses, dead shrubs, dead trees, seasonal and recurrent
weeds, or any material growing upon the streets, sidewalks, or upon private
property within the city, which bears seeds of a wingy or downy nature or which
by reason of their size, manner of growth, and location, constitute a fire
hazard to any building, improvement, crop or other property, and weeds and
grasses which, when dry, will in reasonable probability constitute a fire
hazard, are declared to be a public nuisance.
   B.   Cultivated and useful grasses and pastures shall not be declared a
public nuisance under subsection A of this section; however, if the city
manager or his or her authorized representative shall determine it necessary to
protect adjacent improved property from fire exposure, an adequate firebreak
may be required.
   C.   On parcels up to five acres, where the topography is such that
portions, such as slopes greater than 2:1, are inaccessible for weed abatement,

control; however, all flat accessible areas shall conform to the requirements
of this chapter for weed abatement. On parcels larger than five acres, the same
provision is applicable; however, the regulations for required firebreaks and
structure setbacks for weed abatement shall prevail.

confirmed by resolution. Such hearing may be continued from time to time,
provided, however, that the hearing shall be completed as expeditiously as
circumstances permit. The decision of the city council shall be final. The

it shall be the duty of the auditor, assessor and tax collector, as
appropriate, to add the amount of such assessment or assessments to the next
regular bills of taxes levied against the respecting lot or parcel of land, and
thereafter, the amount shall be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as ordinary real property taxes are collected, and shall be subject to

8.36.100 Title.
   This chapter shall be known as the “City of Murrieta Stormwater and Runoff
Management and Discharge Controls Ordinance” and may be so cited.
(Ord. 472 § 1, 2012)
8.36.110 Purpose and intent.
   The purpose of this chapter is to implement the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act (the "Clean Water Act" or "CWA"), 33 U.S.C. Sections 1251 - 1387,
and the California Water Code by prohibiting the discharge of any pollutant to
navigable waters of the United States from a point source unless the discharge
is authorized by a permit issued pursuant to the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System ("NPDES") required by CWA Section 402, 33 U.S.C. Section
1342, and prohibits non-stormwater discharges into the municipal separate storm
sewer system ("MS4").
(Ord. 472 § 1, 2012)
8.36.120 Administration.
   The chapter shall be administered for the city of Murrieta by the city
engineer or his or her designee.
(Ord. 472 § 1, 2012)
8.36.130 Definitions.
   A. The terms as used in this chapter or in any resolution or standard
adopted by the city council pursuant to this chapter, shall have the following
meanings:
   "Authorized inspector" shall mean the city engineer and all persons
designated by him or her and under his or her instruction and supervision, who
are assigned to investigate compliance with, detect violations of, and/or take
actions pursuant to this chapter.
   "Best management practices" or "BMPs" shall mean, as defined in 40 C.F.R.
122.2, schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance
procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the pollution
of waters of the United States. BMPs also include site design, source control,
treatment requirements, operating procedures and practices to control plant
site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw
material storage.
   "City engineer" shall mean the director of public works/city engineer of the
city of Murrieta or his or her designee.
   "Co-NPDES permittee" shall mean the county of Riverside, the Riverside
County Flood Control and Water Conservation District and the city of Temecula,
city of Wildomar and city of Murrieta which are responsible for compliance with
the terms of the NPDES permit.
   "CWA" shall mean the Clean Water Act.
   "Discharge" shall mean any release, spill, leak, flow, escape, leaching
(including subsurface migration or deposition to groundwater), dumping or
disposal of any liquid, semi-solid or solid substance.
   "Discharge exception" shall mean those activities not restricted or
prohibited by this chapter or exempted in the NPDES permit or a subsequent
NPDES permit.
   "Discharger" shall mean any person, any property owner, or any occupant of
any unit, building, premises or lot within the city, who either discharges or
causes to discharge any of the substances listed under "discharge," above,
either directly or indirectly into the city's storm drain system.
   "Existing development and operations" shall mean existing fixed or mobile
industrial and commercial business facilities and non-commercial facilities
that are not residential in nature (such as not-for-profit entities,)
facilities in the city operated by other governmental entities, common interest
areas, homeowners' associations, and property management organizations.
   "Illicit connection" shall mean any physical connection to the storm drain
system that conveys an illicit discharge.
   "Illegal discharge" shall mean any discharge to the storm drain system that
is not composed entirely of stormwater runoff except discharges made pursuant
to a NPDES permit and discharges resulting from fire fighting activities (40
C.F.R. 122.26(b)(2)).
   "Invoice for costs" shall mean the actual costs and expenses of the city,
including but not limited to administrative overhead, salaries and other
expenses recoverable under California law, incurred during any inspection
conducted pursuant to this chapter or where a notice of noncompliance,
administrative compliance order or other enforcement option under this chapter
is utilized to ensure compliance with this chapter or the NPDES permit.
   "JRMP" or "jurisdictional runoff management plan" shall mean a written
description of the specific jurisdictional runoff management measures and
programs that the city will implement to comply with the NPDES permit and to
ensure that stormwater pollutant discharges in runoff are reduced to the MEP
and do not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards.
   "Maximum extent practicable" ("MEP") shall mean the technology-based
standard established by Congress in CWA Section 402(p)(3)(B)(iii) for
stormwater that operators of MS4s must meet as contained within the most-
current NPDES permit. Technology-based standards establish the level of
pollutant reductions that dischargers must achieve, typically by treatment or
by a combination of source control and treatment control BMPs. MEP generally
emphasizes pollution prevention and source control BMPs primarily (as the first
line of defense) in combination with treatment methods serving as a backup
(additional line of defense). MEP considers economics and is generally, but not
necessarily, less stringent than best available technology economically
achievable. A definition for MEP is not provided either in the statute or in
the regulations. Instead the definition of MEP is dynamic and will be defined
by the following process over time: municipalities propose their definition of
MEP by way of their runoff management programs. Their total collective and
individual activities conducted pursuant to the runoff management programs
becomes their proposal for MEP as it applies both to their overall effort, as
well as to specific activities (e.g., MEP for street sweeping, or MEP for MS4
maintenance). In the absence of a proposal acceptable to the Regional Board,
the Regional Board defines MEP.
   "Modifications to existing development" shall mean the creation or addition
of impervious surfaces or the making of improvements to an existing structure
on an already developed site; replacement of impervious surfaces that are not
part of a routine maintenance activity; and land-disturbing activities related
to structural or impervious surfaces. Modifications to existing development
does not include trenching and resurfacing associated with utility work;
resurfacing existing roadways; new sidewalk construction, pedestrian ramps, or
bikelane on existing roads; and routine replacement of damaged pavement, such
as pothole repair. This definition is consistent with the term "redevelopment"
as referenced in the NPDES permit.
   "New development" shall mean all public and private residential (whether
single-family, multi-unit or planned unit development), industrial, commercial,
retail, and other non-residential construction projects, or grading for future
construction, for which a land use approval, grading permit, building permit or
nonresidential plumbing permit is required.
   "Non-stormwater" shall mean all discharges to and from a MS4 that do not
originate from precipitation events (i.e., all discharges from a MS4 other than
stormwater). Non-stormwater includes illicit discharges, non-prohibited
discharges, and NPDES permitted discharges.
   "NPDES" or "National Pollution Discharge Elimination System" shall mean the
national program for issuing, modifying, revoking and reissuing, terminating,
monitoring and enforcing NPDES permits, and imposing and enforcing pretreatment
requirements, under Sections 307, 318, 402, and 405 of the CWA.
   "NPDES permit" shall mean any NPDES permit setting waste discharge
requirements for discharges from the MS4s draining the county of Riverside, the
incorporated cities of Riverside County, and the Riverside County Flood Control
and Water Conservation District within the San Diego Region and which also
includes the city of Murrieta.
   "Owner or operator" shall mean the owner or operator of any facility or
activity subject to regulation under the NPDES permit.
   "Permittee" shall mean any person, property owner, contractor, or authorized
agent to whom a NPDES permit is issued pursuant to this chapter.
   "Person" shall mean an individual, association, partnership, corporation,

   It is the purpose of these regulations to aid in the reduction of the crimes
and reported incidents involving alcohol and other intoxicating substances
including, but not limited to, public intoxication, disturbances, fights,
thefts, vandalism, and driving under the influence. Because alcohol and other
intoxicating substances cause physical impairments and decrease the ability of
persons to make sound decisions, many of these incidents would not occur
independent of the presence of alcohol and intoxicating substances. The city
desires to restrict the public consumption of alcohol and intoxicating
substances where state law and current city regulations are silent, in
furtherance of the goal of creating a safer community.
(Ord. 413 § 2, 2009)

   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive set of
regulations applicable to newsracks on public rights-of-way. The purpose of
this chapter is to advance and improve safety and aesthetics by controlling the
number, size, construction, placement and appearance of newsracks without
restricting the free dispersal of information guaranteed by the Constitution of
the United States and the State of California.
   B.   More specifically, the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare by regulating the placement, appearance,
servicing and insuring newsracks so as to protect against the dangers of
impairing or distracting the vision of motorists and pedestrians; the hazards
of unreasonably interfering with or impeding the flow of pedestrian or
vehicular traffic, including ingress into or egress from any residence or place
of business, or from the street to the sidewalk by persons exiting or entering
parked or standing vehicles; unreasonably interfering with the use of public
property for its intended purpose; unduly restricting access to the use of
poles, ports, traffic signs or signs, hydrants, mailboxes and purpose of the
city's design regulations; neglectful servicing of newsracks resulting in the
aesthetics or store window displays, adjacent landscaping and other
improvements; reductions in value or surrounding property; and unnecessary
exposure of the city to personal injury or property damage claims or suits.
   C.   The city council finds and determines that the strong and competing
interests of the public and of newspapers require a reasonable accommodation,
which can only be satisfactorily achieved through the means of this chapter,
which is designed to accommodate such interests by regulating the time, place
and manner of using newsracks. It is not the intent of this chapter to in any
way discriminate against, regulate or interfere with the publication,
circulation, distribution or dissemination of any newspapers.    
(Ord. 307 § 2 (part), 2004)

9.35.010 Findings.
   The city council of the city of Murrieta finds that the theft of catalytic
converters has been an increasing problem in the city in recent years. The
external location of catalytic converters and the use of valuable precious
metals, including rhodium, palladium and platinum, in catalytic converters
makes these devices a target for thieves. Individuals in possession of stolen
catalytic converters often recycle them for substantial profit, while victims
of these thefts suffer the consequences of paying thousands of dollars in
repairs, the inconvenience of repairing their vehicles, and feeling unsafe in
the community. Finding the victim of these crimes is extremely difficult due to
the manner in which the catalytic converter thefts occur and lack of
identifying markers on catalytic converters to link a stolen catalytic
converter to the victim. The inability to identify the victims of catalytic
converter thefts can inhibit the ability to successfully prosecute individuals
for the thefts. This chapter is necessary to provide the city a means to
protect the public, deter this criminal activity and promote a more productive
use of city resources.
(Ord. 606-24 § 2 (part), 2024)
9.35.020 Purpose.
   Catalytic converter theft is an ongoing problem within the city and causes
significant financial damage to the victims. The purpose and intent of this
chapter is to curb the theft of catalytic converters throughout the city and to
provide the city with reasonable means to address the impact on the community
and the victims posed by increasing catalytic converter thefts.
(Ord. 606-24 § 2 (part), 2024)
9.35.030 Definitions.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the
following meanings:
   “City” means the city of Murrieta.
   “Catalytic Converter” means any exhaust emission control device, or portion
thereof, that converts toxic gases and pollutants in exhaust gas from an
internal combustion engine into less-toxic pollutants.
   “Documentation or other proof” means written document(s) clearly identifying
the vehicle from which the catalytic converter originated based on the totality
of the circumstances, which includes, but is not limited to, the following
types of documents:

      3.   Verifiable electronic communication from the previous owner to the
possessor relinquishing ownership of the catalytic converter.
      4.   Photographs of the vehicle from which the catalytic converter
originated.
      5.   Vehicle registration associated with the catalytic converter
containing an etched associated license plate number or vehicle identification
number or driver’s license number of registered vehicle owner.
   “Lawful Possession” includes: (1) being the lawful owner of the catalytic
converter or (2) being in possession of the catalytic converter with the lawful
owner's verifiable written consent. It is not required to prove the catalytic
converter was stolen to establish the possession is an unlawful possession.
   “Enforcement Officer” means Riverside county sheriff, murrieta police chief,
city attorney, or district attorney and their designees.
(Ord. 606-24 § 2 (part), 2024)
9.35.040 Unlawful possession of a catalytic converter.
   Barring any provision of state law permitting the same, it is unlawful for
any person to possess any catalytic converter which is not attached to a
vehicle unless the person has a verifiable valid proof of ownership of the
catalytic converter.
   A.   This section does not apply to a detached catalytic converter that has
been verifiably tested, certified, and labeled or otherwise approved for reuse,
and is being bought or sold for purposes of reuse in accordance with the
federal Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.) and regulations under the
Clean Air Act, as they may be amended from time to time.
   B.   It is unlawful for any person to knowingly falsify or cause to be
falsified any information in a record intended to show valid proof of
ownership.
   C.   Evidence of unlawful possession may be presumed by the number of
detached catalytic converters within one’s possession and/or by the condition
of the dismantled catalytic converter(s), including but not limited to, the
manner a catalytic converter has been detached or cut from a vehicle.
(Ord. 606-24 § 2 (part), 2024)
9.35.050 Violations and enforcement.

subsequent conviction of the offense, the person shall be punished by the
penalties of a fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000) and by imprisonment in the

contain the following information: (1) date, location and approximate time the
violation was observed; (2) the amount of the administrative civil penalty
imposed for the violation; (3) instructions for the payment of the
administrative civil penalty, the time period by which it shall be paid, and
the consequences of failure to pay the administrative civil penalty within this
time; (4) instructions on how to appeal the administrative citation; and (5)
the signature of the enforcement officer. The failure of the administrative
citation to set forth all required contents shall not affect the validity of
the administrative citation or any proceedings to enforce said citation. The
administrative civil penalty may be imposed via the administrative process set
forth in this chapter or may be imposed by the court if the violation requires
court enforcement without an administrative process.
   D.   Separate offenses. Acts, omissions, or conditions in violation of this
chapter that continue, exist, or occur on more than one day constitute separate
violations on each day. Violations continuing, existing, or occurring on the
service date, the effective date, and each day between the service date and the
effective date are separate violations. A person is guilty of a separate
offense for each and every day or portion thereof during which he or she
commits, continues, or permits a violation of this chapter. A person is deemed
guilty of a separate offense for each and every violation of this chapter, or
any portion thereof. Likewise, a person shall be deemed guilty of a separate
offense for each and every catalytic converter in the person’s possession that
is not attached to a vehicle unless the person has a valid proof of ownership
of the catalytic converter.

or abatement remedy does not preclude the use of additional citations or other
remedies as authorized by other ordinance or law. Enforcement remedies may be
employed concurrently or consecutively. Conviction and punishment of or
enforcement against any person hereunder shall not relieve such person from the
responsibility of correcting, removing or abating a violation, nor prevent the

10.40.010 Abatement and removal as a public nuisance.
   A.   This chapter is enacted under the authority of Section 22660 of the
California Vehicle Code to establish procedures for the abatement and removal,
as public nuisances, of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles
or parts thereof, from private or public property within the city, excluding
highways, and for recovery of the costs of such removal and administration of
this chapter.
   B.   The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or
inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property, excluding
highways, is found to create conditions tending to reduce the value of private
property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create
fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the
health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects, and
to be injurious to the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the
presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicle, or part
thereof, on private or public property, excluding highways, except as expressly
permitted in this chapter, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which
may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

(Ord. 344 § 7, 2005)

than once annually. Each taxicab vehicle must comply, at all times, with the
California Vehicle Code.
      2.   All licensed taxicabs shall at all times be maintained by the
taxicab business permit holder, in an acceptable appearance and state of
repair, in clean and sanitary condition, and in safe operating condition.
      3.   The taxicab business permit holder must keep and maintain a
maintenance log on every taxicab. The maintenance log must include the
following information:
         a.   A record of brake inspection, the name and address of the garage
that performed the inspection, the date of the inspection; and
         b.   Any other inspection or maintenance performed on the taxicab
vehicle.
   The garage mechanic must sign and date the maintenance log after each
appointment. The maintenance log must be kept at the taxicab business principal
office and be available for review by the police department/code enforcement
department for at least three years after the date of the last entry in the log
book or other form of log. A taxicab permit for the inspected vehicle may be
revoked or suspended if the holder fails to comply with the provisions of this

   I.   Whenever a vehicle licensed as a taxicab pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter is replaced with another vehicle, all requirements of this chapter
must be first met, and a fee as established by city council resolution shall be
paid by the owner of the vehicle to the business licensing officer. The
previously issued vehicle permit sticker shall be removed at the time the
replacement sticker is applied to the new vehicle.
(Ord. 344 § 11, 2005)
10.60.110 Taximeters.
   A.   Testing and Sealing of Taximeter. Prior to placing any taxi vehicle
into service, it shall be the duty of every taxicab business permit holder to
present its licensed taxicabs at a designated reasonable place and at such
reasonable time as may be specified by the weights and measures division of the
county of Riverside or by other appropriate regulatory authority for the
purpose of testing, checking and sealing taximeters. Failure to produce a
taxicab for such purpose will be sufficient grounds for the city to deny a
sticker and/or to require that the vehicle be taken out of service until the
taximeter has been checked, tested and sealed by such regulatory authority in
accordance with the provisions of law. The cost of all such tests, checks and
seals shall be borne by the holder of the permit. Proof of completion of this
requirement shall be presented to the chief of police, or his or her designee,
prior to any issuance or renewal of a taxicab permit.
   B.   Rates—To be Filed. Every holder of a taxicab business permit shall file
with the city clerk a true and correct statement of the rates proposed to be
charged for the transportation of passengers in all taxicabs operated by the
holder pursuant to this chapter. The company shall submit, not less than sixty
(60) days in advance of changing rates, a formal request to the city council
for approval of the proposed rates. At the discretion of the city council, a
public hearing may be set to consider the proposed rates. The city council may
require justification for the proposed rates. If the council does not hold a
public hearing within sixty (60) days after the submittal, the proposed rates
will be deemed to have been approved.
   C.   Taximeter—Operation.
      1.   No holder of a taxicab business permit or of a taxicab permit or of
a drivers permit shall operate,
drive, cause or permit to be driven or operated, any taxicab in the city unless
and until the taximeter for such taxicab shall have been approved by the
appropriate regulatory authority, and it shall be the duty of such permit
holder to keep the taximeter operating at all times within such standards of
accuracy as may be prescribed from time to time by the appropriate regulatory
authority and consistent with the approved rates on file with the city.
      2.   No passenger shall be carried in any taxicab unless the taximeter
shall be in operation. This provision shall apply regardless of whether a
taxicab is engaged for a trip entirely within the boundaries of the city or
partially outside thereof, and the taximeter shall be kept operating
continuously during the entire time that it is engaged in the transportation of
passengers, regardless of the point of destination.
      3.   Within one month prior to submitting an application for issuance or
renewal of a taxicab permit, the taximeter of such taxicab must be tested and
sealed by the appropriate regulatory authority.
      4.   A taximeter shall be placed in each taxicab so that the reading dial
showing the amount to be charged will be well lighted and readily discernible
to a passenger riding in the taxicab.
      5.   Every taximeter used in the operation of taxicabs shall be subject
to inspection at any time by a duly authorized representative of the city, or
by other appropriate authority, including a police officer. Upon the discovery
of any material inaccuracy of a taximeter or inconsistent with approved rates,
the operator thereof shall remove, or cause to be removed from service, the
vehicle equipped with the inaccurate or inconsistent taximeter until such
taximeter shall have been replaced or repaired, and tested and resealed.
   D.   Flag Drop Charges. The driver of any taxicab, while carrying
passengers, must immediately activate the meter once the vehicle is in motion
and is actively transporting passengers, and must be deactivated by the driver
once the passengers have reached the desired destination, or the passenger
verbally communicates the cancellation of the service, and/or at the
termination of the service.
   E.   Charges to be Registered. All charges for taxicab service shall be
calculated and indicated by taximeter, and at all times while the taxicab is
engaged, the taximeter shall be activated to register the charges.
No taximeter shall be so operated as to cause any charge to be registered
thereon except during the time when the taxicab is engaged by a passenger or
passengers.
   F.   Receipt for Charges. No driver of any taxicab, upon receiving full
payment for a fare as indicated by the taximeter, shall refuse to give a
receipt when requested. The receipt shall show the name of the taxi company,
name of the driver, date of service, and taxicab number, total amount of fare,
origin of fare and destination.
   G.   Charges Must be Indicated. Charges for transportation of passengers in
a taxicab operated in the city shall not exceed the amount shown on the
taximeter installed in the taxicab and is verified by the county of Riverside
Weights and Measures. It is unlawful for any owner or driver of any taxicab to
charge any passenger or passengers any sum in excess of the sum indicated on
the taximeter.
(Ord. 344 § 12, 2005)
10.60.120 Rates.
   A.   Rates to be Displayed in Vehicle. Every taxicab shall have

owner operates;
      2.   The business address and telephone number of the business;

office and police department dispatch number;
      6.   At the request of any person, the driver of a taxicab shall give the
number of his or her vehicle.
   B.   Deduction for Time While Disabled. In the event any taxicab shall,
while under hire, become disabled or break down without fault of the passenger,
the time stopped for such cause shall be deducted from the charge made.
(Ord. 344 § 13, 2005)
10.60.130 Insurance requirements.
   Before any permit is issued or renewed by the business licensing officer, or

         a.   The proposed use of the property is not governed by or subject to
any other permit procedures provided elsewhere in this policy or other
applicable laws, rules or regulations; and
         b.   The preparation for the conduct of the proposed use, event or
activity will not unduly impede, obstruct, or interfere with the public's use
of the street or other public property; and
         c.   The preparation for the conduct of the proposed use, event or
activity will not unduly impede, obstruct, or interfere with the operation of
emergency vehicles or equipment in or through the particular permit area, or

city services in the vicinity of the permit area; and

      2.   In addition to the requirements of this policy or other applicable
laws or rules or regulations promulgated by the city manager, each permit shall
contain such terms and conditions regarding the city streets or other public
property which are necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.
   E.   Permit Fees. Permit application fees, daily fees and other additional
fees for the use of city streets or other city-owned or controlled property

      1.   In addition to the payment of the nonrefundable permit application
fees, the daily fees and any other fees prescribed by resolution of the city
council, a permittee shall pay the city for all city departmental service
charges incurred in connection with or due to the permittee's activities under
the permit. If city property is destroyed or damaged by reason of permittee's
use, event or activity, the permittee shall reimburse the city for all the
actual replacement or repair cost of the destroyed or damaged property.
      2.   City departments shall submit the final invoices and billings for
departmental charges to the permittee no later than ten working days after the
expiration date of the permit.
      3.   At least three days prior to the date that any permit under this
policy is to become effective, the applicant shall pay to the city a cash
deposit to the accounting department in an amount sufficient to cover the total
city departmental charges which the city manager or his or her designee
estimates will be incurred in connection with the permit. The payment of any
such advance cash deposit may be waived by the city manager or his or her
designee.
   G.   Refunds. If a permittee is unable to hold or conduct a use, event or
activity because of inclement weather or due to some other cause not within the
permittee's control, and the permittee submits a written request for the refund
of such fees to the city manager's office within ten days after the date that
the use, event or activity was to have been held or conducted, the city manager
may authorize a refund of the fee or a pro rata portion thereof, except the
nonrefundable application fees, which have been paid by the permittee to the
city in connection with a permit issued under this policy.
   H.   Compliance Investigation. It shall be the duty, responsibility and
authority of the city manager or his or her designee to monitor, investigate
and determine whether a permittee fully complies with all the provisions of any
applicable laws, rules or regulations.
   I.   Insurance.
      1.   Concurrent with the issuance of a permit under this policy, and as a
condition precedent to the effectiveness of the permit, the permittee shall
obtain and maintain in full force and effect during the term of the permit a
policy of insurance from a reliable insurance company authorized to do business
in the state, which policy includes the city, its boards, officers, agents and
employees as named insureds or additional named insureds and which provides the
coverages that the city manager determines to be necessary and adequate under
the circumstances, and proof of insurance shall be submitted to the city at
least ten days prior to the event.
      2.   If the city manager determines that a particular use, event or
activity which is for a permit period of no more than one day does not present
a substantial or significant public liability or property damage exposure for
the city or its officers, agents and employees, the city manager may give a
written waiver of the insurance requirements of this section.
      3.   Each permit shall expressly provide that the permittee agrees to
defend, protect, indemnify and hold the city, its officers, employees and
agents free and harmless from and against any and all claims, damages,
expenses, loss or liability of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of, or
resulting from the alleged acts or omissions of permittee, its officers, agents
or employees in connection with the permitted event or activity; and the
permittee shall expressly provide that the permittee shall, at permittee's own
cost risk and expense, defend any and all claims or legal actions that may be
commenced or filed against the city, its officers, agents or employees, and
that permittee shall pay any settlement entered into and shall satisfy any
judgement that may be rendered against the city, its officers, agents or
employees as a result of the alleged acts or omissions of permittee or
permittee's officers, agents or employees in connection with the uses, events
or activities under this permit.

UNIVERSAL DESIGN RESIDENTIAL DWELLINGS

15.12.030   Definitions.

15.12.050   Standards.
   
15.12.060   Enforcement.
15.12.010 Purpose and intent.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide consistent, practical, and proven
building and design requirement incorporating universal design and visitability
standards that will make specified dwelling units visitable, more usable, and
safer for occupancy and visitability by persons with disabilities or frailties.
It is this jurisdiction's desire to enhance full life-cycle use of housing
without regard to the physical abilities or disabilities of a home's occupants
or guests in order to accommodate a wide range of individual preferences and
functional abilities. In order to enhance the ability of homeowners or renters
to remain in their homes during periods of temporary, developing, or permanent
disabilities or frailties, the following design criterion shall be applied.
(Ord. 370 § 1 (part), 2006)
15.12.020 Findings.
   A.   The city of Murrieta finds that the California Department of Housing
and Community Development have determined that the provisions of the model
universal design ordinance from which this chapter is derived are consistent
with the requirements of California Health and Safety Code Section 17959. The
city of Murrieta finds that this chapter is substantially the same as the model
ordinance issued by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development.
   B.   To the extent that the provisions of this chapter are inconsistent with
the provisions of the city of Murrieta ordinances adopting the California
Building Standards Code, adopted pursuant to California Health and Safety Code
Sections 17922 and 18928, the provisions of this chapter shall supersede those
ordinances, except as otherwise provided by law. This chapter shall not apply
to any residential dwelling unit subject to and in compliance with Chapter 11A
or 11B of the California Building Code.
   C.   The city of Murrieta finds that the regulations imposed by this chapter
are reasonably necessary in this jurisdiction because:
      1.   According to the 2000 Census data, there were five thousand two
hundred thirty-eight (5,238) residents or twelve-point nine percent (12.9%) of
Murrieta's population classified on disability status. The 2000 Census data
also has five thousand sixty- three (5,063) residents or eleven-point four
percent (11.4%) of Murrieta's population at age sixty-five (65) and older.
      2.   According to a 2000 AARP survey, more than ninety percent (90%) of
persons age sixty-five (65) and older would prefer to stay in their current
residence as long as possible. One key method to promote continuing
independence in the home is to build and incorporate a number of
architecturally friendly design features into new homes as they are built.
      3.   Universal design, as defined by the National Endowment for the Arts,
goes beyond the mere provision of special features for various segments of the
population. Instead, universal design emphasizes a creative approach that is
more inclusive – one that asks at the outset of the design process how a
product, graphic communication, building, or landscape can be made both
aesthetically pleasing and functional for the greatest number of users. Designs
resulting from this approach are more likely to serve a wider array of people:
individuals who have temporary disabilities, people who have permanent
disabilities, and everyone whose abilities change with age.

      1.   It shall be the responsibility of the civil engineer who prepared
the grading plans to incorporate the applicable recommendations from the
geotechnical engineering and engineering geology reports and to incorporate any
city engineer-approved alternatives into the grading plan.
      2.   The civil engineer shall be responsible for establishing line and
grade for the grading and drainage improvements and shall act as the
coordinating agent in the event the need arises for liaison between the other
professionals, the contractor and the city engineer.
      3.   The civil engineer shall be responsible for the preparation of plan
revision, and upon completion of the work, the submission of as-graded drawings
incorporating all changes and/or additions made during construction.
      4.   Prior to issuance of building permits for any given lot or lots, the
civil engineer shall submit a written statement as evidence that rough grading
for land development has been completed within standard tolerances in
accordance with the approved plans and that all embankments and cut slopes and
pad sizes are as shown on the approved plans.
      5.   The geotechnical engineer's area of responsibility shall include,
but not be limited to, performing the preliminary geotechnical engineering
investigation and preparing the preliminary geotechnical engineering report,
determining the suitability of soils during grading, providing compaction
inspection and testing, and preparing the final geotechnical engineering
report.
      6.   The engineering geologist's area of responsibility shall include,
but not be limited to, professional inspection and approval of the stability of
cut slopes with respect to geological matters, and the need for subdrains or
other groundwater drainage devices. The engineering geologist shall report the
findings to the geotechnical engineer for engineering analysis.
      7.   The landscape architect shall incorporate applicable recommendations
from the geotechnical engineering reports into the landscape and irrigation
plans. The landscape architect shall also prepare plan revisions, as required
by the city engineer, and shall submit as-graded drawings incorporating all
changes and/or additions made during construction.
   C.   Notification of Noncompliance. If, in the course of fulfilling their
responsibility under this grading code, the engineer of record, the
geotechnical engineer, the engineering geologist, or the testing agency finds
that the work is not being done in accordance with approved plans,
specifications or this chapter, the discrepancies shall be reported immediately
in writing to the grading contractor, the permittee and the city engineer.

in any event immediately after completion of the work, the permittee shall, at
its own expense, clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of any
kind resulting from the work. Upon failure to do so, within twenty-four hours
after having been notified, the work may be done by the city and the cost
thereof assessed against the permittee's maintenance deposit and/or performance
bond. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to excavate through any
landscaped area, the area shall be reestablished in a like manner after the
excavation has been backfilled as required. All construction and maintenance
work shall be done in a manner designed to leave the area clean of earth and
debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed before

is indebted to the city for past permit violations or who in the judgment of
the city engineer has repeatedly violated permit procedures or failed to comply
with conditions requiring protection of the public health and safety.
   B.   The city engineer may deny the issuance of an encroachment permit to
any person who refuses to execute the encroachment permit.
   C.   Any permittee found in violation of the conditions of an encroachment
permit or the provisions of this chapter shall be given a written notice to
comply stipulating the code violation. Upon receipt of a notice to comply, the
permittee shall take action to correct the condition of violation within the
period stipulated in the notice. If within that period appropriate measures
have not been implemented, the city engineer may revoke the encroachment permit
and take any measures required to secure the work site or return the work site
to its original condition. The cost of such work may be collected through
assessment against the permittee's maintenance deposit and/or performance bond
with any additional funds required collected from the permittee.
(Ord. 264 § 1 (part), 2002)
15.54.110 Permit fees.

expenses involved in the issuance of an encroachment permit, checking plans for
compliance with the ordinance codified in this chapter and other ordinances,
facility indicator costs, field inspections conducted to insure compliance with
the terms and conditions under which the encroachment permit was issued and any
other expense that is reasonably related to the additional cost that the city
may incur as the direct result of the application or as allowed under law. Fee/
deposit schedules shall be established by resolution of the city council.
(Ord. 264 § 1 (part), 2002)
15.54.120 Performance deposits.
   A.   As a condition of issuance of an encroachment permit, the city engineer
may require posting of a maintenance deposit and/or performance bond or an
equivalent security in a form acceptable to the city attorney. The city
engineer may require that up to one hundred percent of any deposit be submitted
in the form of a cash deposit. The cash deposit may be used at the discretion
of the city engineer to provide for traffic-control, restoration of public
facilities or removal from the right-of-way of work, materials or equipment
when permittee or the permittee's agent fails to act in a timely manner to
provide for the public health, safety or welfare. The maintenance deposit and/
or performance bond shall otherwise be for the purpose of guaranteeing
performance of work contemplated under the permit.
   B.   The amount and nature of the deposit shall be established by the city
engineer based on the size, duration, and/or nature of the encroachment.
   C.   Upon completion and acceptance of work under permit, any funds unused
shall be refunded to the permittee and any other bonds or security instruments
shall be released upon written request to the chief public works inspector.
Securities shall be processed for release no sooner than thirty (30) days after
the city deems project complete.
   D.   If any deposit or security is not sufficient for the protection of the
public interest in the public places, the city engineer may require an
additional deposit or an increase in the security in such amount as he or she
determines necessary. The permittee shall, upon demand, deposit the additional
cash or security.
   Upon failure or refusal to pay, the city engineer may revoke the permit,
issue a "Stop Work Notice" and/or recover the deficiency by appropriate action
in any court of competent jurisdiction. Until such deficiency is paid in full,
no other permit shall be issued to such permittee.
   E.   Where work is to be done by persons or utilities operating under a
franchise issued by the city or regulated by the state Public Utilities
Commission or utilities operated by governmental agencies, a permit may be
granted without making a deposit. In such cases, the permittee shall be liable
for the actual cost of any work to be done by the city in restoring the area
covered by the permit to the satisfaction of the city engineer.
(Ord. 264 § 1 (part), 2002)
15.54.130 Relocation or removal of encroachment.
   When any encroachment authorized hereunder is found to be in conflict with
the use of public property or existing or proposed facilities owned,
maintained, or operated by the city, such encroachment shall, upon written
notice by the city, be relocated in such a way as to eliminate the conflict,
said relocation to be at the sole expense of the permittee. If the permittee
fails to comply with said written notice within a reasonable period of time,
the city may cause such relocation of the encroachment at the expense of the
permittee.
(Ord. 264 § 1 (part), 2002)
15.54.140 Protection measures and routing of traffic.
   A.   Work Area Traffic Control Plan. When the proposed work, emergency or
scheduled, causes an impact to existing traffic operations, the applicant shall
submit a "Work Area Traffic Control Plan" for review by the city engineer.
(Note: Per the recommendation of the city engineer, additional plans may be
required.)
   B.   For emergency purposes, the city will allow work to proceed while the
"Work Area Traffic Control Plan" is being reviewed. If the plan is found
insufficient, a "Stop Work Notice" will be issued and in effect until such time
that an acceptable plan is submitted.
   C.   It shall be the duty of every person undertaking any encroachment, to
place and maintain barriers and warning devices necessary for safety of the
general public and to comply with the provisions of the conditions of the
encroachment permit.
   D.   For excavations over five feet in depth, blasting operations, and
tunneling work, the permittee shall, when required by law, obtain a permit from
the California Division of Industrial Safety and/or any other permit required
by state or federal safety regulations.

to the occupants of the adjoining property and to the general public. Permittee
shall conform to the requirements of the standard construction specifications.
   G.   When traffic conditions permit, the administrative authority may by
written approval, permit the closing of streets and alleys to all traffic for a
period of time prescribed by him or her. The written approval of the
administrative authority may require that the permittee provide approved
detours and give notification to various public agencies and to the general
public. In such cases, the written approval shall not be valid until notice is
given.
(Ord. 264 § 1 (part), 2002)
15.54.150 Clearance for vital structures.
   The encroachment shall be performed and conducted so as to not unreasonably
interfere with access to fire hydrants, fire stations, fire escapes, water
gates, underground vaults, valve housing structures and all other vital
equipment designated by the administrative authority. Permittee shall provide
alternate services or provisions if the process of work and its interference
with said structures cannot be avoided.

to property happening or occurring as a result of the design or performance of
any work undertaken under any encroachment permit granted pursuant to the
application. The applicant shall be required to provide proof of liability
insurance in the amount of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) and
shall name the city as an additional insured under the insurance policy. The
insurance shall be provided by a company satisfactory to the city. Any
deductible or self-insured retention under the insurance policy shall be in an
amount acceptable to the city. (Ord. 264 § 1 (part), 2002)
15.54.270 Revoking of permit.
   This chapter empowers the administrative authority with the right to cancel
any permit for good and sufficient cause, including violation of any provision
of this code or noncompliance with any encroachment permit condition.
(Ord. 264 § 1 (part), 2002)
15.54.280 Appeal.
   A.   In the event the application for the permit is denied in whole or in
part or the conditions imposed by the administrative authority are unacceptable
to the applicant, the applicant may appeal his or her decision to the city
council within ten days of receiving notice of the decision.
   B.   Appeals shall be in writing, shall state the specific reasons therefor
and grounds asserted for relief, and shall be filed with the city clerk within
ten calendar days after the date of the action being appealed. If an appeal is
not filed within the time or in the manner prescribed above, the right to
review of the action against which the complaint is made shall be deemed to
have been waived.

to time, adopt. The city engineer shall not participate in the decision of the
city council in such cases. If the city council is unable to render a decision,
the hearing officer's decision will be considered to be upheld.
   D.   The city council's decision on an appeal shall be furnished in writing
to the appellant and to the city engineer, and all such decisions shall be
final immediately.
(Ord. 264 § 1 (part), 2002)
15.54.290 Action after expiration of permit unlawful.
   It is unlawful for a person to place, erect or maintain or to permit the
placement, erection, maintenance or existence of any encroachment after his or
her permit has expired or after his or her permit has been revoked and the time
specified in the notice from the city clerk for removal of the same has
expired.
(Ord. 264 § 1 (part), 2002)
15.54.300 Removal required when--Notice.
   Any person whose property encroaches in any manner upon, over or under any
public property who has not obtained a permit for the placing, erection and/or
maintenance of such encroachment, shall remove the same after written notice by
the city demanding removal. Notice of removal shall be by certified mail
addressed to the post office address of the owner or occupant of the premises
where the encroachment exists, by personal service of such notice upon the
owner or occupant, or by posting the notice on the premises. The time required
for the removal of the encroachment shall be specified in the notice, and shall
be a reasonable time considering danger, risk and size of job.
(Ord. 264 § 1 (part), 2002)
15.54.310 Enforcement--Violation--Penalty.
   A.   Failure to pay fees and obtain a permit before commencing work shall be
deemed a violation of this code, except when an emergency existed which made
impractical to first obtain the permit. The determination of the existence of
an emergency shall be solely within the discretion of the city engineer using
the definition of emergency in this chapter as a guideline. A violation shall
result in an assessment of additional fees for work done prior to permit
issuance. The fee shall be the actual cost to the city resulting from illegal
activities performed by the applicant, his or her assignee, or his or her
employee. Payment of additional fee shall not relieve any person from fully
complying with the requirements of this code nor from other penalties
prescribed in this code. (Ord. 264 § 1 (part), 2002)
15.54.320 Exemptions.
   The city and its employees, acting in their official capacity, are exempt
from the requirements set forth in this chapter.

   The legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections
65302, 65560 and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry.
(Ord. 70 § 1 (part), 1992: Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 2.42.010)
15.56.020 Findings of fact.
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities,
and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. 70 § 1 (part), 1992: Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 2.42.020)
15.56.030 Statement of purpose.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designated:
   A.   To protect human life and health;
   B.   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   C.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   F.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight;
   G.   To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
   H.   To insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 70 § 1 (part), 1992: Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 2.42.030)
15.56.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   D.   Controlling fill, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 70 § 1 (part), 1992: Ord. 3 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 2.42.040)

interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH zone on the flood
insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet;
a clearly defined channel does not exit; the path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   Area of special flood hazard. See "special flood hazard area."
   "Area of special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazard" is the area subject to
severe mudslides (i.e., mudflows). The area is designated as Zone M on the
flood insurance rate map (FIRM).
   "Backfill" means the placement of fill material within a specified

final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the
effective date of this chapter.
   "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   "Fill material" can be natural sand, dirt, soil or rock. For the purposes of
floodplain management, fill material may include concrete, cement, soil cement,
brick or similar material as approved on a case-by-case basis.
   "Flood, flooding, or floodwater" means (a) a general and temporary condition
of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from (1) the
overflow of inland or tidal waters, (2) the unusual and rapid accumulation or
runoff of surface waters from any source, and/or (3) mudslides (i.e., mudflows)
which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in subsection (a)(2) of
this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the
surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of
water and deposited along the path of the current; and (b) the collapse or
subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result
of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding
anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level
in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an
unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge,
or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding.
   "Flood elevation determination" means a determination by the administrator
of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the flood level
that has a one percent or greater chance of occurrence in any given year.
   "Flood elevation study" means an examination, evaluation and determination
of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations,
or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow)
and/or flood-related erosion hazards.
   "Flood hazard boundary map" means the official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated
the areas of flood hazards.
   "Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk zones
applicable to the community.
   "Flood insurance study" means the official report provided by the Federal
Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, flood insurance rate
map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the surface elevation of the base
flood.
   "Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being
inundated by water from any source (see definition of "flooding").
   "Floodplain administrator" is the individual appointed by the city council
to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.
   "Floodplain management regulations" means zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances.
   "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures, and their contents.
   "Flood protection system" means those physical structural works for which
funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been
constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of
the area within the city subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of
the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane
tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood
modifying works are those constructed to conform with sound engineering
standards.
   "Flood-related erosion" means the collapse or subsidence of land along the
shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by
waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly
caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied
by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash
flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and
unforeseeable event which results in flooding.
   "Flood-related erosion area" or "flood-related erosion prone area" means a
land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which due to
the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven
currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage.
   "Flood-related erosion area management" means the operation of an overall
program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related
erosion damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans,
flood-related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations.
   "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
Also referred to as "regulatory floodway."
   "Floodway encroachment lines" means the lines marking the limits of
floodways on federal, state and local floodplain maps.
   "Floodway fringe" is the area of a floodplain on either side of the
designated floodway where encroachment may be permitted.
   "Fraud and victimization" related to Sections
15.56.230 through
15.56.240, of this chapter means that the variance granted must not cause fraud
on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, requests for
variances will be considered in view of the fact that every newly constructed
building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the city for
fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years
to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property
and the city as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger,
and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future
owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood
damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of
urbanization of the watershed.
   "Hardship" as related to Sections
15.56.230 through
15.56.240, of this chapter means the hardship that would result from a failure
to grant the requested variance. The city shall require that the variance be
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as exceptional hardships.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means, without granting a
variance. This is so even if the alternative means are more expensive or
complicated than building with a variance, or if they require the property
owner to put the parcel to a different use than originally intended, or to
build elsewhere.
   "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   "Historic structure" means any structure that is: (a) listed individually in
the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the
Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National
Register; (b) Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district registered historic district; (c) Individually
listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic
preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the
Interior; or (d) Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either; (1) by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the
Interior or (2) directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states with
approved programs.
   "Landfill" means a permitted location for the disposal, placement or dumping
of garbage, trash, debris, junk or waste material.
   "Levee" means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed
and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain,
control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.

levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter.
   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The

15.56.230 through
15.56.240, of this chapter means the minimum necessary to afford relief to the
applicant of a variance with a minimum deviation from the requirements of this
chapter. In the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the
city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, for
example, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only that
level that the city believes will provide relief and preserve the integrity of
this chapter.
   "Mudslide" (i.e., mudflow) describes a condition where there is a river,
flow or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside usually as a result of a dual

embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation,
channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel,
refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or
projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.

probability of being equalled or exceeded. It is identical to the "base flood,"
which will be the term used throughout this chapter.
   "Principal structure" means a structure used for the principal use of the
property as distinguished from an accessory use.
   "Public safety and nuisances" as related to Sections
15.56.230 and
15.56.240, of this chapter means the granting of a variance must not result in
additional threats to public safety or create nuisance. This chapter is
intended to help protect the health, safety, well-being, and property of the
local citizens. This is a long-range community effort made up of a combination
of approaches such as adequate drainage systems, warning and evacuation plans,
and keeping new property above the flood levels. These long-term goals can only
be met if exceptions to the requirements of this chapter are kept to a bare
minimum.

tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
   Sheet flow area. See "area of shallow flooding."
   "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area having special flood or
flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-
A30, AE, A99 or AH.
   "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from
the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which
equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure
before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes
structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either (1) any
project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state
or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been
identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) any alteration of a "historic
structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a "historic structure."
   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter
which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by
this chapter.
   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance
required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   "Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or
other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.

   B.   Such permits shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed site
alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion
and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the
existing hazard.
   C.   If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related
erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement shall be
relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating
the existing erosion hazard.
   D.   Within Zone E of the flood insurance rate map, a setback is required
for all new development from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront, or other body of
water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour
strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related erosion
hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated "useful life" of
structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic and
climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open
space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and
wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable
structures only.

15.56.230 Variance procedures--Conditions for variances.
   A.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-
half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of Sections
15.56.120 through
15.56.140 and Sections
15.56.150 through
15.56.220 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
   B.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "Historic
Structures" (as defined in
Section 15.56.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   C.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   D.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the "minimum necessary" as defined in
Section 15.56.050 of this chapter), considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
   E.   Variances shall only be issued upon (1) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (2) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional "hardship" (as defined in
Section 15.56.050 of this section) to the applicant; and (3) a determination
that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
"nuisances" (as defined in
Section 15.56.050 of this chapter), cause "fraud or victimization" (as defined
in
Section 15.56.050 of this chapter) of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
   F.   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement
and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that the provisions of
Section 15.56.240(A) through (E) are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
   G.   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection C of this section and
the purposes of this chapter, the city council of the city may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.

15.56.240 Variance procedures--Appeal board.
   A.   The city council of the city shall hear and decide appeals and requests
for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
   B.   The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there
is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the
floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   C.   In passing upon such applications, the city council shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and;
      1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      2.   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      5.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      6.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      9.   The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and,
      11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.
   D.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of the floodplain administrator or designee that (1)
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level
will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage and (2)
such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and
property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain board in the
office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in manner so that it
appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
   E.   The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance
Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency.

an ordinance that creates an expedited, streamlined permitting process for
small residential rooftop solar energy systems.
   B.   Section 65850.5 of the California Government Code provides that in
developing an expedited permitting process, the city, county, or city and
county shall adopt a checklist of all requirements with which small rooftop
solar energy systems shall comply to be eligible for expedited review. The
building official is hereby authorized and directed to develop and adopt such
checklist.
   C.   The checklist shall be published on the city's internet website. The
applicant may submit the permit application and associated documentation to the
City's building division by personal, mailed, or electronic submittal together
with any required permit processing and inspection fees. In the case of
electronic submittal, the electronic signature of the applicant on all forms,
applications and other documentation may be used in lieu of a wet signature.
(Ord. 503 § 1, 2015)
15.62.030   Pre-submittal requirements.
   Prior to submitting an application, the applicant shall:
   A.   Verify to the city's reasonable satisfaction through the use of
standard engineering evaluation techniques that the support structure for the
small residential rooftop solar energy system is stable and adequate to
transfer all wind, seismic, and dead and live loads associated with the system
to the building foundation; and
   B.   At the applicant's cost, verify to the city's reasonable satisfaction
using standard electrical inspection techniques that the existing electrical
system including existing line, load, ground and bonding wiring as well as main
panel and subpanel sizes are adequately sized, based on the existing electrical
system's current use, to carry all new photovoltaic electrical loads. (Ord. 503
§ 1, 2015)
15.62.040   Inspections required.
   For a small residential rooftop solar energy system eligible for expedited
review, only one inspection shall be required, which shall be done in a timely
manner and may include a consolidated inspection by the building official and

as determined by the building official or his designee shall be deemed
complete. Upon receipt of an incomplete application, the building official
shall issue a written correction notice detailing all deficiencies in the
application and any additional information required to be eligible for
expedited permit issuance.
   Upon confirmation by the building official of the application and supporting
documentation being complete and meeting the requirements of the checklist, the
building official shall administratively approve the application and issue all
required permits or authorizations. Such approval does not authorize an
applicant to connect the small residential rooftop energy system to the local
utility provider's electricity grid. The applicant is responsible for obtaining
such approval or permission from the local utility provider.
   The building official may require an applicant to apply for a minor use
permit if the official finds, based on substantial evidence, that the solar
energy system could have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health and
safety. Such decisions may be appealed to the Planning Commission. If a minor
use permit is required, the city may deny such application if it makes written
findings based upon substantive evidence in the record that the proposed
installation would have a specific, adverse impact upon public health or safety
and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid, as
defined, the adverse impact. Such findings shall include the basis for the
rejection of the potential feasible alternative for preventing the adverse
impact. (Ord. 503 § 1, 2015)

16.04.010 Purpose.
This chapter provides rules for resolving questions about the meaning or
applicability of any part of this development code. The provisions of this
chapter are intended to ensure the consistent interpretation and application of
the provisions of this development code and the general plan.
(Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.04.020 Rules of Interpretation.
   A.   Authority. The director is assigned the responsibility and authority to
interpret the requirements of this development code.
   B.   Language.
      1.   Abbreviated Titles and Phrases. For the purpose of brevity, the
following phrases, personnel and document titles are shortened hereafter in
this development code. The city of Murrieta is referred to hereafter as the
"city." The city of Murrieta development code is referred to hereafter as "this
development code." The development services director is referred to hereafter
as "director," the city council is referred to as the "council," the planning
commission is referred to as the "commission." "Buildings and structures" are
referred to hereafter as "structures."
      2.   Terminology. When used in this development code, the words "shall,"
"must," "will," "is to," and "are to" are always mandatory. "Should" is not
mandatory but is strongly recommended; and "may" is per-missive. The present
tense includes the past and future tenses; and the future tense includes the
present. The singular number includes the plural number, and the plural the
singular, unless the natural construction of the word indicates otherwise. The
words "includes" and "including" shall mean "including but not limited to."
      3.   Number of Days. Whenever a number of days is specified in this
development code, or in any permit, condition of approval, or notice issued or
given as provided in this development code, the number of days shall be
construed as calendar days. Time limits will extend to the following working
day where the last of the specified number of days falls on a weekend or
holiday.
      4.   Minimum Requirements. When interpreting and applying the regulations
of this development code, all provisions shall be considered to be minimum
requirements, unless stated otherwise (e.g., height limits and site coverage
requirements for structures, and the numbers and size of signs allowed are
maximums, not minimums).
      5.   State Law Requirements. Where this development code references
applicable provisions of state law (e.g., the California Government Code,
Subdivision Map Act, Public Resources Code, etc.), the reference shall be
construed to be to the applicable state law provisions as they may be amended
from time to time.
   C.   Zoning Map Boundaries. If there is uncertainty about the location of
any zoning district boundary shown on the official zoning map, the following
rules are to be used in resolving the uncertainty:
      1.   Where district boundaries approximately follow lot, alley, or street
lines, the lot lines and street and alley centerlines shall be construed as the
district boundaries;
      2.   If a district boundary divides a parcel and the boundary line
location is not specified by distances printed on the zoning map, the most
appropriate zoning for the property will be determined through the review of a
zoning change application;
      3.   Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned,
the property that was formerly in the street or alley will be included within
the zoning district of the adjoining property on either side of the centerline
of the vacated or abandoned street or alley.
      4.   Where a public street or alley is officially realigned, the zoning
district boundary line shall automatically be adjusted to the new centerline of
the public street or alley, and the area on either side of the new street or
alley centerline shall be zoned the same as the adjacent property. This
automatic adjustment in zoning district boundaries only applies if the
resulting zone change reduces and/or increases the zoning districts area by a
maximum of 5%; otherwise, a zone change and possible general plan amendment is
required.
   D.   Allowable Uses of Land. If a proposed use of land is not specifically
listed in Article II (Zoning Districts and Allowed Land Uses), the use shall
not be allowed, except as follows:
      1.   Similar Uses Allowed. The director may determine that a proposed use
that is not listed in Article II is allowable if the proposed use is
substantially the same in character and intensity as those listed in Article
II. Such a use is subject to the permit process that governs the category in
which it falls.
      2.   Applicable Standards and Permit Requirements. When the director
determines that a proposed, but unlisted, use is similar to a listed use, the
proposed use will be treated in the same manner as the listed use in
determining where it is allowed, what permits are required and what other
standards and requirements of this development code apply.
      3.   Commission Determination. The director may forward questions about
similar uses directly to the commission for a determination.
      4.   Medical Marijuana Dispensary Uses of Land Prohibited. Any use of
land as a medical marijuana dispensary or mobile medical marijuana dispensary
anywhere in the city is prohibited. Use of land as a medical marijuana
dispensary or mobile medical marijuana dispensary is not substantially the same
in character and intensity as any other use of land in Article II and no
application may be made to the director or otherwise to the city for such a
determination.
   E.   Conflicting Requirements:
      1.   Development Code and Municipal Code Provisions. If conflicts occur
between requirements of this development code, or between this development code
and other regulations of the city, the most restrictive shall apply.
      2.   Development Agreements or Specific Plans. When conflicts occur
between the requirements of this development code and standards adopted as part
of a development agreement or specific plan, the requirements of the
development agreement or specific plan shall apply.
      3.   Private Agreements. This development code applies to all land uses
and development regardless of whether it imposes a greater or lesser
restriction on the development or use of structures or land than a private
agreement or restriction, without affecting the applicability of the agreement
or restriction. The city shall not enforce private covenants or agreements
unless it is a party to the covenant or agreement.

Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.04.030 Procedures for Interpretations.
Whenever the director determines that the meaning or applicability of the
requirements of this development code are subject to interpretation generally
or as applied to a specific case, the director may issue an official
interpretation. Interpretations may also be requested in compliance with this
section.
   A.   Request for Interpretation. A request shall be written, specifically
state the provision(s) in question, and provide information to assist in their
review.
   B.   Record of Interpretations. Official interpretations shall be:
      1.   In writing, and shall quote the provisions of this development code
being interpreted, and explain their meaning or applicability in the particular
or general circumstances that caused the need for interpretation; and
      2.   Distributed to the council, commission, city attorney, city clerk,
and department staff.
Provisions of this development code that are determined by the director to need
refinement or revision should be corrected by amending this development code as
soon as is practical. Until amendments can occur, the director will maintain a
record of official interpretations, available for public review, and indexed by
the number of the Section that is the subject of the interpretation.
   C.   Appeals and Referral. Interpretations of this development code by the
director may be appealed to the commission as provided by 16.78 (Appeals). The
director may also refer interpretations to the commission for a determination.

16.08.010 Purpose.
This chapter provides regulations applicable to development and new land uses
in the residential zoning districts established by
16.06.010 (Zoning Districts Established). The purposes of the individual
residential zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as
follows:
   A.   RR (Rural Residential) District. The RR zoning district identifies
areas intended for low density, large lot single-family uses within a rural
atmosphere, and may include the keeping of horses and other livestock,
including kennels, as a permitted use in conjunction with the main residential
use. Agricultural uses are allowable especially for buffering smaller lot
single-family designations. The allowable density range is from 0.1 to 0.4
dwelling units per acre, with a minimum parcel size of 2.5 acres, unless
designated within a master plan overlay. The RR zoning district is consistent
with the large lot residential designation of the general plan;
   B.   ER-1 (Estate Residential 1) District. The ER-1 zoning district
identifies areas appropriate for large lot single-family uses, and allows for
the keeping of horses and other livestock in conjunction with the main
residential use, including small scale agricultural uses appropriate far
buffering smaller lot single-family designations. The allowable density range
is from 0.4 to 1.0 dwelling units per acre, with a minimum parcel size of one
acre, unless designated within a master plan overlay. The ER-1 zoning district
is consistent with the large lot residential land use designations of the
general plan;
   C.   ER-2 (Estate Residential 2) District. The ER-2 zoning district
identifies areas appropriate for large lot single-family uses, and allows for
the keeping of horses and other livestock in conjunction with the main
residential use, including small scale agricultural uses appropriate for
buffering smaller lot single-family designations. The allowable density range
is from 1.0 to 2.0 dwelling units per acre, with a minimum parcel size of one-
half acre, unless designated within a master plan overlay. The ER-2 zoning
district is consistent with the single-family residential land use designations
of the general plan;
   D.   ER-3 (Estate Residential 3) District. The ER-3 zoning district
identifies areas appropriate for large lot single-family uses. This district is
an appropriate transition zone between rural and the single family zones. The
allowable density range is from 2.0 to 3.0 dwelling units per acre, with a
minimum parcel size of ten thousand (10,000) square feet The ER-3 zoning
district is consistent with the single-family residential designations of the
general plan;
   E.   SF-1 (Single-Family Residential 1) District. The SF-1 zoning district
is applied to parcels appropriate for single-family subdivisions with a uniform
lot pattern possessing a minimum parcel size of seven thousand two hundred
(7,200) square feet. The allowable density range is from 2.1 to 5.0 units per
acre. The SF-1 zoning district is consistent with the single-family residential
land use designation of the general plan;
   F.   SF-2 (Single-Family Residential 2) District. The SF-2 zoning district
is applied to parcels appropriate for single-family subdivisions which may
include detached and attached single-family dwelling units with common walls.
For attached units configured within two to three unit configurations, a
planned residential development application is required. The allowable density
range is from 5.1 to 10.0 units per acre. The minimum parcel size for detached
single-family units is four thousand three hundred fifty (4,350) square feet,
although a smaller lot size can be considered for the clustering of units. This
can be accomplished through a planned residential development application
process and associated findings. See Section
16.16.020 “Planned residential development general standards” for additional
details and requirements. The clustering of units through the planned
residential development review process is to encourage an aggregate of open
space with units on individual parcels with commonly maintained open space, and
on-site recreational facilities required. The SF-2 zoning district is
consistent with the residential land use designation of the general plan;
   G.   MF-1 (Multi-Family Residential 1) District. The MF-1 zoning district is
applied to parcels appropriate for low density multi-family subdivisions which
may include stacked flats or townhouse development, with ample amounts of open
space, including required commonly maintained recreational and open space
facilities. Air space, or postage stamp subdivisions providing individual
ownership are allowed. The allowable density range is from 10.1 to fifteen (15)
units per acre. The minimum parcel size for single-family detached units is
five thousand (5,000) square feet. Clustering of units to provide aggregate
open space is encouraged, with commonly maintained open space, and on-site
recreation facilities. The MF-1 zoning district is consistent with the multi-
family residential land use designation of the general plan;
   H.   MF-2 (Multi-Family Residential 2) District. The MF-2 zoning district is
applied to parcels appropriate for high density multi-family development, in
which attached or detached dwelling units may be air-space condominiums, or
rented as apartments under single ownership. Senior housing, congregate care or
group facilities are allowed, with commonly maintained recreational facilities
and open space required. The allowable density range is from 15.1 to eighteen
(18) units per acre. The MF-2 zoning district is consistent with the multi-
family residential land use designation of the general plan; and
   I.   MF-3 (Multi-Family Residential 3) District. The MF-3 zoning district is
applied to parcels appropriate for higher density multi-family development, in
which attached dwelling units, senior housing and assisted living facilities
are allowed with commonly maintained recreational facilities and open space
required. The allowable density range is from 18.1 to 29 units per acre. The
MF-3 zoning district is consistent with the multi-family residential land use
designation of the general plan.
   J.   MF-4 (Multi-Family Residential 4) District. The MF-4 zoning district is
applied to parcels appropriate for the highest density multi-family
development, in which large buildings of attached dwelling units, senior
housing and affordable housing are allowed with commonly maintained
recreational facilities and open space required. The allowable density range is
a minimum of 30 units per acre. The MF-4 zoning district is consistent with the
multi-family residential land use designation of the general plan.

16.08.030 Single-family Residential Design Standards and Design Features.
The following standards and design features are provided to ensure a level of
quality that must be compiled with or satisfied in all new single-family
residential subdivisions. Standards are mandatory requirements for all new
single-family residential subdivisions. Design features are provided to allow
flexibility by providing options for implementing specific standards. In order
to meet a certain standard, one or a combination of design features shall be
incorporated in the project’s design. In some instances, there will be no
design feature(s) identified for a particular standard.
   A.   Site Planning. The following standards and design features deal with
the internal organization of new single-family residential development. The
intent of the standards and design features are to ensure that the
relationships of units to each other and to other on-site uses are functional,
attractive, and create visual variety along the project's streets.
      1.   Site Character.
         a.   Standard: Existing natural amenities (e.g., views, mature trees,
and topographic features) and other amenities (e.g., structures of
architectural significance and cultural resources) unique to the site shall be
preserved and incorporated into the project's design whenever possible.
         b.   Standard: Development on sloped properties shall generally follow
the natural contours of the land by use of at least one of the following design
features:
            1)   Terrace parking lots to conform with the terrain.
            2)   Step building foundations and retaining walls to follow
natural terrain.
            3)   Avoid grading large, flat pads in hilly terrain.
            4)   Provide larger setbacks to preserve natural landforms.
      2.   Variation of Development Patterns.
         a.   Standard: Variation of development patterns shall be incorporated
in new subdivisions to achieve visual diversity and avoid a monotonous
appearance by use of at least one of the following design features:
            1)   Alternate placement of homes and garages closer to and farther
back from the street to create different patterns of open space along the
street edge and to break up an otherwise monotonous view of houses built along
the same setback.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3079.gif]
            2)   Vary the distance between adjacent structures, or between
structures and fences to result in different types of yards and private patio
areas and to create variety and interest.
            3)   Design some lots wider and some narrower than the average to
provide different amounts of open area between structures and to allow
placement of different shapes and sizes of homes. On narrow lots, a variation
of only three or four feet can make a perceptible difference in the street
scene.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ff6b6c3a544be3d7cac76476080ed2ade3ea3350/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3081.gif]
            4)   When lot size permits. vary garage placement and orientation
through the provision of garages on the front side of the house, which can be
entered from the front or side, garages that vary in size. or detached garages
connected to the home by breezeways.

discouraged, but may be considered provided they incorporate at least one of
the following design features:
            1)   Significant differences shall be incorporated in the massing
and composition (not just finish materials) of each adjacent house. Varied
designs shall not be repeated more frequently than every fourth house.
            2)   Each group of three adjacent houses shall contain at least one
house whose front setback differs from those of its neighbors by a minimum of
five feet. Minimum setback requirements may be reduced to eighteen (18) feet to
accommodate this variation. Average front yard setback shall be no less than
twenty (20) feet.
            3)   Curved streets shall be integrated into the block design with
radii to the centerline of the street, in conformance with city standards.

16.10.010 Purpose.
This chapter provides regulations applicable to development and new land uses
in the commercial zoning districts established by
16.06.010 (Zoning Districts Established). The purposes of the individual
commercial zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as
follows:
   A.   NC (Neighborhood Commercial) District. The NC zoning district is
applied to areas appropriate for convenience shopping, including individual
retail and service uses and small destination centers on sites generally three
to ten acres in size. Appropriate buffering between adjacent residential
designations is required. The NC zoning district is consistent with the
commercial land use designation of the general plan;
   B.   CC (Community Commercial) District.  The CC zoning district is applied
to areas appropriate to serve the daily shopping needs of the community,
including destination centers, supermarkets, and smaller, single-lot,
commercial activities. Financial, office and restaurant activities are also
allowed. Appropriate buffering between adjacent residential designations is
required. Community centers are generally ten (10) to thirty (30) acres in
size. The CC zoning district is consistent with the commercial land use
designation of the general plan;
   C.   RC (Regional Commercial) District. The RC zoning district is applied to
areas appropriate for major regional centers containing several major anchor
tenants, including, but not limited to, financial, hotel, motel, restaurant,
smaller retail, theater and accessory uses, with landscaping, parking access,
and signs designed and provided in common. Regional centers are generally
thirty (30) acres or larger in size. The RC zoning district is consistent with
the commercial land use designation of the general plan.

   This chapter provides regulations applicable to development and land uses in
the Office and Office Research Park Districts established by 16.06.010 (Zoning
Districts Established). The purposes of the individual Office and Office
Research Park zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as
follows:
   A.   Office (O) District. The Office zoning district is applied to areas
appropriate primarily for office uses with commercial uses (financial, hotel,
personal services, restaurant, etc.) oriented to serve the customers and
employees of the office uses, and limited community services to serve the
residents of the city. The Office zoning district is consistent with the Office
and Research Park land use designation of the general plan; and
   B.   Office Research Park (ORP) District. The ORP zoning district is applied
to areas appropriate primarily for office, medical, business campuses with
associate research and development facilities. Commercial uses (financial,
hotel, retail, personal service, and restaurant, etc.) are intended as
accessory or support uses for the employees and customers of the office,
business, and medical uses with their associate and research and development
operations. The ORP zoning district is consistent with the Office and Research
Park land use designation of the general plan.

   C.   Architectural Design.
      1.   Architectural Style.
         a.   Standard: No specific architectural style or design theme shall

proportion. Structures shall be designed to avoid a "box-like," impersonal
appearance by use of at least two of the following design features:
            1)   Provide horizontal and vertical wall articulation through the
use of arcades, towers, wall recesses and projections, and setting back upper
floors. Facades should incorporate wall plane projects and recesses having a
depth of at least three percent of the length of the facade and extending at
least twenty (20) percent of the length of the facade.
            2)   Provide architectural detail through the use of columns,
three-dimensional decorative cornice bands, recessed entries and windows, and
awnings and canopies.
            3)   Provide full roofs with substantial overhangs.
            4)   Incorporate decorative parapets where roof overhangs are not
provided.
            5)   Use different, but compatible, building materials with varying
textures and colors.
         b.   Standard: Entries shall be protected from the elements and shall
create a focus and sense of entry for the building by use of at least two of
the following design features:
            1)   Provide wall recesses.
            2)   Use roof overhangs.
            3)   Incorporate canopies and awnings.
            4)   Include arcades.
            5)   Install pedestrian oriented signs.
      4.   Roofs.
         a.   Standard: Variations in roof lines shall be used to add interest
to, and reduce the massive scale of large commercial buildings. Roofs shall
incorporate at least two of the following features:
            1)   Parapets concealing flat roofs and rooftop equipment. The
average height of a parapet shall not exceed fifteen (15) percent of the height
of the supporting wall and parapets shall not at any point exceed one-third the
height of the supporting wall. Parapets shall incorporate a three-dimensional
cornice.
            2)   Overhanging eaves, extending at least three feet past the
supporting walls.
            3)   Sloping roofs that do not exceed the average height of the
supporting walls with an average slope greater than or equal to one-foot for
vertical rise for every three feet of horizontal run and less than or equal to
one-foot of vertical rise for every one-foot of horizontal run.
            4)   Three or more roof slope planes.
         b.   Standard: Parapet walls shall be treated as an integral part of
the structure design.
         c.   Standard: Parapet walls should receive architectural detailing
consistent with the rest of the facade design and should not appear as
unrelated elements intended only to screen the roof behind.
         d.   Standard: Where a mansard roof is incorporated into the parapet
design, views from above the structure should also be considered relative to
any visible structural support elements.
      5.   Building Materials.
         a.   Standard: False or decorated facade treatments, wherein one or
more unrelated materials appear to be "stuck on" a building, shall be avoided.
         b.   Standard: Fake products that attempt to imitate real materials
(e.g., wood, stone, brick, etc.) are not allowed.
         c.   Standard: The composition of materials shall avoid giving the
impression of thinness and artificiality.
         d.   Standard: Veneers shall turn corners, avoiding exposed edges.
         e.   Standard: Stock, "off-the-shelf" metal buildings are prohibited
as primary structures.
      6.   Colors.
         a.   Standard: Facade colors shall be low reflective, subtle, neutral
or earth tone colors. The use of high-intensity colors, metallic colors, black,
or fluorescent colors is prohibited.
         b.   Standard: Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter
colors, including primary colors, but neon tubing shall not be an acceptable
feature for building trim or accent areas except for movie theatres.
         c.   Standard: The transition between base and accent colors shall
relate to changes in building materials or the change of building surface
planes. Colors should not meet or change without some physical change or
definition to the surface plane.
      7.   Additions to Existing Structures.
         a.   Standard: The design of an addition to an existing structure
shall follow the general scale, proportion, massing, and detailing of the
original structure. The addition shall be harmonious with the original
structure, not a stark contrast.
         b.   Standard: Additions shall be an interpretation of the existing
building wherein the main characteristics of the existing structure are
incorporated into the design of the addition by use of at least two of the
following design features:
            1)   Repeat window and door spacing;
            2)   Use harmonizing colors and materials; and/or
            3)   Include similar, yet distinct, architectural details (e.g.,
window/door trim, lighting fixtures, tile/brick decoration, etc.).

16.12.010 Purpose.
This chapter provides regulations applicable to development and new land uses
in the business park and industrial districts established by
16.06.010 (Zoning Districts Established). The purposes of the individual
business park and industrial zoning districts and the manner in which they are
applied are as follows:
   A.   BP (Business Park) District. The BP zoning district is applied to
appropriate areas for assembly, fabrication, light manufacturing, materials
processing, offices and research and product development, provided the uses are
conducted within an enclosed, controlled setting. Limited retail activities, to
serve the primary business park tenants, is also allowed. The BP zoning
district is consistent with the business park land use designation of the
general plan; and
   B.   GIA (General Industrial–A) District. The GI-A zoning district is
applied to appropriate areas for outdoor storage of materials and vehicles,
small scale manufacturing, and handicraft industries. The GI-A zoning district
is consistent with the industrial land use designation of the general plan; and
   C.   GI (General Industrial) District. The GI zoning district is applied to
appropriate areas for the processing of raw materials and manufactured parts or
products, including bulk storage, distribution and warehousing facilities,
which may require appropriate buffering from adjacent commercial and
residential designations, and additional review for outdoor assembly and
storage. The GI zoning district is consistent with the general industrial land
use designation of the general plan

16.12.030 Business Park and Industrial Zoning Districts Design Standards.
The following standards and design features are provided to ensure a level of
quality that must be compiled with or satisfied in all industrial developments.
Standards are mandatory requirements for all industrial developments. Design
features are provided to allow flexibility by providing options for
implementing specific standards. In order to meet a certain standard, one or a
combination of design features shall be incorporated in the project’s design.
   A.   Site Planning.  The following standards and parameters are intended to
help ensure internal consistency with sound industrial site development
practices.
      1.   Site Design.
         a.   Standard: The following design elements shall be incorporated
into the design of industrial projects whenever possible (See figure below):
            1)   Controlled site access (1);
            2)   Service areas located at the sides and rear of buildings (2);
            3)   Convenient public access and visitor parking (3);
            4)   Screening of storage, work areas, and mechanical equipment
(4);
            5)   Storage and service area screen walls (5); and
            6)   Emphasis on the main building entry and landscaping (6).
         b.   Standard: Buildings shall be arranged to avoid long, monotonous
building facades and to create diversity by use of at least one of the
following design features:
            1)   Set portions of the building at the front setback line with
other portions set further back (minimum ten foot offset);
            2)   Cluster buildings around courtyards, plazas, and landscaped
open spaces;
            3)   Set buildings on "turf islands" where the office portion of
the building does not directly abut parking areas. Provide a generous ten- to
twenty- (20-) foot landscaped strip between the parking area and the main
entrance; or
            4)   Avoid placing parking between the street and the building for
more than fifty (50) percent of the parcel frontage.
         c.   Standard: Larger than minimum required building setbacks shall be
provided for buildings thirty (30) feet high or higher. Buildings shall be set
back an additional five feet (all sides) for each additional ten feet of
building height over thirty (30) feet.
         d.   Standard: Where an industrial use is adjacent to a nonindustrial
use, appropriate buffering techniques shall be provided in compliance with
Section
16.18.120 (Screening and Buffering).
      2.   Parking, Loading, and Circulation.
         a.   Standard:  Parking lots and cars shall not be the dominant visual
elements of the site. Projects should incorporate at least one of the following
design features:
            1)   Provide multiple smaller parking lots as opposed to large
lots;
            2)   Provide dense landscaping and walls to screen parking lots; or
            3)   Locate parking on the side or at the rear of the site.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3149.gif]
         b.   Standard: Site access and internal circulation shall be designed
in a straight forward manner with emphasis on safety and efficiency. The
circulation system shall be designed to reduce conflicts between vehicular and
pedestrian traffic, provide adequate maneuvering and stacking areas, and
consideration for emergency vehicle access.
         c.   Standard: Meandering sidewalks shall be provided in all
industrial zoning districts when required by the director.
         d.   Standard: Parking lots adjacent to public streets shall be
screened from view in compliance with
16.34 (Off-Street Parking and Loading).
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ff6b6c3a544be3d7cac76476080ed2ade3ea3350/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3151.gif]
         e.   Standard: Loading facilities shall not be located at the front of
buildings where it is difficult to screen them from view. Loading facilities
are more appropriate at the rear of the site or on the side with adequate
screening.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ff6b6c3a544be3d7cac76476080ed2ade3ea3350/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3153.gif]
         f.   Standard: When it is not possible to locate loading facilities at
the rear or side of the building, they may be allowed on the front if properly
screened from view with dense landscaping and walls. Loading facilities shall
not directly align with driveways where screening cannot be provided
effectively.
         g.   Standard: Backing from the public street onto the site for
loading shall not be allowed except at the ends of industrial cul-de-sacs where
each circumstance will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
      3.   Screening.
         a.   Standard: Outside storage and loading shall be confined to
portions of the site least visible to public view and appropriately screened in
compliance with
16.18.120 (Screening and Buffering).
         b.   Standard: Screening methods shall consist of at least one of the
following design features:
            1)   Solid masonry walls with landscape relief;
            2)   Open metal grillwork with masonry pillars and dense
landscaping; or
            3)   Earth berms with dense landscaping.
         c.   Standard: The method of screening shall be architecturally
integrated with the adjacent building in terms of materials, colors, texture,
and size.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ff6b6c3a544be3d7cac76476080ed2ade3ea3350/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3155.gif]
      4.   Screen Walls/Fencing.
         a.   Standard: If walls are not required for a specific screening or
security purpose they shall not be provided. Walls provide hiding places for
intruders and surfaces for graffiti. The intent is to keep walls as low as
possible while performing their screening and security functions.
         b.   Standard: When security fencing is required, it shall not include
barbed wire or razor wire. Chain link fencing is not allowed along street
frontages. Security fencing shall be:
            1)   Masonry pillars with open metal grillwork;
            2)   Short (two-three feet) masonry walls with grillwork on top;
and
            3)   Open grillwork or chainlink fence along side and rear property
boundaries or used internally on the site if not visible from the public
street.
         c.   Standard: Long expanses offences and walls shall be offset and
architecturally designed to create interest and avoid monotony. Landscape
pockets, a minimum of twelve (12) feet wide and four feet deep, shall be
provided at forty (40)-foot minimum intervals along the wall. These dimensions
may vary somewhat, as long as the overall effect is the same, subject to
approval by the director.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ff6b6c3a544be3d7cac76476080ed2ade3ea3350/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3157.gif]
      5.   Landscaping Standards.
         a.   Standard: Landscaping shall be used to define entrances to
buildings and parking lots, edges of various land uses, provide transition
between neighboring properties (buffering), and provide screening for outdoor
storage, loading and equipment areas.
         b.   Standard: Landscaping shall be in scale with on-site buildings
and be of an appropriate size at maturity to accomplish its intended purpose.
         c.   Standard: The use of vines on walls is required in industrial
areas because walls often tend to be large and blank. Vines will provide
texture, add color, break up flat walls, and reduce opportunities for graffiti.
         d.   Standard: Landscaping around the base of the building is
required, except for work and loading areas that are not visible from a public
street or parking lot. Landscaping shall be accented at the main entrance to
provide a prominent focal point.
   B.   Architectural Design Standards.
      1.   General.
         a.   Standard: Industrial buildings tend to be large and box-like. At
least four of the following design parameters shall be incorporated to decrease
the negative visual impact of large industrial uses.
            1)   Use variety in building forms and heights to create visual
character and interest.
            2)   Provide building indentations and architectural details:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ff6b6c3a544be3d7cac76476080ed2ade3ea3350/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3159.gif]
            3)   Accentuate the building's main entrance.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ff6b6c3a544be3d7cac76476080ed2ade3ea3350/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3162.gif]
            4)   Change building elevations and use berming at the edge of the
building in conjunction with landscaping to help reduce the visual height and
mass of buildings along street frontage;
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ff6b6c3a544be3d7cac76476080ed2ade3ea3350/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3164.gif]
            5)   Use alteration of colors and materials to produce diversity
and visual interest;
            6)   Avoid large blank, flat wall surfaces;
            7)   Do not construct walls of exposed, untreated concrete block
(except split face);
            8)   Do not provide exposed roof drains; or
            9)   Avoid minimal landscaping that is too small and out of scale
with large industrial buildings.
         c.   Standard: Avoid long (over one hundred (100) feet)) unbroken
building facades. Facades with varied front setbacks are required.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ff6b6c3a544be3d7cac76476080ed2ade3ea3350/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3166.gif]
         d.   Standard: Entries to industrial buildings shall portray a quality
office appearance while being architecturally related to the overall building
composition.
      2.   Roofs.
         a.   Standard: Roof-top equipment shall be screened from view by
architectural features integrated with the design of the structure.
         b.   Standard: A variety of roof pitches is encouraged, especially at
the main entrance.
      3.   Materials.
         a.   Standard: A variety of siding material, (e.g., metal, masonry,
concrete texturing, cement, or plaster) shall be used to produce effects of
texture and relief that provide architectural interest.
         b.   Standard: Avoid materials with high maintenance (e.g., stained
wood, clapboard, or shingles).
         c.   Standard: Use wall materials (e.g., concrete, stone, cement
block, or slumpstone) that will withstand accidental damage from machinery.
      4.   Metal Buildings.
         a.   Standard: Stock, "off-the-shelf" metal buildings are prohibited
as primary structures. Metal buildings shall be designed to have an exterior
appearance of conventionally built structures by use of at least one of the
following design features:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ff6b6c3a544be3d7cac76476080ed2ade3ea3350/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3168.gif]
            1)   Exterior surfaces should include materials in addition to
metal (e.g., stucco, plaster, glass, stone, brick, or decorative masonry).
            2)   Employ a variety of building forms, shapes, colors, and other
architectural treatments to add visual interest and variety.
         b.   Standard: All exterior surfaces that have the potential of being
contacted by vehicles or machinery shall be protected by landscaped areas,
raised concrete curbs, and traffic barriers.
      5.   Color.
         a.   Standard: Use color to help reduce the apparent size of
industrial structures. Incorporate at least two of the following design
features:
            1)   Light, neutral colors should be used to help reduce a
structure's perceived size.
            2)   Use contrasting trim and horizontal color bands to help break
up the vertical monotony of tall flat walls.
            3)   Provide a blending of compatible colors in a single facade or
composition to add interest and variety while reducing building scale.
         b.   Standard: Overly bright colors (e.g., day-glo) and intricate
patterns of color (e.g., checkerboard) shall be avoided.

16.13.010 Purpose.
This chapter provides regulations applicable to development and land uses in
the Innovation Zoning District (INN) as established by 16.06.010 (Zoning
Districts Established). The Innovation Zoning District is applied to areas
primarily for business and medical offices, corporate headquarters, medical
services, business campuses with associated research and development
facilities, education, technological advancement, makers labs such as people
using digital tools to design new products, and craftsman products such as
furniture and window design/construction. A limited amount of commercial uses
are allowed within the Innovation Zoning District. Examples of allowable
commercial uses include: businesses that sell products made in facilities on-
site, restaurants that support the employment and primary uses, and hotels.
Commercial businesses are intended as support services for the employees and
customers of the office, business, and medical uses with their associated
research and development operations. The Innovation Zoning District provides
for a limited amount of housing as a supporting use to a facility such as a
hospital, college or university, research and development campus that would
directly benefit from having employees and students living on-site.

areas onto existing or planned amenities (e.g. parks, open space, and water
features) and/or streets.
         d.   Standard: Frontage roads or drives shall be provided adjacent to
open space areas unless a project is designed to provide direct pedestrian
access to the open space and the road or drive is not otherwise necessary.
         e.   Standard: Buildings over 10,000 square feet in size shall include
an outdoor employee seating area for use during breaks and/or for lunch.
      2.   Land Use Buffering.
         a.   Standard: Noise, traffic, or odor-generating activities should be
located adjacent to similar activities on adjacent properties whenever
possible. Buffering between different land uses shall be in compliance with
Section
16.18.120 (Screening and Buffering).
         b.   Standard: Loading areas, access and circulation driveways, trash
enclosures, and mechanical equipment should be located within the project as-
far-as practical from any adjacent residences.
         c.   Standard: When adjoining uses can mutually benefit from
connection rather than separation, appropriate connective elements (e.g.,
walkways, common landscape areas, building orientation, and unfenced property
lines) should be provided between the uses.
         d.   Standard: Window orientation in nonresidential buildings should
preclude a direct line of sight into adjacent residential units and private
open spaces located within one hundred (100) feet of the shared property line.
Required, maintained landscaping for screening, such as evergreen trees, may
provide a barrier to block the direct line of sight.
         e.   Standard: When nonresidential buildings back-up to open space
areas of residential projects, parks, or open space districts, the rear setback
area shall be landscaped (consistent with Section 16.28) with direct line of
sight obscuring vegetation to screen parking lots.
      3.   Building Placement.
         a.   Standard: Projects containing multiple buildings shall place a
minimum fifteen percent (15%) building frontage adjacent to the front setback
line. The Director may waive or reduce this standard for projects where
implementation of this standard is not feasible.

16.14 Special Purpose Districts
Sections:
   
16.14.010   Purpose.
16.14.010 Purpose.
This chapter provides regulations applicable to development and new land uses
in the special purpose zoning districts established by Section
16.06.010 (Zoning Districts Established). The purposes of the individual
special purpose zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are
as follows:
   A.   C/I (Civic/Institutional) District. The C/I zoning district is applied
to parcels appropriate for a variety of public uses, including civic centers,
educational facilities, general aviation airports, government offices,
hospitals, libraries and public agency facilities which may require appropriate
buffering from adjacent residential designations. The C/I zoning district is
consistent with the civic/institutional land use designation of the general
plan;
   B.   P&R (Parks and Recreation) District. The P&R zoning district is applied
to appropriate areas for active and passive open space and recreational areas
generally open to the public. Development in this designation is subject to
special review by the city. Additional details and policies for recreation/
parks is included in the conservation and open space element. The P&R zoning

16.16.030   Planned Residential Development Design Standards and Parameters.
   
16.16.040   Transit Development Oriented Overlay.
16.16.010 Purpose.
   A.   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidance for
development and new land uses in addition to the standards and regulations of
the primary zoning district, where important area, neighborhood or site
characteristics require particular attention in project planning.
   B.   Applicability. The applicability of any overlay zoning district to
specific sites is shown by the overlay zoning map symbol established by Section
16.06.010 (Zoning Districts Established). The provisions of this chapter apply
to development and new uses in addition to all other applicable requirements of
this development code. In the event of any perceived conflict between the
provisions of this chapter and any other provision of this development code,
this chapter shall control.
   C.   The Combining and Overlay Districts Include the Following:
      1.   MPO (Master Plan) Overlay District. The MPO designation is applied
to appropriate parcels with unique characteristics or circumstances that
require additional development review. The district is subject to the density
of the base zoning district and provides for clustering of residential dwelling
units within projects in compliance with the master development plan process.
         a.   Master Development Plan Required. For any project with a master
plan overlay designation, a master development plan shall be prepared pursuant
to
Chapter 16.64 of the development code, except that a specific plan shall be
required for commercial or industrial zoned property with a master plan
overlay, for the mixing of residential and non-residential land uses, or as
required by the city pursuant subsection (C)(1)(c) of this section.
         b.   Applicable Residential Zones. A master plan overlay is restricted
to the following residential zones:
            Rural Residential (RR);
            Estate Residential 1 (ER-1);
            Estate Residential 2 (ER-2);
            Single-Family 1 (SF-1).
         c.   Specific Plan May be Required for Certain Projects. Projects in a
master plan overlay may re-quire the preparation of a specific plan if required
by the city, in accordance with state law, when the following occur:
The project site is of sufficient size to effectively utilize density transfers
to protect and preserve significant open space areas; and/or
The project site contains environmentally sensitive habitat or species or has
significant geographic constraints or requires extensive public utility
extensions that necessitate detailed long-range planning to ensure adequate
protection of resources and the efficient provision of public services, infra-
structures, and/or utilities.
Specific plans shall comply with the density provisions of the underlying land
use designation.
         d.   Development Standards. The following standards (Table 16.16-1)
shall apply. Modifications to these standards, except for minimum lot size, may
be considered as part of the review and approval of a master development plan
provided in subsection (C)(1)(g) of this section:
 
TABLE 16.16-1 MASTER PLAN OVERLAY APPLICABLE STANDARDS
Land Use Designation/Zone   Minimum Lot Size         Applicable Standards(1)
Rural Residential (RR)      20, 000 sq. ft.          ER-2
Estate Residential 1 (ER-1) 10,000 sq. ft.        ER-3
Estate Residential (ER-2)   7,200 sq. ft.            SF-1
Single-Family (SF-1)        5,000 - 6,000 sq. ft.(2) SF-2
Notes:
(1)   See
Table 16.08-1 "Use Table For Residential (Single-Family) Zoning Districts";
Table 16.08-3 “Residential (Single-Family) Zones General Development
Standards”; and Section
16.08.030 "Single-family Residential Design Standards and Parameters" for
additional standards. In addition to the above-described standards, all
applicable standards pertaining to single-family residential development,
including but not limited to landscaping, parking etc. shall apply.
(2)   Five thousand (5,000) square foot lots may be allowed for up to ten
(10) percent of the project and six thousand (6,000) square foot lots may be
allowed for up to twenty (20) percent of the project.
 
      e.   Modifications to Development Standards. Modifications to development
standards may be approved in order to allow greater flexibility in dealing with
site-specific issues, such as preservation of environmentally sensitive areas,
efficient use of infrastructure, and allow for the inclusion of on-site
amenities such as open spaces, enhanced landscaping and recreational
opportunities. As the number and extent of any proposed development standard
modifications increase, it is expected that the number and extent of the public
amenities would expand accordingly.
      f.   Project Amenities. The development project shall provide public
benefit beyond that normally required of a similar development outside of an
MPO by the provision of such things as equestrian facilities, public open
space, on and/or off site infrastructure improvements, public playgrounds,
trails and other recreational facilities, or other beneficial public use
facilities to the satisfaction of the city council as part of the master
development plan review process.
      g.   Modifications to Standards for Public Benefit. Modifications to the
standards specified herein may be approved in order to allow greater
flexibility in reaching the objectives of the master plan and to meet the needs
of a particular site. Any modifications must demonstrate that the public
benefit is being provided.
   3.   SHO (Scenic Highway) Overlay District. The SHO designation is applied
to the I-15 and I-215 corridors, as defined in the Master Plan of State
Highways Eligible for Official Scenic Highway Designation, to provide
protection for scenic qualities of historic significance with appropriate
conservation plans. The SHO designation is consistent with the scenic highway/
special corridor designation in the conservation and open space element of the
general plan.

16.16.020 Planned Residential Development General Standards.
   1.   PRD (Planned Residential Development). The PRD standards can be
utilized on all land zoned SF-2 (single-family residential), MF-1 (multi-family
residential). The standards allow for the development of single-family detached
and attached units on residential lots which are smaller than four thousand
three hundred fifty (4,350) square feet, by requiring the use of common usable
open space within the development in either a neo-traditional, courtyard
cluster or alley access site design. Per
Chapter 16.56, a development plan must be filed concurrent with the request for
a planned residential permit, and the proposed project must meet all
requirements set forth in Table 2-X and Section
16.16.020.

Notes:
(1)   The standards below are for attached and detached single-family units.
(2)   The number of dwelling units in a planned development shall not exceed
the density permitted by the underlying zone. The density regulations of the
underlying zone may be applied to the total developable area of the planned
development rather than separately to individual lots. In no case shall the
density of the project be inconsistent with the general plan.
(3)   The front yard setback must be a minimum of ten feet to an architectural
feature (ex: front porch or bay window). The setback for the garage door must
be at least twenty (20) feet from the back of the sidewalk, or the back of
curb if there is no sidewalk. Projects incorporating side-loaded garages may
use a ten (10) foot minimum setback to the garage. See Section
16.16.030(A)(5)(a) below.
(4)   The total distance between structures must be at least ten feet per
California Building and Fire Code standards. If any side yard setback is less
than three feet, easements may be required on the adjacent property to allow
for proper fire and emergency access.
(5)   See Section
16.16.030(A)(5) for additional design criteria.
(6)   Exception to Development Standards - See Section
16.44.160 (Accessory Dwelling Units) for lot coverage, setbacks, and square

16.16.030 Planned Residential Development Design Standards and Parameters.
The following standards and parameters are provided to ensure a level of
quality that must be complied with or satisfied in all planned residential
developments (PRD). In addition to the general provisions of the underlying
zone and
Chapter 16.16 (Combining and Overlay Districts), a PRD shall comply with the
following standards. Parameters are provided to allow flexibility by providing
options for implementing specific standards. In order to meet a certain
standard, one or a combination of parameters shall be incorporated in the
project’s design. In some instances, there will be no parameter(s) identified
for a particular standard and this will be noted.
   A.   Site Planning. The following standards and parameters deal with the
internal organization of planned residential developments. The intent of the
standards and parameters is to ensure that the relation-ships of units to each
other and to other on-site uses are functional, attractive, and create a visual
variety along the project's streets.
      1.   Lot Layout.
         a.   Standard: A project may be designed using one, two or all three
of the lot designs within the project. Attached single-family units with up
three units within a building may be option as well for any of the three lot
designs with implementation of a modified typical interior setback(s) (See
Table 16.16-2 “PRD General Development Standards” for additional details). All
other PRD standards would apply for this type of attached configuration. The
standards that apply to any given lot will depend upon where access to the
garage is obtained. A neo-traditional (Refer to Diagram 16.16-1) lot will have
garage access from the front of the house to the project local street. Cluster
courtyards and alley access lots will have garage access to the side of the
house from either a courtyard or an alley.
            Parameters:
            1)   The neo-traditional development consists of detached single-
family dwellings on individuals lots. Lots are of approximately equal size, and
are placed adjacent to one another throughout the entire project area. Common
open space areas are dispersed throughout the project. A two-car garage shall
be provided for each unit.

Diagram 16.16-1 - Neo-Traditional Development Lot Configuration – Single-
Family Home Typical Layout
            2)   The courtyard cluster or alley access development layout
(Refer to Diagram 16.16-2) permits a reduction in lot area, resulting in an
increase in the overall density of the project. Single-family homes are
clustered around an access courtyard or provided with rear alley access,
Garages have access from the courtyard or from the alley. Common usable open
space areas are provided throughout the project. Private fenced patio area is
provided for each unit. A two-car garage shall be provided for each unit.

Configuration – Single-Family Home Typical Layout
      2.    Parking.
         a.   Standard: All units shall have at least two full-size enclosed
residential parking spaces. A three -car garage is not permitted, unless the
third space is located within a tandem configuration.
            Parameters: None.
         b.   Standard: Driveways for a neo-traditional lot design shall be
large enough to provide for additional off-street parking. Driveway length is
measured from back of sidewalk, or back of curb where there is no sidewalk.
            Parameters:
            1)   Driveways for neo-traditional lots shall have a minimum of
twenty (20) feet in length.
         c.   Standard: Visitor parking shall be provided. Standards set forth
in Section 16.34.040 regarding the number of spaces to be provided shall be
followed.
            Parameters:
            1)   On-street parallel parking on project streets may satisfy this
requirement. On-street parallel parking on at least one side of the street is
strongly encouraged. If the project lacks adequate on-street parking,
additional parking bays dispersed throughout the project shall be provided.
         d.   Standard: Additional parking spaces, in excess of the required
visitor parking, at a ratio of one space per ten units included in the entire
project, shall be provided at the primary recreation facility.
            Parameters: None.
      3.   Common Recreational Space.
         a.   Standard: Open space areas designed for common recreation use
shall be provided for all residential developments at a ratio of four hundred
twenty-five (425) square feet per unit for neo- traditional units and seven
hundred fifty (750) square feet per unit for courtyard cluster or alley access
units.
            Parameters: None.
         b.   Standard: Specifically excluded from meeting the common usable
open/recreational space requirement are driveways, parking areas, fenced areas,
which are inaccessible to residents, areas with slopes of fifteen (15) percent
or greater, and any other areas deemed not to be primarily used for open
recreational purposes by the planning commission or city council.
            Parameters: None.
         c.   Standard: For all projects, common usable space areas shall be
designed so that a horizontal rectangle inscribed within it has no dimension
less than ten feet.
            Parameters: None.
         d.   Standard: Residential projects with twenty-five (25) to seventy-

293 § 1 (part), 2004; Ord. 252 (part), 2002)
16.16.040 Transit Development Oriented Overlay.
   A.   Transit Oriented Development Overlay District. The purpose of the
Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Overlay District is to allow a mixture of
residential and non-residential development in close proximity to transit to
encourage mixed land uses for enhanced transit and pedestrian activity. This
designation is applied to parcels as shown in the official zoning map.
      1.   The TOD Overlay District is intended to:
         a.   Stimulate economic development and reinvestment through
regulations based upon recognized urban design principles that allow property
owners to respond with flexibility to market forces;
         b.   Create a pedestrian-oriented mix of uses with convenient access
to transit between area neighborhoods, housing, employment centers, and retail
services;
         c.   Accommodate intensities and patterns of development that can
support multiple modes of transportation including public transit, bicycles,
and walking;
         d.   Facilitate well-designed new mixed-use development projects that
combine residential and nonresidential uses (e.g., office, retail, business
services, personal services, public spaces and uses, other community amenities,
etc.) to promote a better balance of jobs and housing;
         e.   Ensure compatibility with adjacent existing single-family
neighborhoods and harmonious integration with existing commercial areas;
         f.   Encourage the development of a unique zone character through a
streetscape that provides attractive features (e.g., landscaping, street
furniture, niche or linear parks, public places, courtyards, public
transportation shelters; etc.) designed to integrate the public realm (e.g.,
streets, sidewalks, etc.) with development on adjacent private property; and
         g.   Provide additional development opportunities. This intent is
achieved by providing additional development rights in compliance with this
chapter, which property owners may exercise under certain conditions, while
retaining all development rights conferred by the underlying zone to property
owners in the TOD Overlay Zone. Incentives and advantages include allowing a
greater range and mix of uses and specifying more permissive dimensional
specifications (e.g., greater building heights; reduced setbacks; etc.).
   B.   Authority and Applicability. The provisions of the TOD Overlay District
supplement those of the applicable underlying zoning district. Where the TOD
Overlay District and base zone provisions conflict, the standards and
regulations of the TOD Overlay District shall apply. A TOD shall be processed
in accordance with chapter 16.56 Development Plan Permits.
   C.   Allowable Uses and Permit Requirements. All uses in the applicable
underlying zoning district are allowed. In addition, the following land uses
shall also be permitted in the TOD Overlay District:
      1.   Multi-Family Residential;
      2.   Mixed-Use Development, where residential and nonresidential uses are
integrated vertically or horizontally, including live/work opportunities; and
      3.   Other similar uses compatible with the objectives of the TOD as
determined by the director.
   D.   General Development Standards. New land uses and structures, and
alterations to existing land uses and structures within the TOD Overlay
District, shall be designated, constructed, and/or established in compliance
with the requirements of the base zones, with the following exceptions:

purposes of this section are to:
      1.   Preserve and protect, those lands where agricultural uses and the
keeping of livestock are allowed;
      2.   Support and encourage continued agricultural operations in the city:
and
      3.   Notify prospective purchasers, residents and tenants of property
adjoining or near agricultural operations, including the keeping of livestock
(including, but not limited to, kennels). of the inherent conflicts associated
with the purchase of the residence including the presence of chemicals, dust,
light, noise, odors. and traffic that may occur near agricultural operations.
   B.   Relationship to Nuisance.

lot coverage.
      4.   Exceptions for Public Benefit. The city council may increase the
maximum amount of lot coverage from between five percent and twenty (20)
percent as a means of recognizing an applicant's efforts to address
neighborhood compatibility and/or to acknowledge the inclusion of public
benefits and both on-site amenities and public amenities beyond that normally
required of a similar development proposal. Conditions under which a lot
coverage increase could be considered include, but are not limited to, at least
two of the following: the use of a substantial amount of single-story
structures; construction of off-site infrastructure not otherwise needed for
the project; the inclusion of useable public open spaces; enhanced landscaping
or public and on-site recreational opportunities. As the amount of the lot
coverage exception increases, the number and extent of the public benefits as
well as on-site and public amenities would expand accordingly.

that city. There is in the City of Murrieta a need for housing affordable to
various groups, such as lower income, moderate income and senior citizen
households. Therefore, it is in the public interest for the City to promote the
construction of such additional housing through the exercise of its powers and
utilization of its resources to facilitate the development of quality housing
affordable for these types of households.
   A.   It is the purpose of this section to specify how compliance with
Government Code §§ 65915, 65915.5, 65915.7, and 65917 ("State Density Bonus
Law") will be implemented, as required by Government Code § 65915(a).
   B.   It is the purpose of this section to implement the goals, objectives
and policies of the Housing Element of the City's General Plan.
   C.   It is the purpose of this section to provide the implementing
framework, as it relates to affordable housing density bonuses, and offer
concessions and incentives for eligible housing developments which are
consistent with the City's long-standing commitment to provide for affordable
housing.

(Ord. 574-22, Exhibit B-3 (part), 2022; Ord. 549 § 2, 2019)
16.20.050 Density Bonus.
   All calculations are rounded up for any fractional numeric value in
determining the total number of units to be granted, including base density and
bonus density, as well as, the resulting number of affordable units needed for
a given density bonus project.
   A.   If a housing development qualifies for a density bonus under more than
one income category, or additionally as senior housing or as housing intended
to serve transitional foster youth, disabled veterans, homeless persons, or
lower income students, the applicant shall identify the categories under which
the density bonus would be associated with and granted to. Density bonuses from
more than one category can be combined up to maximum allowed under State
Density Bonus law.
   B.   The density bonus units shall not be included in determining the number
of affordable units required to qualify a housing development for a density
bonus pursuant to State Density Bonus Law.
   C.   The applicant may elect to accept a lesser percentage of density bonus
than the housing development is entitled to, or no density bonus, but no
reduction will be permitted in the percentages of required affordable units
contained in Government Code § 65915(b), (c), and (f). Regardless of the number
of affordable units, no housing development shall be entitled to a density
bonus of more than what is authorized under State Density Bonus Law.
(Ord. 549 § 2, 2019)
16.20.060 Incentives.
   A.   Incentives include incentives and concessions as defined in State
Density Bonus Law. The number of incentives that may be requested shall be
based upon the number the applicant is entitled to pursuant to State Density
Bonus Law.
   B.   Nothing in this subsection requires the provision of direct financial
incentives for the housing development, including, but not limited to, the
provision of financial subsidies, publicly owned land, fee waivers, or waiver
of dedication requirements. The City, at its sole discretion, may choose to
provide such direct financial incentives.
(Ord. 549 § 2, 2019)
16.20.070 Review Procedures.
   All requests for density bonuses, incentives, parking reductions, waivers,
or commercial development bonuses shall be considered and acted upon by the
approval body with authority to approve the development within the timelines
prescribed by Government Code §§ 65950 et seq., with right of appeal to the
City Council.
   A.   Eligibility for Density Bonus, Incentive(s), Parking Reduction, and/or
Waiver(s) for a Housing Development. To ensure that an application for a
housing development conforms with the provisions of State Density Bonus Law,
the staff report presented to the decision-making body shall state whether the
application conforms to the following requirements of state law as applicable:
      1.   The housing development provides the affordable units or senior
housing required by State Density Bonus Law to be eligible for the density
bonus and any incentives, parking reduction, or waivers requested, including
the replacement of units rented or formerly rented to low and very low income
households as required by Government Code § 65915(c)(3).
      2.   Any requested incentive will result in identifiable and actual cost
reductions to provide for affordable housing costs or rents; except that, if a
mixed-use development is requested, the application must instead meet all of
the requirements of Government Code § 65915(k)(2).
      3.   The development standards for which a waiver is requested would have
the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development at the
densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by Government Code §
65915.
      4.   The housing development is eligible for any requested parking
reductions under Government Code § 65915(p).
      5.   If the density bonus is based all or in part on donation of land,
all of the requirements included in Government Code § 65915(g) have been met.
      6.   If the density bonus or incentive is based all or in part on the
inclusion of a child care facility, all of the requirements included in
Government Code § 65915(h) have been met.
      7.   If the density bonus or incentive is based ail or in part on the
inclusion of affordable units as part of a condominium conversion, all of the
requirements included in Government Code § 65915.5 have been met.
   B.   If a commercial development bonus is requested for a commercial
development, the decision-making body shall make a finding that the development
complies with all of the requirements of subparagraph
16.20.100.C, that the City has approved the partnered housing agreement, and
that the commercial development bonus has been mutually agreed upon by the City
and the commercial developer.
   C.   The decision-making body shall grant an incentive requested by the
applicant unless it makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence,
of any of the following:
      1.   The proposed incentive does not result in identifiable and actual
cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in §
50052.5 of the Health and Safety code, or for affordable rents, as defined in §
50053 of the Health and Safety Code; or
      2.   The proposed incentive would be contrary to state or federal law; or
      3.   The proposed incentive would have a specific, adverse impact upon
public health or safety or the physical environment or on any real property
that is listed in the California Register of Historic Resources, and there is
no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse
impact without rendering the housing development unaffordable to low and
moderate income households. For the purpose of this subsection, specific

The purpose of this chapter is to provide regulations for the development of
areas in the city that, because of their topography, require special
consideration to ensure that they are developed in a way that substantially
maintains their natural character and environmental and aesthetic values to
implement the general plan, and to provide for the safety, health, and welfare
of the public by:
   A.   Providing guidelines and standards for development in visually
sensitive hillside areas to minimize the ad-verse impacts of grading and to
promote the goals and objectives of the general plan;
   B.   Maintaining an environmental equilibrium consistent with existing
vegetation, wildlife, soils, geology, slopes, and drainage patterns, and to
preserve natural topography and scenic character, including canyons, creeks,
knolls, rock outcrops, and ridgelines whenever feasible;
   C.   Encouraging development proposals that feature water conservation and
aquifer recharge techniques;
   D.   Encouraging development proposals that are sensitive to fire, flood,
slide, erosion, pollution, or other safety hazards;
   E.   Encouraging sensitive development through flexible design and
innovative arrangement of building sites by utilizing variable lot sizes,
clustering, and setback variations;
   F.   Utilizing nontraditional design standards for streets and hillside
grading where development quality and public safety are not affected;
   G.   Encouraging developments that incorporate desirable existing features
of land (e.g., natural vegetation, viewsheds, topographic features);
   H.   Protecting significant natural areas for ecologic purposes,
educational, and other scientific study purposes; 1. Encouraging the use of
drought-tolerant plant material to protect slopes from soil erosion and
slippage, preserve natural watershed, minimize fire hazard, and minimize the
scarring and deformation of the natural landscape;
   J.   Limiting the impact of cut slopes on adjacent developed and undeveloped
properties; and
   K.   Providing for appropriate intensity of development (e.g., density,
massing, etc.) in hillside areas through a variety of design techniques to
ensure that development intensity decreases as slopes become steeper (e.g., lot
sizes appropriate for steeper topography and separation of structures
sufficient to preserve the viewshed).

(Ord. 293 § I (part), 2004; Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.24.030 Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply:
Clearing. The removal of vegetation (grass, brush, trees, and similar plant
types) by mechanical means (also known as brushing and/or grubbing).
Cluster Development. A concept where structures are grouped on certain portions
of a site, frequently of different shapes and sizes, surrounded by large
expanses of open space.
Contour. A line drawn on a plan that connects points of equal elevation.
Cut. The mechanical removal of earth material.
Daylight Line. The line between the finished grade and natural terrain drawn by
connecting points where pro-posed contours meet existing contours.
Elevation. Height or distance above mean sea level.
Erosion. The process by which the soil and rock components of the earth's crust
are worn away and removed from one place to another by natural forces (e.g., as
wind and water).
Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
Finished Grade. The final elevation of the ground surface after development,
that is in conformance with the approved plan.
Grading. To bring an existing surface to a designed form by excavating,
filling, or landforming operations in excess of fifty (50) cubic yards.
Contour Grading. A grading concept designed to result in earth forms that
resemble natural terrain characteristics. Horizontal and vertical curve
variations are often used for slope banks.
Conventional Grading. A grading concept that results in simple, straight
forward, cut and fill lines and even planed slopes. This is the most basic type
of grading often resulting in an "engineered or man-made" appearance
attributable to a lack of curvilinear or natural-appearing shapes.
Landform Grading. A grading method that replicates the irregular shapes of
natural slopes. Landform graded slopes are characterized by continuous series
of concave and convex forms interspersed with mounds that blend into profiles,
nonlinearity in plan view, varying slope gradients, and significant transition
zones, between man-made and natural slopes.
Hillside. Land with an average rise or fall of twenty-five (25) percent or
greater or a vertical rise of thirty (30) feet or more.
Mass Grading. The movement of large quantities of earth over large areas.
Disruption of the majority of the on-site surface terrain resulting in a
successive pad/terrace configuration. Modification or elimination of natural
landforms may result.
Minimal Grading. A grading concept designed to minimize excavation and filling.
Allows the movement of earth for projects (e.g., as individual building
foundations, driveways, local roads, and utility excavation). The concept is
associated with roads conforming closely to natural contours and with
structures being built on natural terrain.
Pad. A level area created by grading to accommodate development.
Prominent Ridge. A ridge or hill location that is visible from Interstate 15,
Interstate 215, or from an arterial or secondary street, that forms part of the
skyline or is seen as a distinct edge against a backdrop of land. Ridge. An
extended, narrow, conspicuous elevation of land generally between valleys.
Slope. An inclined ground surface, the inclination of which is expressed as a
ratio of the vertical distance (rise), or change in elevation, to the
horizontal distance (run). The percent of a given slope is determined by
dividing the rise by the run, multiplied by one hundred (100).

IMAGES/0-0-0-3180.gif]
 
Slope, Average. The method of determining average natural slope of land using
the following equation:
   I x L x .0023 where
    A
I   = Contour interval in feet.
L   = Combined length in feet of contour lines measured on the project site.
.0023   = A constant that converts square feet into acres and expresses slope
in percent.
A   = Project site area in acres.
Slope, Man-made. A manufactured slope consisting wholly or partially of either
cut or filled material. Slope, Natural. A slope that is not man-made.
Slope, Significant Natural. A slope that is not man-made that exceeds twenty-
five (25) percent and a vertical rise of thirty (30) feet or more.
Slope Ratio. The relationship of a slope's horizontal length to vertical
height, with the height specified as one (e.g. 2:1).
Slope Transition. The area where a slope plane changes to meet the natural
terrain or a level graded area either vertically or horizontally.

      4.   Other illustrative techniques determined necessary to aid in review
of the project.
   K.   Exceptions to the filing requirements shall be determined by the
director.
(Ord. 293 § 1 (part), 2004; Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.24.050 Project Review Procedures.
Projects within designated hillside areas shall be subject to review and
approval by the director or the commission in compliance with the provisions of
this chapter.
   A.   Director Approval. The director shall approve, approve with conditions,
or deny development proposal applications when the following conditions apply:
      1.   Development plan permits;
      2.   Extensions of time; or
      3.   Building permit reviews.
   B.   Commission Approval. The commission shall approve, approve with
conditions, or deny development proposal applications when one or more of the
following conditions apply:
      1.   When padded building sites are proposed; or
      2.   Proposals referred to the commission by the director.
   C.   Modification of Requirements. The commission may modify or waive a
development standard when an improved or more sensitive design will result.
Further, where it can be demonstrated that imposing hillside development
standards would either render a parcel unbuildable and create a loss of its
reasonable economic use, or place an undue restriction on the improvement of
the property, development consistent with the general plan shall be allowed
subject to approval by the commission, if the following findings can be made:
         a.   The site is physically suitable for the design and siting of the
proposed development. The proposed development will result in minimum
disturbance of environmentally sensitive areas;
         b.   The grading proposed in connection with the development will not
result in soil erosion, silting of lower slopes, flooding, severe scarring or
other geological instability or fire hazard that would affect health, safety
and general welfare as determined by the city engineer;
         c.   The proposed development retains the visual quality of the site,
the aesthetic qualities of the area and the neighborhood characteristics by
utilizing proper structural scale and character, varied architectural
treatments, and appropriate plant materials; and
         d.   The proposed development is in conformance with the qualitative
development standards and guidelines as established in this chapter and is
conformance with the goals, objectives and policies of the general plan.
(Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.24.060 Hillside Development Standards.
The following are minimum standards and shall apply to a use, development, or
alteration of land in compliance with Section
16.24.020 (Applicability). These standards are supplemented by the provisions
of the development guidelines contained in Section
16.24.070 of this chapter.
   A.   Hillside Slope Categories. The following descriptions serve as general
standards for hillside slope categories to ensure that development will
compliment the overall character of the landform.
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
 
% Natural      Standards
Slope Category
Up to 25%      This is not considered a hillside condition.
               This is a hillside condition. Development within this slope
               category is limited to the less visually prominent slopes, and
               then only where it can be shown that grading, vegetation
               removal, safety and environmental and aesthetic impacts can be
               minimized. Impact of access and roadways shall be minimized by
               following natural contours or using grade separations.
               Structures shall blend with the natural landform through their
25% up to 50%  shape, material, and color. Special hillside architectural and
               design techniques are required, which may include the use of
               larger lots, variable setbacks, and variable building structural
               techniques and clustering. Padded building sites may be
               considered in some instances. Where this occurs, the commission
               may consider padded building sites adjacent to special features
               when it is found that grading of padded building sites will
               create a better relationship between the special feature(s) and
               the building sites.
50% and over   This is an excessive slope condition and development is
               prohibited.
 
   B.    Site Design.
      1.   Projects located in hillside areas shall incorporate clustering,
variable setbacks, multiple orientations, and other site planning techniques to
preserve open spaces, protect natural features, and offer views to residents.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3182.gif]
      2.   When clustering techniques are used, minimum lot sizes may be
decreased to five thousand (5,000) square feet when it is necessary to preserve
sensitive lands (e.g., hillsides, creeks, habitat areas, etc.). Lots may be
allowed smaller than five thousand (5,000) square feet, but not smaller than
four thousand (4,000) square feet, for up to twenty (20) percent of the total
approved lots and only under an approved specific plan when absolutely
necessary to preserve sensitive and hillside areas. Lots under five thou-sand
(5,000) square feet are prohibited in slope areas of twenty-five (25) percent
or greater.
   C.   Driveways and Roadways.
      1.    Driveways shall enter public/private streets maintaining adequate
sight distance as determined by the city engineer.
      2.   Driveways shall not be located within three feet of a side property
line. Exceptions may be considered based on lot size, percent slope,
appropriate drainage facilities and use as a common (joint) driveway.
      3.   Only slopes less than fifty (50) percent (2:1) shall be allowed
adjacent to driveways.
      4.   Driveway grades above fifteen (15) percent may only be considered
when driveways are aligned with the natural contours of the land, are necessary
to achieve effective site design, and safety considerations are met to the
satisfaction of the building and safety official, city engineer, and the fire
department. Proper design considerations shall be employed, including the use
of vertical curves. On driveways that may be approved with a slope greater than
fifteen (15) percent, a coarse, all-weather paving material, or grooves for
traction, shall be incorporated into the construction.
      5.   Roadways shall conform to the natural landform. Significant
alterations to the physical and visual character of a hillside shall be avoided
by eliminating large notches in ridgelines and wide straight alignments.
Modified or reduced width road sections and split sections shall be considered
in the layout of hillside streets to reduce grading and cuts in topography
while allowing access for fire trucks and other emergency vehicles.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3184.gif]
      6.   Where road construction is proposed in hillside areas, the standards
shall be consistent with those identified for high fire hazard areas.
      7.   The extent of vegetation and visual disruption shall be minimized by
the combined use of retaining structures and regrading to approximate natural
slopes. The view along a street front shall provide a pleasant appearance with
a sense of open space and landscaping. The use of terraced walls and
landscaping to reduce grading impact associated with retaining walls is
encouraged.
      8.   Wet utilities shall be placed in the road right-of-way, where
feasible.
      9.   Appropriate roadway drainage and grades shall be provided.
   D.   Architecture.
      1.    The building envelope for primary structures, except for padded
building sites, shall be as follows:
         a.    Downhill Lot. The maximum structure height shall be thirty (30)
feet, measured from finished grade at the front setback line extending towards
the rear of the lot. The maximum height at the side setbacks shall be fifteen
(15) feet extending up toward the center of the lot at a forty-five (45) degree
angle to a maximum height of thirty (30) feet as measured from finished grade.

BUILDING ENVELOPE FOR CROSS LOT SLOPE
         d.    Architectural Projections Allowed. Architectural projections and
variations in roof design are encouraged. Projections above the maximum height
limits for architectural features may be allowed subject to approval by the
director.
      2.   In steeper terrain, reduction of front yard setbacks may be
considered in order to minimize rear yard grading.
      3.   Architectural treatments shall be provided on all sides of a
structure. Elements of the architectural treatment used on the front facade
shall be repeated on all sides of a structure with additional emphasis on those
elevations visible from public rights-of-way.
      4.   Building materials and color schemes shall blend with the natural
landscape. Colors shall be earth tones and the value (lightness or darkness) of
the specific hue shall be as close to that of the immediately surrounding
landscape as possible. Where exterior stucco is used, it shall have a final
coat of integrated color in a muted earth tone. Contrasting color accents shall
be kept to a minimum.
      5.   Treated wood or materials of a wood-like appearance, having the
necessary fire retardant characteristics. are encouraged for exterior surfaces.
Use of other natural materials (e.g., river rock) is also strongly encouraged.
The reflectivity of exposed surfaces (walls, roofs, windows, frames, and paved
surfaces) shall be mitigated by overhangs, trellises, planting, and similar
features.
      6.   Exterior lighting shall be located and shielded so as to not impact
adjacent property owners in terms of glare and privacy in compliance with
Section
16.18.100 (Lighting).
   E.   Walls and Fences.
      1.   Retaining walls, not exceeding six feet in height, may be allowed to
reduce grading, preserve natural features, or increase soil stabilization.
Within the required front yard setback, individual retaining walls shall not
exceed three feet in height.
      2.    Where multiple (terraced) walls are designed to retain larger
slopes they shall not exceed six feet in height and shall be separated by a
minimum of six feet horizontally. A maximum of two walls shall be placed
together. Walls within the required front yard setback shall not exceed three
feet in height and shall be separated by a minimum of three feet and shall
incorporate landscaping to screen the wall(s).

FIGURE 3-8
RETAINING WALL AS PART OF PRIMARY STRUCTURE
      4.   Crib walls may be approved on a case by case basis if it can be
demonstrated that excessive height is not being created and provisions for
extensive landscaping are incorporated.
      5.   Walls and fences shall incorporate materials and colors used in an
adjacent structures. Naturally occur-ring materials (e.g., river rock,
flagstone, etc.) shall be used whenever possible.
      6.   Walls and fencing visible from the public right-of-way shall be
designed to incorporate visual interest through variation in placement, use of
planters, differing materials, and modulation of the wall plane.
      7.   Walls and fences shall follow landform grading shapes and contours.
   E.   Landscaping. Revegetation in hillside areas shall reflect the visual
patterns found naturally in local canyons and valleys. The landscaping as
viewed from urban areas and arterial roadway system shall mask and screen man-
made structures.
      1 .    Indigenous, or naturalized plants that blend naturally with the
landscape shall be utilized in areas where planting is required.
      2.    Natural landform planting shall be used to soften manufactured
slopes, reduce the impact of development on steep slopes or ridgelines. and
provide erosion control. These landscape techniques shall serve to reintroduce
landscape patterns that occur naturally in the hillsides.

      3.    A "vegetative backdrop" shall be maintained by replanting with
native trees or the same vegetation that was removed. The vegetation should
screen structures to the extent possible at maturity and preserve the
appearance of the natural skyline.
      4.    The surface of graded or disturbed slopes with three feet or
greater vertical height shall be protected against damage by erosion through
the planting of deep rooted ground cover. Slopes exceeding eight feet in
vertical height shall be planted with ground cover and a combination of shrubs
and trees that have a high "root-to-shoot" ratio. The size of shrubs and trees
shall be determined based on the individual project area as deemed appropriate
by the department and/or commission.
      5.    Jute mesh or an equivalent shall be required when planting occurs
between August fifteenth and April fifteenth, and when determined, as
necessary, by a soils engineer and/or licensed landscape architect.
      6.    Indigenous, native vegetation shall be retained and supplemented
within canyons and along natural drainage courses where grading does not occur,
provided that it conforms with fuel modification and tire prevention plans.
      7.    Common open areas and front and side yards adjacent to a street
shall be adequately landscaped and irrigated. The areas shall be provided with
native plant materials that blend with the natural character of the surrounding
landscape.
      8.    In order to protect slopes from soil erosion and slippage and to
facilitate revegetation, an automatic irrigation system shall be installed on
slopes with planting. Design and operation of the irrigation system shall
respect the special conditions that exist in hillside situations specific to
maintaining slope stabilization and integrity. In all cases, the emphasis shall
be toward using plant materials that may eventually not need to be irrigated:
therefore, temporary irrigation systems may be used as approved by the city's
landscape architect and city engineer. Water and energy conservation techniques
shall be utilized (e.g., drip irrigation, alluvial rockscape, etc.) Where
irrigation systems are installed above ground, ultraviolet light resistant.
brown line or other approved color, shall be used.
      9.    A permanent fuel modification area shall be required around
development projects that are adjacent or exposed to hazardous fire areas for
the purpose of fire protection. The fuel modification area shall be maintained
by its owners, a homeowners' association, or other public nonprofit agency or
conveyed in a public easement. Adequate provisions shall be made for the
continual maintenance of these areas and the fire chief may require brush,
vegetation, or debris to be removed and cleared consistent with the provisions
of
Chapter 8.32 of the municipal code. Where feasible, fuel modification areas
shall be designated as common open space rather than private open space. The
recommended width of the fuel modification area shall be based on applicable
building and fire codes and the recommendations of the fire chief with
consideration given to:
         a.   A worst-case Santa Ana wind condition;
         b.   The natural ungraded slope of the land within the project and in
the areas adjacent to the project;
         c.   Fuel loading:
         d.   Access to the project by fire suppression equipment. and access
directly to the fuel modified area, and egress out of the project in case of
evacuation;
         e.   The on-site availability of water that can be used for fire
fighting purposes with regard to fire flows, water pressure, and duration:
         f.   "Built-in" fire protection within structures (i.e., sprinklers
etc.);
         g.   Soil erosion and sediment control measures; and
         h.   The fire department fuel modification policy document.
      10.    Fuel modification areas shall also incorporate soil erosion and
sediment control measures to alleviate permanent scarring and accelerated
erosion.
   G.   Grading.
      1.   Grading shall not take place on natural slopes that exceed fifty
(50) percent.
      2.   Slopes created by grading of the site shall not exceed fifty (50)
percent or 2:1, without a soils report and stabilization study indicating a
greater permissible slope. Slopes shall not exceed thirty (30) feet in height
between terraces or benches, except that the commission may permit slopes
exceeding these dimensions where the slopes will result in a natural appearance
and will not create geological or erosion hazards. The soils report and
stabilization study will be subject to third party review prior to approval by
the city. Refer to the hillside development guidelines (16.24.070) for methods
to accomplish this standard.
      3.   Structures shall not visually impair ridgeline silhouettes.
Structures are not permitted closer to a prominent ridge than fifty (50) feet
measured vertically on a cross-section or one hundred fifty (150) feet
horizontally on a topographic map. whichever is more restrictive. Exceptions to
this requirement for public facilities. utilities. and infrastructure necessary
to serve the public health, safety, and welfare may be considered by the
commission.
      4.   Clearing, excavation, or other earth disturbances shall not be
permitted on hillside areas prior to the issuance of a grading permit. with the
exception of county/state authorized soils remediation operations, drill holes,
and exploratory trenches for the collection of geologic and soil data. Trenches
are to be properly backfilled and in addition, erosion treatment provided where
slopes exceed twenty-five (25) percent.
      5.   Manufactured cut and fill slopes exceeding ten feet in height which
will be either exposed to public view, or are adjacent to environmentally
sensitive areas, shall be landform or contour graded, where physically
feasible, so that their ultimate appearance will resemble a natural slope. This
will include slopes along streets and highways, slopes, adjacent to parks,
schools, open spaces, and other public facilities and other prominent slopes.
Refer to the hillside development guidelines (16.24.070) for methods to
accomplish this standard.
      6.   Landform grading shall be used where zero to twenty-five (0-25)
percent (nonhillside) slopes intersect with twenty-five to fifty (25-50)
percent (hillside) slopes. Proper transitioning from manufactured slopes
created by conventional grading methods to natural slopes shall be achieved
gradually and naturally through the use of radii or irregular curvilinear
shapes that will blend into the adjoining topography tangentially and not
create abrupt changes.
      7.   Fill slopes shall not be placed perpendicular across a canyon.
Straight line cut ofF fill slopes shall not be made to appear like a dam. The
terminus of the fill shall, instead, be concave in shape to restore the can-yon
appearance. This concave configuration shall be in combination with the use of
substantially flatter slope ratios (4:1, 3.5:1, 3: I ) at or near the center of
this indentation. Symmetrical or unsymmetrical con-cave configurations shall be
used depending upon the adjoining or underlying topographic characteristics.
      8.   Minimal radius rounding at the edges of cut and fill slopes is not
acceptable. Proper transitioning from manufactured slopes to natural slopes
shall be achieved gradually and naturally through the use of radii or irregular
curvilinear shapes that will blend into the adjoining topography tangentially
and not create abrupt changes.
      9.   In the planning, design, and development of public utilities and
infrastructure, every reasonable effort shall be made to minimize grading
impacts and harmonize with the natural contours and character of the land.
      10.   Side yard slopes and low (less than twenty (20) feet in height)
rear yard slopes whose view is blocked by future structures need not have
landform design applied.
      11.   Grading shall be phased so that prompt revegetation or construction
will control erosion. Where possible. only those areas that will be built on,
resurfaced, or landscaped shall be disturbed. Top soil shall be stockpiled
during rough grading and used on pads or revegetated habitat areas, upon the
recommendation of the soils engineer. Refer to the hillside development
guidelines for methods to accomplish this standard.
      12.    Applicable requirements of the city and state shall be complied
with in conjunction with a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit prior to the issuance of a grading permit, which may include,
but is not limited to, an Erosion Control Plan, Best Management Plan (including
Notice of Intent to be filed with the state Water Resources Control Board) and
Construction Monitoring Program.
   H.   Drainage.
      1.    Debris basins, energy dissipating devices, and down drains shall be
provided, where necessary, to reduce erosion when grading is undertaken in the
hillside areas. Natural drainage courses should be retained where health and
safety are not jeopardized. Drainage courses retained in a natural state shall
be protected from grading activity. In instances where a crossing is required.
a natural crossing and bank protection shall be preferred over steel and
concrete systems. Where drainage structures are required, they shall be
naturalized with coloration, plant materials, native rocks and/or concealment
with grading techniques.
      2.    Drainage channels, slope drainage devices, interceptor drains and
terrace drains should be placed in less visible locations. Down drains shall be
hidden in swales diagonally or curvilinear across a slope face. In this manner
they will be built into the overall landform of the slope. They should also
receive a naturalizing treatment which may include native rock, colored
concrete, and/or landscaping so that the structure appears as an integral part
of the environment. In all cases, a concrete liner shall be used in addition to
a naturalizing treatment.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3198.gif]
      3.   Cross lot drainage usage shall be minimized. In situations where
this is not possible using conventional design. optional techniques (e.g.,
single loaded streets, reduced densities, etc.) shall be considered. Use of
cross lot drainage may be considered only after demonstration that this method
will not adversely affect the proposed lots or adjacent properties, and that it
is absolutely required in order to minimize the amount of grading which would
result with conventional drainage practices.
      4.   Where cross lot drainage is utilized, the following shall apply:
         a.    Project Interiors. One lot may drain across one other lot if a
maintenance easement is provided within either an improved, open V-swale gutter
which has a naturalized appearance, or within a closed drainage pipe that shall
be a minimum twelve (12) inches in diameter. This drainage shall be conveyed to
either a public street or to a drainage easement. If drainage is conveyed to a
private easement, it shall be maintained by its owners or a Homeowners'
Association; otherwise. the drain-age shall be conveyed to a public easement.
The easement width shall be determined on an individual basis and shall be
dependent on appropriate hydrologic studies and access requirements. Irrigation
lines shall be placed above swales to minimize the impacts in the event of a
system failure. When irrigation lines cross an open V-swale they shall be
placed in a galvanized pipe which is to be clamped to the soil on both sides of
the swale subject to the review of the director.
         b.    Project Boundaries. On-site drainage shall be conveyed in an
improved open V-swale gutter, which has a naturalized appearance, or within an
underground pipe in either a private drainage easement, that is to be
maintained by its owners or a homeowners' association, or it shall be conveyed
in a public easement. The easement width shall be a minimum often feet. A
greater width may be determined necessary on an individual basis and shall be
dependent on appropriate hydrologic studies and access requirements.
   I.   Public Safety.
      1.    Residential developments shall be constructed in a manner so as to
reduce the potential for spread of brushfires as follows:
         a.   In the case of a conflict where more restrictive provisions are
contained in the uniform building code or in the uniform fire code, the more
restrictive provisions shall apply.
         b.   Roofs shall be covered with noncombustible materials (e.g., clay
tile, concrete shake, tile, or similar materials). Open ends shall be stopped
in order to prevent bird nests, or other combustible material, lodging within
the roof and to prevent entry of flames.
         c.   Exterior walls and fences shall be surfaced with noncombustible
or flame resistive materials. Alternate surface materials may be approved
subject to the approval of the fire chief and Building Official. Except as
otherwise provided herein, exterior walls shall extend to the ground.
         d.   Balconies. patio roofs, eaves and other similar overhangs shall
be of noncombustible or flame resistive materials.
         e.   Plastic webbing, split or whole bamboo, reed or straw-like
materials, corrugated plastic or fiberglass materials, and similar flammable
materials are not permitted for use on patio covers.
         f.   Vents for attics and underfloor areas shall be designed and
located to minimize the likelihood of spreading of fire.
         g.   Chimneys shall be provided with approved spark arresters.
      2.    Adequate water supply and pressure for proposed development shall
be required in compliance with fire department Standards.
      3.    The fire chief shall require brush, vegetation, or debris to be
removed and cleared within ten feet on each side of every roadway and access
drive, and may enter upon private property to do so. This requirement shall not
apply to single specimens of trees, ornamental shrubbery, or cultivated
groundcover provided they do not form a means of readily transmitting fire.
      4.   If the fire chief determines in a specific case that difficult
terrain, danger of erosion, or other unusual circumstances make strict
compliance with the clearance of vegetation undesirable or impractical, he or
she may suspend enforcement thereof and require reasonable alternative measures
designed to advance the purposes of this chapter.
      5.    Site design shall provide for all-weather equipment access to
publicly maintained slope areas for maintenance and emergency purposes.
      6.    Structures and facilities shall be restricted in geologically
hazardous areas.
      7.    Special construction features shall be required in the design of
structures where site investigations con-firm potential geologic hazards.
      8.    Development not on public sewers shall be permitted only after site
specific investigations have been conducted that demonstrate the soils are
suitable for on-site wastewater disposal and the disposal of wastewater will
not degrade the subsurface water quality.
      9.    Due to the hazard associated with saturated soils in areas of steep
slopes, irrigation systems in critical areas that have the potential for
failure in the judgement of the city engineer shall be required to be equipped
with potentiometers to make sure that the systems will not operate when there
is sufficient moisture in the soil.
(Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.24.070 Hillside Development Guidelines.
The hillside development guidelines are intended to illustrate and amplify the
appropriate development concepts for hillside areas. The guidelines are not
intended to be an exhaustive list of standards, but rather policy statements,
to encourage development that is sensitive to the unique characteristics common
to hillside properties. The guidelines allow for flexibility and they encourage
creativity, especially where a specific plan is prepared. How-ever, the
development standards provided in Section
16.24.060 shall be considered as a "benchmark" against which hillside
development proposals will be reviewed for compliance with the purposes of this
chapter.
The guideline's purpose is to allow for innovative or alternate methods of
design in hillside areas. Innovation is encouraged as long as the end result is
one that respects the natural character of the hillside and is consistent with
the purposes of this chapter and the goals, objectives and policies of the
general plan .
Conformance with the guidelines will be incorporated in the preparation and
approval of subdivisions and individual site developments. During the
application review process, the city will evaluate the consistency of the
proposal with the purposes of this chapter. Prior to the start of the design
effort, it is recommended that the project design team members read the general
plan and become familiar with its policies.
   A.   Site Design.
      1.   Design of building sites should be sensitive to the natural terrain.
Structures should be located in a way that minimizes grading and preserves
natural features (e.g., prominent knolls, ridgelines, etc.)
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ff6b6c3a544be3d7cac76476080ed2ade3ea3350/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3200.gif]
      2.   Preserve views of significant visual features, as designated on the
hillside overlay zone map, as seen from both within and outside a hillside
development. When designing lots and plotting homes, the following provisions
should be considered:
         a.   Dwellings should be oriented to allow view opportunities. even
though views may be limited. Residential privacy should not be unreasonably
sacrificed; and
         b.   A significant public vista, skyline, open space corridor, or
vertical open space corridor as seen from an interstate, an arterial, or a
secondary street should be a major design element in the site planning process.
      3.   Where possible, graded areas should be designed with manufactured
slopes located on the uphill side of structures.

      4.   To the extent possible. the width of a building, measured in the
direction of the slope, should be minimized in order to limit the amount of
cutting and tilling and to better "fit" the house to the natural terrain. The
degree of slope will dictate how this is accomplished.

      5.   Clustering of development is encouraged in hillside areas regardless
of size. This is particularly important in environmentally sensitive areas in
order to reduce the potential for tire hazard, erosion and excess runoff, and
to preserve existing natural features and open space.
   B.   Driveways and Roadways.
1. Driveways that serve more than one parcel are encouraged as a method of
reducing unnecessary grading, paving, and site disturbance.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3206.gif]
   C.   Architecture.
      1.    The form, mass, and profile of the individual buildings and
architectural features should be designed to blend with the natural terrain and
preserve the character and profile of the natural slope. Techniques that should
be considered include:
         a.   Detaching the garage:
         b.   Integrating retaining walls into garage walls on sloping lots to
reduce grading and minimize visibility of walls: and
         c.   Including architectural enrichments and variations in roof
massing. Roofs should have low profiles to minimize their visual impact. On
sloping land, the roof pitch should follow the slope of the hill-side, instead
of being perpendicular to the hillside or opposing hillside slope. Care should
be taken to avoid the use of gabled ends on downhill elevations. Upper stories
should not be cantilevered out of the opposite direction of the hillside slope.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3208.gif]
      2.   The design of the structure should give consideration to the lot's
size and configuration in order to avoid the appearance of overbuilding and to
minimize the blocking of views. For example, within a development, the majority
of the units should not be designed with minimum setback to minimum setback.
      3.   Large expanses of a single material on walls, roofs, or paving areas
should be avoided. Create interesting, small scale patterns by breaking up
building mass, varying building materials, and through design and placement of
windows and doors. Building plans and elevations should be varied throughout a
development to avoid a monotonous "cookie-cutter" look.
   D.   Walls and Fences.
      1.   Walls and fences can be used to define a sense of place and create
an attractive appearance. However, walls should not dominate a view, and their
height should be limited adjacent to a street or trail or within a rear yard.
Extensive landscaping should be used to reduce the visual impact of walls. In
addition, street front walls should incorporate varying design and natural
materials. The use of open view fencing is encouraged, so long as adequate
public safety and residential privacy are maintained.
      2.   When possible, walls and fences should be designed as an integral
part of the building in order to minimize the visual impact on surrounding
areas.
      3.   Visually obtrusive solid fencing should be avoided in highly visible
areas (unless required for sound attenuation), with the preference being for
open (wrought iron) fencing.
   E.   Landscaping.
      1.   Street trees should be provided in select areas to enhance the
natural character of the areas and create a more rural appearance. Street tree
species selection, and spacing of trees, should be sensitive to the context in
which they are planted. Species selection should also be respectful of
potential impact on infra-structure improvements (i.e. root damage to streets,
sidewalks, etc.).
      2.   Slopes should be designed with informal clusters of trees and shrubs
to soften and vary the slope planes, consistent with landform grading concepts.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3210.gif]
   F.   Grading.
There are three distinct types of grading proposed in these guidelines, each
with a unique quality, each with an individual and appropriate application.
Larger sites will most likely incorporate all three concepts in various parts
of the plan.
      1.   Minimal Grading. This is typically used for large lot single family
homes, custom homes with variable foundations that conform to the existing
slopes, and other uses that utilize the least amount of grading in order to get
the facility and structures built. This technique embraces the following
concepts:
         a.   Grading should be limited to individual flat graded pad areas for
residential building sites. Grading should be limited to only the required
building areas and adjacent outdoor amenities in steep hillside areas;
         b.   Foundation systems that require little or no grading are
encouraged, forcing the architecture to con-form to the land rather than the
land to conform to the dwelling:
         c.   Roadways, driveways, and individual building pads should be
designed to conform with the contours and to attempt to daylight in the center
of the road or building pad to ensure a minimum cut and fill situation; and
         d.   The grading concept minimizes the amount of cubic yards of earth
excavated and filled.
      2.    Contour Grading. This concept results in post-development landforms
that exhibit many of the characteristics present within natural landforms.
Contour grading is typically used in situations where conventional, terraced,
grading with benches and slopes might be used but a "softened" grading look is
desired. This would be desirable for areas that are limited in public view
(i.e. concealed rear yards). Typically, contour grading can reduce required cut
and fill volumes as compared with traditional, terraced, grading. The design
elements associated with this type of grading include: (See Figure 3-9)
         a.   The use of horizontal and vertical curve variations for slope
banks creating a curvilinear pattern;
         b.   Post-development landforms that exhibit natural terrain
characteristics (without the heavy modeling effects of landform grading);
         c.   A general rounding of slopes at slope intersections and
transition zones with natural grade;
         d.   Pad configurations that are curvilinear; and
         e.   Slopes that are designed with contour grading techniques (e.g.,
the location of slopes behind structure (not in side yards), slopes in hidden
locations, or slopes less than ten feet in height).

LANDFORM GRADING

IMAGES/0-0-0-3214.gif]
 
      3.    Landform Grading. Graded slopes in this category will replicate the
irregular shapes of natural slopes. Landform grading techniques should be used
whenever slopes are created that will be open to public view. This is
particularly true for slopes that exceed ten feet in height.
The intent of these grading guidelines, is to incorporate the basic principles
of the landform grading concept as the preferred method in the design and
construction of hillside development projects so that they w ill be in harmony
with the natural topography and reflect natural plant distribution patterns.
(See Figure 3-10)
Landform grading techniques embrace the following concepts:
         a.   Land plans should flow with the natural topography rather than
against it. This means that street pat-terns and building pad configurations
follow the underlying topographic features rather than cutting across them:
         b.   Landform graded slopes are characterized by continuous series of
concave and convex forms interspersed with mounds that blend into profiles with
varying slope gradients and with significant transition zones between man-made
and natural slopes;
         c.   Pad configurations are irregular. Slope down-drain devices either
follow natural lines of the slopes or are tucked away in special Swale and berm
combinations in order to conceal the drains from view. Exposed segments in
visible areas are treated with natural rock for a more aesthetically pleasing
appearance;
         d.   The technique should be used wherever possible to provide a
variety of both slope percentage, slope direction, and topographical detailing
in a three-dimensional, undulating. pattern similar to existing terrain: and
         e.   Manufactured cut and fill slopes exceeding ten feet in height
that will be either exposed to permanent public view or are adjacent to
environmentally sensitive areas should be designed with features characteristic
of natural slopes, where physically feasible so that their ultimate appearance
will resemble a natural slope. This will include slopes along streets and
highways, adjacent to parks, schools, open spaces. other public facilities, and
other prominent and visible slopes.
      4.    The following basic grading guidelines and techniques serve to
implement preferred landform grading techniques and help avoid unnecessary cut
and fill:
         a.    Cuts. When convex shaped natural features. (e.g., protruding
minor landforms) are cut, the residual landform should not be a flat slope
face, but rather should be restored to resemble the original. This will require
more than just rounding at the edges but, in effect, reconfiguring it so the
final result will give the appearance of a protruding ridgeline.
         b.    Use of variable slope ratios. Because Landform grading designs
require the use of variable slope ratios at greater than 2:1 and may create
valleys or concave indentations on building pad areas, they may result in loss
of usable area. In addition, engineering and construction costs may increase.
Be-cause of this, segments of a cut or fill slope may be designed with variable
slope ratios less than 2:1, but not less than 1.5: I within the following
guidelines and subject to third party review at the applicant's expense:
            1)   A geotechnical engineer shall certify that slopes will meet
standard stability requirements;
            2)   The overall ratio from top to toe will be 2:1 or flatter; and
            3)   Ratios flatter than 2:1 will also be used in the slope design.
         c.    Grading operations should be planned to avoid the rainy season,
October fifteenth (15th) to April fifteenth (I 5th). Grading permits shall only
be issued when a plan for erosion control and silt retention has been approved
by the city without regard to time of year.
         d.    A rounded and smooth transition should be made when the planes
of man-made and natural slopes intersect. Where cut or fill conditions are
created, slopes should be varied rather than left at a constant angle or create
an unnatural, rigid, `'engineered" appearance. The angle of a graded slope
should be gradually adjusted to the angle of the natural terrain.
         e.    Manufactured slopes adjacent to roadways shall be consistent
with the landform grading and revegetation technique, where physically feasible
to create visually interesting and pleasing streetscapes. The higher the slope
becomes, the more important the modeling effect of landform grading becomes.
         f.    Top of slope berms shall be used to eliminate the possibility of
drainage sheet flow over the slope that would potentially cause an unstable
condition. Tops of slopes should be rounded in conformance with landform
grading techniques, or increased in size to reduce the visual impact of the
back of a home.
   G.   Drainage.
      1.   Natural drainage courses should be preserved and enhanced to the
extent possible. Rather than filling them in, drainage features should be
incorporated as an integral part of the project design in order to enhance the
overall quality and aesthetics of a site, to provide attractive open space
vistas, and to preserve the natural character of the site. Encourage the use of
natural drainage courses as natural boundaries between neighborhoods.
      2.   Storm drainage runoff resulting from project development should be
minimized. Where possible, flood control plans for storm waters should
encourage the detention of water for percolation in to the ground-water to
conserve it for future uses and to mitigate downstream flooding.

16.32.010 Purpose.
This chapter establishes uniform provisions for the regulation of legal
nonconforming land uses, structures, and parcels. Within the zoning districts
established by this development code, there exist land uses, structures, and
parcels that were lawful before the adoption, or amendment of this development
code, but that would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted differently under
the terms of this development code or future amendments. It is the intent of
this development code to discourage the long-term continuance of
nonconformities, but to permit them to exist under the limited conditions
outlined in this chapter. This chapter is intended to be administered in a
manner that encourages the eventual abatement of nonconformities.
(Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.32.020 Definitions.
Nonconformities are defined as follows:
Nonconforming Parcels. A parcel of record that was legally created before the
adoption of this development code and which does not comply with the access,
area or width requirements of this development code for the zoning district in
which it is located.
Nonconforming Structure. A structure that was legally constructed before the
adoption of this development code and which does not conform to current Code
provisions/standards (e.g., open space, distance between structures, etc.)
prescribed for the zoning district in which the structure is located.
Nonconforming Use. A use of a structure (either conforming or nonconforming) or
land that was legally established and maintained before the adoption of this
development code and which does not conform to the current provisions governing
allowable land uses for the zoning district in which the use is located.
Nonconformity Upon Annexation. A use, structure, or parcel that legally existed
in the unincorporated territory and after annexation does not comply with the
provisions of this development code.
(Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.32.030 Restrictions on Nonconforming Uses and Structures.
Nonconformities may be continued subject to the following provisions:
   A.   Nonconforming Uses of Land. A nonconforming use of land may be
continued, transferred, or sold, provided that the use shall not be enlarged or
intensified, nor be extended to occupy a greater area than it lawfully occupied
before becoming a nonconforming use (exception: see subsections (C)(1) and (E),
below).
   B.   Nonconforming Structures. A nonconforming structure may continue to be
used as follows:
      1.   Building Envelope Exemptions. Structures shall not be deemed
nonconformities due solely to nonconformance with building envelope regulations
(i.e., height or setback requirements);
      2.   Changes to a Structure. The addition, enlargement, extension,
reconstruction, relocation, or structural alteration of a nonconforming
structure, may be allowed by the director only if the director finds that the
addition, enlargement, extension, reconstruction, relocation or structural
alteration of the nonconforming structure would not result in the structure
becoming:
         a.   Incompatible with other structures in the neighborhood;
         b.   Inconsistent with the general plan or any applicable specific
plan;
         c.   A restriction to the eventual/future compliance with the
applicable regulations of this development code;
         d.   Detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of persons
residing in the neighborhood; and
         e.   Detrimental and/or injurious to property and improvements in the
neighborhood.
      3.   Conversion of an Existing Residential Structure. The use of a
preexisting residential structure for commercial or industrial purposes may be
allowed with conditional use permit (
16.52) approval, if the conversion, additions and improvements conform to the
applicable provisions of this development code. The commission may approve a
conditional use permit only if the following findings can be made, in addition
to those contained in Section
16.52.040 (Findings and Decision).
      4.   Nonconforming Due to Parking. A nonconforming structure, rendered
nonconforming due to lack of compliance with current standards for off-street
parking, may undergo changes in compliance with Section
16.32.030(B)(2) (Changes to a Structure), above, subject to the following
provisions:
         a.   Residential Uses. Additional parking spaces or driveway paving
shall not be required provided the change does not result in an increase in the
number of dwelling units nor the elimination of required/existing parking or
access; or
         b.   Nonresidential Uses. Additional parking spaces or driveway paving
may be required in compliance with
16.34 (Off-Street Parking and Loading Standards) and further provided the
change does not result in the elimination of existing parking or access.
      5.   Maintenance and Repair. A nonconforming structure may undergo normal
and necessary maintenance and repairs, provided no structural alterations are
made, and the work does not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the current
appraised value of the structure as shown in the County Assessor's records in a
one year period. The director may allow more extensive work only if the
following findings can be made:
         a.   That the additional maintenance and repairs will not, in this
case, adversely impact adjoining properties;
         b.   That the additional maintenance and repairs will not extend the
expected life of the structure; and
         c.   That the additional maintenance and repairs will not be contrary
to the public health, safety and general welfare.
      6.   Seismic Retrofitting/Building Code Compliance. Repairs or
alterations otherwise required by law shall be allowed. Reconstruction required
to reinforce unreinforced masonry structures or to comply with Building Code
requirements shall be allowed without cost limitations, provided the
retrofitting/Code compliance is limited exclusively to compliance with
earthquake safety standards and other applicable Building Code requirements,
including. State law (e.g., Title 24, California Code of Regulations, etc); and
      7.   Other Modifications Allowed. The addition, enlargement, extension,
reconstruction, or structural alteration of a nonconforming structure may be
allowed provided the modification(s) is necessary to secure added safety or to
reduce the fire hazard and/or to secure aesthetic advantages through closer
conformity to surrounding structures with minor conditional use permit approval
in compliance with
16.52.
   C.   Nonconforming Use of a Conforming Structure. The nonconforming use of a
structure that otherwise conforms with applicable provisions of this
development code may be continued, transferred, and sold, as follows, provided
that no structural alterations, except those required by law, are made:
      1.   Expansion of Use. The nonconforming use of a portion of a conforming
structure may be extended throughout other portions of the structure. However,
an expansion shall not:
         a.   Be granted more than one time; nor
         b.   Exceed a maximum of ten percent of the total floor area of the
structure before the expansion.
      2.    Relocation of Use. A nonconforming use located in a conforming
structure may be relocated within the same structure or to an adjacent
conforming structure(s) on the same parcel.
   D.   Prior Building Permits. A use or structure which does not conform to
the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located, but for which a
building permit, minor variance, variance, minor conditional use permit or
conditional use permit, was issued and exercised before the applicability of
this development code, may be completed, provided that the work is pursued
continuously and without delay. These uses or structures, or parts thereof,
shall be deemed to be nonconforming and shall thereafter be subject to the
provisions of this chapter. For the purposes of this section, the provisions of
Chapter 16.80 (Permit Implementation, Time Limits, and Time Extensions) shall
govern the determination of whether the permit or entitlement has been legally
exercised in a timely manner.
   E.   Accessory Structures for Non-Conforming Residential Uses. Legal, non-
conforming residential uses may construct new or replace accessory structures
subject to compliance with the development and design standards contained in
section
16.44.150 Residential Accessory Uses and structure Subsection (A).
(Ord. 492-14 Exhibit 10, 2014; Ord. 430-10 § 3, 2010; Ord. 215 § 2 (part),
2000; Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.32.040 Single- and Multi-Family Dwelling Unit Exemptions.
Nonconforming single- and multi-family residential dwelling units damaged or
destroyed due to a catastrophic event may be reconstructed or replaced with a
new structure(s) using the same development standards applied to the damaged or
destroyed structure(s) (e.g., building envelope and footprint standards). The
new construction shall comply with the current building and fire code
requirements.
(Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.32.050 Loss of Nonconforming Status.
   A.   Termination by Discontinuance.
      1.   If a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use of a
conforming structure is discontinued for a continuous period of at least one
hundred eighty (180) days or more, rights to a legal nonconforming status shall
terminate, regardless of the owner's intention to abandon.
      2.   The determination of abandonment shall be supported by evidence,
satisfactory to the director (e.g., the actual removal of equipment, furniture,
machinery, structures, or other components of the nonconforming use, the
turning-off of the previously connected utilities, or where there are no
business receipts/records available to provide evidence that the use is in
continual operation).
      3.   Without further action by the city, further use of the site or
structure shall comply with all of the regulations of the applicable zoning
district and all other applicable provisions of this development code.
   B.   Termination by Destruction. If a nonconforming structure, or a
conforming structure used for a nonconforming use, is damaged, destroyed or
demolished, the right to continue occupancy of the nonconforming structure, or
to continue the nonconforming use shall cease; provided however, that the
structure may be re-paired or rebuilt and reoccupied only as follows:
      1.   If the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged portion of the
structure does not exceed fifty (50) per-cent of the current appraised value of
the structure, as shown in the county assessor's records, the structure may be
restored and the use continued if the restoration is started within one year of
the date of damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to completion; and
      2.    If the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged portion of the
structure exceeds fifty (50) percent of the current appraised value of the
structure, as shown in the county assessor's records, a minor conditional use
permit (16.52) shall be required to authorize the restoration of the structure
and continue the use. The minor conditional use permit shall include a finding,
in addition to those contained in Section
16.52.040 (Findings and Decision), that the benefit to the public health,
safety or welfare exceeds a detriment inherent in the restoration.
(Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.32.060 Nonconforming Parcels.
A nonconforming parcel of record that does not comply with the access, area, or
width requirements of this development code for the zoning district in which it
is located, shall be considered a legal building site if it meets at least one
of the criteria specified below. This section does not apply to parcels created
by an approved undeveloped subdivision which do not meet the density, area and/
or width requirements of the underlying zone, unless otherwise vested prior to
the zone change or general plan amendment which rendered the subdivision map
non-conforming. New development on nonconforming parcels shall conform to the
current development standards established by this development code and other
applicable city regulations. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
produce sufficient evidence to establish the applicability of one or more of
the following:
   A.   Recorded Lot. A validly existing recorded lot prior to any general plan
amendment or zone change which rendered such lot nonconforming.
   B.   Individual Parcel Legally Created by Deed. The parcel is under one
ownership and of record, and was legally created by a recorded deed before the
effective date of the zoning amendment that made the parcel nonconforming;
   C.   Variance or Lot Line Adjustment. The parcel was approved through the
variance procedure, in compliance with
Chapter 16.72 or resulted from a lot line adjustment.
   D.   Partial Government Acquisition. The parcel was created in compliance
with the provisions of this development code, but was made nonconforming when a
portion of the parcel was acquired by a governmental entity so that the parcel
size is decreased not more than twenty (20) percent and the yard facing a
public right-of-way was decreased not more than fifty (50) percent.
(Ord. 227 § 2 (part), 2000; Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.32.070 Previous Conditional Use Permits in Effect.

with the regulations in effect at the time of application for a land use
activity which, under the new regulations is not allowable by conditional use
permit, may continue, but only in compliance with the provisions and terms of
the original conditional use permit. If the conditional use permit specified a
termination date, then the use shall terminate in compliance with the original
permit.

16.36.010 Findings and Intent.
   A.   The city council finds that Murrieta is a rapidly growing city. The
city's population has the potential to grow from a current population of about
forty thousand (40,000) to approximately one hundred two thousand (102,000) at
build out. This increase in population is reasonably expected to create a
substantial increase in the demand placed upon public facilities. The city's
existing public facilities will soon become inadequate to handle the projected
population growth at existing levels of service. In order to serve the
projected population growth, public facilities must be expanded.
   B.   It is the intent of the city to require every person who develops land
to mitigate the impacts of that development on the city's public facilities.
The city will therefore require developers to pay a public facilities
development impact fee that will assist in meeting the demand for public
facilities caused by development. The public facilities will be constructed in
accordance with a capital improvement plan adopted by resolution of the city
council.
   C.   The amount of the public facilities development impact fees collected
pursuant to this chapter shall be limited to the cost of public facilities
attributable to new development. The amount of the public facilities
development impact fees collected shall not include the cost of public
facilities that serve existing development.
(Ord. 196 § 1 (part), 1998)
16.36.020 Residential Public Facilities Development Impact Fee Required.
   A.   A developer shall pay a public facilities development impact fee for
each building which is part of a residential development, in an amount
established by resolution of the city council, upon issuance of a building
permit for that building; provided, however, that if a residential development
contains more than one dwelling, the development services director may
determine whether the fees or charges shall be paid on a pro rata basis for
each dwelling when it receives its building permit, on a pro rata basis when a
certain percentage of the dwellings have received their building permits, or on
a lump-sum basis when the first dwelling in the development receives its
building permit. If the required fee is not fully paid prior to issuance of a
building permit for construction of any portion of the residential development
encumbered thereby, the development services director may require the property
owner, or lessee if the lessee's interest appears of record, as a condition of
issuance of the building permit, to execute a contract to pay the fee or
charge, or applicable portion thereof, within the time specified above. The
contract shall be recorded with the Riverside County re-corder and shall
constitute a lien for the payment of the fee.
(Ord. 196 § I (part), 1998)
16.36.030 Non-Residential Public Facilities Development Impact Fee Required.
   A.   Except as provided in Sections
16.36.040 and 16.36.050, a developer shall pay a public facilities development
impact fee for each building in a non-residential development or new square
footage of a building in a non-residential development, in an amount
established by resolution of the city council, prior to issuance of a building
permit for that building. Construction which does not result in new square
footage shall not be subject to a public facilities development impact fee.
   B.   Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a building permit may be
issued to a developer prior to payment of a public facilities development
impact fee, if the developer qualifies as any nonprofit organization that is
exempted from taxes by Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
If, pursuant to this paragraph, the required fee is not fully paid prior to
issuance of a building permit for construction of any portion of the non-
residential development encumbered thereby, the development services director
may re-quire the property owner, or lessee if the lessee's interest appears of
record, as a condition of issuance of the building permit, to execute a
contract to pay the fee or charge, or applicable portion thereof, upon transfer
of the non-residential development, or the applicable portion thereof, to a
purchaser that does not qualify as a nonprofit organization that is exempted
from taxes by Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The
contract shall be recorded with the Riverside County recorder and shall
constitute a lien for the payment of the fee.
(Ord. 196 § 1 (part), 1998)
16.36.040 Developer Construction of Public Facilities Pursuant to Capital
Improvement Plan.
   A.   A developer shall be entitled to a reduction in the amount of the
component of the development impact fees required by Sections
16.36.020 and 16.36.030, if the developer constructs public facilities,
relating to that component, pursuant to the city's capital improvement plan and
the public facilities constructed are those for which the capital improvement
plan designates development impact fees as the funding source. The specific
component of the development impact fees which would have funded the
improvement when installed shall be reduced by the amount of engineering and
construction costs that would be reasonably incurred by the city in building
those same public facilities. The amount of the reduction in the development
impact fee component shall be subject to approval by the development services
director prior to construction of the development. In no case shall the
reduction in a specific development impact fee component (i.e. streets and
minor bridges, storm drainage, etc.) be greater than the amount assessed to the
developer for that specific component; nor shall fees from one component be
transferred to another component to offset public facility improvements
constructed by the developer that exceed the assessed amount.
   B.   If a developer constructs off-site public facilities pursuant to the
city's capital improvement plan, and if the city's engineering and construction
costs to construct those same public facilities would have been more than the
public facilities development impact fees assessed to that developer pursuant
to Sections
16.36.020 and 16.36.030, then nothing in this section shall prevent the city
from entering into a reimbursement agreement with that developer, subject to
the availability of funds.
(Ord. 196 § 1 (part), 1998)
16.36.050 Fee Reduction.
   A.   Application for Fee Reduction.
      1.   Any developer whose development is subject to the public facilities
development impact fee required by this chapter may apply to the development
services director for a reduction in that fee based upon the demonstrable
absence of a reasonable relationship between the impact of that development on
the city's public facilities and either the amount of public facilities
development impact fee charged, or the type of public facilities improvements
to be constructed and/or purchased. The application shall be made in writing
and filed with the development services director no later than ninety (90) days
after approval of the development. If no application for discretionary review
is required for the development, then the application shall be made in writing
and filed within ninety (90) days after the city issues a building permit for
the development. The application shall state in detail the factual basis for
the request for reduction. Failure to file a timely application for reduction
deprives the director of jurisdiction to consider the application. The director
shall make a decision on the application for reduction within thirty (30)
calendar days after the application has been filed. Notice of the director's
decision shall be mailed to the applicant, postage paid.
      2.   Any developer whose development is subject to the public facilities
development impact fee required by this chapter, including a developer who, in
connection with the development, has constructed or financed regional or
regionally significant public facilities substantially similar to those
facilities that are listed or otherwise identified in the city's capital
improvement plan, either through participation in a special district (e.g., a
community facilities district or a special assessment district) or as a result
of conditions of approval for the development, may apply to the development
services director for a reduction in that fee. The application shall be made in
writing and filed with the development services director no later than ninety
(90) days after the effective date of this section or ninety (90) days after
the city issues a building permit for the development, whichever is later. The
application shall state in detail the factual basis for the request for
reduction. The city shall consider entering into an agreement, or modifying an
existing agreement, with any developer applying for a reduction pursuant to
this subsection.
   B.   Appeal from Director's Decision.
      1.   Any decision of the development services director under subsection
16.36.050(A) may be appealed to the city council by filing an application for
appeal with the city clerk. The application must be filed within fifteen (15)
calendar days after notice of the director's decision has been mailed to the
applicant; provided, however, that if the fifteen (15) days expire on a day
when Murrieta City Hall is not open for business, then the appeal period shall
be extended to the next business day.
      2.   Failure to file a timely appeal application deprives the city
council of jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
      3.   The city council shall consider the appeal at a public hearing to be
held within forty-five (45) calendar days after the appeal application is
filed. Notice of public hearing pursuant to
Chapter 16.76 of the Murrieta Municipal Code shall not be required for an
appeal of development impact fees.
   C.   Allocation of Fee Reductions or Credits. Any fee reductions or fee
credit granted pursuant to this chapter shall be applied only to that component
of the public facilities development impact fee which would have funded the
improvement upon which the reduction or credit is based or for which a fee
reduction was granted pursuant to subsection 16.36.050(A)(1).
   D.   Processing of Protests. The procedure set forth in this section shall
implement Government Code Section 66020, or its successor, and shall serve as
the city's method for processing protests filed pursuant to that section. Prior
to the effective date of the approval of the development, or, if no
discretionary approval is revoked, prior to the issuance of a building permit,
a developer that is subject to this chapter shall sign a statement
acknowledging the imposition of a public facilities development impact fee upon
that developer's development. Such acknowledgment shall not be deemed a waiver
of the developer's right to protest the imposition and to request a fee
adjustment pursuant to this section.
(Ord. 196 § 1 (part), 1998)
16.36.060 Use of Funds.
All public facilities development impact fees paid and collected pursuant to
this chapter shall be placed in one or more funds and used solely for the
purpose of constructing, expanding or rehabilitating the public facilities
specified in the resolution establishing the fee and described in the city's
capital improvement plan.
(Ord. 196 § 1 (part), 1998)
16.36.070 School Facilities.
The following standards are intended to provide a mechanism whereby the impact
of new development on public school facilities can be evaluated, and
appropriate mitigation measures for the provision of school facilities be
required if necessary.
   A.   Annual School Impact Report. The city shall, at the commencement of
each calendar year, request that each school district serving the city and/or
its sphere of influence area, submit in a timely manner, a report to the city
which addresses all of the following for each district facility:
      1.   Current demand;
      2.   Existing capacity;
      3.   Future expansion needs;
      4.   Student generation factors;
      5.   Status report of overcrowding of facilities; and
      6.   Status of applications and eligibility for state funding.
   B.   Submittal of Applications to School Districts. The city shall transmit
the application materials for any land use entitlement to the applicable school
district within ten days of filing an application.
   C.   School Impact Analysis Required. Within twenty (20) days of the receipt
of an application for any land use entitlement, the applicable school district
shall prepare a school impact analysis based on the most recent school impact
report. The analysis should evaluate the proposed project's impact on the
demand for schools based on the servicing area. If the school district fails to
submit the analysis to the city in a timely manner, the city may assume that
the school district has no information to submit.
   D.   California Environmental Quality Act Compliance. Notwithstanding
subsection 16.36.050(C), the city shall conduct an environmental analysis of
the impact of a project on the affected school district.
   E.   Phasing of Development/Density Reduction. If adequate school facilities
will not be available in a timely manner, pursuant to the impact analysis
required in subsection 16.36.050(C), the city may reduce the density of a
project or phase development of a project until adequate school facilities are
available.
   F.   Projects Involving Legislative Acts. The provisions of this subsection
shall apply to new development projects that include any of the following land
use entitlement applications: development agreements, general plan amendments,
master development plans, public financing and/or redevelopment proposals,
specific plans, zone changes, and other legislative approval.
Prior to the approval of an implementing entitlement, a conditional use permit,
a development plan permit, or a tentative map that is part of any land use
entitlement described above, an approved copy of any impact mitigation
agreement entered into between a developer and a district, shall be provided to
the department. School impact mitigation agreements are not required to be
approved at the time of approval of the legislative act, except when concurrent
implementing entitlements are processed (e.g., a change of zone and a
conditional use permit).
   G.   Projects not Involving Legislative Acts. The provisions of this
subsection shall apply to new development projects which do not involve a
legislative action, (e.g., as a conditional use permit, a development plan
permit, or a tentative map).
      1.   All residential development proposals of seventy-five (75) gross
acres or more, not within a master development plan or specific plan, shall be
evaluated for possible inclusion of a ten net usable acre elementary school
site.
      2.   Development proposals are not required to obtain a separate school
impact mitigation agreement from the applicable school district prior to the
issuance of a building permit. School mitigation fees shall be as authorized
under state statute.
(Ord. 196 § 2, 1998)
16.36.080 Dedications and Improvements.
The purpose of this section is to establish standards and requirements for
dedications and improvements in connection with the development of land in
which no subdivision is involved.
A.   Dedications Required. Applicants who propose new development within the
city shall provide, by means of an offer of dedication or other appropriate
conveyance as approved by the city attorney, the rights-of-way necessary for
the construction of any street as shown on the circulation plan in the general
plan, any applicable specific plan, or otherwise required by the city engineer
in compliance with an established street system or plan. Rights-of-way shall
also be provided for improvements to existing facilities including rights-of-
way for storm drains or other required public facilities. All rights-of-way
shall be accompanied by a title examination report and be free of all liens and
encumbrances.
Dedications required by this section shall be made before the issuance of a
building permit for a subject property.
B.   Public Improvements Required. Applicants who propose new development
within the city shall cause to construct all necessary improvements in
compliance with city specifications upon the property and along all street
frontages adjoining the property upon which the structure is constructed unless
adequate improvements already exists. In each instance, the city engineer shall
determine whether or not the necessary improvements exist and are adequate.
C.   Construction of Public Improvements. If the city engineer determines that
public improvements are required, these public improvements shall be designed
to city standards and their construction guaranteed by an improvement agreement
secured by a bond or cash deposit before issuance of a building permit for the
subject property. If the building permit is not exercised, the improvement
obligation shall terminate and the security shall be returned. The city
engineer is authorized to execute agreements on behalf of the city.
D.   Deferrals of Public Improvement Requirements. Requests for deferrals of
improvements shall be processed in compliance with Section
16.108.130 (Article V).
E.   Exemption for Expansion of Existing Single Family Homes.
   1.   The addition, enlargement, expansion, alteration, extension,
reconstruction or replacement of any existing single family dwelling and/or
accessory structure shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter to
construct street improvements.
   2.   The development of non-habitable accessory structure(s) as provided for
under Section
16.44.150 of this Title shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter
to construct street improvements.
   3.   A development that is exempt from the requirement to construct street
improvements as provided for in this section shall remain subject to the
requirement to provide the city with an irrevocable offer of dedication for the
ultimate street right-of-way for any addition, enlargement, expansion,
alteration, extension, reconstruction or replacement of an existing single
family dwelling and/or habitable accessory structure regardless of size.
   4.   No exemption from the requirement to construct street improvements
shall be granted if the city engineer determines that the lack of street
improvements in this case would be a potential danger to the public health,
safety and welfare. (Ord. 538, Exhibit A (part), 2018; Ord. 439-10, § 1, 2010;

16.38.060 Comprehensive Sign Program.
   A.   Purpose. The purpose of a comprehensive sign program is to integrate a
project's signs with the design of the structures to achieve a unified
architectural statement. A comprehensive sign program provides a means for the
flexible application of sign regulations for multi-tenant projects and projects
with more than five (5) permanent signs in order to encourage creativity and
provide incentive and latitude in the provision of multiple signs and to
achieve, not circumvent, the intent of this chapter.
   B.   Development Plan Permit Required. The director shall approve a
development plan permit for a comprehensive sign program for a multi-tenant
nonresidential project and individual tenant projects with five (5) or more
signs. Standards and guidelines provided in this chapter shall serve as a
reference for evaluating comprehensive sign programs.
   C.   Application Requirements. An application for a development plan permit
shall be accompanied by plans and information as provided in department
handouts for comprehensive sign programs and the following:
      1.   A statement explaining how revisions/modifications/replacement of
tenant signs will be carried out to limit the possibility of holes being left
in the structure's exterior by mounting brackets, electrical connections, or
similar items; and
      2.   A statement of how the use of temporary signs, Including banners,
flags and pennants and similar advertising devices will be monitored by the
applicant to ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Failure
of the applicant to adequately monitor and control the use of temporary signs
shall be grounds for revocation of the development plan permit in compliance
with
Chapter 16.82 (Revocations and Modifications).
   D.   Design Standards. The following design standards are applicable to all
signs being proposed under a comprehensive sign program:
      1.   Signs, colors, and materials shall be compatible with the building's
colors and materials. Limit the number of primary colors on signs to no more
than three (3) with a secondary color used for accent or shadow detail;
      2.   Use the same type of cabinet, cabinet supports, or method of
mounting for signs of the same type;
      3.   Use the same form of illumination for signs of similar types:
      4.   If exposed raceways are proposed they shall be an integral part of
the design.
   E.   Lessees to be Informed of Comprehensive Sign Program. Lessees within
developments subject to the requirements of an approved comprehensive sign
program shall be made aware of the Program in their lease and their
responsibility to follow the approved comprehensive sign program.
   F.   Findings. In approving an application for a development plan permit
authorizing a comprehensive sign program, the Director shall make the following
findings in addition to those required for a development plan permit in
compliance with
Chapter 16.56:
      1.   The comprehensive sign program satisfies the purpose and the intent
of this chapter;
      2.   The signs enhance the overall development, are in harmony with, and
are visually related to other signs included in the comprehensive sign program
and to the structure and/or uses they identify and to surrounding development;
      3.   The comprehensive sign program accommodates future revisions which
may be required due to changes in uses or tenants; and
      4.   The comprehensive sign program complies with the standards of this
chapter 16.38, except that flexibility is allowed with regard to sign area,
number of signs, location, and/or height to the extent that the comprehensive
sign program will enhance the overall development and will more fully
accomplish the purposes of this chapter.
   G.   Revisions to Comprehensive Sign Programs. Revisions to a comprehensive
sign program may be approved by the director if it is determined that the
revision is minor and that the intent of the original approval, and any
conditions attached thereto, are not affected. For revisions that would
substantially deviate from the original approval, the director may require that
a modification to the development plan permit application be filed.
(Ord. 524 Exhibit A, 2017; Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.38.070 Sign Design.
In determining the consistency of each proposed sign with the purposes of this
chapter, the following guidelines shall be applied:
   A.   That the proposed sign will be legible to the intended audience under
normal viewing conditions, based on its proposed location, and the design of
its visual element;
   B.   That the proposed sign will not obscure from view or detract from
existing signs, based on its location, shape, color, and other similar
considerations. Signs colors should be compatible with the architecture. The
use of garish or fluorescent colors is considered inappropriate;
   C.   That the proposed sign shall be designed as an integral design element
of a building's architecture and shall be architecturally compatible, including
color and scale, with any building to which the sign is to be attached and with
surrounding structure and will be in harmony with adjacent properties and
surroundings, based on the size, shape, height, color, placement, and the
proximity of the proposed signs to adjacent properties and surroundings;
   D.   That the proposed structure, sign, or display will be designed,
constructed, and located so that it will not constitute a hazard to the public;
and
   E.   If exposed raceways are proposed they shall be an integral part of the
design.

16.38.150 Billboards Subject to a Relocation Agreement.
The city recognizes that California Business and Professions Code Section 5412
encourages cities to enter into relocation agreements, and to adopt ordinances
or resolutions providing for relocation of billboards. Thus, the intent of this
section is to reduce visual clutter; eliminate non-conforming signage;
facilitate the relocation and redistribution of existing billboards to more
appropriate locations within the city to better serve the advertising needs of
the local business community; to allow for incorporation of modern technology
into relocated billboards in the form of digital displays; and to eliminate
payment of public funds for the removal of existing billboards to accommodate a
public project.
   A.   Content. Each relocation agreement shall contain, at a minimum, the
following information:
      1.   Identification of the location of the relocated billboard(s) and the
billboard(s) being permanently removed;
      2.   Conceptual design drawings for the relocated billboard(s), including
sign area and dimensions; and
      3.   Description of the revenue or other consideration to be received by
the city.
   B.   Review Process. All relocation agreements shall be reviewed and
approved by the city council. The following findings must be made by the city
council in order to approve a relocation agreement:
      1.   The proposed agreement is consistent with the goals, objectives,
purposes and provisions of the Murrieta General Plan and the Murrieta Municipal
Code;
      2.   The proposed relocation site is compatible with the uses and
structures on the site and in the surrounding area;
      3.   The proposed relocation agreement contributes to the reduction of
visual clutter in the city by proposing a net decrease in existing billboards
and promotes activities of city-wide benefit and interest and generates
significant revenue for the city; or in the case of relocations to accommodate
a public project, the agreement serves the public interest eliminating the need
for public fund expenditure;
      4.   The proposed billboard would not create a traffic or safety problem
with regard to onsite access circulation or visibility;
      5.   The proposed billboard would not interfere with onsite parking or
landscaping required by city ordinance or permit; and
      6.   The proposed billboard would not otherwise result in a threat to the
general health, safety and welfare of city residents, based on factors
including but not limited to such factors as distracted driving, driver safety,
light and glare, or aesthetics.
   C.   Status of Existing Billboards. Only billboards that comply with the
Murrieta Municipal Code or that are legal non-conforming billboards as of the
date of adoption of this section are eligible to be relocated pursuant to a
relocation agreement.
   D.   Permits Required. All relocated billboards shall require a building
permit. Relocated billboards on city property shall also require a lease or
license and a conditional use permit. Relocated billboards on private property
shall also require a development agreement, and a conditional use permit (in
addition to the development agreement) if required by the relocation agreement.
Subsequent to the approval of a relocation agreement by the city council, the
billboard owner and/or property owner shall file applications for the permits
and agreements specified herein and in the relocation agreement. All of the
foregoing applications submitted by the billboard owner must include the
written consent of the property owner. All billboards, whether relocated,
reconstructed, or new, require either a conditional use permit or development
agreement as determined by the city.
   E.   Non-Conforming Billboards. Any non-conforming billboard relocated or
reconstructed pursuant to an approved relocation agreement shall no longer be
considered non-conforming for purposes of this code.

A.   A tree report shall be prepared by an arborist.
B.   A Tree Report shall include the following information:
   1.   The precise vertical and horizontal location within plus or minus one
foot of each protected tree on the subject parcel and the generalized locations
of all protected trees within twenty (20) feet of the subject parcel. Each
protected tree shall be assigned an identification number;

(Ord. 553-19 § 8, 2019; Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.42.090 Preservation of Protected Trees.
A.   The design of each project shall recognize the desirability of preserving
protected trees to the greatest extent feasible. The design of the grading and
other improvements shall reflect consideration of the following safe-guards:
   1.   Provision of sufficient growing areas as required by individual
species;
   2.   No disruption or removal of structural or feeder roots;
   3.   Fencing of trees at or beyond their drip lines during grading and
construction activities;
   4.   No filling, cutting, development, or compaction of soils within the
drip line;
   5.   Preservation of oak leaf litter below the drip line; and
   6.   Other measures required by the particular species of tree(s) to be
preserved as recommended by the consulting arborist, horticulturist, or
landscape architect.
B.   It is recognized that the preservation of all healthy trees on a
development site may sometimes conflict with reasonable land developmental
considerations (e.g., adequate drainage, grading, circulation, safety, and
provision of utilities.) However, the design of the proposed development shall
address preservation of the most desirable and significant of the healthy trees
and the developer is encouraged to utilize creative land planning techniques to
achieve this goal.
C.   The review authority shall consider each development proposal and
determine the adequacy and appropriateness of the proposed plan to preserve and
maintain protected trees. Grading and landscaping plans shall implement an
approved tree preservation program. The locations of all protected trees shall
be indicated on the plans by the number of the tree as described in the tree
report. Notes shall identify which trees are to be preserved, and which may be
removed. Plans shall be consistent with the required tree protection mitigation
measures included in the project application, initial study, mitigated negative
declaration environmental impact report and monitoring plan, and the conditions
of the development approval. Plans shall be approved by the director and the
city engineer. Prior to use inauguration, the preserved trees shall be trimmed
for healthy balance, structural integrity and ornamental appearance as
recommended in the tree report for the project.
D.   The precise vertical and horizontal locations (plus or minus one foot) of
all protected trees shall be shown on the site plan as part of the initial
application unless the project does not involve exterior alterations or
construction activities.
(Ord. 553-19 § 9, 2019; Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.42.095   Protected Tree Replacement Standards.
A.   Replacement standards.
   1.   A protected tree shall be replaced at a ratio of one inch DSH of tree
replaced for each inch DSH of tree removed.
B.   Replacement equivalents.
   1.   Trees planted as replacement trees for native Oak trees or native trees
shall be the same species as those removed or a species that is acceptable to
the director, with consideration given to species diversity.
   2.   Trees planted as replacement trees for mature trees shall be limited to
species that are drought tolerant and ignition-resistant and not deemed to be
an invasive species, to the satisfaction of the director.
   3.   The following equivalent sizes shall be used whenever new trees, or
combination thereof, are planted (either on-site or off-site) pursuant to a
tree replacement plan:
      a.   A tree in a 15 gallon container equates to a one inch DSH.
      b.   A tree in a 24 inch box equates to a two inch DSH.
      c.   A tree in a 36 inch box or larger equates to a three inch DSH.
C.   Security.
   1.   Security may be required for any tree replacement. The security shall
guarantee the tree permittee's compliance with conditions of approval and city
provisions regarding tree protection and preservation. Security may also be
required at the discretion of the director to insure the completion of any
additional work specified as a condition of permit approval or other approvals.
   2.   The security shall be in the amount of the estimated cost of the
required work. The applicant shall include the cost estimate by an Arborist as
part of the tree replacement plan. The terms and conditions of the security
shall be reviewed and approved by the director prior to approval of the tree
replacement plan.
   3.   Security posted on actual work required shall be maintained for the
time period determined by the director.
(Ord. 553-19 § 10, 2019)
16.42.100 Considerations for Approving Tree Removal Permits.
A.   The determination to approve a tree removal permit shall be based upon the
following considerations:
   1.   The condition of the tree with respect to disease, danger of collapse
of all or any portion of the tree, proximity to an existing structure,
interference with utility services, or, in the case of mature native oak trees,
interference with an addition to an existing single family detached home;
   2.   The necessity to remove a protected tree to construct improvements that
allow economic enjoyment of the property;
   3.   The number of protected trees existing in the neighborhood/area;
   4.   Good forestry practices (i.e., the number of healthy mature trees that
a given parcel of land will support);
   5.   The necessity to remove a protected tree to construct required
improvements within a public street right-of-way, flood control right-of-way.
or utility right-of-way; and
   6.   The suitability of the tree species for use in an urban area.
B.   The director may waive any requirement of this chapter based upon a
determination that the tree(s) would have little or no ornamental value in an
urban setting, or that the tree(s) are located so that they would not be
impacted by the proposed development, or evidence is provided from an arborist
determining that the current condition of the tree does not justify its
protection (i.e., damaged tree or diseased tree).
(Ord. 553-19 § 11, 2019; Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.42.110 Post Approval Procedures.
The following procedures, shall apply following the approval of a tree removal
permit application:
A.   Appeals. The decision of the director shall be considered final unless an
appeal is filed in compliance with Chapter 16.78 (Appeals).
B.   Expiration/Extension. A tree removal permit shall be exercised within one
year from the date of approval or other time limit established through a
discretionary permit approval. Time extensions, for up to a total of two
additional years, may be granted in compliance with
Chapter 16.80 (Permit Implementation and Time Extensions). If a tree removal
permit is not exercised within the established time frame, and a time extension
is not granted, the provisions of
Chapter 16.80 (Permit Implementation and Time Extensions) shall be initiated to
consider the permit expired.
C.   Issuance of Building Permit. Building permits may be issued once all
applicable terms and conditions of the approved tree removal permit have been
satisfied. Minor changes to required conditions of an approved permit may be
granted in compliance with Section
16.80.070 (Changes to an Approved Project).
D.   Performance Guarantee. The applicant/owner may be required to provide
adequate performance security for the faithful performance of conditions of
approval imposed as part of the tree removal permit.
E.   Construction Monitoring. Monitoring of tree protection and restoration
measure specified as conditions of approval shall be performed by site
inspection conducted by the director.
F.   Revocation. A tree removal permit may be revoked or modified, as
established in
Chapter 16.82 (Revocations/Modifications), which generally includes findings
that the tree removal, relocation, or protection activities:
   1.   Cannot support the original findings:
   2.   Resulted from misrepresentation or fraud;
   3.   Has not been implemented in a timely manner;
   4.   Has not met, or has violated any condition of approval:
   5.   It is in violation of any code, law, ordinance, or statute;
   6.   Is detrimental to public health, safety, or welfare; or
   7.   Constitutes a nuisance.
G.   Enforcement.
   1.   Any person who cuts, damages, or moves a protected tree in violation of
this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction may be
punished in compliance with the applicable provisions of the municipal code.
   2.   Violation of this chapter during construction activity may result in an
immediate stop-work order until permits are obtained along with proper
mitigation procedures.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3228.gif]
 
   D.   The provision of drive-through service facilities shall not justify a
reduction in the number of required off-street parking spaces.
   E.   Drive-through aisles shall provide adequate on-site queuing distance to
accommodate six cars (one hundred twenty (120) feet) before the first stopping
point (e.g.. menu board, teller window, automatic teller machine). No portion

   F.   Each drive-through aisle shall be appropriately screened with a
combination of landscaping, low walls, and/or berms to prevent headlight glare
from impacting adjacent streets and parking lots.
   G.   A six-foot high solid decorative wall shall be constructed on each
property line that is adjoining a residentially zoned or occupied parcel. The
design of the wall and the proposed construction materials shall be subject to
the approval of the director.

   Gated residential communities shall be developed and maintained in
accordance with this section.
   A.   Required Access. Gated developments shall install and maintain in good
working order emergency public safety access consistent with fire and police
requirements.
(Ord. 536-18 § 2 (part), 2018; Ord. 332 § 2, 2005)
16.44.090 Hotels and Motels.
   A.   Design Issues. Hotels and motels are quasi-residential uses and should
be designed and sited to minimize the effect of noise from Murrieta's two
freeways. Although they are quasi-residential, the scale of, and activities
associated with hotels and motels often make them problematic neighbors for
adjacent residential properties. If a residential interface cannot be avoided,
it should be carefully designed to mitigate any potential adverse impacts on
existing or future adjacent residents. Because hotel and motel architecture is
often thematic, presenting a strong temptation to over design the building's
front and to neglect the other sides, it is important to remember that all
sides of a building require consistent architectural treatment.
   B.   Site Planning.
      1.   The primary presence along the major street frontage shall be the
building and driveway approach, not the parking lot.
      2.   Only a few (no more than five) short term parking spaces shall be
provided near the office for check-ins.
      3.   Exterior corridors on multi-level buildings are strongly discouraged
and shall not be located adjacent to residential uses.
      4.   Delivery and loading areas shall not be located where visible from
residential uses.
      5.   Mechanical equipment of all types, including swimming pool
equipment, shall be located to assure that it cannot be heard at any
residential property line.
      6.   Recreational facilities (e.g.. as swimming pools) shall be located
where guests can use them in some privacy; they shall not be exposed to public
streets to function as advertising.
      7.   Avoid locating driveway, garage ramps or loading and service areas
where they interfere with the flow of pedestrian movement or impact the privacy
of guest rooms.
      8.   Utilize parking lots and other open spaces on the site to help
buffer the hotel/motel from any adjacent in-compatible uses.
   C.   Building Design.
      1.   Noise attenuation techniques shall be included in the design of
buildings near major noise generators, (e.g., major streets, freeway).
Techniques may include: double paned glass, earthberms, thick tree groves over
thirty (30) feet in depth or lowering the grade of the subject building below
the roadway elevation. Solid masonry walls over five feet high are not
desirable in Murrieta.
      2.   The scale of buildings shall be related to the surrounding
development patterns.
      3.   Walkway. stairway, and balcony railings and other similar details
shall be visually substantial (handrails with a thickness exceeding two and
one-half (2½) inches and balusters over two inches thick) and stylistically
consistent with the basic building design.
      4.   Air conditioning units shall not be visible from public streets.
Structures over three stories shall avoid exterior exposed air-conditioning
units for each room.
      5.   Guest rooms shall be accessible from hallways within the hotel, not
exterior balconies. Avoid room en-trances directly adjacent to parking lots or
exterior walkways.

FIGURE 3-15
(Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.44.100 Mixed Use Projects.
   A.   Design Issues. For the purpose of this section multiple or mixed use
projects are defined as developments that combine both commercial/office and
residential uses or structures on a single lot, or as components of a single
development. The uses may be combined either vertically within the same
structure, or spread horizon-tally on the site in different areas and
structures.
The primary design issue related to mixed use projects is the need to
successfully balance the requirements of residential uses. (e.g., the need for
privacy and security) with the needs of commercial uses for access, visibility,
parking, loading, and possibly extended hours of operation.
   B.   Site Planning.
      1.   Mixed use projects that provide commercial space on the ground floor
with residential units above are encouraged over projects that provide
commercial structures on the front portion of the lot with residential uses
placed at the rear of the lot. This latter configuration does not meet the
intent of a true mixed use project which incorporates vertical integration of
uses.
However, a horizontal separation (commercial to the front, residential to the
rear) of uses may be appropriate depending on the size of the site and
available access.
      2.   Separate site access drive and parking facilities shall be provided
for residential uses and commercial uses in compliance with
Chapter 16.34 (Off-street Parking and Loading).
      3.   If enclosed parking is provided for the entire complex, separate
levels shall be provided for residential and commercial uses with separate
building entrances.
      4.   Site access drives shall incorporate distinctive architectural
elements and landscape features which help to differentiate access to
commercial parking areas from residential areas. Security gates shall be
considered for access to residential uses and residential parking areas, as
well as to securing commercial parking areas when businesses are closed.
      5.   When a mixed use project is designed as separate structures on a lot
with the commercial uses along the street and residential uses at the rear, a
decorative masonry wall with security gates shall separate the uses.
      6.   Loading areas and refuse storage facilities shall be located as far
as possible from residential units and shall be completely screened from view
from adjacent residential portions of the project. The location and design of
trash enclosures shall account for potential nuisances from odors.
      7.   Parking lot lighting and security lighting for the commercial uses
shall be appropriately shielded so as not to spill over into the residential
area. Residential units shall also be shielded from illuminated commercial
signing.
      8.   Open space intended for use by `"residents only"" may not be
accessible from commercial areas. Open space and courtyards in commercial areas
may be accessible to residential occupants and visitors.
      9.   When residential and commercial uses are provided in the same
structure, separate entrances shall be provided for each use.
   C.   Building Design.
      1.   The architectural style and use of materials shall be consistent
throughout the entire project. Differences in materials and/or architectural
details should only occur on a structure where the intent is to differentiate
between the residential scale and character of the structure and the commercial
scale and character.
      2.   The design of storefronts shall be consistent with the design
guidelines for commercial development. The residential portion of a mixed use
structure shall be consistent with the design guidelines for multi-family
residential development.

      3.    Projects three stories or less in height shall incorporate full
roofs on at least fifty (50) percent of the roof area.
      4.    Structures with heights greater than three stories shall set back
upper portions of the structure a minimum of ten feet for each additioual two
stories.
      5 .    All roof mounted equipment shall be screened in compliance with
Section
16.18.120 (Screening and Buffering). Special consideration should be given to
the location and screening of noise generating equipment (e.g., refrigeration
units, air conditioning, and exhaust fans). Noise reducing screens and
insulation may be required where equipment has the potential to impact
residential uses.
(Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.44.110 Office Buildings.
   A.    Design Issues. While office buildings are found on every kind of
commercial street, they have functional characteristics that result in physical
forms different from other commercial development: intensity of use is lower;
buildings are typically 'live' on all four sides; office activities are not
limited to the first floor; building perimeters have fewer entries and no
display windows and thus have more opportunity for landscaping. Because their
use patterns differ significantly from retail commercial, there is more
opportunity to site office buildings up toward the street with parking behind.
This arrangement is strongly encouraged even where the pattern is not an
established one.
   B.   Site Planning.
      1 .    Buildings shall be placed at the minimum required front setback.
Alternate solutions may be considered that are determined to provide a superior
solution to protecting neighboring sensitive land uses or orienting the
building toward a freeway frontage to enhance the community image.
      2.   Multi-story building shall not be placed adjacent to the private
open space areas of residential uses. First floor may be adjacent to setback;
second and third floors shall be setback an additional foot for each additional
foot in height.
      3.    Office buildings should have the primary entry from the public
street with secondary entries from any onsite pedestrian paths or parking
areas.
   C.    Building Design.
      1 .    Large or long unadorned wall planes shall be avoided. As a general
standard, building surfaces over two stories high or fifty (50) feet in length
will need to be relieved with a change of vertical and horizontal wall plane
that provides strong shadow and visual interest.
      2.    Clear glass shall be used for ground floor windows where pedestrian
traffic is high and there is any potential for retail, food service of other
service occupancy.

      3.    Building entries shall be protected from inclement weather and
should afford a 'sense of entry' for the structure.

16.52.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a process for reviewing conditional
use permit applications which are intended to allow the establishment of uses
which are deemed to have some special impact, uniqueness, or effect on the
neighborhood surrounding the subject site. The permit application process
allows for the review of the location and design of the proposed use,
configuration of improvements, potential impact(s) on the surrounding
neighborhood, and to ensure that development in each zoning district protects
the integrity of that district.
At the time of an application for a conditional use permit, a review of the
location, design configuration, and potential impact(s) of the proposed project
shall be conducted by comparing the project to established standards. This
review shall determine whether the proposed use should be allowed by weighing
the public need for and the benefit to be derived from the use against any
adverse impact(s) it may cause.

would not impair the integrity and character of, the subject zoning district
and complies with all applicable provisions of this development code;
   C.   The proposed use is consistent with the objectives, policies, general
land uses, and programs of the general plan, and any applicable specific plan;
   D.   The approval of the conditional use permit for the proposed use is in
compliance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) and there will be no potentially significant negative impacts upon
environmental quality and natural resources that could not be properly
mitigated and monitored;
   E.   The site is suitable for the type and intensity of use or development
that is proposed;
   F.   There are adequate provisions for sanitation, water, and public
utilities and services to ensure public convenience, health, safety, and

conditions or situations that may be objectionable or detrimental to other
allowed uses in the vicinity or adverse to the public convenience, health,
safety, or general welfare, or materially injurious to properties and
improvements in the vicinity of the subject property.
(Ord. 598-23 § 7, 2023; Ord. 182 § 2 (part), 1997)
16.52.050 Conditions.
In approving a conditional use permit, the applicable review authority may
impose specific locational, develop-mental, and operational conditions relating
to both on- and off-site improvements (e.g., dedications, easements, public
improvements, etc.), as it finds are reasonable and necessary to ensure that
the use and development of the property conform with the site plan,
architectural drawings, and statements submitted in support of the application
or with modifications that would be deemed necessary to protect the public
convenience, health, safety, and general welfare.
Additionally, the conditions shall ensure compliance with the objectives of the
general plan and any applicable specific plan, the findings required by Section
16.52.040 (Findings and Decision), above, this development code, and to carry
out the purpose and requirements of the respective zoning district.

unless an appeal is filed in compliance with
Chapter 16.78 (Appeals).
   B.   Expiration/Extension. To ensure continued compliance with the
provisions of this development code, each approved conditional use permit shall
expire three years from the date of approval, unless a permit has been issued
or construction of the project is substantially completed before its
expiration, in compliance with
Chapter 16.80 (Permit Implementation, Time Limits, and Extensions). Time
extensions may be granted in compliance with Section
16.80.060 (Time Extension), if a written request is submitted by the applicant,
and received by the department, prior to the expiration of the conditional use
permit. If the use granted by the conditional use permit has not been exercised
before its expiration, and a time extension is not granted, the provisions of
Chapter 16.80 (Permit Implementation, Time Limits, and Extensions) shall deem
the permit void.
   C.   Issuance of a Zoning Clearance. A zoning clearance may be issued once
all applicable terms and conditions of the approved conditional use permit have

adequate performance security for the faithful performance of any/all
conditions of approval imposed as part of the approved conditional use permit.
   F.   Suspension/Revocation.
      1.   Issuance of Order. Upon a showing of probable cause by code
enforcement staff of a violation of this chapter or the conditions of
operations by a conditional use permit holder, the director may issue an order
suspending the conditional use permit pending a hearing before the commission.
The director shall cause notice of the suspension order to be served on the
permit holder by first-class U.S. mail and by posting the subject property.
      2.   Notice of Violation/Public Hearing. Whenever the director suspects a
violation of the conditions of operations by a conditional use permit holder,
the director shall notify the permit holder and specify how the violation(s)
can be remedied and the time frame within which the violations must be
corrected. If the permit holder has not remedied the violation(s) in the
required time frame, the director may schedule a public hearing to consider the
revocation of a conditional use permit to be held by the commission in
compliance with
Chapter 16.82 (Revocations and Modifications). Notice of the hearing shall be
mailed to the permit holder, any party complaining of the violation and to all
adjoining residents and property owners.
      3.   Commission's Action. At the conclusions of the hearing, the
commission may revoke or modify the conditional use permit, in compliance with
Chapter 16.82, or order the termination of the suspension or revocation and
order the reinstatement of the permit. The decision of the commission may be
appealed to the council, in compliance with
Chapter 16.78 (Appeals).
   G.   Run With the Land. The conditional use permit that is valid and in
effect, and was granted in compliance with the provisions of this chapter,
shall run with the land and continue to be valid upon a change of owner-ship of
the land or any lawfully existing structure on the land.
   H.   Expiration of Permit. A conditional use permit shall be considered to
have expired if the use for which the permit was granted ceased or was
suspended for at least one hundred eighty (180) successive days.

the affected public agency. State law (Government Code Section 65865) allows
local agencies to enter into contractual agreements relating to the intensity,
timing, and conditions of development of real properties.
This chapter shall not be construed or applied at any time to require the city
to enter into an agreement; more specifically, but without limitation, no
amount of preliminary negotiations, preliminary work, or any expenditure of
funds shall be a basis for a claim of estoppel or bad faith that would require
city approval or implementation of an unexecuted agreement.
The public interest is adequately protected by noticed public hearings before
the commission and council and by a specific state law (Government Code Section
65867.5) provision subjecting a development agreement to the people's right of
referendum.

16.68.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a process for reviewing surface
mining permit applications which are intended to create and maintain an
effective surface mining and reclamation policy as authorized by the California
Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (Public Resources Code, Section 2710
et seq.). While preservation and extraction of economic viable mineral
resources has been determined to be in the interests of the people of
California by the state legislature, it also recognized that surface mining
activities may result in significant adverse environmental impacts.
It is, therefore, the intent of this chapter to regulate surface mining
operations to ensure that:
   A.   The adverse effects of surface mining operations would be prevented or
minimized, and that mined lands would be reclaimed to a usable condition that
is readily adaptable for alternative land use;
   B.   The reclamation of mined land would be carried out in a way that the
continued mining of valuable minerals would not be precluded; and

requires another discretionary permit, the fee(s) for all other discretionary
permits shall be paid.
      8.   If an individual needs assistance in making the request for
reasonable accommodation, the city will provide assistance to ensure the
process is accessible.
   B.   Other Discretionary Permits. If a project, for which the request for
reasonable accommodation is being made, also requires some discretionary permit
(s) or approval(s), the application may be submitted and reviewed at the same
time as the related permit(s) or approval(s).
(Ord. 482-13 § 2, 2013)
16.73.040 Review Authority.
The director may approve, conditionally approve, or deny a reasonable
accommodation request, with ten-day public notice to adjacent property owners,
subject to the Findings in

fundamental alteration in the nature of a city program or law, including, but
not limited to, land use and zoning.
      5.   There are no reasonable alternatives that would provide an
equivalent level of benefit without requiring a modification or exception to
the city’s applicable rules, standards and practices.
   B.   In determining whether the requested reasonable accommodation is
necessary to make specific housing available to individual(s) with a
disability, pursuant to Subsection (A)(2) above, the city may consider, but is
not limited to, the following factors:
      1.   Whether the requested accommodation will affirmatively enhance the
quality of life of a person(s) with disability.
      2.   Whether the person(s) with disability will be denied opportunity to
enjoy the housing type of their choice absent the accommodation.
   C.   In determining whether the requested reasonable accommodation would
require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a city program or law,
pursuant to Subsection (A)(4) above, the city may consider, but is not limited
to, the following factors:
      1.   Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the
character of the neighborhood.

authority may impose any conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary
to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would comply with the findings
required by Subsection (A) above.

construction commencement shall be consistent with the tentative map and the
permit/entitlement shall be exercised before the expiration of the companion
tentative map.

provide suitable protection from any harm that may result from the terminated
development.

public hearing, the director shall pro-vide notice, in compliance with Section
16.76.020 (Notice of Public Hearing).

permit/entitlement may be extended may not exceed six years from the original
expiration date of the permit/entitlement unless otherwise allowed by law. Each
extension of time granted shall not exceed three years. For permits/
entitlements approved and which have not expired prior to the adoption of this
ordinance number 538-18, an additional extension may be granted provided the
extension does not cause the permit/entitlement to exceed nine years from the
original approval date of the permit/entitlement.
      5.   Circumstances Under Which Extension(s) May be Granted. An extension
of the approval of a permit/entitlement may be granted only if the director
finds that there have been no significant changes in the general plan, any
applicable specific plan, development code, municipal code, or character of the
area within which the subject property is located that would cause the approved
permit/entitlement to be injurious to the public convenience, health, safety,
or general welfare.

determines are similar to those de-scribed above.
   C.   Revised Permit. A revised permit is required when the change(s) does
not meet or exceeds the thresholds/criteria described above.
   D.   Procedure.
      1.   Substantial Conformance. The director shall approve, or deny an
application for a substantial conformance within forty-five (45) days after
accepting a completed application and give notice by mail of the decision,
including any additional conditions of approval, to the applicant and any other
person(s) who has filed a written required for notice. The director's
determination shall be based upon the standards of this section and those
standards identified in this development code for the approval of the original
permit. An application for substantial conformance shall not require a public
hearing.
      2.   Revised Permit. An application for a revised permit shall be
approved, conditionally approved, or disapproved in compliance with the
procedures for processing the original permit, including any requirements for
notice of hearing, public hearing, and all rights of appeal, in compliance with
Chapter 16.78 (Appeals). A revised permit shall be subject to the development
standards applicable to approval of the original permit.
   E.   Approval Period. The approval of an application for a substantial
conformance or a revised permit shall be valid until the expiration of the
original permit, unless an extension of time has been granted by the approved
revised permit.

same or substantially similar discretionary permit/entitlement for the same
parcel shall be filed for a period of one year, except as otherwise specified
at the time of disapproval.
         c.    The director shall determine whether the new application is for
a discretionary permit/entitlement which is the same or substantially similar
to the previously disapproved permit/entitlement.
      2.    Disapproved Without Prejudice. There shall be no limitation on
refilling a project disapproved without prejudice.
   B.   Modification of Condition(s). No request for modifications of a
condition of approval relating to any fee, exaction, or dedication of property
