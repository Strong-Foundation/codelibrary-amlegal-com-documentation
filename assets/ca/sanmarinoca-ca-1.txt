similar structural or zoning issues which are continuing in nature and that do
not create an immediate danger to health and safety, comply with the compliance
order to remedy the violation within the time specified on the citation. (Ord.

01.06.08: CIVIL FINES, LATE CHARGES; COLLECTION OF FEES AND COSTS:
   A.   Civil Fine Amount: The amount of each fine shall be set forth in a
resolution adopted by the City Council. If a violation is classified as an
infraction under this Code, the civil fine shall not exceed one hundred dollars
($100.00) for a first offense, two hundred dollars ($200.00) for a second

payments received after the due date shall be fifty percent (50%) of the civil
fine.
   C.   Interest: The city council may, by resolution, also establish and
impose a daily interest charge on civil fines that are not fully paid to the
city on the due date. Interest shall not be imposed on a late charge, and shall

decision by a hearing officer or judicial officer confirming the fine.
Thereafter, a late charge and interest shall be due and owing.
   F.   Effect Of Payment: Payment of a civil fine shall not excuse or

of this code, nor from any other responsibility or legal consequences for a
continuation or repeated occurrence(s) of a violation of this code.

obligation of the responsible person to pay a civil fine, or any late charges
or interest imposed on its untimely payment.

interest thereon, shall be a personal obligation and debt of the responsible

Court, the recordation of a lien with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office
against citee-owned property that was the subject of the citation, by means of

permit, or other entitlement to any citee who has failed to tender all unpaid
administrative fines, late penalty charges, or interest charges. The remedies

those set forth elsewhere in this code or by law.

11-2018; Ord. O-22-1389, 4-13-2022)
01.06.09: RECORDATION OF LIEN:
   A.   If the responsible person fails to satisfy in full the assessed civil
fines by the due date, as defined above in subsection
01.06.08E, the city may recover the outstanding fine by imposing a lien against
the real property on which the violation occurred.
   B.   Prior to the recording of the lien with the Los Angeles County
Recorder’s office, the city council shall conduct a hearing to hear any protest
or objection to the lien. The enforcement officer shall serve notice of the
hearing upon the owner of record of the real property, based on the last
equalized assessment roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is more current.
The notice of hearing shall include the time, date, and place of the hearing,
and shall be served upon the owner of record by regular mail at least ten (10)
days before the date of the hearing.
   C.   If the city council determines that the lien should be imposed, the
responsible person will have thirty (30) days to satisfy the assessed civil
fine in full. If after that time the assessed civil fine, late charge and
interest have not been paid in full, the enforcement officer shall then prepare
and file with the city clerk a report stating the amount due and owing.
   D.   After the report is filed with the city clerk, the citing official may
cause the lien to be recorded with the county recorder. Once recorded, the lien
shall have the force and effect and priority of a judgment lien governed by the
provisions of section 697.340 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or its successor,
and may be extended as provided in sections 683.110 to 683.220, inclusive, of
the Code of Civil Procedure, or their successors.
   E.   If the lien is satisfied, the city shall record a notice of
satisfaction of the lien with the Los Angeles County recorder’s office within
thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of payment in full. (Ord. 0-07-1189, 9-12-
2007; amd. Ord. O-22-1389; 4-13-2022)
01.06.10: ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING:
   A.   Any responsible person to whom a citation is issued may contest the
citation by: 1) completing a request for hearing form and returning it to the
city manager or his/her designee; and 2) either depositing the civil fine with
the city manager or his/her designee or providing notice that a request for an
advance deposit hardship waiver has been filed. A request for hearing form may
be obtained from the city clerk. The request for hearing form and the civil
fine or completed hardship waiver must be received within ten (10) days from
the date of service of the citation. If not, the responsible person waives the
right to a hearing.
   B.   Only after a request for hearing form is received within the required
period, and the responsible person requesting the hearing has either deposited
the civil fine in full or obtained an advance deposit hardship waiver
(hereinafter a “perfected appeal”), shall the city set the date and time for
the administrative hearing. The hearing shall be set for a date not less than
fifteen (15) days, nor more than ninety (90) days after a perfected appeal.
   C.   The city shall notify the responsible person requesting the hearing by
regular mail of the time and place of the hearing at least ten (10) days before
the date of the hearing. The city manager or his/her designee shall serve any
documentation, other than the citation, that the city manager or his/her
designee has submitted or will submit to the hearing officer on the person
requesting the hearing by regular mail at least three (3) calendar days before
the date of the hearing. Failure to receive such documentation shall not
invalidate the citation or any hearing, city action or proceeding conducted
pursuant to this article. The failure to appear at the hearing shall render the
citation final. (Ord. 0-08-1202, 3-19-2008; amd. Ord. O-22-1389; 4-13-2022)
01.06.11: ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING PROCEDURES:
   A.   The city manager shall designate or appoint a hearing officer who shall
be selected in a manner that avoids the potential for pecuniary or other bias
and in no event shall the enforcement officer, nor any other officer or
employee in his/her department, be the hearing officer. The compensation, if
any, of the hearing officer shall be paid by the city. Compensation shall not
be directly or indirectly conditioned upon whether or not citations are upheld
by the hearing officer.
   B.   Administrative hearings are informal and formal rules of evidence and
discovery do not apply. Each party shall have the opportunity to present
evidence in support of that party’s case and to cross examine any witnesses
present. The city bears the burden of proof to establish the violation. The
citation and any additional reports submitted by the enforcement officer shall
constitute prima facie evidence of the facts contained in those documents. The
hearing officer must use preponderance of the evidence as the standard of
review in deciding the issues. A responsible person may bring an interpreter to
the hearing provided there is no expense to the city therefor.
   C.   A responsible person may appear at the hearing in person or by written
declaration executed under penalty of perjury. Said declaration and any
documents in support thereof shall be served on the office of the city clerk at
least three (3) city business days prior to the hearing. If the responsible
person fails to attend the scheduled hearing, or does not submit a written
declaration in a timely manner, he or she shall be deemed to have waived the
right to a hearing. In such an instance, the hearing officer shall cancel the
hearing and not render a decision. In such instances, the citation shall be
deemed final.
   D.   Hearings may be continued once at the request of a responsible person
or the enforcement officer who issued the citation. The hearing officer may
also continue the hearing for cause. (Ord. 0-07-1189, 9-12-2007; amd. Ord. O-
22-1389; 4-13-2022)
01.06.12: HEARING OFFICER DECISION; RIGHT OF APPEAL:
   A.   The hearing officer shall issue a written decision no later than
fifteen (15) days after the date on which the hearing concludes. The decision
shall set forth the reasons for the decision along with notice of the right to
appeal pursuant to section
01.06.13 of this article. The administrative hearing officer’s decision shall
be final. If the citation is upheld and the violation has not been fully
corrected as of the date of the hearing, the hearing officer shall order
correction thereof in the decision and state the date in which to complete said
correction.
   B.   The decision shall be served by first class mail and shall be deemed to
be served on the date it is deposited with the United States postal service.
The failure of the responsible person to receive a properly addressed decision
shall not invalidate the citation, compliance order or the hearing officer’s
decision. (Ord. 0-07-1189, 9-12-2007; amd. Ord. O-22-1389; 4-13-2022)
01.06.13: APPEAL OF DECISION OF HEARING OFFICER:
Within twenty (20) days after service of the hearing officer’s decision upon
the responsible person, the responsible person may seek review of the hearing
officer’s decision by filing a notice of appeal with the Los Angeles Superior
Court. The responsible person shall serve a copy of the notice of appeal upon
the city clerk either in person or by first class mail within five (5) calendar
days of its filing. If the responsible person fails to timely file a notice of
appeal, the hearing officer’s decision shall be deemed confirmed. (Ord. 0-07-
1189, 9-12-2007; amd. Ord. O-22-1389; 4-13-2022)
01.06.14: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH HEARING OFFICER'S DECISION:
Failure to comply with the hearing officer’s decision after it becomes final is
a misdemeanor. Filing a criminal misdemeanor action does not preclude the city
from using any other legal remedy available to gain compliance with the
decision. (Ord. 0-07-1189, 9-12-2007; amd. Ord. O-22-1389; 4-13-2022)
01.06.15: ADVANCE HARDSHIP WAIVER DEPOSIT:
   A.   Any responsible person who requests a hearing to contest a citation and
who is financially unable to deposit the civil fine required, may file a
request for an advance deposit hardship waiver. The request shall be filed with
the city manager on an advance deposit hardship waiver application form,
available from the city clerk, no later than ten (10) days after service of the
citation. The city manager’s office’s failure to receive a completed form, with
all supporting documents, within ten (10) days after service of the citation,
shall constitute a waiver of the right to receive a hardship waiver.
   B.   The city manager or designee may issue an advance deposit hardship
waiver only if the responsible person requesting the waiver submits a sworn
affidavit, together with any supporting documents, demonstrating to the
satisfaction of the city manager or designee the person’s financial inability
to deposit with the city the full amount of the civil fine in advance of the
hearing. The city manager or designee shall issue a written decision specifying
the reasons for issuing or not issuing the waiver. The decision shall be served
upon the responsible person requesting the waiver by regular mail. If the city
manager or designee determines that the waiver is not warranted the responsible
person shall remit the full amount of the civil fine to the city within ten
(10) days of receipt of the written decision. The city manager or designee’s
decision whether to issue a hardship waiver shall be final. (Ord. 0-08-1202, 3-

08.03.06: HEARING TO ESTABLISH COSTS:
If the City shall have the nuisance abated, a hearing shall be held within 40

advise the owner that the owner has the right to appear and be heard on the
issue of the cost to the City of the abatement. The code enforcement officer
shall cause the written notice to be served by personal service or by

at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing date.
At the hearing, the City Council shall hear and consider testimony and all

relating to the cost of the abatement. At the conclusion of the hearing, the

establish the cost to the City of the nuisance abatement.
No later than five (5) days following the hearing before the City Council, the
code enforcement officer shall send the owner of the property, by first class

   A.   The City may cause a special assessment to be made upon real property
upon which a public nuisance was abated pursuant to Government Code Section
38773.5, and future amendments thereto, in the event a statement of abatement
costs or a confirmed statement of abatement costs is not paid in a timely
manner.
   B.   A notice of special assessment shall be sent to the owner(s) of the
subject real property by certified mail at the time the assessment is imposed
which shall contain the following recitals:
The property may be sold after three years by the tax collector for unpaid
delinquent assessments. The tax collector’s power of sale shall not be affected
by the failure of the property owner to receive notice. The assessment may be
collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes
are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same
procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal
taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal
taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real
property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or
conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide
encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date
on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the
cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property but
instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.
   C.   The city attorney or city prosecutor shall establish the notice of
special assessment form for use, or consideration by, the tax collector in
collecting a special assessment.
   D.   The notice of special assessment shall be entitled to recordation with
the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office.
   E.   The amount of a special assessment shall also constitute a personal
obligation of the property owners of land upon which the nuisance was abated.
(Ord. O-22-1389, 4-13-2022)
08.03.08: COLLECTION OF COSTS OF ABATEMENT BY NUISANCE ABATEMENT LIEN:
   A.   As an alternative to a special assessment, the City may cause a
nuisance abatement lien to be recorded upon real property upon which a public
nuisance was abated pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.1, and future
amendments thereto, in the event a statement of abatement costs or a confirmed
statement of abatement costs is not paid in a timely manner.
   B.   A lien shall not be recorded prior to serving the owner of record of
the parcel of land on which the public nuisance is maintained with a notice.
This document shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action
in accordance with Article 3 (commencing with Section 415.10) of Chapter 4 of
Title 5 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If the owner of record, after
diligent search, cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy
thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of 10 days and
publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in Los
Angeles County pursuant to Section 6062 of the Government Code.
   C.   The nuisance abatement lien shall be recorded in the Los Angeles County
Recorder’s Office in the county in which the parcel of land is located and from
the date of recording shall have the force, effect, and priority of a judgment
lien.
   D.   A nuisance abatement lien authorized by this section shall specify the
amount of the lien for the City of San Marino, the name of the City department
or division on whose behalf the lien is imposed, the date of the abatement
actions, the street address, legal description and assessor’s parcel number of
the parcel on which the lien is imposed, and the name and address of the
recorded owner of the parcel.
   E.   In the event that the lien is discharged, released, or satisfied,
either through payment or foreclosure, notice of the discharge containing the
information specified in subsection (D) of this section shall be recorded by
the City. A nuisance abatement lien and the release of the lien shall be
indexed in the grantor-grantee index.
   F.   A nuisance abatement lien may be foreclosed by an action brought by the
City for a money judgment.
   G.   The City may recover from the property owner any costs incurred
regarding the processing and recording of the lien and providing notice to the
property owner as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien.
   H.   The amount of a nuisance abatement lien shall also constitute a
personal obligation of the property owners of land upon which the nuisance was
abated. (Ord. O-22-1389, 4-13-2022)
08.03.09: RECOVERY OF COSTS:
   A.   The City may collect the cost of abatement of any nuisance and related
administrative costs, including but not limited to inspection costs,
investigation costs, attorneys’ fees and costs, and costs to repair and
eliminate all substandard conditions by either: (i) obtaining a court order
stating that this reimbursement requirement is a personal obligation of any
person held responsible for creating, causing, committing or maintaining a
public nuisance, recoverable by the City in the same manner as any civil
judgment; (ii) recording a nuisance abatement lien pursuant to this Code
against the parcel of land on which the nuisance is maintained; or (iii)
imposing a special assessment pursuant to this Code against the parcel of land
on which the nuisance is maintained.
   B.   Any responsible person (as defined in Section
01.06.02) shall have the right to fully abate a nuisance in accordance with the
hearing officer’s decision prior to the date of entry of city personnel upon
the subject real property, provided that all corrective actions are completed
with all required city permits, approvals and inspections, prior to said entry
date. In such instances, all administrative proceedings shall be cancelled,
with the exception of the city’s right to seek recovery of its incurred
incidental expenses, code enforcement fees, and attorney’s fees as provided by
and pursuant to the provisions of this article. (Ord. 0-21-1379, 3-10-21; amd.

   A.   Notwithstanding any provision of the San Marino Municipal Code to the
contrary, the city manager, police chief, fire chief, director of code
enforcement, health official, or building official, or any of their designees,
may cause a public nuisance to be summarily abated if it is determined that the
nuisance creates an imminent hazard to a person or persons, or to other real or
personal property.
   B.   Prior to abating a nuisance that creates an imminent hazard, the City
Manager shall attempt to notify a responsible person (as defined in Section
01.06.02) by telephone or in writing of the imminent hazard and request its
abatement by said person; provided, however, that the City Manager may dispense
with any attempt at prior notification of a responsible person if, in the sole
discretion of the City Manager, the nature or severity of the hazard does not
reasonably allow for such prior notification. If notice has been so given, but,
in the sole discretion of the City Manager, the responsible person(s) fail(s)
to take immediate and meaningful steps to abate the imminent hazard, the City
may abate the nuisance with City personnel without further notice, and charge
the costs and fees thereof to the responsible person(s).
   C.   Within 10 business days following emergency action of City personnel to
abate an imminent hazard, the City shall serve any responsible person with a
notice of emergency abatement by City personnel of an imminent hazard by first
class mail. Notice to a property owner shall be mailed to the mailing address
set forth in the last equalized assessment roll of the Los Angeles County
Assessor’s Office. Failure of any responsible person to receive a properly
addressed notice of emergency abatement by City personnel of an imminent hazard
by mail shall not invalidate any action or proceeding pursuant to this chapter.
   D.   A notice of emergency abatement by City personnel of an imminent hazard
shall contain the following provisions:
      1.   The name of all known responsible persons who are being served with
the notice of emergency abatement by City personnel of an imminent hazard and
the address of the real property on which the imminent hazard was present.
      2.   A brief description of the condition(s) and reasons why it
constituted an imminent hazard.
      3.   A brief description of the law prohibiting or pertaining to the
imminent hazard.
      4.   A brief description of the actions City personnel took to abate the
imminent hazard.
   E.   Omission of any of the foregoing provisions in a notice of emergency
abatement by City personnel of an imminent hazard, whether in whole or in part,
or the failure of a responsible person to receive said notice, or the failure
of the City to issue said notice in a timely fashion, shall not render it
defective or render any proceeding or action pursuant to this chapter invalid.
   F.   The City shall be entitled to recover its fees and costs (incidental or
otherwise) for the abatement of an imminent hazard. In such instances, the City
shall follow the procedures set forth in this article. (Ord. O-22-1389, 4-13-

   A.   State recycling law, Assembly Bill 939 of 1989, the California
Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (California Public Resources Code
Section 40000, et seq., as amended, supplemented, superseded, and replaced from
time to time), requires cities and counties to reduce, reuse, and recycle
(including composting) solid waste generated in their cities to the maximum
extent feasible before any incineration or landfill disposal of waste, to
conserve water, energy, and other natural resources, and to protect the
environment.
   B.   State recycling law, Assembly Bill 341 of 2011 (approved by the
Governor of the State of California on October 5, 2011, which amended Sections

Sections 40004, 41734.5, and 41780.01 and Chapter 12.8 (commencing with Section
42649) to Part 3 of Division 30 of, and added and repealed Section 41780.02 of,
the Public Resources Code, as amended, supplemented, superseded and replaced
from time to time), places requirements on businesses and multi-family property
owners that generate a specified threshold amount of solid waste to arrange for
recycling services and requires cities to implement a mandatory commercial
recycling program.

14.12.01: FINDINGS:
   A.   The congress of the United States (hereinafter "congress") has
determined that pollutants contained in stormwater and urban runoff are
responsible for the environmental degradation of oceans, lakes, rivers, and
other waters of the United States.
   B.   Congress, in 1987, amended the clean water act of 1972 to reduce
pollutants discharged into the waters of the United States by extending
national pollutant discharge elimination system (hereinafter "NPDES")
requirements to regulate stormwater and urban runoff discharge into municipal
storm drain systems.
   C.   Stormwater and urban runoff flows from individual properties onto
streets, then through storm drains to coastal waters along the city of San
Marino.
   D.   The city of San Marino is a co-permittee under the municipal NPDES
permit issued by the California regional water quality control board, Los
Angeles region, which also serves as a NPDES permit under the federal clean
water act and as a co-permittee, the city is required to implement procedures
with respect to the entry of nonstormwater discharges into the municipal
stormwater system.
   E.   In order to control, in a cost effective manner, the quantity and
quality of stormwater and urban runoff to the maximum extent practicable, the
adoption of reasonable regulations, as set forth herein, is essential. (Ord. 0-
15-1290, 5-29-2015)
14.12.02: PURPOSE:
   A.   The purpose of this article is to ensure the future health, safety and
general welfare of the citizens of the city and the water quality of the county
of Los Angeles and surrounding coastal areas by:
      1.   Reducing pollutants in stormwater discharges to the maximum extent
practicable;
      2.   Regulating illicit connections and illicit discharges and thereby
reducing the level of contamination of stormwater and urban runoff into the
municipal stormwater system; and
      3.   Regulating nonstormwater discharges to the municipal stormwater
system.
   B.   This article also sets forth requirements for the construction and
operation of certain commercial development, new development and redevelopment
and other projects (as further defined herein) which are intended to ensure
compliance with the stormwater mitigation measures prescribed in the current
version of the municipal NPDES permit approved by the regional water quality
control board, Los Angeles region, and on file in the office of the city clerk.
   C.   This article authorizes the authorized enforcement officer to define
and adopt applicable best management practices and other stormwater pollution
control measures and to cite infractions and to impose fines pursuant to this
article. Except as otherwise provided herein, the authorized enforcement
officer shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this section.
   D.   The intent of this article is to protect and enhance the quality of
watercourses, water bodies, and wetlands within the city in a manner consistent
with the federal clean water act and the NPDES permit.
   E.   This article is also intended to provide the city with the legal
authority necessary to control discharges to and from those portions of the
municipal stormwater system over which it has jurisdiction as required by the
municipal NPDES permit. (Ord. 0-15-1290, 5-29-2015)
14.12.03: DEFINITIONS:
Except as specifically provided herein, any term used in this article shall be
defined as that term is defined in the current municipal NPDES permit, or if it
is not specifically defined in the municipal NPDES permit, then as such term is
defined in the federal clean water act, as amended, and/or the regulations
promulgated hereunder. If the definition of any term contained in the current
municipal NPDES permit conflicts with the definition contained in this article,
then the definition contained in the municipal NPDES permit shall govern. The
following words and phrases shall have the following meanings when used in this
article:
AREA SUSCEPTIBLE TO RUNOFF: Any surface directly exposed to precipitation or in
the path of runoff caused by precipitation which path leads off the parcel on
which the surface is located.
AUTHORIZED ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: The director of public works or his or her
designee.
AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE FACILITY: A facility that is categorized in any one of the
following standard industrial classification (SIC) and North American industry
classification system (NAICS) codes. For inspection purposes, permittees need
not inspect facilities with SIC codes 5013, 5014, 5541, 5511 provided that
these facilities have no outside activities or materials that may be exposed to
stormwater.
BASIN PLAN: The water quality control plan, Los Angeles region, basin plan for
the coastal watersheds of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, adopted by the
regional water board on June 13, 1994, and subsequent amendments.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs): Practices or physical devices or systems
designed to prevent or reduce pollutant loading from stormwater or
nonstormwater discharges to receiving waters, or designed to reduce the volume
of stormwater or nonstormwater discharged to the receiving water. Examples of
BMPs may include, but are not limited to, public education and outreach, proper
planning of development projects, proper cleaning of catch basin inlets, and
proper sludge or waste handling and disposal, among others.
BIOFILTRATION: A LID BMP that reduces stormwater pollutant discharges by
intercepting rainfall on vegetative canopy, and through incidental infiltration
and/or evapotranspiration, and filtration. Incidental infiltration is an
important factor in achieving the required pollutant load reduction. Therefore,
the term "biofiltration" as used in this article is defined to include only
systems designed to facilitate incidental infiltration or achieve the
equivalent pollutant reduction as biofiltration BMPs with an underdrain
(subject to approval by the regional board's executive officer). Biofiltration
BMPs include bioretention systems with an underdrain and bioswales.
BIORETENTION: A LID BMP that reduces stormwater runoff by intercepting rainfall
on vegetative canopy, and through evapotranspiration and infiltration. The
bioretention system typically includes a minimum two foot (2') top layer of a
specified soil and compost mixture underlain by a gravel filled temporary

         c.   Where redevelopment results in an alteration of less than fifty
percent (50%) of impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and
the existing development was not subject to postconstruction stormwater quality
control requirements, only the alteration must be mitigated, and not the entire
development.
         d.   Redevelopment does not include routine maintenance activities
that are conducted to maintain original line and grade, hydraulic capacity,
original purpose of facility or emergency redevelopment activity required to
protect public health and safety. Impervious surface replacement, such as the
reconstruction of parking lots and roadways which does not disturb additional
area and maintains the original grade and alignment, is considered a routine
maintenance activity. Redevelopment does not include the repaving of existing
roads to maintain original line and grade.
         e.   Existing single-family dwelling and accessory structures are
exempt from the redevelopment requirements unless such projects create, add, or
replace ten thousand (10,000) square feet of impervious surface area.
   D.   LID Standards Manual: The director shall prepare, maintain, and update,
as deemed necessary and appropriate, a manual ("LID Standards Manual"), which
shall include urban and stormwater runoff quantity and quality control
development principles and technologies for achieving compliance with the
provisions of this section. The "LID Standards Manual" shall also include
technical feasibility and implementation parameters, as well as other rules,
requirements, and procedures as the director deems necessary, for implementing
the provisions of this article.
   E.   Specific Requirements:
      1.   New Single-Family Hillside Homes: To the extent that the city may
lawfully impose conditions, mitigation measures or other requirements on the
construction of new single-family hillside homes, new single-family hillside
homes are exempt from the new development/redevelopment project performance
criteria of part VI.D.7.c of the MS4 permit but shall include mitigation
measures to:
         a.   Conserve natural areas;
         b.   Protect slopes and channels;
         c.   Provide storm drain system stenciling and signage;
         d.   Divert roof runoff to vegetated areas before discharge unless the
diversion would result in slope instability; and
         e.   Direct surface flow to vegetated areas before discharge, unless
the diversion would result in slope instability.
      2.   Street And Road Construction: Street and road construction of ten
thousand (10,000) square feet or more of impervious surface are exempt from the
new development/redevelopment project performance criteria of part VI.D.7.c of
the MS4 permit but shall follow the city's "Green Streets Manual" to the
maximum extent practicable, consistent with the city's green streets policy.
      3.   New Development And Redevelopment Projects: Unless otherwise
exempted in this article or in the MS4 permit, the site for every new
development and redevelopment project shall comply with part VI.D.7.c of the
MS4 permit and be designed to control pollutants, pollutant loads, and runoff
volume to the maximum extent feasible by minimizing impervious surface area and
controlling runoff from impervious surfaces through infiltration,
evapotranspiration, bioretention and/or rainfall harvest and use in accordance
with the requirements set forth in the MS4 permit and the "LID Standards
Manual". The project applicant shall prepare and submit a stormwater mitigation
plan, which shall implement set LID standards and practices for stormwater
pollution mitigation consistent with this article and the "LID Standards
Manual", to the director for review and approval. The stormwater mitigation
plan shall provide documentation to demonstrate compliance with the MS4 permit
on the plans and permit application submitted to the city, and shall comply
with the following:
         a.   Retain stormwater runoff on site for the stormwater quality
design volume (SWQDv) defined as the runoff from:
            (1)   The 85th percentile 24-hour runoff event as determined from
the Los Angeles County 85th percentile precipitation isohyetal map; or
            (2)   The volume of runoff produced from a 0.75 inch, 24-hour rain
event, whichever is greater.
         b.   Minimize hydromodification impacts to natural drainage systems as
defined in the NPDES permit.
   F.   Technical Infeasibility:
      1.   Some relief, as outlined later in this section, from the MS4 permit
(part VI.D.7.c) requirements may be granted for technical infeasibility. To
demonstrate technical infeasibility, the project applicant must demonstrate
that the project cannot reliably retain one hundred percent (100%) of the SWQDv
on site, even with the maximum application of green roofs and rainwater harvest
and use, and that compliance with the applicable postconstruction requirements
would be technically infeasible by submitting a site specific hydrologic and/or
design analysis conducted and endorsed by a registered professional engineer,
geologist, architect, and/or landscape architect. Technical infeasibility may
result from conditions including the following:
         a.   The infiltration rate of saturated in-situ soils is less than 0.3
inch per hour and it is not technically feasible to amend the in-situ soils to
attain an infiltration rate necessary to achieve reliable performance of
infiltration or bioretention BMPs in retaining the SWQDv on site.
         b.   Locations where seasonal high groundwater is within five (5) to
ten feet (10') of surface grade;
         c.   Locations within one hundred feet (100') of a groundwater well
used for drinking water;
         d.   Brownfield development sites or other locations where pollutant
mobilization is a documented concern;
         e.   Locations with potential geotechnical hazards;
         f.   Smart growth and infill or redevelopment locations where the
density and/or nature of the project would create significant difficulty for
compliance with the on site volume retention requirement.
      2.   If partial or complete on site retention is technically infeasible,
the project site may biofiltrate 1.5 times the portion of the remaining SWQDv
that is not reliably retained on site. Biofiltration BMPs must adhere to the
design specifications provided in the MS4 permit (order no. R4-2012-0175).
         a.   Additional alternative compliance options such as off site
infiltration and groundwater replenishment projects may be available to the
project site. The applicant for the project should contact the authorized
enforcement officer to determine eligibility.
      3.   The remaining SWQDv that cannot be retained or biofiltered on site
must be treated on site to reduce pollutant loading. BMPs must be selected and
designed to meet pollutant specific benchmarks as required by the MS4 permit.
Flow through BMPs may be used to treat the remaining SWQDv and must be sized
based on a rainfall intensity of:
         a.   0.2 inches per hour, or
         b.   The 1-year, 1-hour rainfall intensity as determined from the most
recent Los Angeles County isohyetal map, whichever is greater.
   G.   Exemptions From LID Requirements: The provisions of this section do not
apply to any of the following:
      1.   A development involving only emergency construction activity
required to immediately protect public health and safety;
      2.   Infrastructure projects within the public right of way, excluding
street and road construction of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more of
impervious surface;
      3.   A development or redevelopment involving only activity related to
gas, water, cable, or electricity services on private property;
      4.   A development or redevelopment involving only resurfacing and/or
restriping of permitted parking lots, where the original line and grade,
hydraulic capacity, and original purpose of the facility is maintained;
      5.   A project not requiring a city building, grading, demolition or
other permit for construction activity.
   H.   City Review And Approval:
      1.   Prior to the issuance of a permit for a new development or
redevelopment project, the city shall evaluate the proposed project using the
MS4 permit, and erosion and grading requirements of the city building official
or authorized enforcement officer to determine: a) its potential to generate
the flow of pollutants into the MS4 after construction; and b) how well the
stormwater mitigation plan for the proposed project meets the goals of this
article. Each plan will be evaluated on its own merits according to the
particular characteristics of the project and the site to be developed. Based
upon the review, the city may impose conditions upon the issuance of the
building permit, in addition to any required by the state construction general
permit for the project, in order to minimize the flow of pollutants into the
MS4.
   I.   Issuance Of Discretionary Permits: No discretionary permit may be
issued for any new development or redevelopment project identified in this
section until the authorized enforcement officer confirms that the project
plans, including the stormwater mitigation plan, comply with the applicable LID
requirements. Where redevelopment results in an alteration to more than fifty
percent (50%) of impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and
the existing development was not subject to postdevelopment stormwater quality
control requirements, the entire project must be mitigated. Where redevelopment
results in an alteration to less than fifty percent (50%) of impervious
surfaces of a previously existing development, and the existing development was
not subject to postdevelopment stormwater quality control requirements, only
the alteration must be mitigated, and not the entire development.
   J.   Issuance Of Certificates Of Occupancy: As a condition for issuing a
certificate of occupancy for a project subject to this article, the director
shall require facility operators or owners to build all BMPs that are shown on
the approved project plans and to submit an owner signed certification
statement stating that the site and all LID BMPs will be maintained in
compliance with the stormwater mitigation plan and other applicable regulatory
requirements.
   K.   Transfer Of Properties Subject To Requirement For Maintenance Of BMPs:
      1.   The transfer or lease of a property subject to a requirement for
maintenance of BMPs shall include conditions requiring the transferee and its
successors and assigns to either: a) assume responsibility for maintenance of
any existing BMP, or b) to replace an existing BMP with new control measures or
BMPs meeting the then current standards of the city and the municipal NPDES
permit. Such requirement shall be included in any sale or lease agreement or
deed for such property. The condition of transfer shall include a provision
that the successor property owner or lessee conduct maintenance inspections of
all BMPs at least once a year and retain proof of inspection.
      2.   For residential properties where the LID BMPs are located within a
common area which will be maintained by a homeowners' association, language
regarding the responsibility for maintenance shall be included in the project's
conditions, covenants and restrictions (CC&Rs). Printed educational materials
will be required to accompany the first deed transfer to highlight the
existence of the requirement and to provide information on what stormwater
management facilities are present, signs that maintenance is needed, and how
the necessary maintenance can be performed. The transfer of this information
shall also be required with any subsequent sale of the property.
      3.   If LID BMPs are located within an area proposed for dedication to a
public agency, they will be the responsibility of the developer until the
dedication is accepted. (Ord. 0-15-1290, 5-29-2015)
14.12.09: FEES:
Fees for plan reviews, inspections, violations, corrections, and tasks

         c.   The associated cross traffic visibility is less than 5.5 seconds
at prevailing speeds; or
         d.   Yield sign control has been shown to be inadequate.
      3.   All Way Stop Sign Control:
         a.   Minimum Volume: This warrant is used to identify locations with
partial stop sign control where the volume of traffic entering the intersection
is so high that there is likely to be an insufficient number of acceptable gaps
to accommodate stop sign controlled cross traffic. This warrant is satisfied
when the total vehicular volume entering the intersection from all approaches
averages at least five hundred (500) vehicles per hour during any six (6) hours
of an average day, and the combined vehicular and pedestrian volumes entering
the intersection from the minor street average at least two hundred (200) units
per hour during the same six (6) hours. When the eighty fifth percentile
approach speed of the major traffic exceeds forty (40) miles per hour, the
minimum vehicular volume warrant is seventy percent (70%) of these
requirements.
         b.   Accident Experience: This warrant is used to identify locations
with partial stop sign control where an accident pattern has developed that is
susceptible to correction. This warrant is satisfied if either of the following
conditions is met:
            (1)   The intersection has experienced three (3) or more reported
accidents in the most recent twelve (12) month period; or
            (2)   The intersection has experienced two (2) reported accidents
per year during any two (2) years of the most recent four (4) year period.
The accidents shall be of a type susceptible to correction with all way stop
sign control and where an adequate trial with partial stop sign control has
proven to be unsatisfactory.
      4.   Interim Installation: This warrant is used to provide all way stop
sign control on an interim basis when traffic signal control is warranted and
arrangements are underway for the signal installation. This warrant is
satisfied on two (2) lane local or collector streets, or on low volume arterial
streets when the need for traffic signal control is urgent.
      5.   Restricted Visibility: This warrant is used to provide additional
right of way assignment at intersections with restricted visibility. This
warrant is satisfied where cross traffic visibility on stop sign controlled
approaches at the intersection of local and/or collector streets is less than
one hundred forty feet (140').
      6.   Midblock Crosswalk: This warrant is used to provide positive right
of way assignment for pedestrians crossing at a midblock crosswalk. This
warrant is satisfied where a marked crosswalk has been established at a
midblock location on a local or collector street without signal control or
warning beacons.
      7.   Special Facilities: This warrant is used to provide additional right
of way assignment at intersections near institutions primarily serving the
youth, elderly and disabled. This warrant is satisfied at the intersection of
local and/or collector streets without signal control or warning beacons less
than one block from:
         a.   A public or private elementary or middle school.
         b.   A public library.
         c.   A recreation center or playground used by children under twelve
(12) years of age.
         d.   A senior citizen center.
         e.   A medical center or clinic.
         f.   A center serving the visually, mentally, or physically impaired.
      8.   Excessive Speeds: This warrant is used to discourage excessive
speeds on residentially developed local and collector streets where speed humps
or tables are not feasible or desirable. This warrant is satisfied where the
eighty fifth percentile speed on the street to be controlled exceeds the speed
threshold shown in the table below and the distance between current stop signs
and/or traffic signals on the street to be controlled exceeds the distance
threshold show in the table below. Application of this warrant generally
results in all way stop sign control, but can result in partial stop sign
control, if the controlled approaches are reversed.
 
Street    Speed Threshold Distance Threshold
Local     30 mph          1,000 feet
Collector 35 mph          2,000 feet
 
      9.   Excessive Through Traffic On Local Streets: This warrant is used to
discourage excessive through traffic on residentially developed local streets.
Application of this warrant can result in partial stop sign control if the
controlled approaches are reversed. This warrant is satisfied where both
conditions below apply:
         a.   The volume on the street to be controlled exceeds one thousand
(1,000) vehicles per day and is at least twenty five percent (25%) greater than
that on similar adjacent parallel streets; and
         b.   The distance between current stop signs exceeds one thousand feet
(1,000').
      10.   Excessive Through Traffic On Collector Streets: This warrant is
used to discourage excessive through traffic on residentially developed
collector streets. Collector streets are identified in community plans. This
warrant is satisfied where the daily volume on the collector street exceeds the
volume of trips estimated to be generated by the dwelling units served by the
collector street in the absence of specific data, the threshold volume is
considered to be the product of fifteen (15) multiplied by the number of
dwelling units generally within one-eighth (1/8) mile parallel to the collector
street and between arterial street and/or collector street crossings. (Ord. 0-

16.08.01: PEOPLES' RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN EXPRESSIVE ACTIVITIES:
   A.   People may gather on sidewalks and the Huntington Drive medians for the
purpose of expression, dissemination, or communication of opinion, views, or
ideas by any means, including, but not limited to, public oratory and
expressive activities protected by the first amendment to the United States
constitution ("expressive activities"), on any day and at any time in
accordance with this article and without a permit and without being subject to
any city fees or charges.
      1.   The medians on Huntington Drive provide the best location for
persons to gather for expressive activities. The city of San Marino is a
primarily residential community. It has limited parks and public areas and
those areas do not have sufficient parking to provide for significant
gatherings. Huntington Drive is a large street with three (3) lanes of traffic
in each direction, curbside parking and a median with grass and trees,
approximately sixty feet (60') wide and approximately 2.9 miles from the east
to the west boundaries of the city (the "Huntington Drive median" or
"Huntington Drive medians"). The medians on Huntington Drive provide a parklike
setting with visibility and access from Huntington Drive. Parking is available
on Huntington Drive.
      2.   Persons shall not use those portions of the Huntington Drive median
areas that are within one hundred feet (100') from the curb of signalized
intersections on Huntington Drive while gathering on the medians. Such areas
near signalized intersections must remain clear of pedestrians in order to
reduce traffic hazards for the pedestrians and traffic on Huntington Drive.
Additionally, such areas contain left turn lanes and width of the median is
greatly reduced in these areas.
      3.   The Huntington Drive medians are not the only public areas within
the city available for expressive activities but they do provide adequate space
and parking for such activities and can accommodate expressive activity without
the need for a public events permit.
      4.   People gathering on the Huntington Drive medians and sidewalks for
expressive activities shall comply with all applicable laws and ordinances and
traffic and pedestrian laws and ordinances, including, without limitation, the
targeted residential picketing ordinance in chapter XIV, article 17 of this
code.
      5.   Persons gathering on sidewalks for any purposes shall not sit,
stand, or act in such a way as to obstruct the ability of persons to use the
sidewalk for passage and shall not sit, stand or act in such a way as to
prevent full compliance with all access requirements under the Americans with
disabilities act or its regulations and similar state and local legislation.
   B.   Expressive activities on a street or public place not described in
subsection A of this section, shall require a public events permit under this
article. Such events could create safety hazards for participants and disrupt
traffic and activities in the areas surrounding the event. The public events
permit process under this article will enable the city manager and the event
organizer to mitigate these potential concerns in the manner specified in this
article.
   C.   This article shall not amend or otherwise modify section 23.02.31 of
this code relating to special events on private property. (Ord. 0-12-1267, 10-

to be done, and the persons executing the bond shall be firmly bound for the
payment of all necessary costs therefor; or
   B.   Enters into a contract with the Council to complete such improvements
within a specified reasonable time after the approval and recordation of the

required to be done by the subdivider shall further provide and be conditioned
that the surety executing such bond, or such deposit, respectively, shall
continue to be firmly bound under a continuing obligation for the payment of
all necessary costs and expenses that may be incurred or expended by the City
in causing any and all such required work to be done, and that such surety or

showing the existence of the easement shall be placed on the title sheet of the
final map. All easements shall be delineated on the final map by fine dotted
lines. Distances and bearings on the side lines of lots which are crossed by
easements shall be so arrowed or shown as to indicate clearly the actual length

22.03.14: SOILS INVESTIGATION:
   A.   Purpose: The City Council declares that this Section is enacted
pursuant to the requirements of section 66490 et seq., of the California
Government Code.
   B.   Preliminary Soil Report: Prior to the submission of the final
subdivision map, the subdivider shall file with the Planning and Building
Department a preliminary soil report, prepared by a civil engineer who is
registered by the State, based upon adequate test borings or excavations of
every subdivision, as defined in sections 66411 et seq., of the California
Government Code. The preliminary soil report may be waived if the Planning and
Building Department shall determine that, due to the knowledge of such
Department as to the soil qualities of the subdivision, no preliminary analysis
is necessary.
   C.   Soil Investigation: If the preliminary soil report indicates the
presence of critically expansive soils or other soil problems which, if not
corrected, would lead to structural defects, a soil investigation of each lot
in the subdivision shall be prepared by a civil engineer who is registered by
the State. The soil investigation shall recommend corrective action which is
likely to prevent structural damage to each dwelling proposed to be constructed
on the expansive soil. The report shall be filed with the Planning and Building
Department.
   D.   Approval of Soil Investigation: The Planning and Building Department
shall approve the soil investigation if it determines that the recommended
corrective action is likely to prevent structural damage to each dwelling to be
constructed on each lot in the subdivision. Appeal from such determination
shall be to the City Council. The building permit shall be conditioned upon the
incorporation of the approved recommended corrective action in the construction
of each dwelling. (1954 Code §20.28-1; 1994 Code)
22.03.15: CERTIFICATION BY ENGINEER; COUNCIL DECISION:
   A.   Certification: The City Engineer shall check the final map to determine
if the same conforms in all respects to the provisions of the Subdivision Map
Act 1 and of this Chapter. He shall, thereupon, either certify to its
correctness and transmit it to the City Council, together with such other
information as is necessary, or he shall return the map to the subdivider,
together with a statement setting forth the corrections required. (1954 Code
§20.20)
   B.   Approval or Disapproval by Council; Dispositions: The City Council
shall, at its next regular meeting after receipt of the final map from the City
Engineer as provided by subsection A above, approve or disapprove the final
map. If the Council approves the final map, it shall return the map to the City
Engineer, who shall immediately transmit the same to the Clerk of the Board of
Supervisors of the County for recordation. If the Council disapproves the final
map, it shall be returned to the City Engineer with a statement of the grounds
for its disapproval, and the City Engineer shall, thereupon, return the same to
the subdivider. (1954 Code §20.30)

following street lines, alley lines or lot lines, such lines shall be construed
to be such boundaries.

additional procedure. Where uncertainty exists as to the zoning classification
to be indicated on the map, or any other provision of this chapter, such zoning
shall be determined by the commission by written decision. (Ord. 096-1093, 7-
10-1996)
23.01.10: REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION:
   A.   Purpose: In accordance with federal and state fair housing laws, it is
the purpose of this section to allow for reasonable accommodations in the
city's zoning and land use regulations, policies, and practices when reasonably
necessary to provide an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to
use and enjoy a dwelling.
   B.   Permit Application:
      1.   Applicant: Any person with a disability, his or her representative,
or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with a disability may
request for reasonable accommodation. The Community Development Director shall
approve a reasonable accommodation only for the benefit of one or more
individuals with a disability.
      2.   Application: An application for a reasonable accommodation from a
zoning regulation, policy, or practice shall be made on a form specified by the
planning and building director. No fee shall be required for a request for
reasonable accommodation, but the prescribed fees shall be paid for all
necessary discretionary permits.
      3.   Other Discretionary Permits: If the project for which the request
for reasonable accommodation is made requires a discretionary permit or
approval, then the applicant may file the request for reasonable accommodation
together with the application for the discretionary permit or approval. The
processing procedures of the discretionary permit shall govern the processing
of the discretionary permit.
      4.   Required Submittals: In addition to materials required under other
applicable provisions of this code, an application for reasonable accommodation
shall include the following:
         a.   Documentation that the applicant is:
            (1)   An individual with a disability;
            (2)   Applying on behalf of one or more individuals with a
disability; or
            (3)   A developer or provider of housing for one or more
individuals with a disability;
         b.   The specific exception from or modification to the zoning code
provision, policy, or practices the applicant is requesting;
         c.   Documentation that the specific exception or modification the
applicant is requesting is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a
disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the residence; and
         d.   Any other information that the director reasonably concludes is
necessary to determine whether the findings required by this section to approve
a reasonable accommodation can be made, so long as any request for information
regarding the disability of the individuals benefited complies with fair
housing law protections and the privacy rights of the affected individuals.
   C.   Review Procedure: The Community Development Director shall review the
reasonable accommodation application and make a written decision within forty-
five (45) days to either approve, conditionally approve, or deny the request
for reasonable accommodation in compliance with subsection D required findings
below.
   D.   Required Findings: The decision to approve, conditionally approve, or
deny a request for a reasonable accommodation shall be made in writing and
shall be based on the following findings, all of which are required for
approval:
      1.   The requested accommodation is requested by or on the behalf of one
or more individuals with a disability protected under the fair housing laws.
      2.   The requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more
individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
      3.   The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or
administrative burden on the city as "undue financial or administrative burden"
is defined in fair housing laws and interpretive case law.
      4.   The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental
alteration in the nature of the city's zoning program, as "fundamental
alteration" is defined in fair housing laws and interpretive case law.
      5.   The requested accommodation will not, under the specific facts of
the case, result in a direct threat to the health or safety of other
individuals or substantial physical damage to the property of others.
   E.   Alternative Reasonable Accommodations: In making these findings, the
Community Development Director may approve alternative reasonable
accommodations that provide an equivalent level of benefit to the applicant.
   F.   Consideration Factors - Necessity: The Community Development Director
may consider, but is not limited to considering, the following factors in
determining whether the requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or
more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a
dwelling:
      1.   Whether the requested accommodation will affirmatively enhance the
quality of life of one or more individuals with a disability;
      2.   Whether the individual or individuals with a disability will be
denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the housing type of their choice absent
the accommodation;
      3.   In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested
accommodation is necessary to make facilities of a similar nature or operation
economically viable in light of the particularities of the relevant market and
market participants; and
      4.   In the case of a residential care facility, whether the existing
supply of facilities of a similar nature and operation in the community is
sufficient to provide individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to
live in a residential setting.
   G.   Consideration Factors - Fundamental Alteration To Zoning Program: The
Community Development Director may consider, but is not limited to considering,
the following factors in determining whether the requested accommodation would
require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the city's zoning program:
      1.   Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the
character of the neighborhood;
      2.   Whether the requested accommodation would result in a substantial
increase in traffic or insufficient parking;
      3.   Whether the requested accommodation would substantially undermine
any express purpose of either the city's general plan or an applicable specific
plan; and
      4.   In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested
accommodation would create an institutionalized environment due to the number
of and distance between facilities that are similar in nature or operation.
   H.   Rules While Decision Is Pending: While a request for reasonable
accommodation is pending, all laws and regulations otherwise applicable to the
property that is the subject of the request shall remain in full force and
effect.
   I.   Effective Date: No reasonable accommodation shall become effective
until the decision to grant such accommodation shall have become final by
reason of the expiration of time to make an appeal. In the event an appeal is
filed, the reasonable accommodation shall not become effective unless and until
a decision is made by the Planning Commission on such appeal.
   J.   Expiration: Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with
the terms of this chapter shall expire within twenty-four (24) months from the
effective date of approval or at an alternative time specified as a condition
of approval unless:
      1.   A building permit has been issued and construction has commenced;
      2.   A certificate of occupancy has been issued;
      3.   The use is established; or
      4.   A time extension has been granted.
   K.   Time Extension: The Community Development Director may approve a single
one year time extension for a reasonable accommodation for good cause. An
application for a time extension shall be made in writing to the director no
less than thirty (30) days nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the
expiration date.
   L.   Violation Of Terms: Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance
with the terms of this code may be revoked if any of the conditions or terms of
such reasonable accommodation are violated, or if any law or ordinance is
violated in connection therewith.
   M.   Discontinuance: A reasonable accommodation shall lapse if the exercise
of rights granted by it is discontinued for one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days. If the persons initially occupying a residence vacate the
residence, the reasonable accommodation shall remain in effect only if the
planning director determines that:
      1.   The modification is physically integrated into the residential
structure and cannot easily be removed or altered to comply with the zoning
code; or
      2.   The accommodation is necessary to give another disabled individual
an equal opportunity to reside in the dwelling.
      The director may request the applicant or his or her successor in
interest to the property to provide documentation that subsequent occupants are
persons with disabilities. Failure to provide such documentation within ten
(10) days of the date of a request by the director shall constitute grounds for
discontinuance by the director of a previously approved reasonable
accommodation.
   N.   Amendments: A request for changes in conditions of approval of a
reasonable accommodation, or a change to plans that would affect a condition of
approval shall be treated as a new application. The director may waive the
requirement for a new application if the changes are minor, do not involve
substantial alterations or addition to the plan or the conditions of approval,
and are consistent with the intent of the original approval.

of established, heritage, or oak trees is accommodated unless doing so
prohibits the development of an ADU/JADU as required by the Government Code.
   F.   All ADUs and JADUs shall be subject to the following restrictions:
      1.   The development and use of the ADU/JADU shall only be valid and
permitted based on the terms established in this Section.
      2.   A Deed Restriction shall be required for all JADUs. Prior to final

development standards such as setbacks, floor area, and lot coverage. The City
will ministerially review ADUs within existing portions of existing multi-
family dwelling structures that are not used as livable space, such as storage
rooms, boiler rooms, passageways, attics, basements, or garages, if each unit
complies with state building standards for dwellings in accordance with
Government Code Section 66323. The City will ministerially review applications
for ADUs and JADUs for multi-family dwellings that meet the requirements of
Government Code Section 66323 as long as they comply with this chapter.
      4.   A second unit may not have utility services separate from those of
the primary dwelling unit on the same property unless required by State law.
      5.   ADU/JADUs shall not be given separate street addresses from the
primary dwelling unit, unless the Director of Community Development determines

Development determines that a separate address is required for public safety
purposes, then the City will issue an alphanumeric address for the ADU/JADU
beginning with "A" and continuing through the alphabet for units on the
property. For example, if the address for the primary dwelling unit is 123 Main
Street, the address for the ADU/JADU would be 123 A Main Street.
      6.   The owner and all successors in interest in the subject property
shall maintain the ADU/JADU in accordance with all applicable regulations
established in this Section and any approval granted by the City. Violations

of the property where the school is located is at least 100,000 square feet.
(Ord. 0-19-1356, 11-13-2019)
23.02.33: TWO-UNIT RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS:
   A.   Purpose and Findings.
      1.   The purpose of this section is to provide regulations for the
establishment of two-unit residential developments in the R-1 zone and to
define an approval process for such two-unit residential developments
consistent with Government Code Sections 65852.21, or any successor statute.
The intent of this section is to provide opportunities for more affordable
housing in existing single-family residential zones as mandated by state law.
It is also the goal to provide development standards to ensure the orderly
development of these units in appropriate areas of the City.
      2.   Two-unit residential developments are residential uses consistent
with the uses permitted in the R-1 zone.
      3.   Government Code Section 65852.21 preempts the density limitations
established by the General Plan and the underlying zones in which two-unit
residential developments created pursuant to the requirements of this
subsection are permitted. Incompatibility with the City’s density limitations
shall not provide a basis to deny a two-unit residential development that
otherwise conforms to the requirements of this section.
      4.   The City will protect residents and properties in the special
districts, including areas where a high fire hazard or seismic risk exists, or
where a Historic Resources Survey has identified historic areas, districts or
properties, by denying requests for two-unit residential developments in these
special districts where a specific, adverse impact, as defined and determined
in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5 of the Government Code
exists, based upon public health and safety or the physical environment and for
which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the
specific, adverse impact.
   B.   A two-unit residential development containing two residential units
within the R-1 zone shall be considered ministerially, without discretionary
review or a hearing, if the proposed housing meets all of the standards set
forth below. For purposes of this section, a two-unit residential development
contains two residential units if the development proposes two new units or if
it proposes to add one new unit to one existing unit.
      1.   If a parcel includes an existing single family residence, one
additional unit of not more than 800 square feet may be developed pursuant to
this section. If the existing single family residence has been occupied by a
tenant in the last three years, no more than 25% of the existing exterior
structural walls may be demolished to create the two-unit residential
development.
      2.   If a parcel does not include an existing single family residence, or
if an existing single family residence is proposed to be demolished in
connection with the creation of a two-unit residential development, two units
of not more than 800 square feet may be developed pursuant to this section.
      3.   Each unit in a two-unit residential development shall be separated
by a distance of at least ten (10) feet from any other structure on the parcel;
however, units may be adjacent or connected if the structures meet building
code safety standards and are sufficient to allow separate conveyance. A solid
(no openings) one-hour rated fire wall is required between any attached units.
      4.   Unit Count. No more than two units are allowed on a lot with a two

23.03.10.01: INTENT AND PURPOSE:
This section establishes development standards and objective design standards
for multi-family residential developments that are intended to achieve and
maintain high-quality site planning and building design and development and in
a manner that conforms to community priorities. The development standards and
objective design standards draw from and complement existing design and
development criteria set forth in land policy and design documents adopted by
the city, including the general plan.
The provisions of this section apply to residential projects containing two or
more residential dwelling units, including duplexes, triplexes, flats,
townhouses, and multi-story and mid-rise building types, which upon an
applicant's request and demonstration of eligibility, qualify for ministerial
processing. This section does not apply to single-family residences, historic
properties, commercial-only projects, or any other non-residential projects,
nor does it apply to two-unit residential developments and urban lot splits
(SB-9). (Ord. O-24-1415, 11-20-2024)
23.03.10.02: RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
These development standards and objective design standards supplement and are
in addition to the standards for the C-1 zone. Articles 1 through 23 of Chapter
XXIII of the code of ordinances establish the City's zoning regulations. Where
conflict between these standards and other provisions of Chapter XXIII exists,
the provisions of this section shall govern. (Ord. O-24-1415, 11-20-2024)
23.03.10.03: DENSITY:
The maximum density for multi-family residential developments in the C-1 zone
shall be twenty (20) dwelling units per acre. (Ord. O-24-1415, 11-20-2024)
23.03.10.04: HEIGHT:
The maximum building height for a multi-family residential building in the C-
1 zone shall be thirty feet (30'). (Ord. O-24-1415, 11-20-2024)
23.03.10.05: LOT COVERAGE:

   A.   That if such use is abandoned, the following provisions shall apply:
      1.   If the use is nonconforming solely for failure to meet the
applicable off street parking requirements of this chapter and is abandoned for
a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, no use may be established or

pertaining to buildings hereafter constructed, except a restaurant that is
legal nonconforming for failure to provide sufficient off street parking may be
added to, structurally altered or enlarged if sufficient off street parking is
provided to meet the zoning ordinance requirement for the expanded area, if
any. Additions or alterations to any existing building which is nonconforming
due solely to existing side yard setbacks are permitted.
   C.   That no nonconforming use occupying any lot shall be enlarged or
extended into any other portion of land and/or building by displacing a

solely by reason of the application of such procedural requirement; provided,
however, that whenever any such preexisting use: a) has not applied for and
been granted such conditional use permit, and b) has been discontinued in usage
for any reason whatsoever for a period of ninety (90) days or more after notice
from the city of the provisions of this section, then there shall arise a
rebuttable presumption that there has been an intent by the owner or user to
abandon such use, and the planning commission shall commence due process
proceedings, based upon such presumed abandonment, to declare such use
nonconforming and to abate such use (and all buildings and structures
applicable to such use) as contrary to and in violation of this zoning code.

23.06.12: MINIMUM LOT AREA AND WIDTH REQUIREMENTS WILL NOT PREVENT USE FOR
SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING:
The requirements of this chapter as to minimum lot area and lot width shall not

of any amendment thereto making such lot or parcel nonconforming, was:
   A.   Shown separately upon an official subdivision map; or
   B.   Shown by a separate number or letter on a record of survey map filed
with the county recorder of Los Angeles County; or

waste management plan (approved November 30, 1989) relating to siting and
siting criteria for hazardous waste facilities. Nothing herein shall limit the
ability of the City to attach appropriate conditions to the issuance of any
such approval in order to protect the public health, safety or welfare nor to

property by the burdened parcel shall be considered for purposes of determining
lot coverage, parcel size and other applicable regulations, and the property
line of the burdened parcel shall be considered to be the inside line of the
easement. Such portion of the burdened parcel shall also not be considered for
purposes of determining the lot area, lot coverage or other applicable
requirements for the benefited parcel, and the lot line of the benefited parcel
shall determine the actual lot line, not the easement line. (Ord. 096-1093, 7-
10-1996)
23.06.15: CANNABIS PROHIBITIONS AND REGULATIONS:
   A.   Purpose:
      1.   The City Council finds that Federal law prohibits the possession,
manufacturing, distribution, and dispensing of cannabis, and in order to serve
the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents and businesses within
the City, the declared purpose of this section is to prohibit all commercial
cannabis activity, for medicinal, adult-use, or any other purpose within the
City, as provided in this section.
      2.   California Business and Professions Code section 26055(d) provides
that a State licensing authority shall not approve an application for a State
license for a cannabis business if approval of the State license will violate
the provisions of any local ordinance or regulation. California Business and
Professions Code section 26200 authorizes a city to adopt and enforce local
ordinances that completely prohibit the establishment or operation of one or
more cannabis businesses licensed under the State, within that city.
      3.   The City Council finds that a prohibition on all commercial cannabis
activity, for medicinal, adult-use, or any other purpose, is necessary for the
preservation and protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the
City and its community. The City Council's prohibition of such activity is
within the authority conferred upon the City Council by State law and is an
exercise of its police powers to enact and enforce regulations for the public
health, safety, and welfare of the City and its community.

property or on a public right-of-way. No person shall cultivate cannabis in any
manner that causes any of the following conditions: light, glare, heat, odor,
noise, mold or vibration that is or whose effect is either detrimental to
public health, safety, or welfare or that interferes with the reasonable

   A.   Submission Of An Application: Any person desiring a variance or
conditional use permit may file an application with the secretary of the
commission. No person may resubmit for one year an application for a variance
or conditional use permit that is substantially the same as a variance or
conditional use permit the council or commission has already denied. (Ord. 096-

   B.   Fees:
      1.   Application Fee: Fees for a variance, conditional use permit or
modifications of a previously approved variance or conditional use permit shall
be set by city council resolution.
      2.   Penalties For Unauthorized Construction: In the event that
construction which is inconsistent with a conditional use permit or variance is
performed, any application for an amendment to the previously approved
conditional use permit or variance to bring the conditional use permit or
variance into conformity with the construction shall be accompanied by an
additional fee as provided in this subsection as a penalty for the unauthorized
construction. The penalty fee shall be based on the valuation of the
construction as reflected on the building permit issued in connection with the
conditional use permit or variance and shall be calculated as set by city
council resolution. (Ord. 0-07-1191, 10-10-2007)

property owner or a representative of the applicant or property owner has been
given an opportunity to discuss that determination with the director of
planning and building.
      4.   Refund Of Penalty And Fees: The penalty and application fees shall
be refunded if the commission finds that the construction was, in fact,
consistent with the originally approved conditional use permit or variance.
      5.   Appeal To The Council: If the commission finds that the construction
was inconsistent with the conditional use permit or variance, the applicant may
appeal that determination to the council by filing with the city clerk a
written notice of appeal, accompanied by an appeal fee in an amount established
by resolution of the council, within ten (10) days of the commission's
determination. The penalty, application and appeal fees shall be refunded if
the council determines that the construction was, in fact, consistent with the
originally approved conditional use permit or variance.
      6.   Judicial Review: If the council determines that the construction was
inconsistent with the conditional use permit or variance, that determination
shall constitute a final administrative action of the city and the applicant
may seek a judicial review of that decision in the manner provided by law.
      7.   Removal Of Unauthorized Construction: Payment of the penalty shall
not preclude the City from disapproving an amendment and requiring the
applicant to bring the construction into conformity with the previously
approved conditional use permit or variance.
   C.   Application Forms: Applications shall be submitted on forms supplied by
the secretary of the Commission and shall be signed or countersigned by the
owner(s) of the property and the applicant if different from the owner. The
applicant shall supply a list of names and addresses of all owners of property
within three hundred feet (300') of the property lines of the subject premises
according to the latest available equalized assessment roll of the County of
Los Angeles.
   D.   Initiation Of Hearings: The Commission may, on its own motion, or if
instructed by the Council, shall, without the filing of any application, set a
date and hold a hearing for the purpose of considering the granting,
modification or revocation of a variance or conditional use permit.
   E.   Processing Of Application:
      1.   Upon receipt of any application for or initiation of a variance or
conditional use permit, the secretary of the Commission shall set a time and
place for public hearing thereon, to be held not less than fifteen (15) days
nor more than ninety (90) days thereafter. Not less than ten (10) days before
the date of such public hearing, public notice shall be given of such hearing
in the following manner:
         a.   By one publication in a newspaper of general circulation within
the City of a notice which shall state the nature of the application, the
location of the property and the time and place of the hearing; and
         b.   By mailing a notice to each property owner whose name and address
appear in such application, informing such owner of the nature of the
application, the location of the property and the time and place of the
hearing.
      2.   The failure on the part of any person to receive or to give due and
careful consideration to any such published or mailed notice shall not affect
the validity of the proceedings, provided that such publication and mailing
shall have been done in good faith.
   F.   Investigation Of Facts Bearing On Application: The Commission shall
cause to be made by its own members, or a member of its staff, such
investigation of the facts bearing on the application as will serve to provide
all necessary information to assure that the action on each such application is
consistent with the intent and purpose of this Chapter.
   G.   Public Hearing Generally: A public hearing shall be held before the
Commission at the time and place for which notice has been given. Any such
hearing may be continued or adjourned to a later date if, prior to such

the public hearing on an application for a variance or a conditional use
permit, the Commission shall render its decision either for the granting of the
application with or without conditions, or denying the application. The
decision shall recite the findings of fact upon which the decision is based.
The failure of the Commission to render its decision within thirty (30) days
after the conclusion of the hearing shall be deemed to constitute a denial
unless, by common consent, the Planning Commission and the applicant agree to
extend such time limit.
   I.   Notice Of Action Taken On A Request For A Variance Or Conditional Use
Permit:
      1.   The Commission shall notify the applicant for a variance and/or

The Commission shall consider applications for a conditional use permit and may
deny or, with or without conditions, approve any application in general accord
with the following principles and standards as determined by the Commission
based on findings and conclusions drawn from information and evidence presented
at a public hearing or hearings:
   A.   Before any conditional use permit may be granted, it shall be
demonstrated and the Planning Commission must find all of the following to be
true:
      1.   That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the use or
building applied for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case,
be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals, comfort or general welfare
of persons residing in or working in the area of such proposed use nor be
detrimental or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood or to
the general welfare of the City; and
      2.   That the site for the proposed conditional use is adequate in size
and shape to accommodate the yards, walls and fences, parking and loading,
landscaping and other development features prescribed in this Chapter or
required by the Commission in order to integrate said conditional use with the
land and uses in the neighborhood; and
      3.   That proposed conditional use will not have a detrimental effect
upon the nature, condition and development of nearby uses and buildings; and
      4.   That the site for the proposed conditional use will relate to
streets and highways adequate in width and pavement to carry the kind and
quantity of traffic such use would generate.
   B.   The Commission may, in granting a conditional use permit, impose such
conditions as are necessary to protect the public health, safety and general
welfare, and assure compliance with the provisions and standards included in
this Chapter, including, but not limited to:
      1.   Special yards, open spaces and buffer areas.
      2.   Fences and walls.
      3.   Surfacing of parking areas and driveways to specified standards.
      4.   Street dedications and improvements.
      5.   Vehicular ingress and egress.
      6.   Landscaping and maintenance of grounds.
      7.   Regulation of nuisance factors, such as noise, vibrations, smoke,
dust, dirt, odors, gases, noxious matter, heat, glare, electromagnetic
disturbances and radiation.
      8.   Regulations of operating hours for activities affecting normal
neighborhood schedules and functions.
      9.   Regulation of signs and outdoor advertising.
      10.   Establish a validation period limiting the time in which
development may begin.
      11.   Require a bond or other security that the proposed conditional use
will be removed on or before a specified date.
      12.   Require a site plan indicating all details and data as prescribed
in this Chapter.
      13.   Dedication or conveyance to the City or affected public utility of
appropriate public and utility easements.
      14.   Require such other conditions as will make possible the development
of the proposed conditional use in an orderly and efficient manner and in
general accord with the intent and purpose of this Chapter.
   C.   No permit shall be issued for nor be effective to permit any use if the
same is prohibited by other provisions of this Code. No conditional use shall
be presumed as permitted use, and the burden of proof shall be upon the
applicant to show persuasive grounds for such permit. (Ord. 096-1093, 7-10-
1996)
23.07.03: BASIS FOR APPROVAL OR DENIAL OF VARIANCE:
The Commission shall give consideration to applications for a variance and may
deny or, with or without conditions, approve any application in general accord
with all of the following principles and standards as determined by the
Commission based on findings and conclusions drawn from information and
evidence presented at a public hearing:
   A.   Before any variance may be granted, it shall be demonstrated, and the
Commission must find all of the following to be true:
      1.   That strict application of the regulations and standards of this
Chapter will result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships
inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of said regulations and
standards; and
      2.   That the variance, if granted, will not constitute a grant of
special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in
the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is situated; and
      3.   That, because of special circumstances applicable to the subject
property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the
strict application of this Chapter will deprive the applicant of a reasonable
utilization of such property; and
      4.   That the use or development applied for will not be materially
detrimental to the public health, safety or general welfare or injurious to
property or improvements in the zone or neighborhood in which the property is
located; and
      5.   That, because of circumstances relating to or conditions applicable
to the property in question, it would be unreasonable and a deprivation of any
practical use of the property to deny such variance; except whenever the
application involves a fence, yard, setback or bulk variance (as opposed to a
use, parking or other type variance), it shall not be necessary to make a
finding on this point.
   B.   The Commission may, in granting a variance, impose such conditions as
are necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare and
assure compliance with the provisions and standards included in this Chapter,
including, but not limited to:
      1.   Granting a variance for a limited period of time.
      2.   Granting a variance for a temporary expansion or extension of a use,
lawful because of a previously granted variance, on conditions that both
variances shall terminate on the indicated date and the property shall
thereafter be used for such purposes as are permitted in the zone in which such
property is located.
      3.   Granting a variance confining the use to designate portions of the
property or restricting function of the use to specific days or designated
times in a day.
      4.   Granting a variance limiting, restricting or prohibiting uses made
of the property, even if such uses are lawful without granting of the variance,
even including requiring fulfillment of specific conditions prior to
establishment of the use in question.
      5.   Imposing protective buffering improvements.
      6.   Controlling access and parking.
      7.   Imposing any of the conditions set forth in subsection 23.07.02B of
this Article.

have an area of not less than one hundred twenty (120) square feet and the
following minimum width and length:
 
Minimum width  8 feet
Minimum length 15 feet
 
   C.   Location: Required off-street parking for buildings constructed prior
to January 1, 1992, may be provided on property other than the property for
which the parking would serve, subject to the following requirements:
      1.   The applicant for the off-site parking plan agrees to immediately
cease all operations of the business for which the off-site parking is to be
devoted within thirty (30) days following the termination of the lease or other
arrangements the Commission or Council approved for the off-site parking unless
the Commission, or the Council on appeal, first approves a new off-site parking
plan; and
      2.   The off-site parking is located within the City and, for parking
that is to be utilized by customers, is not separated from the use by San
Gabriel Boulevard, Huntington Drive or San Marino Avenue; and
      3.   No reduction of existing on-site parking will result; and
      4.   No off-site parking to accommodate an expansion or change in use
requiring additional parking will be permitted in connection with an existing
use that is nonconforming for failure to provide sufficient parking unless the
off-site parking will provide more parking than the Zoning Ordinance requires
for the change in use; and
      5.   Any off-site parking located more than three hundred feet (300')
from the property which it serves shall be limited only to employee parking
use, and the owner of the property on which the off-site parking is located and
the lot the parking serves shall record covenants restricting such property to
that use; and
      6.   Parking spaces located at a distance greater than three hundred feet
(300') from the property served shall not be utilized to satisfy more than
fifty percent (50%) of the off- street parking requirement; and
      7.   The Commission approves an off-site parking plan pursuant to
issuance of a conditional use permit following a public hearing, notice of
which is provided to the owner(s) of property located within three hundred feet
(300') of the lots to which the parking is to be dedicated and upon which the
parking is to be devoted, subject to appeal to the Council filed within fifteen
(15) days following the Commission's action. In approving such an off-site
parking plan, the Commission may impose such conditions that it deems
necessary. Such conditions may include, but need not be limited to, measures to
ensure that employees of the business shall park at the off-site location or a
requirement that the business provide valet, shuttle, jitney or other services
to bring customers and/or employees from the off-site location to the business.
No such plan shall be approved unless the Commission finds that approval will
not harm the public health, safety or general welfare. In considering such
approval, the Commission shall consider the percentage of parking that will be
provided on-site, whether customers and employees will utilize the off-site
parking, the existing parking problems in the neighborhood and the distance
between the off-site parking and the business and such other factors the
Commission deems appropriate; and
      8.   If the parking plan requires employees to utilize the off- street
parking, the owner of the business utilizing the off-site parking shall provide
the City with a list of the names and vehicle license numbers of all employees.
This list shall be updated within five (5) working days of a change in
employees or a vehicle utilized by an employee. Failure of the employees to
park in the off-site location shall constitute grounds for revocation of the
off-site parking plan.
      9.   Any lease of off-site parking shall be for an initial term of at
least one year, or such longer minimum term as the Commission approves, and
shall be renewable only for terms of one year or more.
   D.   Mixed Occupancies In A Building: In the case of mixed users in a
building or on a lot, the total requirements for off-street parking facilities
shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately.
Off-street parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing
required parking facilities for any other use, except as hereinafter specified
for joint use. If a use or occupancy on a mixed use lot is proposed to be
changed to a use or occupancy having a more restrictive off-street parking
requirement, such change shall be allowed only if all uses and occupancies on
the lot will thereafter have the parking required under this Code for new
structures.
   E.   Joint Use: The Commission may, upon the approval of a conditional use
permit, authorize the joint use of parking facilities by the following uses or
activities under the conditions specified herein:
      1.   Up to fifty percent (50%) of the parking facilities required by this
Section for a use considered to be primarily a daytime use may be provided by
the parking facilities of a use considered to be primarily a nighttime use; up
to fifty percent (50%) of the parking facilities required by this Section for a
use considered to be primarily a nighttime use may be provided by the parking
facilities of a use considered to be primarily a daytime use, provided such
reciprocal parking area shall be subject to conditions set forth in subsection
E4 of this Section.
      2.   Up to one hundred percent (100%) of the parking facilities required
by this Section for a church or for an auditorium incidental to a public or
parochial school may be supplied by parking facilities of a use considered to

conditions set forth in subsection E4 of this Section.
      3.   The following uses are typical daytime uses: banks, business
offices, retail stores, personal service shops, clothing or shoe repair or
service shops and similar uses. The following uses are typical of nighttime
and/or Sunday uses: auditoriums, incidental to a public or parochial school, or
churches.
      4.   Conditions required for joint use are as follows:
         a.   Location: The building or use for which application is being made
for authority to utilize the existing off-street parking facilities provided by
another building or use shall be located within three hundred feet (300') of
such parking facility.
         b.   Conflict: The applicant shall show that there is no substantial
conflict in the principal operating hours of the buildings or uses for which
the joint use of off-street parking facilities is proposed.
         c.   Agreement: The parties agreeing to the joint use of off-street
parking facilities shall evidence agreement for such joint use by a proper
legal instrument approved by the City Attorney as to form and content. Such
instrument shall be irrevocable, except with the consent of the City, and, when

23.12.04: MASTER SIGN PLAN:
   A.   Purpose: A master sign plan is intended to integrate identification
signs into the architectural design of the building, thereby creating an
architectural statement of high quality. A master sign plan provides a flexible
means of applying and modifying the sign regulations in this chapter to ensure
high quality in the design and display of multiple permanent signs on multi-
tenant buildings and to encourage creativity and excellence in the design of
signs. It is expected that the design quality of signs proposed under a master
sign plan will be of a superior quality and creativity to those that might
result through the normal sign permit process.
   B.   Applicability: The approval of a master sign plan shall be required and
obtained from the planning commission for all new buildings in the C-1 zone in
the following circumstances:
      1.   Whenever two (2) or more separate commercial tenant spaces are
created on the same parcel;
      2.   Whenever two (2) or more signs are proposed for a building.
   C.   Existing Buildings With Nonconforming Signs: Any sign made
nonconforming by the provisions of this chapter, may be so continued and
maintained until a master sign plan is reviewed and approved by the design
review committee (DRC). The processing fees for a master sign plan shall be
waived if an application is submitted to the planning and building department
within two (2) years of the adoption of this section. This period shall be
determined according to the following provision:
      1.   A fee exemption period shall begin on the adoption date hereof and a
notice will be sent by first class mail by the planning and building director
to the owner(s) of multi-tenant commercial properties.
   D.   Approval Authority: A master sign plan shall be approved by the DRC
before the issuance of a building permit. In approving a master sign plan, the
DRC shall find that the plan's contribution to the design quality of the site
and the surrounding area will be superior to the quality that would result
under the standard regulations of this chapter.
   E.   Modification Of Regulations: A master sign plan may include sign
regulations that are, at the same time, more restrictive in some respects than
the regulations currently established in this chapter. Allowed modifications
may relate to sign area, number of signs, height, and location.
   F.   Application Requirements: A master sign plan shall include all
information and materials identified below, and the filing fee in compliance
with the most current city council's fee resolution.
      1.   An accurate plot plan of the entire lot on which the use will be
located at a scale of not less than one inch to one hundred feet (1"=100').
      2.   Location of buildings, parking lots, driveways and landscaped areas
on the lot.
      3.   A table (or tables) containing:
         a.   Computation of the maximum total sign area;
         b.   Maximum area for individual signs;
         c.   Height of signs; and
         d.   Statement of the maximum total sign area and maximum number of
signs permitted on the site by this code.
      4.   An accurate indication on the plot plan of the location and
orientation of each sign for which a permit is currently being requested, and
the anticipated location of future signs requiring a permit.
      5.   A description and illustration of the following may be required:
         a.   Colors and materials to be used in sign construction;
         b.   Style of lettering for all signs;
         c.   Appearance/location of logos or icons;
         d.   Location of each sign on the building(s), with building
elevations if necessary;
         e.   All sign proportions; and
         f.   Types of illumination.
   G.   Findings: In order to approve a master sign plan, the following
findings shall first be made:
      1.   The master sign plan complies with the purpose of this chapter,
including the commercial design guidelines;
      2.   Proposed signs enhance the overall development and are in harmony
with other signs included in the plan with the structures they identify and
with surrounding development;
      3.   The master sign plan contains provisions to accommodate future
revisions that may be required because of changes in use or tenants; and
      4.   The master sign plan complies with the standards of this chapter.
   H.   Revisions To Master Sign Plans:
      1.   Revisions to master sign plans may be approved by the DRC if the
intent of the original approval is not affected.
      2.   Revisions that would substantially deviate from the original
approval shall require the approval of a new master sign plan. (Ord. 0-10-1235,
7-30-2010)

mitigation measures identified by the transit operator shall be evaluated in
the draft environmental impact report prepared for the project. Related
mitigation measures adopted shall be monitored through the mitigation
monitoring requirements of CEQA.
Phased development projects, development projects subject to a development
agreement or development projects requiring subsequent approvals need not
repeat this process as long as no significant changes are made to the project.
It shall remain the discretion of the lead agency to determine when a project
is substantially the same and therefore covered by a previously certified EIR.

the denial thereof, which decision shall recite the findings of fact upon which
the decision is based. The failure of the DRC or Planning Commission to render
its decision within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the hearing shall
be deemed to constitute a denial of it unless, by common consent, the DRC or
Planning Commission and the applicant agree to extend such time limit.
(Ord. O-22-1397, 10-12-2022)
23.15.09: STANDARD OF REVIEW:
The DRC or Planning Commission shall consider the durability, quality and cost
of construction materials when raised as an issue by the applicant. The DRC or
Planning Commission shall consider all applications for design review and may
deny, with or without conditions, or approve any case in general accord with
the following principles and standards as determined by the DRC or Planning
Commission based on findings and conclusions drawn from information and
evidence presented at a public hearing:
   A.   The DRC shall approve the application if it finds all of the following
to be true:
      1.   That the proposed structure is compatible with the neighborhood, and
      2.   That the proposed structure is designed and will be developed in a
manner which balances the reasonable expectation of privacy of persons residing
on contiguous properties with the reasonable expectations of the applicants to
develop their property within the restrictions of this code,
      3.   In the case of a building addition, the proposal is compatible with
the existing building which includes the rooflines,
      4.   That the colors and materials are consistent and match the existing
building or structure.
   B.   The design review process may not require a reduction of the maximum
lot coverage allowed by sections
23.02.10,
23.02.11, and
23.02.12 of this chapter.
   C.   Any building permit resulting from design review approval of plans and
specifications required in section
23.15.12 of this article must be obtained within one year of the approval. All
construction must take place in conformance with the approved plans and
specifications. A design review application which is not used within one year
after the granting of such application, becomes null and void and of no effect;
except, that the DRC or Planning Commission may extend the expiration date of
any design review application for a period of one year.

23.16.01: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
   A.   The state legislature has found:
      1.   That the waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject
to ever increasing demands;
      2.   That the continuation of California's economic prosperity is
dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses;
      3.   That it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and
efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource;
      4.   That landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California
by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to
the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire
protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development;
      5.   That landscape design, installation, maintenance and management can
and should be water efficient; and
      6.   That section 2 of article X of the California Constitution specifies
that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for
the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to
waste or unreasonable method of use.
   B.   Consistent with these findings, the purpose of this article is to
establish an alternative ordinance that is at least as effective as the state
model ordinance in the context of the conditions in San Marino, in order to:
      1.   Promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that
integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water;
      2.   Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing,
maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and
rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that
requires cross sector collaboration of industry, government and property owners
to achieve the many benefits possible;
      3.   Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste
prevention for existing landscapes;
      4.   Use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied
water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the
lowest practical amount;
      5.   Promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with
neighboring local and regional agencies;
      6.   Establish economic incentives that promote the efficient use of
water; and
      7.   Adopt the necessary authority that implements and enforces the
provisions of the model water efficient landscape ordinance. (Ord. 0-16-1308,

hundred (2,500) square feet or less may comply with the performance
requirements of this chapter or conform to the prescriptive measures contained
in subsection 23.16.23B of this article.
   C.   For projects using treated or untreated gray water or rainwater
captured on site, any lot or parcel within the project that has less than two
thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of landscape and meets the lot or
parcel's landscape water requirement (estimated total water use) entirely with

   A.   Stormwater management practices minimize runoff and increase
infiltration which recharges groundwater and improves water quality.
Implementing stormwater best management practices into the landscape and
grading design plans to minimize runoff and to increase on site rainwater
retention and infiltration are encouraged.
   B.   Project applicants shall refer to the city or regional water quality
control board for information on any applicable stormwater technical
requirements.
   C.   All planted landscape areas are required to have friable soil to
maximize water retention and infiltration.
   D.   It is strongly recommended that landscape areas be designed for capture
and infiltration capacity that is sufficient to prevent runoff from impervious
surfaces (i.e., roof and paved areas) from either: 1) the one inch (1"), 24-
hour rain event or 2) the eighty fifth percentile, 24-hour rain event, and/or
additional capacity as required by any applicable local, regional, state or
federal regulation.
   E.   It is recommended that stormwater projects incorporate any of the
following elements to improve on site stormwater and dry weather runoff capture
and use:
      1.   Grade impervious surfaces, such as driveways, during construction to
drain to vegetated areas.
      2.   Minimize the area of impervious surfaces such as paved areas, roof
and concrete driveways.
      3.   Incorporate pervious or porous surfaces (e.g., gravel, permeable
pavers or blocks, pervious or porous concrete) that minimize runoff.
      4.   Direct runoff from paved surfaces and roof areas into planting beds
or landscaped areas to maximize site water capture and reuse.
      5.   Incorporate rain gardens, cisterns, and other rain harvesting or
catchment systems.

excess flow, and filter pollutants. (Ord. 0-16-1308, 12-14-2016)
23.16.19: PUBLIC EDUCATION:
The city will provide information to new owners and owners of permitted
renovations and new, single-family residential homes regarding the design,
installation, management, and maintenance of water efficient landscapes based
on a water budget. (Ord. 0-16-1308, 12-14-2016)
23.16.20: EXISTING LANDSCAPING; IRRIGATION AUDIT, IRRIGATION SURVEY, AND
IRRIGATION WATER USE ANALYSIS:
   A.   This section shall apply to all existing landscapes that were installed
before December 1, 2015, and are over one acre in size.
      1.   For all landscapes that have a water meter, the city shall
administer programs that may include, but not be limited to, irrigation water
use analyses, irrigation surveys, and irrigation audits to evaluate water use
and provide recommendations as necessary to reduce landscape water use to a
level that does not exceed the maximum applied water allowance for existing
landscapes. The maximum applied water allowance for existing landscapes shall
be calculated as: MAWA = (0.8) (ETo)(LA)(0.62).
      2.   For all landscapes that do not have a meter, the city shall
administer programs that may include, but not be limited to, irrigation surveys
and irrigation audits to evaluate water use and provide recommendations as
necessary in order to prevent water waste.
   B.   All landscape irrigation audits shall be conducted by a certified
landscape irrigation auditor. (Ord. 0-16-1308, 12-14-2016)

      1.   The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no runoff
occurs; or
      2.   The adjacent nonpermeable surfaces are designed and constructed to
drain entirely to landscaping. (Ord. 0-16-1308, 12-14-2016)
23.16.22: EFFECTIVE PRECIPITATION:
The city may consider effective precipitation (25 percent of annual
precipitation) in tracking water use and may use the following equation to
calculate maximum applied water allowance:
MAWA= (ETo-Eppt) (0.62) [(0.55xLA) + (0.45xSLA)] for residential areas.
MAWA= (ETo-Eppt) (0.62) [(0.45xLA) + (0.55xSLA)] for nonresidential areas.

Places is automatically designated as a historic landmark for purposes of this
article.

property in violation of the terms of this Article, shall restore the
environment by planting one or more trees in such quantity that the Community
Development Director or his/her designee requires as part of a tree restoration
plan. The requirements for and the regulations regarding a tree restoration
plan are as follows:
      1.   A tree restoration plan shall be based on planting sufficient trees
as are necessary to provide an amount of tree canopy reasonably equal to the
amount of the tree canopy that was unlawfully removed as determined by the
Community Development Director or his/her designee.
      2.   In the case of unlawful removal of a tree, the tree restoration plan
shall require the planting of not less than one (1) thirty six inch (36") box
size tree, and the total of the diameter of the trees to be planted shall be
equal to the diameter of the tree that was unlawfully removed.
      3.   In the event that the diameter of the tree that was unlawfully
removed cannot be determined, the tree restoration plan shall be based on the
likely diameter of the unlawfully removed tree determined by the City's Urban
Forester, or a City-appointed certified arborist, using the best evidence
available.
      4.   The tree restoration plan shall require the tree(s) to be planted in
those location(s) that will best restore the visual environment to the
environment that existed before the unlawful and irreversible tree damage or
removal occurred, as determined by the City's Urban Forester, or a City-
appointed certified arborist, using the best evidence available.
      5.   If the Community Development Director or his/her designee determines
that the property cannot accommodate the number of trees required to be planted
by this subsection, the tree restoration plan shall require the trees to be
planted on publicly owned property at locations determined by the Community
Development Director or his/her designee.
      6.   The property owner may select the species of tree(s) to be planted
from a list of tree species designated by the Community Development Director,
provided that the City's Urban Forester or a City-appointed certified arborist
determines the tree(s)' size and height is equal to the tree that was
unlawfully and irreversibly damaged, except in the case of oak trees which must
be replaced with oak trees.
      7.   The Community Development Director shall reconsider a tree
restoration plan established in connection with a tree that was unlawfully
removed, or irreversibly damaged if the replacement tree(s) dies within three
(3) years from the date of the tree removal or damage, and may impose
additional replacement requirements.
      8.   The City's determination of such violation and establishment of a
tree restoration plan under this Section
23.19.08 may be appealed as set forth in Section
23.19.06 (Appeals) of this Article.
      9.   Failure to comply with an approved tree restoration plan shall
constitute a separate violation of this Article.
      10.   Payment of any penalty and planting of replacement trees shall
occur within sixty (60) calendar days of the date the violator was directed to
take such action by the Community Development Director. If the property owner
does not complete planting of replacement trees within the allotted time, the
Community Development Director, at the expense of the property owner, may
procure and plant the requisite replacement trees, and the property owner shall
be responsible for reimbursing the city for such additional costs.
Reimbursement is due and payable within thirty (30) calendar days of the city's
issuance of a billing statement. If payment of the penalty is not received by
the city in sixty (60) calendar days, the city manager can instruct that the
outstanding obligation be collected in any of the following manners:
         a.   A civil action in the name of the city, in any court of competent
jurisdiction; or
         b.   Use of a debt collection agency; or
         c.   A lien on the subject property, following notice and a public
hearing.

trespass that results in glare to neighboring properties or public/private
streets is prohibited unless the director determines that there is no other
alternative to provide such security lighting required by the California
Building Code, or approves the use of alarm or motion-activated security
lighting. For the purposes of this section, "glare" means stray, unshielded
lighting striking the eye that results in discomfort, such as bright light
causing squinting of the eyes; and/or disabling glare, such as bright light
that reduces the ability to drive or see into shadows.
      6.   Fixture types. All light fixtures, including pole-mounted and wall-
mounted light fixtures, shall be fully shielded so that the light bulb is
invisible from the adjacent neighbors or streets. Light fixtures shall be "cut-
off" where lenses, refractors or lamp sources do not extend below the surface
of the fixture housing, and no light shall be directed at or above the lowest
horizontal plane of the light fixture. Louvered light fixtures shall not
qualify as fully shielded fixtures.
      7.   Extinguishment of lights. With the exception of approved security
lighting, or operational lighting conditions approved through a conditional use
permit, all exterior lighting and parking lot lighting shall be extinguished by

   A.   All requests under State Density Bonus Law shall be part of the
planning application and shall be applied for, reviewed, and acted upon
concurrently with the planning application by the approval body with authority
to approve the development, within the timelines prescribed by California
Government Code Section 65950 et seq. or other statute or expedited review and
approval process determined the Community Development Director (if applicable).
Appeals of the planning application in accordance with the requirements of San
Marino Municipal Code Section
23.09.06 shall include all requests under State Density Bonus Law if appeals
are authorized for the discretionary or ministerial permit applied for.
   B.   To ensure that an application for a housing development conforms with
the provisions of State Density Bonus Law, the staff report presented to the
decision-making body shall state whether the application conforms to the
following requirements of State Density Bonus Law, as applicable:
      1.   The housing development provides the housing required by State
Density Bonus Law to be eligible for a density bonus and any incentives,
parking reduction, or waivers requested, including housing required to replace
units rented or formerly rented to very low- and low-income households as
required by California Government Code Section 65915(c)(3).
      2.   If applicable, the housing development provides the housing required
by State Density Bonus law to be eligible for an additional density bonus under
Government Code Section 65915(v)(1).
      3.   If an incentive is requested, reasonable documentation has been
presented showing that any requested incentive will result in identifiable and
actual cost reductions to provide for affordable housing or costs or rents;
except that, if a mixed-use development is requested, the application must
instead meet all of the requirements of Government Code Section 65915(k)(2).
      4.   If a waiver is requested, the development standards for which a
waiver is requested would have the effect of physically precluding the
construction of the housing development at the densities or with the incentives
permitted.
      5.   The housing development is eligible for any requested parking
reductions under Government Code Section 65915(p) or other statute.
      6.   If the density bonus is based all or in part on donation of land,
the requirements of Government Code Section 65915(g) have been met.
      7.   If the density bonus or incentive is based all or in part on the
inclusion of a child care facility or condominium conversion, the requirements
included in Government Code Section 65915(h) or 65915.5, as appropriate, have
been met.
   C.   The decision-making body shall grant an incentive requested by the
applicant unless it makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence,
of any of the following:
      1.   The proposed incentive does not result in identifiable and actual
cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in Health
and Safety Code Section 50052.5; or for affordable rents, as defined in Health
and Safety Code Section 50053;
      2.   The proposed incentive would be contrary to state or federal law; or
      3.   The proposed incentive would have a specific, adverse impact upon
the public health or safety or on any real property that is listed in the
California Register of Historic Resources, and there is no feasible method to
satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering
the housing development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households.
For the purpose of this subsection, "specific, adverse impact" means a
significant, quantifiable, direct and unavoidable impact, based on objective,
identified, written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions
as they existed on the date that the application for the housing development
was deemed complete as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5.
   D.   The decision-making body shall grant the waiver of development
standards requested by the applicant unless it makes a written finding, based
upon substantial evidence, of any of the following:
      1.   The proposed waiver would be contrary to state or federal law;
      2.   The proposed waiver would have an adverse impact on any real
property listed in the California Register of Historic Resources; or
      3.   The proposed waiver would have a specific, adverse impact upon the
public health or safety, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily
mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the housing
development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households. For the
purpose of this subsection, "specific, adverse impact" means a significant,
quantifiable, direct and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified,
written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they
existed on the date that the application for the housing development was deemed
complete as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5.
   E.   If a child care center complies with the requirements of Government
Code Section 65915(h), the decision-making body may deny a density bonus or
incentive that is based on the provision of child care facilities only if it
makes a written finding, based on substantial evidence, that the City already
has adequate child care facilities.
   F.   A request for minor modification of an approved density bonus housing
plan may be granted by the Community Development Director, or their designee,
if the modification substantially complies with the original density bonus
housing plan and conditions of approval. Other modifications to the density
bonus housing plan shall be processed in the same manner as the original plan.
(Ord. O-24-1415, 11-20-2024)
23.22.04: DENSITY BONUS HOUSING AGREEMENT:
   A.   If a density bonus, incentive, parking reduction, or waiver is approved
pursuant to this chapter, the applicant shall enter into a binding affordable
housing agreement or restrictive covenant, as described below, with the City,
which sets forth the conditions and guidelines to be met in the implementation
of State Density Bonus Law and that ensures compliance with all of the
provisions of this chapter. The agreement will also establish specific
compliance standards and remedies available to the City upon failure by the
applicant to comply with State Density Bonus Law, this chapter, or the
affordable housing agreement.
   B.   For rental projects, the applicant shall enter into an affordable
housing agreement with the City, running with the land, in a form approved by
the City Attorney, to be executed by the City Attorney, or their designee. The
agreement shall require the continued affordability of all rental units that
qualified the applicant for the receipt of the density bonus, incentive,
waiver, or parking reduction for a minimum of fifty-five (55) years or a longer
period of time if required by the construction or mortgage financing assistance
program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program; shall identify
the type, size and location of each affordable unit; shall specify the eligible
occupants; shall specify phasing of the affordable units in relation to the
market-rate units; and shall contain other relevant provisions approved by the
City Attorney. Rents for the lower income density bonus units shall be set at
an affordable rent as defined in State Density Bonus Law.
   C.   For for-sale projects, the applicant shall enter into an affordable
housing agreement with the City, running with the land, in a form approved by
the City Attorney, to be executed by the City Manager, or their designee. The
affordable housing agreement shall require that, the initial purchasers of
those for-sale units that qualified the applicant for the receipt of the
density bonus, incentive, waiver, or parking reduction are persons and families
of lower or moderate income, as applicable, or if any for-sale unit is not
purchased by an income-qualified household within one-hundred eighty (180) days
after the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, then the unit(s) must be
sold pursuant to a contract that satisfies the requirements of Revenue and
Taxation Code Section 402.1(a)(10) to a qualified non-profit housing
corporation as defined in State Density Bonus Law and that the units are
offered at an affordable housing cost, as that cost is defined in Health and
Safety Code Section 50052.5; and shall contain other relevant provisions
approved by the City Attorney. The City shall enforce an equity sharing
agreement consistent with State Density Bonus Law unless it is in conflict with
the requirements of another public funding source or law.
   D.   Where a density bonus, waiver or parking reduction is provided for a
market-rate senior housing development, the applicant shall enter into a
restrictive covenant with the City, running with the land, in a form approved
by the City Attorney, to be executed by the City Manager, or their designee, to
require the housing development to be operated as "housing for older persons"
consistent with state and federal fair housing laws.
   E.   The executed affordable housing agreement shall be recorded against the
housing development prior to final or parcel map approval, or, where a map is
not being processed, prior to issuance of building permits for the housing
development, whichever is earliest. The affordable housing agreement shall be
binding on all future owners and successors in interest. (Ord. O-24-1415, 11-
20-2024)
23.22.05: DENSITY BONUS CALCULATIONS:
   A.   In determining the total number of units to be granted, each component
of any density calculation, including base density and bonus density, resulting
in fractional units shall be separately rounded up to the next whole number.
   B.   When calculating the number of affordable units needed to qualify for a
given density bonus, any fractions of affordable dwelling units shall be
rounded up to the next whole number.
   C.   Except where a housing development is eligible for an additional bonus
pursuant to Government Code Section 65915(v), each housing development is
entitled to only one density bonus. If a housing development qualifies for a
density bonus under more than one category, the applicant shall identify the
category under which the density bonus is requested to be granted.
   D.   In determining the number of affordable units required to qualify a
housing development for a density bonus pursuant to State Density Bonus Law,
units added by a density bonus are not included in the calculations.
   E.   The applicant may elect to accept a lesser percentage of density bonus
than the housing development is entitled to, or no density bonus, but no
reduction will be permitted in the percentages of affordable units required by
State Density Bonus law. Regardless of the number of affordable units, no
housing development shall be entitled to a density bonus greater than what is
authorized under State Density Bonus Law.
   F.   Nothing in this Article requires the provision of direct financial
incentives from the City for the housing development, including, but not
limited to, the provision of financial subsidies, publicly owned land, fee
waivers, or waiver of dedication requirements. The City, at its sole
discretion, may choose to provide such direct financial incentives. (Ord. O-24-
1415, 11-20-2024)
23.22.06: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Affordable units shall be comparable in exterior appearance and overall
quality of construction to market rate units in the same housing development.
Interior finishes and amenities may differ from those provided in the market
rate units, but neither the workmanship nor the products may be of substandard
or inferior quality as determined by the City.
   B.   To comply with fair housing laws, the affordable units shall contain
the same proportional mix of bedroom sizes as the market-rate units. In mixed-
income buildings, the occupants of the affordable units shall have the same
access to the common entrances and to the common areas, parking, and amenities
of the project as the occupants of the market-rate housing units, and the
affordable units shall be located throughout the building and not isolated on
one floor or to an area on a specific floor. (Ord. O-24-1415, 11-20-2024)

standards and no building or planning inspections shall be completed until all
such applicable items are addressed:
   A.   One sign, visible from the street, must be posted, listing a contact
name, company, and phone number. Said sign may be attached to a construction
fence and must be six (6) square feet in area and no greater than thirty six
inches (36") in length. No other signs shall be permitted in connection with
the project.
   B.   Construction materials, equipment, storage bins, and portable
facilities must be screened from public view.
   C.   Construction fencing must be installed on the site of any residential
or commercial structure that is being, in whole or in part, demolished or
reconstructed. Construction fencing must be installed in a manner that fully
screens and secures the construction site. Construction fencing must include an
opaque, dark-green screening material that is tightly secured to the fencing,
free of holes and without advertising, except as allowed under subsection A of
this section. The Director of Planning and Building, in his or her sole
discretion, may require construction fencing on any other type of construction
sites and may allow landscaping to substitute for some or all of the
construction fencing. Construction fencing and any other approved screening
material must be maintained in good condition.
   D.   A portable toilet shall be placed in the rear of the property with a
minimum setback of ten feet (10') from side yard and rear yard property lines.
If existing conditions prohibit access for the drop-off or the servicing of the
portable toilet, the unit can be placed in the front yard provided the unit is
placed no further than five feet (5') from the front of the house and ten feet
(10') from any side property lines. The door opening shall not face either the
street or an adjacent property and shall remain closed at all times. The
portable toilet shall be screened from public view at all times. No more than
one toilet shall be used per property. The portable toilet shall be serviced a
minimum of twice a week.
   E.   Roll-off containers shall be in good condition and appearance and
emptied on a regular basis. Containers shall be placed on private property
unless an encroachment permit is obtained.
   F.   All construction equipment, storage bins and portable toilets shall be
kept free of graffiti.
   G.   Construction materials, equipment, storage bins or debris shall not be
placed on public property unless an encroachment permit has first been granted
for such placement from Planning and Building and the Public Works Department.
Conditions may be imposed to ensure appropriate safety signage, insurance and
bonds.
   H.   Any dirt or debris tracked onto streets and sidewalks shall be removed
immediately. All trash and litter on the job site shall be removed from public
view on a daily basis.
   I.   Construction worker vehicles, equipment, and gate fencing shall not
block public sidewalks.
   J.   Existing landscaping shall be maintained in good condition, including
the City parkway area. The property owner or contractor shall be responsible
for mowing, trimming, weeding, and irrigating these areas as needed throughout
the duration of the construction project.
   K.   A waste management form/plan shall be submitted at plan check and
project final whenever the scope of work proposes a residential addition of one
thousand (1,000) square feet or more; new construction of one thousand (1,000)
square feet or more; a demolition project of one thousand (1,000) square feet
or more, or tenant improvement projects of three thousand (3,000) square feet
or more.
   L.   A tree protection plan shall be submitted at plan check where any
construction activity takes place within the drip line of the canopy of any
established tree or any tree in the City parkway. A separate cut sheet shall
also be submitted identifying all established trees on the property. The tree
protection plan must be prepared by either a registered consulting arborist or
a certified arborist with the International Society of Arborists. Prior to any
demolition or construction, a registered project arborist must provide the City
with written certification of compliance with the tree protection plan. After
any demolition or construction, a registered project arborist must provide the
City a written inspection report regarding the effectiveness of the measures in
the tree protection plan.
   M.   Sandbags, silt screens, or any similar methods are required to be
installed on all projects during the rainy season (October - April) to prevent
dirt, mud, and debris from flowing into the storm drain system. This shall be
required only when the front yard landscaping is either removed or modified,
regardless whether such removal or modification was intended as part of the
construction project.
   N.   A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) shall be submitted to
the Planning and Building Department during the plan check process for all
projects which disturb one or more acres of soil or whose projects disturb less
than one acre but are part of a larger common plan of development that in total
disturbs one or more acres. Projects include soil excavation, soil grading or
other construction activities where soil may be displaced during weather events
or landscape water run-off. (Ord. 0-18-1337, 10-10-2018)
25.01.07: EXPEDITED ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATION PERMITTING:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide for expedited
processing of applications for electric vehicle charging stations in compliance
with Government Code section 65850.7.
   B.   Definitions: The following definitions shall apply for purposes of this
section:
    ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATION OR CHARGING STATION: Means any level of
electric vehicle supply equipment station that is designed and built in
compliance with article 625 of the California Electric Code, as it read on
January 1, 2016, and delivers electricity from a source outside of an electric
vehicle into a plug-in electric vehicle.
   ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION: Means a submission of an application utilizing email,
the internet, and/or facsimile transmission.
   SPECIFIC, ADVERSE IMPACT: Means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and
unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, and written public health
or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date an
application was deemed complete.
   C.   Expedited Review Process:
      1.   The building official shall adopt a checklist of all application
requirements for expedited building permits for electric vehicle charging
stations. The checklist shall substantially conform to the most current version
of the "Plug-In Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Permitting Checklist" found in
the "Zero-Emission Vehicles in California: Community Readiness Guidebook"
published by the Governor's Office of Planning and Research. The checklist,
application form, and any other documents required by the building official to
process an application shall be published on the City's website.
      2.   Anyone seeking to install an electric vehicle charging station at
any site within the City may apply to the building official for an expedited
nondiscretionary building permit.
      3.   An application for an expedited building permit for an electric
vehicle charging station and all associated documentation may be submitted to
the building official in person, by mail, or by electronic submission.
Electronic signatures may be used in lieu of wet signatures.
      4.   An application that, in the opinion of the building official,
satisfies the information requirements of the checklist adopted by the City
shall be deemed complete.
      5.   If an application for an expedited building permit is deemed
incomplete, the building official shall provide a written correction notice of
the deficiencies and the additional information required to complete the
application.
      6.   If the building official determines that an application for an
expedited building permit is complete, the building official shall process the
application. If the building official determines that the proposed charging
station meets all health and safety requirements of State and Federal law, and
would not have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety, the
application shall be approved and a building permit shall be issued.
      7.   If the building official finds, based on substantial evidence, that
a proposed charging station could have a specific, adverse impact upon the
public health or safety, the applicant must apply for an electric vehicle
charging station use permit in order to install the proposed charging station.
      8.   An application for an electric vehicle charging station use permit
shall be reviewed by the building official. The building official shall not
deny such an application without making written findings, based upon
substantial evidence in the record, that the proposed charging station would
have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety which could
not feasibly be satisfactorily mitigated or avoided. The written findings
required for rejection of an electric vehicle charging station use permit
application shall include the building official's basis for rejecting any
potentially feasible alternatives that could mitigate or prevent the alleged
adverse impact. Pursuant to Government Code section 65850.7, the building
official's review shall be limited to health and safety issues. Aesthetic
concerns, or other items not related to public health or safety shall not be
considered.
      9.   A decision of the building official made pursuant to subsections C1
through C8 of this section may be appealed to the Planning Commission. The
Planning Commission's review shall be subject to the same limitations as that
of the building official, and only health and safety issues may be considered.
      10.   Any condition imposed on an application for an expedited building
permit or electric vehicle charging station use permit shall be designed to
mitigate the specific, adverse impact upon health and safety at the lowest
possible cost.
   D.   No Requirement For Association Approval: Consistent with Government
Code section 65850.7, the building official shall not condition the approval
for any electric vehicle charging station permit on the approval of such a
system by a homeowners association, as that term is defined by Civil Code
section 4080. (Ord. 0-17-1329, 10-11-2017; amd. Ord. 0-18-1335, 4-11-2018)

normally dry land areas from: the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; or
mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as defined
herein and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of
normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and
deposited along the path of the current; or
   B.   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other
body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents
of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusual
and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in this
definition.
FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: The planning and building director, who is hereby
appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this article by granting or

damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds
fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
25.12.01 of this article, Section 4908 is added to the Fire Code to read as
follows:
   Section 4907.4 Clearance of Hazardous Vegetation from Structures and Roads
within the City of San Marino.
      4907.4.1 Statement of Legislative Intent and Purpose. It is the objective
of this section to promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare by
recognizing that there exists within the city of San Marino a potentially
hazardous fire situation created by grass, weeds, shrubs, and trees which are
in such condition and location as to provide a ready fuel supply to augment the
spread or intensity of fire. It is the intent of this section to provide
minimum standards to safeguard life, safety, property and the public welfare by
insuring that hazardous vegetation or refuse is removed and that all grass,
weeds, shrubs, and trees are properly maintained so as to not create a fire
hazard within the community, while maintaining sufficient vegetation for
aesthetic and soil erosion control purposes.
      It is the further intent that this section apply on a year-round basis to
insure the removal and/or proper maintenance of grass, weeds, shrubs, trees and
refuse in order to prevent the spread or intensity of fire within the
community. Of particular concern is the need to provide adequate defensible
space in the urban/wildland interface area of the city, referred to as the high
fire hazard severity zone. For purposes of this section, defensible space is
that space within 100 feet (30.480 m) of a building or structure that is
required for access by fire and other emergency personnel to defend the
building or structure from the threat of fire.
      4907.4.2 Prohibition. No person who has any ownership or possessory
interest in, or control of a parcel of land shall allow to exist thereon any
hazardous refuse or hazardous grass, weeds, shrubs, trees, or other vegetation,
which, by reason of proximity to a building or structure, constitutes a fire
hazard. For purposes of this section, hazardous grass, weeds, shrubs, trees, or
other vegetation are defined as grass, weeds, shrubs, trees, or other
vegetation which are in such condition and location, or by the unique
characteristics of a species, as to provide a ready fuel supply to augment the
spread or intensity of a fire.
      4907.4.3 Specific Requirements. In order to provide sufficient defensible
space, each person who has any ownership or possessory interest in, or control
of, a parcel of land shall:
         4907.4.3.1 General. Remove from the property all hazardous vegetation,
except as otherwise provided herein, if such vegetation is within 100 feet
(30.480 m) of a building, within ten (10) feet (3.048 m) of a combustible
fence, or within ten (10) feet (3.048 m) of any portion of any highway, street,
alley, or driveway improved or used for vehicular travel or other vehicular
purposes. Distances up to 200 feet (60.960 m) or greater from a building or
structure may be necessary as determined by the chief. This requirement does
not apply to the maintenance of trees, ornamental shrubbery or plants which are
used as ground cover, provided such are landscape materials that are properly
irrigated and maintained and do not provide a ready fuel supply to augment the
spread or intensity of a fire.
         4907.4.3.2 Adjacent To Building. Keep all trees, shrubs, and other
vegetation or portions thereof, adjacent to or overhanging any building or
structure free of dead limbs, branches, and other combustible matter.
         4907.4.3.3 Roof Clearance. Maintain 5 feet (1.524 m) of vertical
clearance between roof surfaces and portions of trees or shrubs overhanging any
building or structure.
         4907.4.3.4 Chimney Clearance. Remove any portion of a tree or shrub
which extends within 15 feet (4.572 m) of the outlet of a chimney or stovepipe.
         4907.4.3.5 Roof Surface. Maintain the roofs of all buildings or
structures free of leaves, needles, twigs, and other combustible matter.
         4907.4.3.6 Building Clearance--30 Feet. Maintain all hazardous grass,
weeds, and small shrubs within 30 feet (9.144 m) of any building or structure.
Hazardous vegetation must be maintained less than 3 inches (76 mm) high; cut
grass may be left on the slope to protect the soil if it lays down within 3
inches (76 mm) of the ground. Large native shrubs may be retained no closer
than an average of 18 feet (5.486 m) apart, provided the lower branches have
been trimmed a minimum of 3 feet (914 mm) above the ground, or at least thinned
to reduce the available fuel volume.
         4907.4.3.7 Roads. Maintain trees and shrubs within 10 feet of that
portion of any highway, street, alley, or driveway which is improved or used
for vehicle travel or other vehicular purposes (except for designated fire
roads), so that no leafy foliage, twigs, or branches are within six (6) feet
(1.828 m) of the ground (but no more than 1/3 of the crown).
         4907.4.3.8 Combustible Fences. Maintain all hazardous grass, weeds and
other vegetation located within 10 feet (3.048 m) of any combustible fence at a
height of not more than 3 inches (76 mm). This shall not require the removal of
trees, ornamental shrubbery or plants which are used as ground cover, provided
such do not provide a ready fuel supply to augment the spread or intensity of a
fire.
         4907.4.3.9 Building Clearance--100 Feet. Maintain all hazardous grass,
weeds, shrubs and trees within 100 feet (30.480 m) of any building or
structure. Grass and small shrubs may be retained on steep slopes to stabilize
the soil and prevent erosion, but may not exceed a height of 18 inches (457
mm). Large native specimen shrubs should be retained where possible, but no
closer than an average of 18 feet (5.486 m) apart. Remove all dead foliage,
twigs or branches, or live branches within 3 feet (914 mm) of the ground, from
mature trees and shrubs (but no more than 1/3 of the crown).
         4907.4.3.10 Cut Vegetation and Refuse. Remove and/or safely dispose of
all cut vegetation and hazardous refuse.
         4907.4.3.11 Soil Erosion Control. If the abatement of hazardous
vegetation results in the exposure of bare mineral soil, or the soil is exposed
to such an extent that increased soil erosion would be likely, or the chief or
his designee determines that the abatement has been excessive and poses a
threat to the public health, safety or welfare, irrigation and landscaping or a
suitable erosion control structure must be provided to establish effective soil
erosion control.
         4907.4.3.12 Minimum Requirements. Nothing contained in this section
shall be deemed to preclude the chief from requiring more than the minimum
specific requirements set forth above when the chief determines that conditions
exist which necessitate greater fire protection measures.
      4907.5 Notice. The council finds that grass, weeds, shrubs, trees, or
other vegetation prohibited under sec. 4908.3 increase the danger of fire and
thus constitute a public nuisance. If such condition exists, the San Marino
Fire Department shall give notice to the owner of record to abate the nuisance
within 30 days. The notice shall state that the owner is required to abate the
nuisance and that if the nuisance is not abated the city may take further
action which can include,
         (1)   the city, or its contractor, may enter upon the parcel of land
and remove or otherwise eliminate or abate the nuisance, (2) that upon
completion of such work the cost thereof, including administrative costs, shall
become a special assessment against that parcel, and (3) that upon council
confirmation of the assessment and recordation of that order, a lien shall
attach to the parcel to be collected on the next regular property tax bill
levied against the parcel.

interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:
   A.   To adopt a sales and use tax which complies with the requirements and
limitations contained in part 1.5 of division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code.
   B.   To adopt a sales and use tax which incorporates provisions identical to
those of the sales and use tax law of the State 1 insofar as those provisions
are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in part
1.5 of division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.
   C.   To adopt a sales and use tax which imposes a tax and provides a measure
therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of
Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and
requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the California State sales and use taxes.
   D.   To adopt a sales and use tax which can be administered in a manner that
will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of part 1.5 of
division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the burden of record
keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this Article.

26.01.04: CONTRACT WITH STATE:
Prior to the operative date, this City shall contract with the State Board of
Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and
operation of this sales and use tax; provided, that if this City shall not have
contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it
shall nevertheless so contract, and in such a case, the operative date shall be
the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a
contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following the
initial adoption of this Article. (1990 Revs.)
26.01.05: SALES TAX:
For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is
hereby imposed upon all retailers in the City at the rate stated in Section
26.01.02 of this Article of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of
all tangible personal property sold at retail in this City on and after the
operative date. (1990 Revs.)
26.01.06: PLACE OF SALE:
For the purpose of this Article, all retail sales are consummated at the place
of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is
delivered by the retailer or his/her agent to an out-of-state destination or to
a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross
receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are
subject to the State sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which
delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in
the State or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which
the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and
regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.
(1990 Revs.)

An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other consumption in
this City of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and

In adopting the provisions of part 1 of division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation

of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the State Board of Control, the
State Board of Equalization, the State Treasury or the Constitution of the

substitution would require action to be taken by or against the City or any
agency thereof rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization in
performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this
Article. The substitution shall not be made in those sections, including but
not necessarily limited to sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the
State of California, where the result of the substitution would be to provide
an exception from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other
consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt
from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain
subject to the tax by the State under the provisions of part 1 of division 2 of
the Revenue and Taxation Code or to impose this tax with respect to certain
sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which
would not be subject to tax by the State under the said provisions of that
Code. The substitutions shall not be made in sections 6701, 6702 (except in the
last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and

carriers of persons or property under the authority of the laws of this State,
the United States or any foreign government.

and Taxation Code or which repeals and reenacts section 7202 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code to provide an exemption from City sales and use taxes for

tax administrator that the service user has previously paid the same tax in
another state or city on such telecommunication services, shall be allowed a

forth such facts as the tax administrator may by regulations prescribe, is
furnished to the person receiving such payment. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015,

this article. If the billing address of the service user is different from the
service address, the service address of the service user shall be used for
purposes of imposing the tax.

suppliers, which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this
article, an administrative ruling identifying those video services, or charges
therefor, that are subject to or not subject to the tax of subsection A of this
section.
   E.   The tax imposed by this section shall be collected from the service
user by the video service supplier, its billing agent, or a reseller of such
services. In the case of video service, the service user shall be deemed to be
the purchaser of the bulk video service (e.g., an apartment owner), unless such
service is resold to individual users, in which case the service user shall be
the ultimate purchaser of the video service. The amount of tax collected in one
month shall be remitted to the tax administrator, and must be received by the
tax administrator on or before the twentieth day of the following month. (Ord.

   A.   Any service user subject to the tax imposed by section 26.03.06 or
26.03.07 of this article, which produces gas or electricity for self-use; which
receives gas or electricity, including any related supplemental services,
directly from a nonutility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this
article; or which, for any other reason, is not having the full tax collected
and remitted by its service supplier, a nonutility service supplier, or its
billing agent on the use of gas or electricity in the city, including any
related supplemental services, shall report said fact to the tax administrator
and shall remit the tax due directly to the tax administrator within thirty
(30) days of such use. In lieu of paying said actual tax, the service user may,
at its option, remit to the tax administrator within thirty (30) days for such
use an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous
month, or upon the payment pattern of similar customers of the service supplier
using similar amounts of gas or electricity, provided that the service user
shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within
sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the
tax administrator, may be applied against any subsequent tax bill that becomes
due.
   B.   The tax administrator may require said service user to identify its
nonutility service supplier and provide, subject to audit, invoices, books of
account, or other satisfactory evidence documenting the quantity of gas or
electricity used, including any related supplemental services, and the cost or
price thereof. If the service user is unable to provide such satisfactory
evidence, or, if the administrative cost of calculating the tax in the opinion
of the tax administrator is excessive, the tax administrator may determine the
tax by applying the tax rate to the equivalent charges the service user would
have incurred if the gas or electricity used, including any related
supplemental services, had been provided by the service supplier that is the
primary supplier of gas or electricity within the city. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-
2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.09: WATER USER TAX:
   A.   There is imposed a tax upon every person using water in the city which
is transported and delivered through a pipeline distribution system. The tax
imposed by this section shall be at the rate of five percent (5%) of the
charges made for such water.
   B.   As used in this section, the term "charges" shall apply to all
services, components and items that are: 1) necessary for or common to the
receipt, use or enjoyment of water service; or 2) currently are or historically
have been included in a single or bundled rate for water service by a local
distribution company to a class of retail customers. The term "charges" shall
include, but is not limited to, the following charges: water commodity charges
(potable and nonpotable); distribution or transmission charges; metering
charges; customer charges; fire protection services; late charges; service
establishment or reestablishment charges; franchise fees; franchise surcharges;
annual and monthly charges; and other charges, fees and surcharges which are
necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of water service; and,
charges, fees, or surcharges for water services or programs, which are mandated
by a water district or a state or federal agency, whether or not such charges,
fees, or surcharges appear on a bundled or line item basis on the customer
billing, or whether they are imposed on the service provider or the customer.
   C.   As used in this section, the term "charges" shall include the value of
any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other
consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the water services.
   D.   The tax administrator, from time to time, may survey the water service
suppliers in the city to identify the various unbundled billing components of
water retail service that they commonly provide to residential and commercial/
industrial customers in the city, and the charges therefor, including those
items that are mandated by a water district or a state or federal agency as a
condition of providing such water service. The tax administrator, thereafter,
may issue and disseminate to such water service suppliers an administrative
ruling identifying those components and items which are: 1) necessary for or
common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of water service; or 2) currently are
or historically have been included in a single or bundled rate for water
service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. Charges
for such components and items shall be subject to the tax of subsection A of
this section.
   E.   There shall be excluded from the base on which the tax imposed in this
section is computed charges made for water which is to be resold and delivered
through a pipeline distribution system.
   F.   The tax on water service imposed by this section shall be collected
from the service user by the water service supplier or its billing agent. The
amount of tax collected in one month shall be remitted to the tax
administrator, and must be received by the tax administrator on or before the
twentieth day of the following month. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-
2017)
26.03.10: EFFECT OF COMMINGLING TAXABLE ITEMS WITH NONTAXABLE ITEMS:
If any nontaxable charges are combined with and not separately stated from
taxable service charges on the customer bill or invoice of a service supplier,
the combined charge is subject to tax unless the service supplier identifies,
by reasonable and verifiable standards, the portions of the combined charge
that are nontaxable and taxable through the service supplier's books and
records kept in the regular course of business, and in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and not created and maintained for
tax purposes. If the service supplier offers a combination of taxable and
nontaxable services, and the charges are separately stated, then for taxation
purposes, the values assigned the taxable and nontaxable services shall be
based on its books and records kept in the regular course of business and in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not created and
maintained for tax purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving the
proper valuation and apportionment of taxable and nontaxable charges. (Ord. 0-
15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.11: SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS/MINIMUM CONTACTS:
For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and remit a
tax under this article, "substantial nexus", "substantial economic presence",
and "minimum contacts" shall be construed broadly in favor of the imposition,
collection and/or remittance of the utility user tax to the fullest extent
permitted by state and federal law, and as it may change from time to time by
judicial interpretation or by statutory enactment. Any telecommunication
service (including VoIP) used by a person with a service address in the city,
which service is capable of terminating a call to another person on the general
telephone network, shall be subject to a rebuttable presumption that
"substantial nexus/minimum contacts" exists for purposes of imposing a tax, or
establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax, under this article. A service
supplier shall be deemed to have sufficient activity in the city for tax
collection and remittance purposes if its activities include, but are not
limited to, any of the following: maintains or has within the city, directly or
through an agent, affiliate or subsidiary, a place of business of any nature;
solicits business in the city by employees, independent contractors, resellers,
agents, affiliates or other representatives; solicits business in the city on a
continuous, regular, seasonal or systematic basis by means of advertising that
is broadcast or relayed from a transmitter with the city or distributed from a
location with the city; or advertises in newspapers or other periodicals
printed and published within the city or through materials distributed in the
city by means other than the United States mail; or if there are activities
performed in the city on behalf of the service supplier that are significantly
associated with the service supplier's ability to establish and maintain a
market in the city for the provision of utility services that are subject to a
tax under this article (e.g., an affiliated person engaging in activities in
the city that inure to the benefit of the service supplier in its development
or maintenance of a market for its services in the city). (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-
3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.12: DUTY TO COLLECT; PROCEDURES:
   A.   Collection By Service Suppliers: The duty of service suppliers to
collect and remit the taxes imposed by the provisions of this article shall be
performed as follows:
      1.   The tax shall be collected by service suppliers insofar as
practicable at the same time as, and along with, the collection of the charges
made in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier.
Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the
full amount of the charge and tax that was accrued for the billing period, a
proportionate share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been
paid. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of
refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges, section 26.03.15 of this
article shall apply.
      2.   The duty of a service supplier to collect the tax from a service
user shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period
applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such
regular billing are subject to the provisions of this article. Where a person
receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than
another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period.
   B.   Filing Return And Payment: Each person required by this article to
remit a tax shall file a return to the tax administrator, on forms approved by
the tax administrator, on or before the due date. The full amount of the tax
collected shall be included with the return and filed with the tax
administrator. The tax administrator is authorized to require such additional
information as he or she deems necessary to determine if the tax is being
levied, collected, and remitted in accordance with this article. Returns are
due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. Pursuant to Revenue
And Taxation Code section 7284.6, the tax administrator, and its agents, shall
maintain such filing returns as confidential information that is exempt from
the disclosure provisions of the public records act. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-
2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.13: COLLECTION PENALTIES; SERVICE SUPPLIERS OR SELF- COLLECTORS:
   A.   Taxes collected from a service user, or owed by a service user subject
to section 26.03.08 of this article, are delinquent if not received by the tax
administrator on or before the due date. Should the due date occur on a weekend
or legal holiday, the return must be received by the tax administrator on the
first regular working day following the weekend or legal holiday. A direct
deposit, including electronic fund transfers and other similar methods of
electronically exchanging monies between financial accounts, made by a service
supplier in satisfaction of its obligations under this section shall be
considered timely if the transfer is initiated on or before the due date, and
the transfer settles into the city's account on the following business day.
   B.   If the person required to collect and/or remit the utility users tax
fails to collect the tax (by failing to properly assess the tax on 1 or more
services or charges on the customer's billing) or fails to remit the tax
collected on or before the due date, or, in the case of a service user that
fails to properly self-collect and remit the tax under section 26.03.08 of this
article on or before the due date, the tax administrator shall attach a penalty
for such delinquencies or deficiencies at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of
the total tax that is delinquent or deficient in the remittance, and shall pay
interest at the rate of seventy five hundredths percent (0.75%) per month, or
any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from
the date on which the remittance first become delinquent, until paid.
   C.   The tax administrator shall have the power to impose additional
penalties upon persons required to collect and remit taxes pursuant to the
provisions of this article for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or
remitting at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the tax
collected and/or required to be remitted, or as recomputed by the tax
administrator.
   D.   For collection purposes only, every penalty imposed and such interest
that is accrued under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the
tax herein required to be paid.
   E.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the tax administrator may, in his or her
discretion, modify the due dates and/or penalty and interest provisions of this
section to be consistent with any uniform standards or procedures that are
mutually agreed upon by UUT public agencies, or otherwise legally established,
to create a UUT central payment location or mechanism. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-
2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.14: DEFICIENCY DETERMINATION AND ASSESSMENT; TAX APPLICATION ERRORS:
   A.   The tax administrator shall make a deficiency determination if he or
she determines that any person required to pay or collect taxes pursuant to the
provisions of this article has failed to pay, collect, and/or remit the proper
amount of tax by improperly or failing to apply the tax to one or more taxable
services or charges. Nothing herein shall require that the tax administrator
institute proceedings under this section if, in the opinion of the tax
administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement likely outweighs the tax
benefit.
   B.   The tax administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency
determination to the person required to pay or remit the tax, which notice
shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus interest at the rate
of seventy five one-hundredths percent (0.75%) per month, or any fraction
thereof, on the amount of the tax from the date on which the tax should have
been received by the city. Within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of
service of such notice, the person may request in writing to the tax
administrator for a hearing on the matter.
   C.   If the person fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time
period, the amount of the deficiency determination shall become a final
assessment, and shall immediately be due and owing to the city. If the person
requests a hearing, the tax administrator shall cause the matter to be set for
hearing, which shall be scheduled within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
written request for hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall
be mailed by the tax administrator to such person at least ten (10) calendar
days prior to the hearing, and, if the tax administrator desires said person to
produce specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records
requested to be produced.
   D.   At the time fixed for the hearing, the tax administrator shall hear all
relevant testimony and evidence, including that of any other interested
parties. At the discretion of the tax administrator, the hearing may be
continued from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of
additional evidence. Within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the
hearing, the tax administrator shall issue a final assessment (or
nonassessment), thereafter, by confirming, modifying or rejecting the original
deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such final assessment to
person owing the tax. The decision of the tax administrator may be appealed
pursuant to section 26.03.20 of this article. Filing an application with the
tax administrator and appeal to the city manager, or designee, pursuant to
section 26.03.20 of this article is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.
   E.   Payment of the final assessment shall become delinquent if not received
by the tax administrator on or before the thirtieth day following the date of
receipt of the notice of final assessment. The penalty for delinquency shall be
fifteen percent (15%) on the total amount of the assessment, along with
interest at the rate of seventy five one-hundredths percent (0.75%) per month,
or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from
the date of delinquency, until paid. The applicable statute of limitations
regarding a claim by the city seeking payment of a tax assessed under this
article shall commence from the date of delinquency as provided in this
subsection.
   F.   All notices under this article may be sent by regular mail, postage
prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the third calendar day following the
date of mailing, as established by a proof of mailing. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-
2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.15: ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY; NONPAYING SERVICE USERS:
   A.   Whenever the tax administrator determines that a service user has
deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the
amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or whenever the tax
administrator deems it in the best interest of the city, he or she may relieve
such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this section from
certain named service users for specific billing periods. Whenever the service
user has failed to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two (2) or more
billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation to
collect taxes due. The service supplier shall provide the city with the names
and addresses of such service users and the amounts of taxes owed under the
provisions of this section. Nothing herein shall require that the tax
administrator institute proceedings under this section if, in the opinion of
the tax administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement likely outweighs
the tax benefit.
   B.   In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency
penalty at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the total tax that is owed, and
shall pay interest at the rate of three-fourths of one percent (3/4%) per
month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of
penalties, from the due date, until paid.
   C.   The tax administrator shall notify the nonpaying service user that the
tax administrator has assumed the responsibility to collect the taxes due for
the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes, including penalties and
interest. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal delivery
or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the
person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have a change
of address, to his or her last known address.
   D.   If the service user fails to remit the tax to the tax administrator
within thirty (30) days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or
her, the tax administrator may impose an additional penalty of fifteen percent
(15%) of the amount of the total tax that is owed. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015,
eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.16: ACTIONS TO COLLECT:
Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this
article shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the city. Any such
tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the tax
administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the city by the person required to
collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person
owing money to the city under the provisions of this article shall be liable to
an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount,
including penalties and interest as provided for in this article, along with
any collection costs incurred by the city as a result of the person's
noncompliance with this article, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorney fees. In the event that a service user or service supplier owing a tax
under this article files bankruptcy, then such debt to the city shall be deemed
an unsecured priority excise tax obligation under 11 USCA section 507(a)(8)(C).
Service suppliers who seek to collect charges for service in bankruptcy
proceedings shall also include in any such claim the amount of taxes due the
city for those services, unless the tax administrator determines that such duty
is in conflict with any federal or state law, rule, or regulation or that such
action would be administratively impractical. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff.
4-1-2017)
26.03.17: ADDITIONAL POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR:
   A.   The tax administrator shall have the power and duty, and is hereby
directed, to enforce each and all of the provisions of this article.
   B.   The tax administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations
consistent with provisions of this article for the purpose of interpreting,
clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance
of the taxes herein imposed. The administrative ruling shall not impose a new
tax, revise an existing tax methodology as stated in this article, or increase
an existing tax, except as allowed by California Government Code section 53750
(h)(2). A copy of such administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in
the tax administrator's office. To the extent that the tax administrator
determines that the tax imposed under this article shall not be collected in
full for any period of time from any particular service supplier or service
user, that determination shall be considered an exercise of the tax
administrator's discretion to settle disputes and shall not constitute a change
in taxing methodology for purposes of Government Code section 53750 or
otherwise. The tax administrator is not authorized to amend the city's
methodology for purposes of Government Code section 53750 and the city does not
waive or abrogate its ability to impose the utility users tax in full as a
result of promulgating administrative rulings or entering into agreements.
   C.   Upon a proper showing of good cause, the tax administrator may make
administrative agreements, with appropriate conditions, to vary from the strict
requirements of this article and thereby: 1) conform to the billing procedures
of a particular service supplier (or service user subject to section 26.03.08
of this article) so long as said agreements result in the collection of the tax
in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this article; or 2) to
avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection and remittance
greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such agreement shall be on
file in the tax administrator's office, and are voidable by the tax
administrator or the city at any time.
   D.   The tax administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper compliance
with the requirements of this article, of any person required to collect and/or
remit a tax pursuant to this article. The tax administrator shall notify said
person of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the absence of fraud or
other intentional misconduct, the audit period or review shall not exceed a
period of three (3) years next preceding the date of receipt of the written
notice by said person from the tax administrator. Upon completion of the audit,
the tax administrator may make a deficiency determination pursuant to section
26.03.14 of this article for all taxes (and applicable penalties and interest)
owed and not paid, as evidenced by information provided by such person to the
tax administrator. If said person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient
records to enable the tax administrator to verify compliance with this article,
the tax administrator is authorized to make a reasonable estimate of the
deficiency. Said reasonable estimate shall be entitled to be a rebuttable
presumption of correctness.
   E.   Upon receipt of a written request of a taxpayer, and for good cause,
the tax administrator may extend the time for filing any statement required
pursuant to this article for a period of not to exceed forty five (45) days,
provided that the time for filing the required statement has not already passed
when the request is received. No penalty for delinquent payment shall accrue by
reason of such extension. Interest shall accrue during said extension at the
rate of three- fourths of one percent (3/4%) per month, prorated for any
portion thereof.
   F.   The tax administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person who
asserts a right to exemption from, or a refund of, the tax imposed by this
article.
   G.   The tax administrator, with the written approval of the city manager,
may compromise a claim pursuant to this article where the portion of the claim
proposed to be released is equal to or less than four thousand nine hundred
ninety nine dollars ($4,999.00); and, with the approval of the city attorney
and the city council, may compromise such a claim where the portion proposed to
be released is greater than four thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars
($4,999.00).
   H.   Notwithstanding any provision in this article to the contrary, the tax
administrator may waive any penalty or interest imposed upon a person required
to collect and/or remit for failure to collect the tax imposed by this article
if the noncollection occurred in good faith. In determining whether the
noncollection was in good faith, the tax administrator shall take into
consideration the uniqueness of the product or service, industry practice or
other precedence, or whether the person offers to voluntarily disclose its tax
liability. The tax administrator may also participate with other utility users
tax public agencies in conducting coordinated compliance reviews with the goal
of achieving administrative efficiency and uniform tax application
determinations, where possible. To encourage voluntary full disclosure and
ongoing cooperation on tax collection and remittance, the tax administrator,
and its agents, may enter into agreements with the tax collecting service
providers and grant prospective only effect on any changes regarding the
taxation of services or charges that were previously deemed by the service
provider, in good faith and without gross negligence, to be nontaxable. In
determining whether the noncollection was in good faith and without gross
negligence, the tax administrator shall take into consideration the uniqueness
of the product or service, industry practice or other precedence, and whether
the disclosure was voluntarily made by the service provider or its agent. (Ord.
0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.18: RECORDS:
   A.   It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and/or remit
to the city any tax imposed by this article to keep and preserve, for a period
of at least three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the
amount of such tax that such person may have been liable for the collection of
and remittance to the tax administrator, which records the tax administrator
shall have the right to inspect at a reasonable time.
   B.   The tax administrator may issue an administrative subpoena to compel a
person to deliver, to the tax administrator, copies of all records deemed
necessary by the tax administrator to establish compliance with this article,
including the delivery of records in a common electronic format on readily
available media if such records are kept electronically by the person in the
usual and ordinary course of business. As an alternative to delivering the
subpoenaed records to the tax administrator on or before the due date provided
in the administrative subpoena, such person may provide access to such records
outside the city on or before the due date, provided that such person shall
reimburse the city for all reasonable travel expenses incurred by the city to
inspect those records, including travel, lodging, meals, and other similar
expenses, but excluding the normal salary or hourly wages of those persons
designated by the city to conduct the inspection.
   C.   The tax administrator is authorized to execute a nondisclosure
agreement approved by the city attorney to protect the confidentiality of
customer information pursuant to California Revenue And Taxation Code sections
7284.6 and 7284.7. The tax administrator may request from a person providing
transportation or distribution services of gas or electricity to service users
within the city, a list of the names, billing and service addresses, quantities
of gas or electricity delivered, and other pertinent information, of its
transportation customers within the city pursuant to section 6354(e) of the
California Public Utilities Code.
   D.   If a service supplier uses a billing agent or billing aggregator to
bill, collect, and/or remit the tax, the service supplier shall: 1) provide to
the tax administrator the name, address and telephone number of each billing
agent and billing aggregator currently authorized by the service supplier to
bill, collect, and/or remit the tax to the city; and 2) upon request of the tax
administrator, deliver, or effect the delivery of, any information or records
in the possession of such billing agent or billing aggregator that, in the
opinion of the tax administrator, is necessary to verify the proper
application, calculation, collection and/or remittance of such tax to the city.
   E.   If any person subject to recordkeeping under this article unreasonably
denies the tax administrator, or the tax administrator's designated
representative, access to such records, or fails to produce the information
requested in an administrative subpoena within the time specified, the tax
administrator may impose a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) on such
person for each day following: 1) the initial date that the person refuses to
provide such access; or 2) the due date for production of records as set forth
in the administrative subpoena. This penalty shall be in addition to any other
penalty imposed under this article. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.19: REFUNDS/CREDITS:
Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more than once or has
been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the tax administrator
under this article, it may be refunded or credited as provided in this section:
   A.   The tax administrator may refund any tax that has been overpaid or paid
more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by
the tax administrator under this article, provided that no refund shall be paid
under the provisions of this section unless the claimant or his or her
guardian, conservator, executor, or administrator has submitted a written claim
to the tax administrator within one year of the overpayment or erroneous or
illegal collection of said tax. Such claim must clearly establish claimant's
right to the refund by written records showing entitlement thereto.
   B.   Notwithstanding the notice provisions of subsection A of this section,
the tax administrator may, at his or her discretion, give written permission to
a service supplier, who has collected and remitted any amount of tax in excess
of the amount of tax imposed by this article, to claim credit for such
overpayment against the amount of tax which is due the city upon a subsequent
monthly return(s) to the tax administrator, provided that, prior to taking such
credit by the service supplier: 1) such credit is claimed in a return dated no
later than one year from the date of overpayment or erroneous collection of
said tax; 2) the tax administrator is satisfied that the underlying basis and
amount of such credit has been reasonably established; and 3) in the case of an
overpayment by a service user to the service supplier that has been remitted to
the city, the tax administrator has received proof, to his or her satisfaction,
that the overpayment has been refunded by the service supplier to the service
user in an amount equal to the requested credit. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015,
eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.20: APPEALS:
   A.   The provisions of this section apply to any decision (other than a
decision relating to a refund pursuant to section 26.03.19 of this article),
deficiency determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of the tax
administrator. Any person aggrieved by any decision (other than a decision
relating to a refund pursuant to section 26.03.19 of this article), deficiency
determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of the tax administrator,
shall be required to comply with the appeals procedure of this section.
Compliance with this section shall be a prerequisite to a suit thereon 1 . To
the extent allowed by law, nothing herein shall permit the filing of a claim or
action on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers.
   B.   If any person is aggrieved by any decision (other than a decision
relating to a refund pursuant to section 26.03.19 of this article), deficiency
determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of the tax administrator;
he or she may appeal to the city manager by filing a notice of appeal with the
city clerk within fourteen (14) days of the date of the decision, deficiency

   D.   Franchise Territory: A franchise is effective within the territorial
limits of the city, and within any area added to the city during the term of
the franchise, unless otherwise specified in the ordinance or resolution
granting the franchise or in the franchise agreement.
   E.   Federal Or State Jurisdiction: This division will be construed in a
manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws, and it applies to
all franchises granted or renewed after the effective date of this article, to
the extent authorized by applicable law.
   F.   Franchise Nontransferable:
      1.   Grantee may not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, or dispose
of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary
sale, contract, consolidation, or otherwise, the franchise or any of the rights
or privileges therein granted, without the prior written consent of the city
council and then only upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by
the city council, which consent may not be unreasonably denied or delayed. Any
attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign, or otherwise dispose of the franchise
without the written consent of the city council is null and void. The granting
of a security interest in any assets of the grantee, or any mortgage or other
hypothecation, will not be deemed a transfer for the purposes of this
subsection.
      2.   The requirements of subsection F1 of this section apply to any
change in control of grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited
to the ownership of major stockholder or partnership interests, but includes
actual working control in whatever manner exercised. If grantee is a
partnership or a corporation, prior authorization of the city council is
required where ownership or control of twenty five percent (25%) or more of the
partnership interests or of the voting stock of grantee, or any company in the
tier of companies controlling the grantee, whether directly or indirectly, is
acquired by a person or a group of persons acting in concert, none of whom,
singularly or collectively, owns or controls those partnership interests or
that voting stock of the grantee, or grantee's upper tier of controlling
companies, as of the effective date of the franchise.
      3.   Grantee must notify the city in writing of any foreclosure or
judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the grantee's franchise property,
or upon the termination of any lease or other interest covering all or a
substantial part of that franchise property. That notification will be
considered by the city as notice that a change in control of ownership of the
franchise has taken place, and the provisions of this subsection F3 that
require the prior written consent of the city council to that change in control
of ownership will apply.
      4.   For the purpose of determining whether it will consent to an
acquisition, transfer, or change in control, the city may inquire as to the
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and grantee
must assist the city in that inquiry. In seeking the city's consent to any
change of ownership or control, grantee or the proposed transferee, or both,
must complete federal communications commission form 394 or its equivalent.
This application must be submitted to the city not less than one hundred twenty
(120) days prior to the proposed date of transfer. The transferee must
establish that it possesses the legal, financial, and technical capability to
operate and maintain the cable system and to comply with all franchise
requirements during the remaining term of the franchise. If the legal,
financial, and technical qualifications of the proposed transferee are
determined to be satisfactory, then the city will consent to the transfer of
the franchise.
      5.   Any financial institution holding a pledge of the grantee's assets
to secure the advance of money for the construction or operation of the
franchise property has the right to notify the city that it, or a designee
satisfactory to the city, will take control of and operate the cable television
system upon grantee's default in its financial obligations. Further, that
financial institution must also submit a plan for such operation within ninety
(90) days after assuming control. The plan must ensure continued service and
compliance with all franchise requirements during the period that the financial
institution will exercise control over the system. The financial institution
may not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding eighteen (18)
months unless authorized by the city, in its sole discretion, and during that
period of time it will have the right to petition the city to transfer the
franchise to another grantee.
      6.   Grantee must reimburse the city for the city's reasonable review and
processing expenses incurred in connection with any transfer or change in
control of the franchise. These expenses may include, without limitation, costs
of administrative review, financial, legal, and technical evaluation of the
proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all
costs incurred by these experts), notice and publication costs, and document
preparation expenses. The total amount of these reimbursable expenses may be
subject to maximum limits that are specified in the franchise agreement between
the city and the grantee. No reimbursement may be offset against any franchise
fee payable to the city during the term of the franchise.
   G.   Geographical Coverage:
      1.   Unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement, grantee must
design, construct, and maintain the cable television system to have the
capability to pass every dwelling unit and commercial building in the franchise
service area, subject to any service area line extension requirements or
territorial restrictions set forth in the franchise agreement.
      2.   After service has been established within all or any part of the
franchise service area by activating trunk or distribution cables, grantee must
provide service to any requesting subscriber within that activated part of the
service area within seven (7) days from the date of request, provided that the
grantee is able to secure on reasonable terms and conditions all rights of way
necessary to extend service to that subscriber within that seven (7) day
period.
   H.   Nonexclusive Franchise: Every franchise granted is nonexclusive. The
city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional
franchises for a cable television system that it deems appropriate, subject to
applicable state and federal law. If an additional franchise is proposed to be
granted to a subsequent grantee, a noticed public hearing must first be held if
required by the provisions of Government Code section 53066.3.
   I.   Multiple Franchises:
      1.   The city may grant any number of franchises, subject to applicable
state and federal law. The city may limit the number of franchises granted,
based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law
and the following specific local considerations:
         a.   The capacity of the public rights of way to accommodate multiple
cables in addition to the cables, conduits, and pipes of the existing utility
systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas, and sewerage.
         b.   The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result of cable
system competition, such as lower rates and improved service.
         c.   The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition,
such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and the
disruption arising from numerous excavations within the public rights of way.
      2.   The city may require that any new grantee be responsible for its own
underground trenching and the associated costs if, in the city's opinion, the
rights of way in any particular area cannot reasonably accommodate additional
cables. (Ord. 0-01-1150, 5-9-2001)

   B.   The agreement between the city and the open video system operator may
contain provisions that relate to the following subject matters, to the extent
that such provisions and subject matters are not preempted by federal law or
regulations:
      1.   The nature, scope, and duration of the agreement, including
provisions for its renewal or extension.
      2.   The obligation of the open video system operator to pay to the city,
at specified times and in lieu of the franchise fees permitted under section
622 of the communications act, fees on the gross revenue received by the
operator, as authorized by 47 CFR 76.1511, in accordance with the following
standards and procedures:
         a.   The amount of the fees on the gross revenue will be the maximum
amount authorized by section 653(c)(2)(B) of the communications act, which is
the rate imposed by the city on the existing franchised cable operator.
         b.   The term "gross revenue" has the meaning set forth in 47 CFR
76.1511, and includes: 1) all gross revenue received by an open video system
operator or its affiliates, including all revenue received from subscribers and
all carriage revenue received from unaffiliated video programming providers;
and 2) all advertising revenue received by the operator or its affiliates in
connection with the provision of video programming, where such revenue is
included in the calculation of the cable franchise fee paid to the city by the
franchised cable operator. The term "gross revenue" does not include revenue,
such as subscriber or advertising revenue, collected by unaffiliated video
programming providers.
      3.   The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with
requirements relating to information collection and record keeping, accounting
procedures, reporting, periodic audits, and inspection of records in order to
ensure the accuracy of the fees on the gross revenue that are required to be
paid as specified in subsection B2 of this section.
      4.   The obligation of the open video system operator to meet the city's
requirements with respect to public, educational, and governmental access
channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment, as provided for in 47
CFR 76.1505. In this regard, the following standards and procedures are
applicable:
         a.   The open video system operator is subject to the same public,
educational, and governmental access requirements that apply within the cable
television franchise service area with which its system overlaps.
         b.   The open video system operator must ensure that all subscribers
receive all public, educational, and governmental access channels within the
franchise service area in which the city's subscribers are located.
         c.   The open video system operator may negotiate with the city to
establish the operator's obligations with respect to public, educational, and
governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment.
These negotiations may include the city's franchised cable operator if the
city, the open video system operator, and the franchised cable operator so
desire.
         d.   If the open video system operator and the city are unable to
reach an agreement regarding the operator's obligations with respect to public,
educational, and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities,
and equipment within the city's jurisdiction, then the following obligations
will be imposed:
            (1)   The open video system operator must satisfy the same public,
educational, and governmental access obligations as the city's franchised cable
operator by providing the same amount of channel capacity for public,
educational, and governmental access and by matching the city's franchised
cable operator's annual financial contributions in support of public,
educational, and governmental access services, facilities, and equipment that
are actually used by the city. For in kind contributions, such as cameras or
production studios, the open video system operator may satisfy its statutory
obligation by negotiating mutually agreeable terms with the city's franchised
cable operator, so that public, educational, and governmental access services
to the city are improved or increased. If such terms cannot be agreed upon, the
open video system operator must pay to the city the monetary equivalent of the
franchised cable operator's depreciated in kind contribution, or, in the case
of facilities, the annual amortization value. Any matching contributions
provided by the open video system operator must be used to fund activities
arising under section 611 of the communications act.
            (2)   The city will impose upon the open video system operator the
same rules and procedures that it imposes upon the franchised cable operator
with regard to the open video system operator's use of channel capacity
designated for public, educational, and governmental access use when that
capacity is not being used for such purposes.
         e.   The city's franchised cable operator is required under federal
law to permit the open video system operator to connect with its public,
educational, and governmental access channel feeds. The open video system
operator and the franchised cable operator may decide how to accomplish this
connection, taking into consideration the physical and technical
characteristics of the cable and the open video systems involved. If the
franchised cable operator and the open video system operator cannot agree on
how to accomplish the connection, the city has the right to decide. The city
may require that the connection occur on city owned property or on public
rights of way.
         f.   All costs of connection to the franchised cable operator's
public, educational, and governmental access channel feed must be borne by the
open video system operator. These costs will be counted towards the open video
system operator's matching financial contributions set forth in subsection B4d
(1) of this section.
         g.   The city will not impose upon the open video system operator any
public, educational, or governmental access obligations that are greater than
those imposed upon the franchised cable operator.
         h.   If there is no existing franchised cable operator, the provisions
of 47 CFR 76.1505(d)(6) will be applicable in determining the obligations of
the open video system operator.
            (1)   The open video system operator must adjust its system to
comply with new public, educational, and access obligations imposed on the
city's franchised cable operator following a renewal of the cable television
franchise; provided, however, that the open video system operator will not be
required to displace other programmers using its open video system to
accommodate public, educational, and governmental access channels. The open
video system operator must comply with such new public, educational, and
governmental access obligations whenever additional capacity is or becomes
available, whether it is due to increased channel capacity or to decreased
demand for channel capacity.
      5.   If the city and the open video system operator cannot agree on the
application of the FCC's rules regarding the open video system operator's
obligations to provide public, educational, and governmental access under the
provisions of subsection B4 of this section, then either party may file a
complaint with the FCC in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set
forth in 47 CFR 76.1514. No agreement will be executed by the city until the
dispute has been finally resolved.
      6.   If the open video system operator intends to maintain an
institutional network, as defined in section 611(f) of the communications act,
the city will require that educational and governmental access channels be
designated on that institutional network to the same extent that those channels
are designated on the institutional network of the city's franchised cable
operator.
      7.   The authority of an open video system operator to exercise editorial
control over any public, educational, or governmental use of channel capacity
will be restricted in accordance with the provisions of 47 CFR 76.1505(f).
      8.   The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with all
applicable federal, state, and local statutes, ordinances, and regulations
relating to customer service standards, including the cable television and
video customer service and information act (Government Code section 53054 et
seq.), the video customer service act (Government Code section 53088 et seq.),
and section 27.03.08 of this article.
      9.   If new physical plant is proposed to be constructed within the city,
the obligation of the open video system operator to comply with the following
rights of way use and management responsibilities that are also imposed by the
city upon other cable television and telecommunications service providers in a
nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner:
         a.   Compliance with all applicable city codes, including applications
for excavation, encroachment, and construction permits and the payment of all
required permit and inspection fees.
         b.   The coordination of construction activities.
         c.   Compliance with established standards and procedures for
constructing lines across private property.
         d.   Compliance with all applicable insurance and indemnification
requirements.
         e.   The repair and resurfacing of construction damaged streets.
         f.   Compliance with all public safety requirements that are
applicable to cable television and telecommunications service providers using
public property or public rights of way.
      10.   Acts or omissions constituting breaches or defaults of the
agreement, and the applicable penalties, liquidated damages, and other
remedies, including fines or the suspension, revocation, or termination of the
agreement.
      11.   Requirements relating to the sale, assignment, or transfer of the
open video system.
      12.   Requirements relating to the open video system operator's
compliance with and implementation of state and federal laws, rules, and
regulations pertaining to the operation of the open video system.
      13.   Such additional requirements, conditions, terms, policies, and
procedures as may be mutually agreed upon by the city and the open video system
operator and that will, in the judgment of the city council, best serve the
public interest and protect the public health, welfare, and safety. (Ord. 0-01-
1150, 5-9-2001)
DIVISION 4. OTHER VIDEO AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND SYSTEMS
27.03.13: OTHER MULTICHANNEL VIDEO PROGRAMMING DISTRIBUTORS:
The term "cable system", as defined in federal law and as set forth in section
27.03.17 of this article, does not include a facility that serves subscribers
without using any public rights of way. Consequently, the categories of
multichannel video programming identified below are not deemed to be "cable
systems" and are therefore exempt from the city's franchise requirements and
from certain other local regulatory provisions authorized by federal law,
provided that their distribution or transmission facilities do not involve the
use of the city's public rights of way.
   A.   Multichannel multipoint distribution service ("MMDS"), also known as
"wireless cable", which typically involves the transmission by an FCC licensed
operator of numerous broadcast stations from a central location using line of
sight technology.
   B.   Local multipoint distribution service ("LMDS"), another form of over
the air wireless video service for which licenses are auctioned by the FCC, and
which offers video programming, telephony, and data networking services.
   C.   Direct broadcast satellite ("DBS"), also referred to as "direct-to-home
satellite services", which involves the distribution or broadcasting of
programming or services by satellite directly to the subscribers' premises
without the use of ground receiving or distribution equipment, except at the
subscriber's premises or in the uplink process to the satellite. Local
regulation of direct to home satellite services is further proscribed by the
following federal statutory provisions:
      1.   47 USC section 303(v) confers upon the FCC exclusive jurisdiction to
regulate the provision of direct to home satellite services.
      2.   Section 602 of the telecommunications act of 1996 states that a
provider of direct to home satellite service is exempt from the collection or
remittance, or both, of any tax or fee imposed by any local taxing jurisdiction
on direct to home satellite service. The terms "tax" and "fee" are defined by
federal statute to mean any local sales tax, local use tax, local intangible
tax, local income tax, business license tax, utility tax, privilege tax, gross
receipts tax, excise tax, franchise fees, local telecommunications tax, or any
other tax, license, or fee that is imposed for the privilege of doing business,
regulating, or raising revenue for a local taxing jurisdiction. (Ord. 0-01-
1150, 5-9-2001)
27.03.14: VIDEO PROVIDERS; REGISTRATION; CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS:
   A.   Unless the customer protection and customer service obligations of a
"video provider", as that term is defined in section 27.03.17 of this article,
are specified in a franchise, license, lease, or similar written agreement with
the city, a video provider must comply with all applicable provisions of the
following state statutes:
      1.   The cable television and video customer service and information act
(Government Code section 53054 et seq.).
      2.   The video customer service act (Government Code section 53088 et
seq.).
   B.   All video providers that are operating in the city on the effective
date of this article, or that intend to operate in the city after its effective
date, must register with the city; provided, however, that this registration
requirement is not applicable to any video provider that has executed a
franchise, license, lease or similar written agreement with the city. The
registration form must include or be accompanied by the following:
      1.   The video provider's name, address, and local telephone numbers.
      2.   The names of the officers of the video provider.
      3.   A copy of the video provider's written policies and procedures
relating to customer service standards and the handling of customer complaints,
as required by Government Code section 53054 et seq. These customer service
standards must include, without limitation, standards regarding the following:
         a.   Installation, disconnection, service and repair obligations,
employee identification, and service call response time and scheduling.
         b.   Customer telephone and office hours.
         c.   Procedures for billing, charges, refunds, and credits.
         d.   Procedures for termination of service.
         e.   Notice of the deletion of a programming service, the changing of
channel assignments, or an increase in rates.
         f.   Complaint procedures and procedures for bill dispute resolution.
         g.   The video provider's written commitment to distribute annually to
the city, and to its employees and customers, a notice describing the customer
service standards specified in subsections B3a through B3f of this section.
This annual notice must include the report of the video provider on its
performance in meeting its customer service standards, as required by
Government Code section 53055.2. Subject to the written notice and cure,
provisions of Government Code section 53056(b), a video provider that fails to
distribute the annual notice required by Government Code section 53055.1 will
be assessed a monetary penalty in the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for
each year in which the annual notice is not distributed to all of its
customers.
      4.   Unless a video provider is exempt under federal law from its
payment, a registration fee in an amount established by resolution of the city
council to cover the reasonable costs incurred by the city in reviewing and
processing the registration form.
      5.   In addition to the registration fee specified in subsection B4 of
this section, the written commitment of the video provider to pay to the city,
when due, all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the city in resolving
any disputes between the video provider and its subscribers, which dispute
resolution is mandated by Government Code section 53088.2(o).
   C.   The following schedule of monetary penalties is established by the city
council for the material breach by a video provider of its obligations under
subparagraphs (a) through (n) of Government Code section 53088.2, which
provisions are incorporated by this reference. The term "material breach" means
any substantial and repeated failure to comply with the consumer service
standards set forth in Government Code section 53088.2.
      1.   For a first material breach: up to two hundred dollars ($200.00) per
day, not to exceed a cumulative total of six hundred dollars ($600.00) for each
occurrence of the material breach, irrespective of the number of customers
affected.
      2.   For a second material breach of the same nature for which a monetary
penalty was previously assessed within the preceding twelve (12) month period:
up to four hundred dollars ($400.00) per day, not to exceed a cumulative total
of one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200.00) for each occurrence of the
material breach, irrespective of the number of customers affected.
      3.   For a third or further material breach of the same nature for which
a monetary penalty was previously assessed within the preceding twelve (12)
month period: up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day, not to exceed a
cumulative total of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) for each occurrence of
the material breach, irrespective of the number of customers affected.
   D.   The imposition of monetary penalties under subsection C of this
section, is subject to the following requirements and limitations:
      1.   The city must give the video provider written notice of any alleged
material breach and must allow the video provider at least thirty (30) days
from receipt of that notice to remedy the breach.
      2.   For the purpose of assessing monetary penalties, a material breach
will be deemed to have occurred for each day following the expiration of the
period for cure specified in subsection D1 of this section that the material
breach has not been remedied by the video provider, irrespective of the number
of customers affected.
      3.   With respect to any video provider that is subject to a franchise or
license agreement with the city, any monetary penalties assessed under
subsection C of this section must be reduced dollar for dollar to the extent
that any liquidated damage or penalty provisions of the franchise or license
agreement imposes a monetary obligation on the video provider for the same
customer service failure, and no other monetary damages may be assessed for
that customer service failure. (Ord. 0-01-1150, 5-9-2001)
27.03.15: TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDED BY TELEPHONE CORPORATIONS:
   A.   The city council finds and determines as follows:
      1.   The federal telecommunications act of 1996 preempts and declares
invalid all state rules that restrict entry or limit competition in both local
and long distance telephone service.
      2.   The California public utilities commission ("CPUC") is primarily
responsible for the implementation of local telephone competition, and it
issues certificates of public convenience and necessity to new entrants that
are qualified to provide competitive local telephone exchange services and
related telecommunications service, whether using their own facilities or the
facilities or services provided by other authorized telephone corporations.
      3.   Section 234(a) of the California Public Utilities Code defines a
"telephone corporation" as "every corporation or person owning, controlling,
operating, or managing any telephone line for compensation within this state".
      4.   Section 616 of the California Public Utilities Code provides that a
telephone corporation "may condemn any property necessary for the construction
and maintenance of its telephone line".
      5.   Section 2902 of the California Public Utilities Code authorizes
municipal corporations to retain their powers of control to supervise and
regulate the relationships between a public utility and the general public in
matters affecting the health, convenience, and safety of the general public,
including matters such as the use and repair of public streets by any public
utility and the location of the poles, wires, mains, or conduits of any public
utility on, under, or above any public streets.
      6.   Section 7901 of the California Public Utilities Code authorizes
telephone and telegraph corporations to construct telephone or telegraph lines
along and upon any public road or highway, along or across any of the waters or
lands within this state, and to erect poles, posts, piers, or abutments for
supporting the insulators, wires, and other necessary fixtures of their lines,
in such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the
road or highway or interrupt the navigation of the waters.
      7.   Section 7901.1 of the California Public Utilities Code confirms the
right of municipalities to exercise reasonable control as to the time, place,
and manner in which roads, highways, and waterways are accessed, which control
must be applied to all entities in an equivalent manner. Nothing in section
7901.1 adds to or subtracts from any existing authority that municipalities
have with respect to the imposition of fees.
      8.   Section 50030 of the California Government Code provides that any
permit fee imposed by a city for the placement, installation, repair, or
upgrading of telecommunications facilities, such as lines, poles, or antennas,
by a telephone corporation that has obtained all required authorizations from
the CPUC and the FCC to provide telecommunications services, must not exceed
the reasonable costs of providing the service for which the fee is charged, and
must not be levied for general revenue purposes.
   B.   In recognition of and in compliance with the statutory authorizations
and requirements set forth in subsection A of this section, the following
regulatory provisions are applicable to a telephone corporation that desires to
provide telecommunications service by means of facilities that are proposed to
be constructed within the city's public rights of way:
      1.   The telephone corporation must apply for and obtain, as may be
applicable, an excavation permit, an encroachment permit, or a building permit
("ministerial permit").
      2.   In addition to the information required by this code in connection
with an application for a ministerial permit, a telephone corporation must
submit to the city the following supplemental information:
         a.   A copy of the certificate of public convenience and necessity
issued by the CPUC to the applicant, and a copy of the CPUC decision that
authorizes the applicant to provide the telecommunications service for which
the facilities are proposed to be constructed in the city's public rights of
way. Any applicant that, prior to 1996, provided telecommunications service
under administratively equivalent documentation issued by the CPUC may submit
copies of that documentation in lieu of a certificate of public convenience and
necessity.
         b.   If the applicant has obtained from the CPUC a certificate of
public convenience and necessity to operate as a "competitive local carrier",
the following additional requirements are applicable:
            (1)   As required by decision no. 95-12-057 of the CPUC, the
applicant must establish that it has timely filed with the city a quarterly
report that describes the type of construction and the location of each
construction project proposed to be undertaken in the city during the calendar
quarter in which the application is filed, so that the city can coordinate
multiple projects, as may be necessary.
            (2)   If the applicant's proposed construction project will extend
beyond the utility rights of way into undisturbed areas or other rights of way,
the applicant must establish that it has filed a petition with the CPUC to
amend its certificate of public convenience and necessity and that the proposed
construction project has been subjected to a full scale environmental analysis
by the CPUC, as required by decision no. 95-12-057 of the CPUC.
            (3)   The applicant must inform the city whether its proposed
construction project will be subject to any of the mitigation measures
specified in the negative declaration ("Competitive Local Carriers (CLCs)
Projects for Local Exchange Communication Service throughout California") or to
the mitigation monitoring plan adopted in connection with decision no. 95-12-
057 of the CPUC. The city's issuance of a ministerial permit will be
conditioned upon the applicant's compliance with all applicable mitigation
measures and monitoring requirements imposed by the CPUC upon telephone
corporations that are designated as "competitive local carriers".
         c.   The city reserves all rights that it now possesses or may later
acquire with respect to the regulation of any cable or telecommunications
service that is provided, or proposed to be provided, by a telephone
corporation. These reserved rights may relate, without limitation, to the
imposition of reasonable conditions in addition to or different from those set
forth in this section, the exaction of a fee or other form of consideration or
compensation for use of public rights of way, and related matters; provided,
however, that such regulatory rights and authority must be consistent with
federal and state law that is applicable to cable or telecommunications
services provided by telephone corporations. (Ord. 0-01-1150, 5-9-2001)
DIVISION 5. USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS OF WAY
27.03.16: FINDINGS; POLICIES AND PROCEDURES:
   A.   The city council finds and determines that numerous and repetitive
excavations in the public rights of way diminish the useful life of the surface
pavement and generally cause adverse negative impacts for local residents,
local businesses, and vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The city council
further finds and determines that the utility substructure in the public rights
of way is subject to potential adverse negative impacts as a consequence of new
economic and regulatory policies that foster increased competition between
various utility service providers, including telephone corporations, and
between other service providers, such as cable system operators. In order to
mitigate these potential adverse negative impacts, the following policies are
adopted:
      1.   The city manager is directed to develop and to implement public
rights of way policies and procedures that incorporate, to the extent
reasonably feasible and consistent with all applicable laws and regulations,
the following requirements that are intended to encourage the shared use by
utility and other service providers of existing facilities in the public rights
of way:
         a.   A requirement that utility and other service providers requesting
permits review information provided by the city that identifies the location of
facilities, such as underground conduits, that are available for shared use,
and the owners of those facilities.
         b.   A requirement that utility and other service providers requesting
permits submit a written statement that describes in reasonable detail the
efforts made to obtain from other utility service providers the right to use
excess capacity within existing facilities, and to thereby avoid the
construction of new facilities.
         c.   A requirement that utility and other service providers occupying
the public rights of way submit annually to the city a map, which may be in a
uniform electronic data format to be specified by the city, that shows the
location of their respective facilities in the public rights of way.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an updated annual map need not be provided
unless there are changes to the location of the service provider's facilities
in the public rights of way.
         d.   Any additional requirements that will encourage utility and other
service providers to share excess capacity within previously constructed
facilities and to coordinate the construction of new facilities so as to
minimize the number of excavations in the public rights of way.
      2.   The city manager is directed to ensure that all utility and other
service providers, including telephone corporations and cable system operators,
comply with all local design, construction, maintenance and safety standards
that are consistent with state and federal laws and regulations and that are
contained within, or are related to, any permit that authorizes the
construction of facilities within the public rights of way, including all
applicable insurance provisions.
      3.   Based upon the city's projected plans for street construction or
renovation projects, the city manager is authorized to establish on a quarterly
basis one or more construction time periods or "windows" for the installation
of facilities within the public rights of way. Cable system operators,
telephone corporations, and other utility service providers that submit
applications for permits to construct facilities after a predetermined date may
be required to delay such construction until the next quarterly "window" that
is established by the city.
   B.   The city council finds and determines that the installation in the
public rights of way of numerous aboveground facilities by utility service
providers, including telephone corporations, and other service providers may
create safety hazards and adverse visual impacts. Consequently, the public
works department is authorized to impose reasonable conditions in order to
mitigate those potential adverse impacts that may result, whether on an
individual or a cumulative basis, from permitted aboveground facilities. Those
conditions may include or relate to, without limitation, the following:
      1.   Prior to issuance of the requisite permits, all aboveground
facilities proposed to be installed by a utility or other service provider in
the public rights of way must be clearly delineated on the plans when they are
submitted for the city's review.
      2.   The design and installation by qualified professionals of
landscaping and barriers to minimize public view of aboveground facilities
whose location has been approved by the city.
      3.   The maintenance of all aboveground facilities in good condition,
including compliance with the city's ordinances regarding graffiti removal. In
this regard, a utility or other service provider may be required to affix to
its aboveground facilities a coded label or marker that identifies the specific
facility and sets forth a telephone number that may be called to report any
damage, destruction, or graffiti vandalism involving that facility.
      4.   The placement of aboveground facilities, such as overhead drops, as
close as possible to other utility drops, consistent with all applicable
electrical codes.
      5.   Reasonable limitations upon the number of aboveground facilities
that may be installed within a designated geographical area.
      6.   Reasonable limitations upon the dimensions or volume, or both, of
aboveground facilities.
      7.   The specification of colors of aboveground facilities reasonably
requested by the city to ensure that these facilities blend with the
surrounding environment to the maximum extent possible.
      8.   Such additional conditions regulating the time, place, and manner of
installations of aboveground facilities as will reasonably mitigate potential
safety hazards and adverse visual impacts attributable to these facilities.
   C.   The city reserves all rights that it now possesses or may later acquire
to adopt and implement citywide requirements for the undergrounding of
aboveground facilities, or any portion thereof, in a competitively neutral and
nondiscriminatory manner. To the extent authorized by law, all utility and
other service providers will be required to comply with those requirements at
their sole expense. (Ord. 0-01-1150, 5-9-2001)
DIVISION 6. DEFINITIONS

misdemeanor and is punishable as provided for in chapter I, article 4 of this
code.
   B.    The misdemeanor penalty specified in subsection A of this section is

If any provision of this article is determined by any court of competent
jurisdiction, or by any federal or state agency having jurisdiction over its
subject matter, to be invalid and in conflict with any paramount federal or
state law or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is determined by that
court or agency to require modification in order to conform to the requirements
