whenever the enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe that the

system at least ten (10) calendar days in advance of the bid opening date; b)
submitted in a sealed envelope or electronically through the electronic bidding
system, in conformance with a City prescribed format and procedure; c) publicly
opened, read and recorded at the Office of the City Clerk at a City specified
date and time; and d) accepted by award made by the City Council.
   FORMAL PROCUREMENT: Procurement by written notice inviting bids and formal
bid.
   FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP): A comprehensive written document that
defines the objectives and needs of the City and requests potential vendors to
propose the best method for meeting such objectives and needs. Formal RFPs must
require paper or electronic sealed proposal, with cost proposals submitted in a
separate, sealed envelope, or in a separate sealed cost electronic-file in
accordance with section
2.16.170 of this chapter. Formal RFPs shall be evaluated and ranked by a
Selection Committee of at least three (3) persons.
   GOODS: Supplies, materials, equipment and other commodities included within
the definition of "goods" in section 2105 of the California Commercial Code.
   GRATUITY: A gift or favor, entertainment, loan or anything of monetary value
from anyone who has or is seeking to obtain City business or conducts
activities that may be affected by the performance or nonperformance of the
employee's official duties.
   INFORMAL BID OR QUOTATION: An unsealed competitive offer conveyed by letter,
facsimile or other written means and under conditions different from those
required for formal bidding; informal bids should only be solicited by City
personnel authorized to do so, and for each solicitation of an informal bid,
the authorized personnel shall obtain informal bids from at least three (3)
different prospective bidders, if practicable. Informal bids for public
projects shall be publicly opened, read and recorded at the Office of the City
Clerk.
   INFORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP): A comprehensive written document that
defines the objectives and needs of the City and requests potential vendors to
propose the best method for meeting such objectives and needs. An informal RFP
should have the same level of detail as a formal RFP. Informal RFPs may require
unsealed proposals and may be submitted by letter, facsimile, e-mail or other
written means. Informal RFPs may be evaluated and ranked by City staff peer
review or by a Selection Committee.
   NEGOTIATION: Contracting through the use of either competitive or other than
competitive proposals and discussions. Any contract/purchase order awarded
without using formal bidding procedures is a negotiated contract/purchase
order. Further, negotiation is a procedure that includes the receipt of
proposals, which permits bargaining and usually affords an opportunity to
revise their offers before award of a contract/purchase order. Bargaining in
the sense of discussion, persuasion, alteration of initial assumptions of
positions, and give and take may apply to price, schedule, technical
requirements, type of contract/purchase order or other terms of a proposed
contract/purchase order.
   PROCURE OR PROCUREMENT: Buying, purchasing, renting, leasing or otherwise
acquiring or obtaining goods, services or construction.
   PROFESSIONAL SERVICES: All services performed by persons in a professional
occupation including, but not limited to, consulting and the performance of
services for accounting, attorneys, auditors, architects, computer and
communications software, support, and related hardware, engineers,
environmental, financial, personnel, planning, and other individuals or
organizations exercising professional discretion and independent judgment based
on specialized knowledge, expertise or training.
   PURCHASE ORDER: A City issued document which authorizes the delivery of
goods, the rendering of services, or the performance of construction at a
stated price and which encumbers City funds for the payment thereof. A purchase
order is a contract as defined in this chapter.
   PURCHASE REQUISITION: A written request in the form as the City may from
time to time determine, submitted by a City department to the Purchasing Office
for procurement of goods, services or construction.
   PURCHASING OFFICE: The City department, designated by the City Manager, for
the administration of this chapter.
   RECYCLED GOODS: Finished manufactured products containing recycled materials
in the production thereof.
   SERVICE (CONTRACTUAL): A contract that directly engages the time and effort
of a contractor whose primary purpose is to perform an identifiable task rather
than to furnish an end item of supply. It can also cover services performed by
either professional or nonprofessional personnel, whether on an individual or
organizational basis. Examples of contractual service or services contracts
are: a) maintenance, overhaul, repair, rehabilitation, salvage, modernization
or modification of supplies, systems, equipment; b) facilities maintenance; c)
janitorial services; d) transportation and related services; e) accounting and
auditing; and f) architecture and engineering.
   SINGLE SOURCE PURCHASE: A purchase where it can be substantiated that a
commodity or service can be obtained from one vendor, contractor or
professional service provider which often is the "single" representative of the
manufacturer or principal company. "Single source" purchases frequently involve
a vendor, contractor or professional consultant whose product or service is
discernibly distinguishable from all others in the market and singularly meets
all significant elements of the City's requirement. In this context, "single"
means "the one among others".
   SMALL PURCHASE: A onetime, noncompetitive purchase of goods or services,
which totals seven thousand dollars ($7,000.00) or less. Each City department
may issue a "short form" purchase order for unanticipated and non-repetitive
purchases, which cumulatively do not exceed forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00)
per vendor, per fiscal year. Purchases shall not be split, staged or separated
into smaller units of work for the purpose of evading the competitive bidding
procedures or any other requirement of this chapter.
   SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE: A purchase where it can be substantiated that a
requirement involves commodity or service provided by only one vendor,
contractor or professional service provider which has exclusive rights (e.g.,
rights to data, patent or copyright, proprietary interests or secret processes)
to the manufacturing of the product or service. "Sole source" requirements must
withstand the questions of: a) is the commodity or service the only of its kind
which can fully satisfy the requirement, and b) the commodity or service is
available from one, and only one, source. In this context, "sole" means "the
only one".
   STANDARDIZATION: The process of examining characteristics and needs per
items of similar end usage and developing a single specification that will
satisfy the need for most or all purchases for that purpose.
   SURPLUS PROPERTY: Inventory not needed by the City at the present time or in
the foreseeable future, such as obsolete supplies, equipment, and scrap
materials that have little or no useful life. For purposes of this chapter, the
term "property" does not include real property. (Ord. 2984, 2025: Ord. 2891,
2019)
2.16.020: PURCHASING SYSTEM:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for the purchase of
goods, services and construction at the lowest possible cost commensurate with
the quality needed; to exercise financial control over purchases; to define
authority for the purchasing function; and to assure the quality of such
purchases. Therefore, a centralized purchasing system is hereby adopted and
vested with the authority for the purchase of all goods, services and
construction, except as otherwise required by Federal or State law. In
addition, this chapter and the purchasing system it establishes is designed to
provide appropriate procedures to implement the City's participation in the
Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act pursuant to Public Contract
Code section 22000 et seq. (Ord. 2891, 2019)
2.16.030: PURCHASING AGENT:
The position of Purchasing Agent of the City is hereby established and shall be
incorporated with the duties of the City department director responsible for
oversight of the Purchasing Office. When the term "Purchasing Agent" is used in
this chapter, such term shall include his or her designees. (Ord. 2891, 2019)
2.16.040: POWERS AND DUTIES:
Subject to the supervision of the City Manager, the Purchasing Agent shall have
charge of purchasing goods, services and construction required by any City

goods, services and construction.
   F.   Endeavor to obtain full and open competition whenever possible on all
purchases.
   G.   Prepare and implement policies and procedures governing the purchase of
goods, services and equipment for the City. The Purchasing Agent shall be

City Manager, the purchasing policy and procedures manual shall have the same
force and effect as the provisions of this chapter.
   H.   Keep informed of current developments in the field of purchasing,
prices, market conditions and new products. Recommend purchase of alternative
products of a higher quality or lower cost.
   I.   Prescribe and maintain such forms as reasonably necessary to carry out
the operation of this chapter.
   J.   Maintain appropriate records needed for the efficient operation of the
purchasing function.
   K.   Encourage the standardization of similar goods, services and

catalog file necessary to the operation of this chapter.
   M.   With written approval of the City Manager, or by action of the City
Council, dependent on established dollar limits set for each, authorize in
writing any City department to purchase or contract for specified goods,
services and construction, independently of the Purchasing Agent. However, the
Purchasing Agent shall require that such purchases be made in conformity with
the procedures established by this chapter and that all documents supporting
the formal or informal bidding procedures be attached to the City's copy of the
purchase requisition.
   N.   Each year, on a quarterly basis, the Purchasing Agent, through the City
Manager, shall prepare and provide to the City Council a summary report of
contracts awarded for seventy five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) or less during
such quarter and not previously approved by the City Council.
   O.   Perform such other duties as may be imposed by the City Council or City
Manager. (Ord. 2984, 2025: Ord. 2891, 2019)
2.16.050: PURCHASING STANDARDS AND ETHICS:
The Purchasing Office and all other employees involved in the procurement of
goods, services and construction will be conducted with absolute integrity. The
very highest ethical standards will be maintained in all material activities.
The Purchasing Office and all other employees will be constantly aware of their
responsibilities in spending public funds and subscribe to the principles and
standards as advocated by the National Association of Purchasing Management and
the California Association of Public Purchasing Officers. Some of these
principles and standards are as follows:
   A.   Regard public service as a sacred trust, giving primary consideration
to the interests of the City.

each tax dollar expended.

buying and selling.
   H.   Cooperate with all organizations and individuals engaged in enhancing
the development and standing of the purchasing profession.
   I.   Remember that their conduct reflects on the City and the entire
purchasing profession. (Ord. 2891, 2019)
2.16.060: CONFLICT OF INTEREST:
No officer or employee of the City having any supervisory authority to purchase
any specific goods, services or construction for the City shall have any
financial interest in connection with the purchase of such goods, services or
construction. No officer or employee shall participate in the procurement or
selection process when such officer or employee has a relationship with a
person or business entity seeking a contract under this chapter which would
subject such officer or employee to the prohibition of California Government
Code section 87100 et seq., or Government Code section 1090. (Ord. 2891, 2019)
2.16.070: GRATUITIES:
The Purchasing Agent and all other officers and employees of the City are
prohibited from accepting directly or indirectly from any person to whom any
purchase order or contract is, or might be, awarded, any rebate, kickback,
gift, money or other unlawful consideration. The offer of such gratuity to an
official or employee by any supplier or contractor shall be cause for declaring
such individual to be an irresponsible bidder and for preventing such supplier
or contractor from bidding as otherwise provided for in this chapter. (Ord.
2891, 2019)
2.16.080: PURCHASE REQUISITION:
For other than small purchases, City departments shall submit purchase requests
for goods, services and construction to the Purchasing Office on standard
requisition forms prepared, maintained and updated by the Purchasing Agent. A
requisition shall set forth the characteristics of the goods, services or
construction being requested. No purchase requisition shall be broken into
smaller units to evade any requirement of this chapter, except that unrelated
items requisitioned by departments may be separated to provide different lists
to vendors dealing in different types of goods. (Ord. 2891, 2019)
2.16.090: PURCHASE ORDER:
The purchase of goods, services and construction shall be made only by the
Purchasing Agent through the execution of a purchase order, except in cases of
small purchases or an emergency as defined herein. No officer or employee of
the City shall request a supplier to deliver goods, services or construction to
the City unless a City purchase order number has been issued by the Purchasing
Agent. Purchases and contracts shall not be split, staged or separated into
smaller units of work for the purpose of evading the competitive bidding
procedures or any other requirement of this chapter. (Ord. 2891, 2019)
2.16.100: ENCUMBRANCE OF FUNDS:
The Purchasing Agent shall not issue any purchase order for goods, services or
construction unless there exists an unencumbered appropriation in the account
against which the purchase is to be charged. (Ord. 2891, 2019)
2.16.110: COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT:
Procurement of goods, services and construction by the City shall whenever
practicable be based on competitive procurement, whether by formal procurement,
if required, or procurement in the open market, if permitted, except that
competitive procurement shall not be required in the following circumstances:
   A.   When emergency procurement is required as defined in section
2.16.130 of this chapter;
   B.   When the procurement involved is seven thousand dollars ($7,000.00) or
less;
   C.   When the City department director certifies, in writing, to the
Purchasing Agent that procurement can only be obtained from a sole source, or
timely from a single source, and the Purchasing Agent is satisfied that the
best price, terms and conditions have been negotiated; single or sole source
procurement for goods, services or construction greater than seven thousand
dollars ($7,000.00) and less than or equal to forty thousand dollars
($40,000.00) requires the approval of the City Manager, and approval of the
City Council for single or sole source procurement in excess of forty thousand
dollars ($40,000.00);
   D.   When competitively awarded, cooperative purchasing is available and
undertaken, as pursuant to section
2.16.210 of this chapter;
   E.   When the goods, services or construction can be obtained from a
contractor who offers the same or better price, terms and conditions as the
same contractor previously offered as the lowest responsible bidder under
competitive procurement or negotiations conducted by the City or another public
agency, provided that in the opinion of the Purchasing Agent, it is in the best
interests of the City to do so;
   F.   When the goods, services or construction can be obtained through
Federal, State and/or other public entity pricing contracts or price agreements
which were competitively awarded.
Purchasing without providing for full and open competition shall not be
justified on the basis of a lack of advanced planning on the part of the
requesting City department or based upon concerns related to the amount of
funds available (e.g., funds will expire as a result of grant or fiscal year).
(Ord. 2984, 2025: Ord. 2891, 2019)
2.16.120: FORMAL PROCUREMENT:
Formal procurement shall be required for all estimated procurement expenditures
that meet the formal procurement limits set forth in section
 2.16.160 of this chapter. Except as otherwise provided herein, contracts for
goods, services and nonpublic project improvement work shall be made pursuant
to the procedures described herein:
   A.   Bid Notice: Notices inviting bids shall include a general description
of the articles to be purchased or the improvement work to be performed and
shall state where and when bid packages may be secured, and the time and place
of the bid opening.
   B.   Publication And Mailing: Notice inviting bids shall be published at
least ten (10) calendar days before the opening of bids in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City or as otherwise permitted by law through the
City's electronic bidding system. The Purchasing Agent may establish and
maintain a list of prospective bidders. It shall not be the responsibility of
the Purchasing Agent to ensure that the list contains current information in
respect to the address, service or product of the prospective bidder. The
Purchasing Agent is authorized to mail or otherwise distribute written
invitations for bids directly to the appropriate prospective bidders appearing
on the list and to other prospective bidders.
   C.   Bidder's Security: Each bid or proposal may be required by the
Purchasing Agent to be accompanied by a bidder's bond, certified or cashier's
check, or cash, in an amount not more than ten percent (10%) of the total bid.
When deemed necessary by the Purchasing Agent, bidder's security may be
prescribed in the public notice inviting bids. When bid security is required,
bidders shall be entitled to return of bid security; however, if a successful
bidder refused to or failed to execute the contract within ten (10) business
days after the notice of award has been mailed or otherwise delivered in a
written format, unless, and to the extent the City is not responsible for the
delay, its bid security shall be deemed forfeited. The City Council may, upon
refusal or failure of the successful bidder to execute the contract, award the
contract to the next lowest and responsible bidder.
   D.   Bid Opening Procedures: Formal bids shall be submitted to the City
Clerk in accordance with the notice inviting bids and shall be identified as a
bid on the envelope when submitted in paper format. Bids shall be opened in
public at the time and place stated in the public notice. A record of the bids
received shall be available for public inspection after the bids have been
opened, indicating the amount bid by the various bidders and the basis for
awarding the contract or purchase order if other than the lowest bidder is
awarded the contract/purchase order. Such list shall be available for at least
thirty (30) days after the award has been made.
   E.   Rejection Of Bids: The Purchasing Agent, City Manager or the City
Council, in accordance with the limits established by this chapter, shall each
have the power to reject bids presented, for any reason, and re-advertise for
bids.
   F.   Tie Bids: If two (2) or more bids received are for the same total
amount, unit price or quality, and service being equal, and if the public
interest will not permit the delay of re- advertising for bids, the Purchasing
Agent, City Manager or the City Council in accordance with the limits
established by this chapter, may accept the bid it chooses or accept the lowest
bid made by negotiation with the tie bidders at time of the bid opening.
   G.   Performance And Payment Bonds: The Purchasing Agent may require
performance and payment bonds before a contract is awarded for goods or
services in such amounts as the Purchasing Agent shall find reasonably
necessary to protect the best interest of the City and to comply with law. If
the Purchasing Agent requires a performance or payment bond, the form and
amount of the bonds shall be described in the notice inviting bids.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a payment bond shall be required of a contractor
that is awarded a public works contract involving an expenditure in excess of
twenty five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). (Ord. 2891, 2019)
2.16.130: EMERGENCY PROCUREMENT FOR NONPUBLIC PROJECT:
While the need for emergency procurement is recognized, the practice shall be
curtailed as much as possible by anticipating needs so that normal competitive
procurement may be used.
   A.   Any one or more of the following circumstances shall constitute an
emergency:
      1.   A great public calamity;
      2.   An immediate need to prepare for national or local defense;
      3.   A breakdown in machinery or essential service which requires the
immediate procurement of goods, services or construction, to protect the public
health, welfare, safety or property;
      4.   A City department's operation, directly affecting the public health,
welfare or safety or the protection of public property, is so severely impacted
by any cause that personal injury or property destruction appears to be
imminent and probable unless goods, services or construction designed or
intended to mitigate the risks thereof are procured immediately;
      5.   A department is involved in a City project which is of such a nature
that the need for particular goods, services or construction can only be
ascertained as the project progresses and, when ascertained, must be satisfied
immediately for the preservation of public health, welfare, safety or property.
   B.   Emergency procurement may be initiated by a City department director or
his or her duly authorized representative as follows:
      1.   During normal City business hours, the department director, or his
or her representative, shall provide reasons and justification for the
emergency procurement. If the nature of the emergency is such that goods,
services or construction must be procured immediately and the Purchasing Agent
is satisfied with the explanation of reasons and justification given therefor,
the Purchasing Agent shall authorize the procurement and cause an emergency
purchase order to be issued as soon as possible, and in no event later than the
following business day. A purchase requisition confirming the procurement must
be prepared by the department director or his or her authorized representative
and submitted to the Purchasing Agent no later than the following business day.
      2.   After normal City business hours, the City department representative
shall exercise his or her best judgment in ascertaining whether the actual
circumstances necessitate emergency procurement, and if deemed necessary shall
order it. As soon as possible and in no event later than the following business
day, the City department representative, with approval of the department
director, shall prepare a purchase requisition confirming the emergency
procurement and deliver it to the Purchasing Agent, who shall then cause an
emergency purchase order to be prepared.
   C.   Following the emergency procurement, a written report shall be made,
within ten (10) days of the purchase, by the Purchasing Agent to the City
Manager for procurement between forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00) and seventy
five thousand dollars ($75,000.00), and through the City Manager to the City
Council for procurement exceeding seventy five thousand dollars ($75,000.00).
(Ord. 2984, 2025: Ord. 2891, 2019)
2.16.140: PUBLIC PROJECT CONSTRUCTION WORK:
Procurement for public projects shall be made in accordance with the Uniform
Public Construction Cost Accounting Act. The notice inviting bids for any
public project involving an expenditure in excess of twenty five thousand
dollars ($25,000.00) shall state that a payment bond is required from the
successful bidder in an amount not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the
total amount payable pursuant to the public project contract. The payment bond
shall be in a form of a bond and not a deposit or other security in lieu of a
bond. Prior to or concurrent with the award of a contract for a public project,
the City Engineer shall review and approve the working details, drawings,
plans, and specifications prepared for every public project which may affect
the design or operation of public improvements and which may bring into
question the City's liability for dangerous conditions of public property. The
City Council shall review and approve the working details, drawings, plans and
specifications prepared for every public project of more than seventy five
thousand dollars ($75,000.00) prior to or concurrent with the award of a
contract for the public project.
   A.   A "public project" is defined in Public Contract Code section 22002 as
any of the following:
      1.   Construction, reconstruction, erection, alteration, renovation,
improvement, demolition and repair work involving any publicly owned, leased,
or operated facility;
      2.   Painting or repainting of any publicly owned, leased or operated
facility;
      3.   In the case of a publicly owned utility system, "public project"
shall include only the construction, erection, improvement or repair of dams,

         a.   Contractors List: A list of qualified contractors shall be
developed and maintained by the Purchasing Agent in accordance with the
provisions of section 22034 of the Public Contract Code and any applicable

         b.   Notice Inviting Informal Bids: When a public project is to be
undertaken which is subject to the provisions of this chapter, a notice
inviting informal bids shall be mailed, faxed, or emailed to all contractors
for the category of work to be bid, as shown on the City's list of qualified
contractors and to all construction trade journals as specified by the
California Uniform Construction Cost Accounting Commission in accordance with
section 22036 of the Public Contract Code. Additional contractors and/or
construction trade journals may be notified at the discretion of the City
department responsible for undertaking the public project and soliciting bids,
provided, however:
            (1)   If there is not a list of qualified contractors maintained by
the City for the particular category of work to be performed, the notice
inviting bids for the public project shall be sent only to the construction
trade journals specified by the commission.
            (2)   If the product or service comprising the public project is
proprietary in nature such that it may be obtained only from a certain
contractor or contractors, the notice inviting informal bids for the public
project may be sent exclusively to such contractor or contractors.
         c.   Publicly Opened: Informal bids shall be publicly opened and/or
received by the Office of the City Clerk at the time and date specified by the
Purchasing Agent or other City employee when soliciting requests for informal
bids.
      3.   Excess Of Two Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars: If all bids received
through the informal bidding process are in excess of two hundred twenty
thousand dollars ($220,000.00), the City Council may, by adoption of a
resolution by a four-fifths (4/5) vote, award the contract, at two hundred
twelve thousand five hundred dollars ($212,500.00) or less, to the lowest
responsible bidder, if the City Council determines the cost estimate for the
public project originally made by the City was reasonable.
      4.   Two Hundred Twenty Dollars And Above: Public projects having a

         a.   For public projects, the total of change orders shall not exceed
twenty five percent (25%) of the amount of the original contract. Change orders
exceeding twenty five percent (25%) of the original contract amount should be
bid and awarded separately and approved in relation to approval limits
established in this section.
         b.   Change orders over seventy five thousand dollars ($75,000.00)
should be approved by City Council.
      7.   Bond: A payment bond shall be required of a contractor that is
awarded a public works contract involving an expenditure in excess of twenty-
five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). It is recommended to require performance
bond as well.
      8.   Emergency Contracting Procedure:
         a.   "Emergency" as used in this section, means a sudden, unexpected
occurrence that poses a clear and imminent danger, requiring immediate action
to prevent or mitigate the loss or impairment of life, health, property, or
essential public services as defined in Public Contract Code section 1102. In
cases of emergency when repair or replacements are necessary the City Council
may proceed at once to replace or repair any public facility without adopting
plans, specifications, strain sheets, or working details, or giving notice to
let bids for contracts. The work may be done by day labor under the direction
of the City Council, by contract, or by a combination of the two. The
provisions of California Public Contract Code section 22050, including, but not
limited to, the requirement of a four-fifths (4/5) vote of the City Council
finding substantial evidence of an emergency prior to taking emergency action,
shall apply when notice for bids to let contracts in emergency situations is
not given. The City Council may delegate by resolution the authority to order
any action pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of California Public
Contract Code section 22050 to the City Manager, City Engineer, or other
appropriate non-elected City officer. (Ord. 2984, 2025: Ord. 2891, 2019)
2.16.150: NONPUBLIC PROJECT IMPROVEMENT WORK:
Procurement for nonpublic project improvement work is not subject to the

2.16.200: CHANGE ORDERS:
Except for change orders for public projects, which shall be approved in
accordance with the contract documents for such projects, changes to previously
awarded purchase orders or contracts in excess of ten percent (10%) of the
original value of that purchase order or contract shall require approval by the
Purchasing Agent, City Manager or City Council, depending on the new value of
the purchase order or contract after the increase and in relation to the
approval limits established in sections 2.16.140 through 2.16.180 of this
chapter. Changes equal to or less than ten percent (10%) are allowed at the
department discretion unless the change causes the new value of the purchase
order or contract to exceed seventy five thousand dollars ($75,000.00), which
if not previously approved by the City Council, must then be so approved. Any
change order that increases a purchase order or contract by fifty percent (50%)
or more of the original value requires City Manager approval for purchase
orders or contracts totaling less than or equal to seventy five thousand
dollars ($75,000.00) and City Council approval for those totaling seventy five
thousand dollars ($75,000.00) or more. The City Manager may request City
Council approval for the former, if he or she believes it is in the best
interests of the City to do so. (Ord. 2984, 2025: Ord. 2891, 2019)
2.16.210: COOPERATIVE PURCHASING:
Where advantageous for the City, the Purchasing Agent is authorized to allow
for the purchase of goods, services and construction through legal contracts of
other governmental jurisdictions or public agencies without further
contracting, solicitation or formal bidding, provided such practice otherwise
complies with State law and was competitively awarded. Awards will be made
based on approval limits established in section
2.16.160 of this chapter. (Ord. 2891, 2019)
2.16.220: BUSINESS PREFERENCES:
In administration of competitive procurement pursuant to this chapter, the
purchasing agent shall be authorized to give such preferences for supplies,
materials, equipment, and specialized goods as general law cities are permitted
or required to give by applicable State or Federal law, or as provided for in
this chapter.
   A.   Local Business Preference: To promote business retention within the
city and the economic health of the city and to encourage local business
participation in the procurement process, the purchasing agent, in determining
the lowest responsible bidder for contracts for supplies, materials, equipment
and specialized goods shall grant an eight percent (8%) local business
preference to local businesses. For purposes of this chapter, a local business
is defined as a business possessing a valid Redlands Business License and
having its principal business operation located in the City of Redlands.
   B.   Business Preferences: To promote the economic health of the County of
San Bernardino and to encourage County business participation in the
procurement process, the purchasing agent, in determining the lowest
responsible bidder for contracts for supplies, materials, equipment and
specialized goods shall grant a two percent (2%) County business preference to
County businesses. For the purposes of this chapter, a County business is
defined as a business possessing a valid Redlands Business License and having
its principal business operation located within the County of San Bernardino
and outside of the City of Redlands.
   C.   Application To Bids: When applying the local business preference or
County business preference to a bid, the purchasing agent shall apply the
preference to the bid price solely for bid evaluation purposes such that the
total price bid by a local business shall be reduced by eight percent (8%) of
the amount bid by the local business, and by two percent (2%) to the County of
San Bernardino business and the reduced bid shall be deemed the amount bid by
that bidder. The contract price shall in all events be the amount bid by the
successful bidder awarded the contract.
   D.   Change In Preferences: The local business and County business
preferences established by this Chapter shall terminate on December 31, 2026.
Commencing on January 1, 2027, to further promote business retention within the
city and the economic health of the city and to encourage local participation
in the procurement process, the Purchasing Agent, in determining the lowest
responsible bidder for contracts for supplies, materials, equipment and
specialized goods having a value of forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00) or
less, may take into consideration the one percent (1%) sales tax which would be
returned to the city as a result of the bid award. For procurement where sales
tax would not be generated as a result of the bid award and where the quality
and price are equal to another bidder or bidders, the local vendor may be given
the bid award.
   E.   Recycled Goods: Whenever practicable, all City departments shall use
recycled content products and recycled materials to meet their needs. This
subsection is enacted to facilitate compliance with State requirements and to
foster the development of new, improved markets for recycled products.
      1.   Definitions: For purposes of this subsection E, the following words
shall have the meanings ascribed to them:
         POSTCONSUMER RECYCLED MATERIALS: A finished material or product that
has served its intended use and would normally be disposed of as solid waste.
Examples of postconsumer recovered materials include, but are not limited to,
old newspaper, office paper, green waste (yard waste), steel, glass, aluminum
cans, plastic bottles, oil, asphalt, concrete and tires.
         PRACTICABLE: Available within a reasonable time period; the recycled
product shall be of equal or better quality or value at either no or minimal
additional cost and subject to consideration of product durability as a
criterion of the cost or value of the product.
         PRE-CONSUMER: Materials or byproducts generated after manufacturing of
a product is completed, but before the product reaches the consumer. Examples
of pre-consumer recovered materials include, but are not limited to, obsolete
inventories of finished goods, rejected unused stock and paper wastes generated
during printing, cutting and other conversion operations.
         RECYCLED MATERIAL: Waste material and byproducts that have been
recovered or diverted from the solid waste stream and can be utilized in place
of raw or virgin material in a product. Recycled content materials may consist
of material derived from postconsumer waste, manufacturing waste, industrial
scrap, agricultural waste and other items, all of which can be used in the
manufacture of new products.
      2.   City Departments' Procurement Of Recycled Content Products:
         a.   All departments shall use recycled content products whenever
practicable. Special emphasis shall be placed on the purchase of products
manufactured with postconsumer recycled materials.
         b.   Whenever practicable, recycled materials shall be procured and
used in City operations (e.g., recycled paper shall be used in copy machines
and for printing purposes by departments).
         c.   All departments may require procurement of designated recycled
content products above levels required by this subsection.
         d.   The City shall require its contractors and consultants to use
recycled content products in fulfilling contractual obligations whenever
practical.
         e.   The City shall promote the use of recycled content products
publicizing its procurement policy whenever practicable (e.g., use of recycling
symbol and statement on recycled content products).
         f.   A life cycle cost analysis may be an appropriate tool for
departments to use when evaluating purchasing alternatives. Life cycle cost
should reflect the annual cost of the product calculated over the life of the
product and should consider final costs, not just initial up-front costs. A
life cycle cost analysis may include factors such as capital costs,
installation costs, maintenance costs, energy and other operating costs, and
disposal costs which may utilize the "best value" procurement method.
         g.   The City shall procure recycled products if the product fitness
and quality are equal to the non-recycled product and available at the same or
lesser total cost than non-recycled items. These products shall include paper
products, printing and writing papers, mulch, compost, and compost products,
glass products, lubricating oils, plastic products, paint, antifreeze, tires,
tire derived products and metal.
         h.   The City will favorably consider the selection of other recycled
and environmentally preferable materials, products, and supplies over their
non-recycled or non-environmentally preferable alternatives when the
availability, fitness, operational efficiency, quality, safety, and price of
the recycled or environmentally preferable product is equal to, or better than,
the non-recycled or non-environmentally preferable alternative. The list of
materials, products, and supplies shall include, but not be limited to,
business office products, alternative fuels, rubberized asphalt, and other
items.
         i.   Departments are encouraged to consider less toxic alternatives
when purchasing products or services such as pesticides or pest control
services, and to purchase energy and water conserving products whenever
possible.
      3.   Duties Of The Purchasing Agent: The purchasing agent shall
coordinate implementation of this subsection. Duties of the purchasing agent
for implementation of this subsection include:
         a.   Establishment of a list of recycled products for purchase by all
departments when practicable and review of purchase requests to encourage the
substitution of recycled products when practicable.
         b.   Maintenance of a list and standard specifications and, the
undertaking of a periodic review of available products. Products may be added
as they become available.
         c.   Giving preference to approving and promoting the purchase of
products with the highest postconsumer content, all other considerations being
equal.
      4.   City Departments' Responsibilities: City departments shall be
responsible for the following:
         a.   City staff shall identify the recycled content products available
and the vendors from whom such products are available for purchase. This
information shall be compiled and provided to the purchasing agent and the
sustainability manager, when practical.
         b.   Departments shall evaluate the recycled products on the
established list and shall make efforts to purchase recycled products when

is reasonably ascertainable, that the city's police department possesses the
property and where it may be claimed. The police department may require payment
by the owner of a reasonable charge to defray costs of storage and care of the

2.17.020: RETURN TO LEGAL OWNER; EXCEPTION:
If the owner appears within ninety (90) days, after receipt of the property of
value of one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more by the city's police department,

of the found property to be published at least once in a newspaper of general
circulation. If, after seven (7) days following the first publication of the
notice, no owner appears and proves his or her ownership of the property and
the person who found or saved the property pays the cost of publication of the
notice, the title to the property shall vest in the person who found or saved
the property, unless the property was found in the course of employment by an
employee of any public agency, in which case the property shall be sold at
public auction. Title to the property shall not vest in the person who found or
saved the property or in the successful bidder at the public auction unless the
cost of publication is first paid to the city, whose police department caused
the notice to be published.

dollars ($250.00), and no owner appears and proves his or her ownership of the
property within ninety (90) days, the title shall vest in the person who found

published in the county, or that thereafter such property shall be transferred
to a local government purchasing and storage agency for sale to the public at
public auction. Such property shall not be redeemable by the owner or the other
person entitled to the possession. If the city determines that such property
transferred to it for sales is needed for a public use, such property may be
retained by the agency and need not be sold. (Ord. 2731, 2011: Ord. 2636 § 1,
2006)
2.17.040: DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY:
   A.   The city's police department may sell such property by public auction,
in the manner and upon the notice of sale of personal property under execution,
if it is a thing that is commonly the subject of sale, when the owner cannot,
with reasonable diligence, be found, or, being found, refuses upon demand to
pay the lawful charges as provided by law in the following cases: 1) when the
thing is in danger of perishing, or of losing the greater value or part of its
value, or 2) when the lawful charges provided by law amount to two-thirds (2/3)
of its value.
   B.   Pursuant to California Welfare And Institutions Code section 217, any
personal property with a value less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) in the
possession of the city's police department which has been unclaimed for at
least ninety (90) days may, instead of being sold at public auction to the
highest bidder pursuant to the provisions of Civil Code section 2080.5, be
donated to the county probation or welfare departments, or to any charitable or
nonprofit organization that is authorized under its articles of incorporation
to participate in a program or activity designed to prevent juvenile
delinquency and which is exempt from income taxation under federal or state
law, or both, for use in any program or activity designed to prevent juvenile
delinquency.
   C.   Before any property subject to this section is donated to the county
probation or welfare departments, or to any charitable or nonprofit
organization, the city's police department shall notify the owner of the
property, if his or her identity is known or can be reasonably ascertained,
that the city possesses the property, and where the property may be claimed.
The owner may be notified by mail, telephone, or by means of a notice published
in a newspaper of general circulation which it determines is most likely to
give notice to the owner of the property. If after notice and for a period of
not less than ninety (90) days, the property is not claimed by the owner, the
property may be disposed of as provided in this chapter.
   D.   Currency and coin, except mounted coin collections, shall be given into
the custody of the city's treasurer in exchange for a receipt therefor. Mounted
coin collections remaining unclaimed shall be disposed of by sealed bid at
public auction, which bid shall exceed the current actual face value of the
coins contained in the collection.
   E.   Such unclaimed property, as provided by law and this chapter, that may
be retained and, if in the opinion of the city's chief of police, would assist
the city's police department in carrying out its mission, may be retained and
any such retained property shall be included in the assets of the city and
entered into the inventory of the police department. (Ord. 2731, 2011: Ord.
2636 § 1, 2006)

2.62.180: PROCEDURE FOR DESIGNATION:
   A.   Designation of nominated resources and designation of districts shall
take place in accordance with the procedures in this section:
      1.   No nominated resource shall be altered, moved, demolished,
subdivided or otherwise permanently changed until eligibility for designation
has been determined or the designation process has been initiated in accordance
with this section and a certificate of appropriateness, if applicable, has been
secured.
      2.   Any person or group may request the designation of a nominated
resource or ten percent (10%) of the property owners in a potential district
may request the designation of a historic and/or scenic or urban conservation
district by submitting an application for such designation to the commission on
forms prescribed by the commission. The commission or city council may also
initiate such proceedings on their own motion.
   B.   The commission shall use the survey process to prepare a written report
regarding the proposed designation including a description of the proposed
designated resource, reasons for its significance, criteria used to determine
eligibility and other appropriate data.
   C.   The commission shall schedule a public hearing as soon as feasible but
not less than twenty one (21) days after the filing of the application. Notice
shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation not less than ten (10)
days before the date set for the commission hearing. The notice shall be filed
with the city clerk and mailed to the applicant and owner.
   D.   In the case of a proposed landmark or historic property, notice of the
date, place, time and purpose of the hearing shall be given by first class mail
to the applicants, owners, and occupants of the improvement at least ten (10)
days prior to the date of the public hearing, using the name and address of
such owners as shown on the latest equalized assessment rolls, and shall be
advertised once in a daily newspaper of general circulation.
   E.   In the case of a proposed historic and/or scenic or urban conservation
district, notice of the date, place, time and purpose of the hearing shall be
given by first class mail to the applicant and owners of all properties within
the proposed district at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the public
hearing, using the name and address of such owners as shown on the latest
equalized assessment rolls, and shall be advertised five (5) consecutive days
in a daily newspaper of general circulation. Notices shall be posted every
three hundred feet (300') within the proposed district. An area is not eligible
for designation if more than forty nine percent (49%) of the property owners as
shown on the last equalized assessment rolls within the potential district
object in writing to the proposed designation. Such objection shall be dated
and signed by the objectors and filed with the commission.
   F.   At the conclusion of the public hearing for the designation of a
proposed landmark, historic property, historic and/or scenic district, or urban
conservation district, the commission shall recommend to the city council in
writing approval in whole or in part, or disapproval in whole or in part of the
proposed designation stating the findings of fact and the reasons for its
recommendation based on the report and information brought out at the public
hearing.

five (45) days consider at a noticed public hearing, the designation by
resolution of each property recommended for designation by the commission.
   H.   Following such designation by the city council, the city clerk shall
within thirty (30) days cause to be recorded in the office of the county
recorder notice that such property has been designated and placed on the city's
register of historic and scenic resources. Following the recordation of such
notice, such property shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter.
If the city council decides not to designate a property, it may review the
proposed designation again after one year, sooner if there are substantial
changes in the application.
   I.   The historic and scenic preservation commission may effect the
amendment or rescission of any designation in the same manner and procedure as
was followed in the original designation. (Ord. 1954 § 8(b), 1986)
2.62.190: DESIGN GUIDELINES:
Following designation, the provisions of Redlands' design guidelines shall
apply to landmarks, historic properties, historic and/or scenic districts and
urban conservation districts. Thereafter, any alteration, improvement,
subdivision, lot split, demolition or moving of any historic resource or sign
associated with a historic resource shall be subject to the review of the city
in accordance with article III of this chapter. The purpose of this review is
to retain buildings and their features as well as features of the site, and
streetscape and landscape features which are important in defining the historic
character of the property or district.
The design guidelines contain recommendations for making exterior changes to
historic resources and are intended to be interpreted most strictly for
landmarks and more broadly for urban conservation districts. (Ord. 1954 § 8(c),
1986)
ARTICLE III. APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS AND CERTIFICATE OF
HARDSHIP
2.62.200: CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS; ALTERATIONS, NEW CONSTRUCTION,
SUBDIVISIONS, LOT SPLITS, LOT LINE ADJUSTMENTS AND SIGNS:
   A.   A certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission or the
preservation officer is required for any exterior alteration to any designated
historic resource, for new construction on the site of a designated historic
resource, and for a lot split, lot line adjustment or subdivision (whether
tentative or parcel map) relating to property which is, or has thereon, a
designated historic resource. A certificate of appropriateness shall be
required to erect, alter or relocate any sign which is in a designated district
or associated with property which is, or has thereon, a designated historic
resource. New construction in a historic and/or scenic district shall also
require a certificate of appropriateness. The community development department
shall direct applicants for building permits and sign permits for designated
and nominated resources to apply for a certificate of appropriateness from the
commission. A nominated historic resource need not be designated before a
certificate of appropriateness can be granted. No building, alteration, lot
split, lot line adjustment, subdivision (whether tentative or parcel map),
demolition or removal shall occur, nor shall any permits be issued therefor,
for any exterior improvement, sign, building, structure or property within the
proposed district, or relative to a proposed historic resource, while the
public hearing for designation or any appeal related thereto is pending, except
after a certificate of appropriateness has been secured. In the event any
contributing or non-contributing building in a designated or pending historic
district is completely demolished or partially demolished without approval of a
demolition permit pursuant to Chapter 15.44 of this Code, all provisions of
Section 15.44.120 of this Code may apply. In the case of a property in a
pending historic district for which a historic resource survey has not been
submitted by a consultant retained by the City and meeting the Secretary of the
Interior's Professional Qualification Standards, the Director of Development
Services shall, as required to establish the applicability of the various
enforcement provisions of Section 15.44.120, determine whether the property is
a contributor or a non-contributor to the pending historic district and, for a
property determined to be a contributor, identify its character defining
features. These determinations are rebuttable presumptions and shall be based
on the information included in the historic district application under
consideration by the City and any additional information or materials as may be
necessary for a complete review.
   B.   Applicants are encouraged first to consult with staff about using the
design guidelines before submitting a formal application. Any application for a
certificate of appropriateness shall be made on a form prescribed by the
preservation officer and shall be accompanied by a fee set by resolution of the
city council. The application shall include the information required by the
preservation officer, including, but not limited to, elevation drawings of the
proposed alterations, samples of proposed colors and materials, plan view for
new construction, and color photographs of all sides of any existing structures
on the site.
   C.   The preservation officer shall use a preservation checklist to
determine if the proposal is minor or major, and shall use the design
guidelines to determine if the proposal is compatible with the existing
resource and surrounding resources. All requests for new construction,
subdivision, lot splits, demolitions, or moving of a historic resource shall be
considered major except in urban conservation districts. Applications for a
certificate of appropriateness for major alterations shall be reviewed by the
commission.
   D.   Certificates of appropriateness for minor improvements where proposed
work does not adversely affect the exterior architectural features of the
historic resource nor adversely affect the character or historical,
architectural, or aesthetic interest or value of the resource and its site, may
be approved by the preservation officer. Alterations in urban conservation
districts may be approved by the preservation officer except that major
alterations to designated landmarks and historic properties within an urban
conservation district shall be reviewed by the commission.
The preservation officer shall inform the commission in writing of decisions
regarding minor alterations. All such decisions go into effect within ten (10)
days following presentation to the commission unless appealed or called up for
review by the commission or city council.
   E.   The preservation officer will determine whether the application
involves a land use decision. If so, the application will be forwarded to the
planning commission for recommendation prior to commission consideration.
   F.   The commission shall hold a public hearing on all applications for
certificates of appropriateness referred to it after notice is given in the
same manner as subsection
2.62.180D of this chapter.
   G.   Using the Redlands' design guidelines, the survey, the designation
report, and the preservation officer's report, the commission shall review any
major alterations, appeals of staff determinations, and subdivisions, lot
splits and new construction within historic and scenic districts and make a
determination with due speed to approve, approve conditionally, or deny the
certificate of appropriateness. Approval requires finding that the action
proposed is consistent with this chapter and will not be detrimental to a
historic resource, or that the action is necessary to correct an unsafe or
dangerous condition pursuant to subsection
2.62.270A of this chapter. In case of hardship, the applicant may apply for a
certificate of hardship pursuant to section
 2.62.220 of this article.
A report of the action taken or determination made shall be forwarded to the
city council and a copy of the decision sent to the applicant by mail and, if
appropriate, to the city departments responsible for issuing necessary permits.
The commission's decision shall be in writing and shall state the findings of
fact and reasons relied upon in reaching its decision.
   H.   The applicant or others may appeal the preservation officer's decision
to the commission, or a commissioner or city council member may call it up for
review within ten (10) days of the commission's receipt of the decision.
The applicant or others may appeal the commission's decision to the city
council within ten (10) days. Appeals shall be made on a form prescribed by the
commission and filed with the city clerk.
   I.   The building inspector shall issue the permit applied for provided that
all requirements of city and state codes, including the historical building
code, are met. If the commission fails to consider an application for a
certificate of appropriateness within sixty (60) days of the date of submission
of the application, the building inspector shall issue the building permit. If
an appeal to the city council is filed within ten (10) days from the date of a
commission decision on an application, no permit shall be issued until the
outcome of the appeal is determined by the city council.
   J.   After the permit has been issued, the administrator of the community
development department or his/her designee shall, from time to time, inspect
the work approved by the commission in order to assure compliance. If the work
is not being performed in accordance with the certificate of appropriateness, a
stop work order shall be issued and all work shall cease.
   K.   A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction
is commenced within eighteen (18) months of the date of issuance. Certificates
of appropriateness may be renewed for a thirty six (36) month period by
applying to the preservation officer. If the project is not completed within
thirty six (36) months after the expiration of the last building permit, a new
certificate of appropriateness shall be required to complete work.
   L.   Any change in the scope of the work which is determined to be a major
alteration which occurs subsequent to the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness shall require issuance of a new certificate of appropriateness.
Certificates of appropriateness for minor alterations shall be issued by the
preservation officer upon the request of the applicant. (Ord. 2899 §3, 2019:
Ord. 2605 §1, 2005: Ord. 1954 §9(a), 1986)
2.62.210: CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS; MOVING:
A certificate of appropriateness for moving of a designated structure shall be
granted if the applicant produces evidence to the satisfaction of the
commission that the following findings can be made:
   A.   The moving will not have a significant effect on the applicable goals
and objectives of the historic and scenic preservation element of Redlands
general plan and on the implementation of this chapter.
   B.   The structure in its original setting is of such interest or quality
that it would reasonably meet federal or state criteria for designation as a
historic landmark and thus should be retained in that setting. (Ord. 1954 § 9
(b), 1986)
2.62.220: CERTIFICATE OF HARDSHIP:
   A.   A certificate of hardship permitting demolition, moving, subdivision, a
lot split, new construction or alteration which has been denied a certificate
of appropriateness may be granted under the conditions described herein.
Applications shall be made in a form prepared by the preservation officer and
the same procedure for public notice, public hearing and appeal as for a
certificate of appropriateness shall apply.
   B.   A certificate of hardship shall be granted only if the owner(s) of the
designated property in question can produce evidence to show that:
      1.   Reasonable use or return on the property is not possible under the
conditions of the certificate of appropriateness; and
      2.   Alternative plans which would be in keeping with the interest of
this chapter are not feasible.
   C.   The commission may delay the decision on the application for a period
not to exceed ninety (90) days to investigate plans to allow for a reasonable
use of or return from the property or other measures to preserve the property,
including selling the property to an individual or group that would preserve
it.
   D.   The commission shall review the evidence and make a written finding,
stating the facts and reasons behind the decision. It shall notify the
applicant by mail of the acceptance or denial of the certificate of hardship.
(Ord. 2467 § 1, 2002: Ord. 1954 § 9(d), 1986)
ARTICLE IV. ADMINISTRATION
2.62.240: APPLICABILITY OF STATE HISTORIC BUILDING CODE:
The state historic building code provides alternative building regulations for
the rehabilitation, preservation, restoration or relocation of structures
designated as historic resource buildings. The historic building code, part 8
of the uniform building code, shall be used for any historic resource through
the city's building permit procedure. (Ord. 1954 § 10, 1986)
2.62.250: PRESERVATION EASEMENTS:
Preservation easements on the facades of buildings designated as a historic
resource may be acquired by the city or nonprofit group through purchase,
donation or condemnation pursuant to California Civil Code 815. (Ord. 1954 §
11, 1986)
2.62.260: BUILDING PERMIT WAIVER:
The city shall waive building permit fees for a historic resource building if
construction costs for structural changes are predicted to be less than ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00), and a prorated reduction of fees for projects
over ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00). (Ord. 2053, 1988: Ord. 1954 § 12, 1986)
2.62.265: MOVING PERMIT WAIVER:
The city shall waive moving permit fees for a designated historic resource
building if the new location is in the city of Redlands and if the new use
approximates the prior use. If the new use is different from the prior use, the
fees shall be reduced on a pro rata basis. All capital improvement impact and
processing fees shall be waived. All physical infrastructure requirements for
the new site shall still be applied. (Ord. 2053, 1988)
2.62.270: MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR:
   A.   This chapter shall not be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance
or repair of exterior architectural features, walls, landscapes, etc., in or on
any designated property that does not involve a change in design, materials or
external appearance thereof, nor does this chapter prevent the construction,
reconstruction, alteration, restoration, demolition or removal of any such
feature when the planning and community development department certifies to the
council that such action is required for the public safety due to unsafe or
dangerous conditions which cannot be rectified through the use of the
California historical building code.
   B.   Every owner of a designated historic resource shall maintain and keep
such resource in a manner that ensures the continued availability of such
premises for lawful and reasonable uses, its continued eligibility for listing

CHAPTER 3.06
GENERAL FUND RESERVE POLICY
SECTION:
3.06.010: Purpose
3.06.020: Policy
3.06.010: PURPOSE:
The city council of the city of Redlands acknowledges its responsibility to
maintain a sufficient level of funds to provide for the continuation of city
services to the community in the event of a natural disaster, downturns in the
economy, the loss of economic resources to the city or any other fiscal
emergency. The purpose of this chapter is to formalize the city council's
desire to ensure sound financial management of the city by establishing a
reserve fund policy for the city's general fund. (Ord. 2660 § 1, 2007)
3.06.020: POLICY:
It shall be the fiscal policy of the city council:
   A.   To adopt a balanced budget on an annual basis. For purposes of this
chapter, a "balanced budget" is defined as a condition wherein total financial
sources, excluding any available beginning fund balance and any established
reserves, meet or exceed the total financial requirements of the city,
excluding onetime capital expenditures. Except as otherwise provided for in
this section, this "pay as you go" approach mandates that any increase in
financial requirements, decrease in financial sources, or a combination of the
two, that would result in a budget imbalance will require cost cutting and/or
revenue enhancements, rather than spending reserves to support ongoing
operations. Cost cutting measures may include reductions in capital
expenditures, reductions in staffing levels, salaries and benefits through the
negotiation process, or reductions in expenditures for equipment, supplies and
services. Expenditure reductions may result in reduced service levels to the
community.
   B.   To establish a reserve fund equivalent to a minimum of twelve percent
(12%) of the general fund financial requirements. The term "financial
requirements", for purposes of this chapter, is defined as the sum of approved
operating expenditures and operating transfers out. Onetime (nonrecurring)
expenditures shall not be used in the required reserve calculation.
   C.   That the city council may, by four (4) affirmative votes of its total
membership, utilize the reserve fund described by this chapter only when faced
with an unforeseen or uncontrollable event affecting the city's fiscal
situation. Examples of an unforeseen or uncontrollable event include, but are
not in any manner limited to, the following:
      1.   Federal or state budget cuts that financially impact the city;
      2.   Local revenue shortfalls due to a major business closure or
relocation;
      3.   Legislative or judicial mandates to provide new or expanded services
or programs; that in total will cost the city two hundred thousand dollars
($200,000.00) or more; and
      4.   Natural and civil disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods,
riots and health epidemics. (Ord. 2660 § 1, 2007)

provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which

subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which

THE CITY. (Prior code § 2500)
3.20.020: PURPOSE:
The city council of the city declares that this chapter is adopted to achieve
the following, among other purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be
interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:
   A.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the
requirements and limitations contained in part 1.5 of division 2 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code;
   B.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates provisions
identical to those of the sales and use tax law of the state insofar as those
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained
in part 1.5 of division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;
   C.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and provides
a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the state board of
equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and
requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the state board of equalization in
administering and collecting the California state sales and use taxes;
   D.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a
manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of part
1.5 of division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of
collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of
record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this
chapter. (Prior code §§ 2501–2501.4)
3.20.030: RATE:
The rate of sales tax and use tax imposed by this chapter shall be one percent
(1%). (Prior code § 2501.5)
3.20.040: OPERATIVE DATE; CONTRACT WITH STATE:
This chapter shall be operative on January 1, 1976. Prior to the operative date
this city shall contract with the state board of equalization to perform all
functions incident to the administration and operation of this sales and use
tax ordinance; provided, that if this city shall not have contracted with the
state board of equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless
so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the
first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than
the first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption hereof.
(Prior code § 2502)
3.20.050: SALES TAX; IMPOSITION:
For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail a tax is
imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate stated in section
3.20.030 of this chapter of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of
all tangible personal property sold at retail in the city on and after the
operative date of this chapter. (Prior code § 2503)
3.20.060: PLACE OF SALE; DETERMINATION:
For the purpose of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place
of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is
delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out of state destination or to a
common carrier for delivery to an out of state destination. The gross receipts
from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject
to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is
made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state
or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail
sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be
prescribed and adopted by the state board of equalization. (Prior code §
2503.1)
3.20.070: USE TAX; IMPOSITION:
An excise tax is imposed on the storage, use or other consumption in the city
of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and after the
operative date of this chapter for storage, use or other consumption in the
city at the rate stated in section
3.20.030 of this chapter of the sales price of the property. The sales price
shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to state sales or
use tax regardless of the place to which delivery is made. (Prior code § 2504)
3.20.080: ADOPTION OF STATE LAW PROVISIONS:
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter and except insofar as they are
inconsistent with the provisions of part 1.5 of division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, all of the provisions of part 1 of division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code are adopted and made a part of this chapter as though fully set
forth herein. (Prior code § 2505)
3.20.090: LIMITATIONS ON ADOPTION OF STATE LAW:
In adopting the provisions of part 1 of division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code, wherever the state is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name
of the city shall be substituted therefor. The substitution, however shall not
be made when the word "state" is used as part of the title of the state
controller, the state treasurer, the state board of control, the state board of
equalization, the state treasury, or the constitution of the state of
California; the substitution shall not be made when the result of that
substitution would require action to be taken by or against the city, or any
agency thereof rather than by or against the state board of equalization, in
performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this
chapter; the substitution shall not be made in those sections, including, but
not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of
the state of California, where the result of the substitution would be to
provide an exemption from the tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use
or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be
exempt from the tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain
subject to tax by the state under the provisions of part 1 of division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code, or to impose the tax with respect to certain sales,
storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not
be subject to tax by the state under the provisions of that code; the
substitution shall not be made in sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last
sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code; and the substitution shall not be made for the word "state" in the phrase
"retailer engaged in business in this state" in section 6203 or in the
definition of that phrase in section 6203. (Prior code § 2505.1)

This chapter shall be known as the UNIFORM TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX ORDINANCE OF
THE CITY. (Prior code § 2600)
3.24.020: DEFINITIONS; GENERALLY:
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in sections
3.24.030 through
 3.24.090 of this chapter shall govern the construction of this chapter. (Prior
code § 2601)
3.24.030: HOTEL DEFINED:
"Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied
or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel,
studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house,
dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome located outside a mobilehome
park, or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or
portion thereof. "Hotel" does not mean any hospital, convalescent home or
sanitarium. (Ord. 1921 § 1, 1986: prior code § 2601.2)
3.24.040: OCCUPANCY DEFINED:
"Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession,
of any room or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes. (Prior code § 2601.3)
3.24.050: OPERATOR DEFINED:
"Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the
capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any
other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing
agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall
also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the
same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of
this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both. (Prior code § 2601.6)
3.24.060: PERSON DEFINED:
"Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association,
social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate,
trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or
combination acting as a unit. (Prior code § 2601.1)
3.24.070: RENT DEFINED:
"Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the
occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money,
goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property
and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.
(Prior code § 2601.5)
3.24.080: TAX ADMINISTRATOR DEFINED:
"Tax administrator" means the city's finance director, or the director's
designee. (Ord. 2684 § 2, 2007: prior code § 2601.7)
3.24.090: TRANSIENT DEFINED:
"Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to
occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other
agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less,
counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person occupying
space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty
(30) days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the
operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In
determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time
extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date hereof may be
considered. "Transient" does not include a mobilehome tenant when the tenant is
an employee of the owner or operator of the mobilehome. (Ord. 1921 § 2, 1986:
prior code § 2601.4)
3.24.100: IMPOSITION:
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and
shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the rent charged by the
operator. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which
is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient
shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If
the rent is paid in installments, the proportionate share of the tax shall be
paid with each installment.
The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the
hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel,
the city may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the city's finance
director, or the director's designee. (Ord. 2684 § 2, 2007: Ord. 2083 § 1,
1989: prior code § 2610)
3.24.110: EXEMPTIONS:
   A.   No tax shall be imposed upon:
      1.   Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond
the power of the city to impose the tax herein provided;
      2.   Any federal or state officer or employee when on official business;
      3.   Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by
reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty;
      4.   A corporation or association organized and operated exclusively for
religious, charitable or educational purposes, or for one or more such
purposes, no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any
private shareholder or individual;
      5.   Where the rent is at the rate of two dollars ($2.00) a day or less.
   B.   No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the
time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by
the tax administrator. (Prior code §§ 2620–2620.5)
3.24.120: OPERATOR; DUTIES:
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent
and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount
of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each
transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of
a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly,
that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator,
or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be
refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter. (Prior code § 2630)
3.24.130: REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE; ISSUANCE:
Within thirty (30) days after the effective date hereof, or within thirty (30)
days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel
renting occupancy to transients shall register such hotel with the tax
administrator and obtain from him a transient occupancy registration
certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.
Such certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person
named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform
Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for
the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and
remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not
authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful
business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly
complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those
requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this
City. This certificate does not constitute a permit.
(Prior code § 2632)
3.24.150: REPORT AND REMITTANCE:
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close
of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which
may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax
administrator, on forms provided by him of the total rents charged and received
and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the
return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the
tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting
periods for any certificate holder if he seems it necessary in order to ensure
collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return.
Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any
reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held
in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax
administrator. (Prior code § 2633)
3.24.160: DETERMINATION OF TAX:
If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect such tax and to make, within
the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed
in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to
base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator shall
procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base
the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator
who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and
remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the
tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. If such determination
is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by
serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of
address. Such operator may within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of
such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing
on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not
made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any,
determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator
shall give not less than five (5) days' written notice in the manner prescribed
herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice
why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest
and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why
such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such
hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and
shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed
herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and
penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15)
days unless an appeal is taken as provided in section
3.24.170 of this chapter. (Prior code § 2641)
3.24.170: APPEAL OF DECISION:
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to
the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen (15)
days of the serving or mailing of the determination of the tax due. The council
shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal and the city clerk shall
give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The
findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon
the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing.
Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the
service of notice. (Prior code § 2642)
3.24.180: RECORDATION:

operator. (Prior code § 2651)

directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to

3.41.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for the review of the
city's water and wastewater rates, charges, and revenue requirements on a
regular basis. The water and wastewater utilities must remain fiscally self-
supporting, and require rates and charges to be established that provide
sufficient revenue to recover the reasonable costs incurred by providing water
and wastewater service to its customers. A regular review will provide the city
with the basis necessary to meet fiscal obligations to ensure ongoing fiscal
stability. (Ord. 2530 § 1, 2002)
3.41.020: REVIEW OF RATES AND CHARGES:
   A.   The city council has formed a utilities advisory committee comprised of
city water and wastewater utility customers representing the various customer
classes. The committee is charged with reviewing the current water and
wastewater rates, charges, and revenue requirements on a biannual basis. The
primary goals of the utilities advisory committee are the development of water
and wastewater rates that provide revenues that: 1) recover costs reasonably
borne; 2) are equitable to all customer classes; 3) are in compliance with all
state and federal regulations; and 4) are easily explained to customers. Based
on the review, the committee will prepare and present recommendations to the
city council regarding rates and charges for water and wastewater service
provided by the city. (Ord. 2608 § 1, 2005: Ord. 2530 § 1, 2002)

referred to in the "Water and Wastewater Rate Study Update - 1991" as prepared
by the Public Works Department and approved by the City, which identifies
facilities and improvements required to serve new development that will be
required to obtain City sewer service. (Ord. 2880, 2019)
3.44.030: CHARGES:
The specific amounts of the sewer capital improvement charges shall be approved
by the City Council and shall be paid as a condition of issuing building
permits, or other City approved entitlement, as determined within the sole
discretion of the City, for buildings containing plumbing fixtures and required
to have new sewer services tapping into the City's sewage system or increasing
flow into the City's sewer system as estimated by the City. The charges shall

nonpotable water resources, nonpotable water production, transmission, storage,
and other capital facilities and appurtenances over and above the eight inch
(8") distribution mains and appurtenances used to serve property frontage. The
city council finds that the construction of nonpotable water capital facilities
benefits all new development which is required to obtain nonpotable water
service from the city. This chapter shall establish the method of collecting
fees for financing construction of the nonpotable water capital facilities
other than those facilities which are provided through the approval of
subdivisions, parcel map, or other development entitlements conditioned under
title 18, "Zoning Regulations", of this code. All interest on the cash balance
of the fund shall accrue to the nonpotable water capital improvement fund.

SECTION:
3.70.010: Establishment
3.70.020: Definitions
3.70.030: Charges
3.70.040: Adjustment Of Charges
3.70.010: ESTABLISHMENT:
   A.   The Solid Waste Capital Improvement Fund is established to implement
the Redlands general plan and to finance the capital cost of solid waste
capital facilities and equipment to provide new capacity required to serve
development requiring solid waste service from the City. Included are landfill,
materials recovery and transfer station facilities, solid waste collection
equipment, transfer equipment and other capital facilities equipment.
   B.   The City Council finds that the capital cost of solid waste capital
facilities and equipment benefits all development which is required to obtain
solid waste service from the City. This chapter shall establish the method of
collecting fees for financing the capital costs of the solid waste capital
facilities and equipment other than those facilities which are provided through
the approval of subdivision or parcel maps, or other developments conditioned
under title 18 of this Code. All interest on the cash balance of the fund shall
accrue to the Solid Waste Capital Improvement Fund. (Ord. 2880, 2019)

definitions shall apply:
   ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT: An attached or a detached residential dwelling unit
which provides complete independent living facilities for one or more persons.
It shall include permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking,
and sanitation on the same parcel as the single-family dwelling is situated. An
accessory dwelling unit also includes the following:
   A.   An efficiency unit, as defined in section 17958.1 of the Health and
Safety Code.
   B.   A manufactured home, as defined in section 18007 of the Health and
Safety Code.
   ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY: The Director of Municipal Utilities and
Engineering of the City.
   DEVELOPMENT: Any use to which land is put, building or other alteration of
land and construction incidental thereto.
   MOBILEHOME: A vehicle, other than a motor vehicle, designed or used for
human habitation, for carrying persons and property on its own structure, and
for being drawn by a motor vehicle.
   MOBILEHOME PARK: Any area or tract of land where one or more mobilehome lots
are rented or leased or held out for rent or lease to accommodate mobilehomes
used for human habitation.
   MULTIPLE-FAMILY DWELLING UNIT: A structure designed and used for the
occupancy of two (2) or more families.
   PERSON: A natural person, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns
and also includes a firm, partnership or corporation, and its or their
successors or assigns, or the agent of any of the aforesaid.
   SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING UNIT: A structure or portion thereof designed
exclusively for the occupancy of one family.
   SOLID WASTE CAPITAL FACILITIES: The solid waste facilities identified or
referred to in the "Solid Waste Rate Study - 1991" as prepared by the Public
Works Department and approved by the City, which identifies facilities and
improvements required to serve new development that will be required to obtain
City solid waste service.
   STRUCTURE: Any building or improvement artificially built up or composed of
parts joined together in some definite manner, including, but not limited to,
dwellings, commercial structures, industrial structures, schools, churches or
hotels. (Ord. 2880, 2019)
3.70.030: CHARGES:
   A.   The solid waste capital improvement charge for the following categories
shall be approved by the City Council and shall be paid as a condition of
issuance of building permits for buildings required to have new solid waste
services from the City's solid waste system or increasing the solid waste
stream into the City's solid waste system as estimated by the City. The charges
shall be those in effect on the date the permit is issued.
      1.   Accessory Dwelling Units: The charge for this category shall be per
accessory dwelling unit.
      2.   Single-Family Dwelling Units: The charge for this category shall be
per dwelling or unit.
      3.   Multiple-Family Dwelling Units, Apartments, And Mobilehome Park Lots
Or Space: The charge for this category shall be per dwelling or unit or
mobilehome space.
      4.   Nonresidential Development: The charge for this category shall be a
charge per pound per day estimated solid waste as estimated by the Public Works
Department.
      5.   All solid waste capital improvement charges shall be credited to the
Solid Waste Capital Improvement Fund.
   B.   1.   The owner of the property shall pay to the City the difference in
the solid waste capital improvement charges calculated on the basis of
currently established charges.
         a.   If a building or the use of a building on a parcel of property
which building had been served by the solid waste system is charged in a way
that would make the solid waste capital improvement charge greater; or
         b.   If a building is replaced on a parcel of property, which building
had been served by the solid waste system, and the replacement building would
have a greater solid waste capital improvement charge than the building
replaced.
   The difference in charges shall be due prior to final approval of a
conditional use permit, if applicable, or, if not, prior to building permit
issuance. If not collectible in this manner, such difference shall be invoiced
with the next billing for solid waste service and collectible in the same
manner as the billing for solid waste service.
      2.   If a building or the use of a building on a parcel of property is
changed in any way that would make the solid waste capital improvement charge
less, no refund shall be made, but the property shall retain the amount of
credit established for its previous use. (Ord. 2962, 2024: Ord. 2880, 2019)
3.70.040: ADJUSTMENT OF CHARGES:
On July 1 of each fiscal year, the City's Finance Director, in coordination
with the City's Municipal Utilities and Engineering Director, shall make annual
adjustments to the specific amounts of the solid waste capital improvement fees
approved by the City Council by a percentage equal to the percentage change in
the construction cost index of the Engineering News-Record's "Construction Cost
Index" - twenty (20) cities annual average for the preceding twelve (12) month
period. The purpose of this adjustment is to offset the effects of inflation
related construction cost increases or any deflation related decreases. If this
index should cease publication, the Finance Director shall use any appropriate
official index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or similar agency
as may then exist or may then be most nearly equivalent thereto. (Ord. 2962,
2024: Ord. 2880, 2019)
CHAPTER 3.72
NON-RESIDENT EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE FIRST RESPONDER FEE
SECTION:
3.72.010: Purpose
3.72.020: Definitions
3.72.030: Emergency Medical Service First Responder Fee
3.72.040: Fee Collection
3.72.050: No Effect On Emergency First Responder Services
3.72.060: No Waiver Of Other Means Of Cost Recovery
3.72.070: Appeals
3.72.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to recover city costs of providing emergency
medical services, including, but not limited to, non-resident first responder
services for individual medical assessments that result in transport, and
individual medical assessments that do not result in transport. This chapter
shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with applicable law. The fees
imposed pursuant to this chapter are for the purpose of recovering the cost of
certain city operating expenses, including, but not limited to, employee wage
rate and benefits, medical supplies, and the contracting of services with
specialized firms or individuals, which are reasonably related to the actual
and on-going expenses incurred by the city for the services and expenses
described in this section. (Ord. 2904 § 1, 2019)
3.72.020: DEFINITIONS:
For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply:
   FIRE CHIEF: The chief of the city of Redlands fire department, or his or her
designee.
   FIRST RESPONDER FEE: The fee established by resolution of the city council
pursuant to this chapter, and charged to each non-resident to whom the city
provides medical emergency first responder services to recover the costs for
providing such services.
   INSURER: The recipient's medical insurance provider.
   RECIPIENT: The person to whom the city provides medical emergency first
responder services.
   SERVICES: Medical emergency first responder services provided by the city.
(Ord. 2904 § 1, 2019)
3.72.030: EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE FIRST RESPONDER FEE:
   A.   Fee Amount Established: The city council shall, by resolution, adopt
and amend from time to time a non-resident first responder fee to recover the
actual and reasonable costs incurred by the fire department in providing
services and processing the non-resident first responder fee, including
administrative or enforcement costs.
   B.   Fee Applies To All: The non-resident first responder fee shall be
charged to each city non-resident who receives services during a single
incident. (Ord. 2904 § 1, 2019)
3.72.040: FEE COLLECTION:
   A.   Policies For Discharging Accountability:
      1.   The fire chief will develop policies and procedures for invoicing,
billing, and receiving payments for each fee charged under this chapter and
will coordinate the administration with any contracted third party service
provider, if applicable. The policies and procedures will include a process to
discharge from accountability accounts that are not collectible.
      2.   The city shall accept the payment, if any, from the insurer as the
full payment for the recipient's first responder fee obligation and the city
shall not require the recipient to pay for any portion of the first responder
fee not paid by the insurer.
   B.   Administration Of The Fee: The fire chief may delegate all or some of
the tasks required for the administration of the non-resident first responder
fee. Administration of the non-resident first responder fee will consist of
tasks including, but not limited to, tracking of emergency medical first
responder services provided by the fire department, identification of
financially responsible parties, calculation of total fees to be charged,
invoicing and payment collection, and appeals, if permitted. The city manager
may approve of delegation of administration of the non-resident first responder
fee by a contracted third party.
   C.   Invoicing: When the fire department provides emergency medical first
responder services to a non-resident, the city, or its designee, shall bill the
non-resident and the insurer, if any, for payment of the non-resident first
responder fee. In the case of a minor, the city, or its designee, shall bill
the parent or guardian of the recipient who received the services and to the
insurer, if the person, or his or her representative, has identified to the
fire department the insurer to which the invoice should be sent.
(Ord. 2904 § 1, 2019)
3.72.050: NO EFFECT ON EMERGENCY FIRST RESPONDER SERVICES:
This chapter neither expands nor limits services. Nothing in this chapter
relieves the fire department from providing services. These services will
continue to be provided without regard to whether a person is insured by an
insurer, has the ability to pay the non-resident first responder fee, or has or
has not paid the non-resident first responder fee in the past.
(Ord. 2904 § 1, 2019)
3.72.060: NO WAIVER OF OTHER MEANS OF COST RECOVERY:
This chapter does not preclude the city from pursuing any additional means of
cost recovery permitted by law.
(Ord. 2904 § 1, 2019)
3.72.070: APPEALS:
   A.   Any person wishing to contest an invoice regarding the non-resident
first responder fee imposed under this chapter must submit a written request
for reconsideration to the fire chief explaining the reasons for requesting a
reconsideration within thirty (30) days of the date of receiving the invoice
for the non-resident first responder fee. The fire chief will review the
written request and, based on that review, make a final decision on the request
and notify the person in writing within thirty (30) days of receiving the
request to reconsider.
   B.   If the aggrieved party wishes to contest the fire chief's decision, the
person may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal pursuant to
chapter 1.06 of this code.

chief within seventy two (72) hours upon receipt of notice to do so from the
chief. Such report shall contain all information pertaining to the activation
of the alarm and planned corrective action, if any. Where the alarm system is
serviced by an alarm business, the report shall be made by such business and a
copy forwarded to the alarm user by the alarm business. The investigation of
any false alarm by any person other than members of the police department shall
also result in the notification to the alarm user that such an incident
occurred and shall not relieve the alarm user or alarm business of the formal
report responsibility provided for in this section. (Ord. 2457 § 1, 2000)
5.12.180: FALSE ALARM RESPONSE FEES:
   A.   A false burglary alarm response fee shall be paid to the police
department after three (3) false alarms have been received from any one source
or from any one alarm system within any consecutive three hundred sixty five
(365) day period. No fee shall be charged for false burglary alarms occurring
within thirty (30) days following initial installation of any new alarm
provided the system otherwise complies with the requirements of this chapter.
The false burglary alarm response fee shall be in such amount as established by
the city council. A higher false burglary alarm fee may be established for each
additional false burglary alarm during any consecutive three hundred sixty five
(365) day period.
   B.   A false robbery alarm response fee shall be paid to the police
department after two (2) false robbery alarms have been received from any one
source or from any one alarm system within any consecutive three hundred sixty
five (365) day period. The false robbery alarm fee shall be established by the
city council. A higher false robbery alarm fee may be established for each
additional false robbery alarm during any consecutive three hundred sixty five
(365) day period.
   C.   All fees established and/or levied by this section shall be paid to the
police department within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice rendered
for said fee by the holder of the alarm user's permit or the owner of the
premises upon which the subject alarm system is located if no permit has been
issued for such system. (Ord. 2457 § 1, 2000)
5.12.190: AUDIBLE ALARM REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Every person maintaining an audible alarm which does not contain a
mechanical means to effect an automatic turnoff of the alarm within fifteen
(15) minutes after it is first activated, shall post a notice containing the
names and telephone numbers of persons to be notified to render repairs or
service during any hour of the day or night. Such notice shall be posted near
the alarm in such a position as to be legible from the ground level adjacent to
the building.
   B.   If service is unavailable, audible alarms which have emitted an alarm
signal in excess of thirty (30) minutes are declared to be nuisances, and the
police department may cause such alarm to be disconnected by a registered alarm
agent, with the full cost to be paid by the alarm user.
   C.   All audible alarms installed within the city shall be equipped with
mechanical means to effect an automatic turnoff and reset. (Ord. 2457 § 1,
2000)
5.12.200: ALARM SYSTEM INSPECTION:
Each alarm system shall be inspected annually. A report of such inspection
shall be submitted to the chief by the alarm business servicing or maintaining
such alarm system. Where a proprietor alarm is involved the report shall be
made by the permittee. The inspection report shall be submitted concurrent with
the application for renewal of license or permit or within sixty (60) days of
alarm system installation. (Ord. 2457 § 1, 2000)
5.12.210: MONITORING SERVICES:
Every alarm business which monitors an alarm system located within the city
shall maintain on file a current listing of all such alarm systems including
the alarm permit number and the name, address and telephone number of the
individual or individuals from whom entry to the premises may be obtained. This
information shall be available to the police department upon request of any
authorized representative thereof. The alarm permit number assigned to an alarm
system by the police department shall be given to the police dispatcher at the
time an alarm is reported to the police communications center by an alarm
company, a central monitoring station, a telephone answering service or any
other business that monitors and reports alarms. (Ord. 2457 § 1, 2000)
5.12.220: TELEPHONE DEVICES:
No person shall use or cause to be used any telephone device or telephone
attachment that is activated electronically to automatically dial a telephone
line of the city government and then emit a tone or prerecorded message to
report any emergency condition. (Ord. 2457 § 1, 2000)
5.12.230: USE OF PANIC BUTTON:
A burglary or robbery panic button shall only be used when there is a threat of
life or property. It is unlawful to use such panic button to merely summon the
police. (Ord. 2457 § 1, 2000)
5.12.240: ENFORCEMENT:
The conviction or punishment for violations of the provisions of this chapter,
or for failing to secure a permit as required by this chapter, shall not
relieve such person from paying the permit fee due and unpaid at the time of
such conviction, nor in the alternative shall the payment of any permit fee
prevent criminal prosecution for the violation of the provisions of this
chapter. All remedies shall be cumulative, and the use of one or more remedies
by the city shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of
enforcing the provisions of this chapter. The amount of any permit and alarm
fees shall be deemed a debt to the city. An action may be commenced in the name
of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction for the amount of any
delinquent fees. All permit and alarm fees shall be deemed delinquent thirty
(30) days after they are due and payable. (Ord. 2457 § 1, 2000)
5.12.250: NUISANCE ABATEMENT:
The chief may declare an alarm system at a specific location to be a nuisance
if such alarm system actuates excessive false alarms. The city council finds
and determines that four (4) false burglary alarms within one year (365 days)
or three (3) false robbery alarms within three hundred sixty five (365) days is
excessive and thereby constitutes a public nuisance. The chief shall not
consider any false alarm in this computation of nuisance alarms if such false
alarm was generated by an earthquake, high intensity wind, unusual act of
nature or general power outage. Nuisance alarms shall be considered those that
are the result of the negligence of the alarm user, the agents or employees of
the alarm user, or a defect in the alarm system. (Ord. 2457 § 1, 2000)
5.12.260: NONRESPONSE POLICY:
The chief shall have the authority to institute an immediate nonresponse policy
for any violation of sections contained in this chapter. Such policy shall
provide that the city's police personnel shall not respond to future alarms at
such premises. Such nonresponse policy shall be taken only after adequate
written notification has been given to the alarm user and any alarm company
involved. (Ord. 2457 § 1, 2000)
5.12.270: VERIFIED RESPONSE REQUIRED:
   A.   The police department will not respond to property alarms, intrusion
alarms, or burglar alarms unless they are verified alarms as defined by this
section. In reporting such an alarm to the police department, an alarm company
operator shall confirm that the alarm is a verified alarm. In the first
instance, it shall be presumed that an alarm company operator who reports an
alarm as a verified alarm has actually verified that alarm. Even if an alarm is
verified, exigent circumstances may arise that prevent the police department
from responding to verified alarm activations due to the availability of
resources. The police department is under no legal duty or obligation
whatsoever to respond to any property alarm, intrusion alarm, or burglary alarm
activation, and may respond in its discretion, as police resources allow and as
police department supervision and management deem appropriate.
   B.   An alarm company operator who reports a verified burglary alarm to the
police department is required to maintain the evidence it used to verify that
the burglary alarm activation, or a written report thereof, for not less than
twelve (12) months from the date of the alarm activation, except as to
recordings of remote audio or video surveillance, which must be maintained for
not less than sixty (60) days. Because the police department will accept the
alarm company operator's representation in the first instance that it verified
the alarm before reporting it to the police department as a verified alarm, the
police department shall have the right to audit the alarm company operator to
ensure that the alarm company operator is not misrepresenting that fact to the
police department. If the police department has probable cause to believe that
an alarm company operator has misrepresented an unverified alarm to be a
verified burglary alarm, it may send the alarm company operator written notice
of the date and time of the reported verified burglary alarm and request the
alarm company operator produce to the police department the evidence and/or
report substantiating the verification of that burglary alarm activation. The
alarm company operator shall produce the requested items to the police
department within fourteen (14) days of the mailing of notice. Should the alarm
company operator fail to maintain the evidence and/or report for the specified
period of time or fail to produce the requested items to the police department,
the alarm company operator will not be entitled to the presumption set forth in
section A above. Should the alarm company operator intentionally destroy, fail
to maintain for the time period specified above, or discard the evidence and/or
report, or intentionally fail to produce the requested items to the police
department that have been maintained and do exist, and in that event the alarm
company operator shall be presumed to have made a fraudulent verification. Such
presumption may be overcome by the alarm company operator producing evidence
that in requesting a police response to the burglary alarm in issue, it did not
know that the alarm was unverified.
   C.   Police department response to robbery alarms, panic alarms, and medic
alarms does not require a prior verified response. Exigent circumstances may
arise, however, that prevent the police department from responding to robbery,
panic, and medic alarm activations due to the availability of resources. The
police department is under no legal duty or obligation whatsoever to respond to
any robbery alarm, panic alarm or medic alarm activation and may respond, in
its discretion, as police resources allow and as police department supervision
and management deem appropriate. (Ord. 2915, 2020)

This chapter shall be known as the PEDDLING, SOLICITATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF
ADVERTISING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY. (Prior code § 41501)
5.36.020: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The city council of Redlands does find, determine and declare:
   A.   The distribution of commercial advertising material upon residential
property without their permission in the city creates widespread litter which
is unsightly; inadvertently advertises the absence of occupants of the property
to the dissolute or criminal elements of society, thereby increasing the
possibility of criminal activity and the resulting police problems to the city,
and places an unnecessary burden upon the residents and city to properly
dispose of the commercial advertising materials;
   B.   Door to door commercial solicitation of unwilling recipients by
salesmen of goods and services jeopardizes the right of residents in the city
to enjoy the privacy of their homes and serious public offenses have been
committed by purported solicitors;
   C.   The practice of distributing, depositing, placing, throwing,
scattering, and casting advertising matter in or upon motor vehicles and in or
upon the public streets and in public places, except to persons who are willing
to receive the same, creates a serious police problem and a threat to the
public safety in that such material is permitted to fall and is thrown upon
parking areas, public streets and public places, and is blown about and
accumulated as trash and creates fire hazards and unsightly conditions, and
requires extra expense to remove such trash;
   D.   Such practices are injurious and inimical to the public health, safety
and welfare of residents of the city and such problems are becoming
increasingly direct and substantial;
   E.   Such practices are, therefore, declared to be a public nuisance;
   F.   Such practices should be prohibited to protect the public health,
safety and general welfare of the residents of the city. (Prior code § 41502)
5.36.030: MANNER OF DISTRIBUTION IN PUBLIC PLACE:

5.36.040: PERMISSION REQUIRED TO PLACE ON AUTOMOBILE:

(Prior code § 41504)
5.36.050: DISTRIBUTION ON PRIVATE PROPERTY:
No person may distribute, circulate, or deliver any newspaper, written
handbill, circular, advertising literature or materials upon any private

such objection which shall include his name, the address where no distributions
are to be made, the declarant's capacity to make such objection, and the name
of the distribution to which he objects;
   B.   The city clerk shall maintain on file all objections by residents to
the distribution of any newspaper, or other matter referred to in section
5.36.050 of this chapter, and shall have available on the first Monday of each
month, for the benefit of all licensed distributors, a list of addresses of
those persons having filed objections. Such list shall contain the name of the
specific newspaper, or other matter referred to in section
5.36.050 of this chapter, objected to and the address where no such
distributions are to be made. (Prior code § 41506)
5.36.070: DISTRIBUTORS REQUIRED TO USE LIST OF OBJECTORS:
It shall be the duty of each and every distributor of a newspaper or other
matter referred to in section
5.36.050 of this chapter, to secure the monthly list of those objecting to its
distribution and shall be held to have notice of such list as of the date such
list is made available. (Prior code § 41507)

(Rep. by Ord. 2551 § 1, 2003)

RENT STABILIZATION FOR MOBILEHOME PARKS

5.48.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   On December 15, 1981, the city council of the city of Redlands
determined that a serious shortage of mobilehome rental spaces within the city
had created a virtual monopoly in the rental of mobilehome park spaces. In
response to this lack of available rental space, the city declared it necessary
to protect the owner-occupants of mobilehomes from unreasonable rent increases
while recognizing the need for mobilehome park owners to receive a just and
reasonable return on their property. Accordingly, this chapter was adopted to
provide for mobilehome park rent stabilization within the city.
   B.   Mobilehome owner-occupants, unlike apartment renters or residents of
other rental stock, are in a unique position of having made a substantial
investment to purchase a mobilehome for which they must rent a space in a
mobilehome park. They also make investments in maintaining and improving their
homes as well as in landscaping the rental space. Alternative sites for the
relocation of mobilehomes are difficult to find due to the shortage of vacant
spaces, restrictions on age, size or style of mobilehomes permitted in many
parks and the requirements related to the installation of mobilehomes,
including permits, landscaping and site preparation. Additionally, the cost of
moving a mobilehome is substantial and the risk of damage is significant. Thus,
moving a mobilehome is rarely a feasible option if the rent for a mobilehome
park space becomes excessive. The result of these conditions is the creation of
a captive market of mobilehome owner-occupants. The immobility of mobilehomes
and the shortage of rental spaces, in turn, creates an imbalance in the
bargaining relationship between mobilehome park owners and mobilehome owner-
occupants. Because mobilehomes are often owned by senior citizens, persons on
fixed incomes and persons of low and moderate income, excessive rent increases
fall upon those individuals with particular harshness. (Ord. 2458 § 1, 2000:

lease. For determining whether twenty five percent (25%) of the spaces share an
anniversary date, only those spaces subject to this chapter shall be counted.

occupants. The notice for each mobilehome owner-occupant shall indicate the new

that an application for a discretionary rent increase has been filed with the
city, and shall state that a copy of the application and all supporting
documentation is on file at the owners office in the affected park and may be
photocopied at the mobilehome owner-occupants expense. The application for a
discretionary rent increase will not be effective unless accompanied by proof

either personally or by mail, with the notice required herein. If approved, the
discretionary rent increase shall take effect no sooner than one year after the
date of the last rent increase within the mobilehome park.
   B.   Upon the filing of an application for a discretionary rent increase
which satisfies the requirements of this chapter, the commission shall conduct
a public meeting within thirty (30) days. At that meeting, if the commission is
persuaded upon the testimony of any affected mobilehome owner-occupant that the
mobilehome owner-occupant has been refused the opportunity to review and
photocopy background documentation which the mobilehome park owner intends to
submit in support of the application, the commission shall adjourn the meeting
for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed thirty (30) days, and instruct
the mobilehome park owner to permit full review and reproduction of the
documentation as required by this chapter. At any such meeting, if the
commission is persuaded upon written proof or oral testimony that the majority
of the affected mobilehome owner-occupants in the park agree to the proposed
discretionary increase, the commission shall authorize the increase as proposed
and such determination shall be final.
   C.   In the event the commission determines that an application for a
discretionary rent increase shall be submitted to arbitration pursuant to the

shall, within ten (10) days of the commissions determination, pay to the city
the sum of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) as a deposit towards the city's
actual costs in retaining an arbitrator and holding the arbitration
proceedings. The deposit shall be replenished, from time to time, as deemed
necessary by city staff to ensure that the city's actual ongoing costs are
paid. In the event payment of the deposit is not made, or the applicant for the
discretionary rent increase fails to make a required replenishment of the
deposit, the city may, in its sole discretion, cease the arbitration
proceedings and have no further obligation or any liability to the applicant
for the discretionary rent increase. (Ord. 2532 § 6, 2003: Ord. 2458 § 7, 2000:
Ord. 2420 § 1, 1999: Ord. 2207 § 1, 1993)
5.48.080: ARBITRATION:
   A.   Upon considering an application for a discretionary rent increase, if
the commission is persuaded that a majority of the tenants do not agree to the
proposed increase, the commission shall within ten (10) days select an
arbitrator from a list of arbitrators approved by the city council to conduct
arbitration of the disputed application for a discretionary rent increase. If
possible, the commission should select from the list a retired judge to serve
as arbitrator, but the commission shall not be bound to do so.
   B.   Upon selecting an arbitrator, the commission or its designee shall
transmit copies of the application for a discretionary rent increase and any
other supporting documentation filed by the mobilehome park owner to the
arbitrator for his or her review, and shall mail notice of the selection of an
arbitrator to all affected parties as set forth in the application. The owner
shall produce, at the request of the arbitrator, any additional records,
receipts, or other documents that the arbitrator may deem necessary for a
decision on the disputed application. The owner shall supply duplicate copies
of such documents to the city, shall keep copies at the owner's office within
the park for review and duplication by the affected tenants, and shall provide
notice to each affected tenant that the copies are available for review and
reproduction at the tenant's expense.
   C.   Upon receipt of the application and all requested documentation, the
arbitrator shall schedule a hearing on the application within sixty (60) days.
The commission or its designee shall send notice of the time, date and place of
the hearing to all affected parties at least thirty (30) days prior to the
hearing. The notice shall state that copies of the application and supporting
documentation are on file with the city and are available for review by any
affected party, and that responding parties may submit written statements or
documents to the arbitrator no later than ten (10) days before the hearing. All
statements or documents submitted by responding parties shall be signed and
verified under penalty of perjury, and duplicate copies thereof shall be filed
with the city for review by any affected party.
   D.   At the hearing, the mobilehome park owner and any affected party may
offer any testimony that the arbitrator deems relevant to the requested rent
adjustment. The owner shall produce any records, receipts, or other documents
that the arbitrator may deem necessary to approve the requested adjustment. The
owner and affected parties may offer documents, written declarations, or other
written evidence for the first time at the hearing only if good cause is shown
why such evidence was not filed prior to the hearing. Formal rules shall not be
applicable to such proceedings. In addition, members of the rent review
commission shall be available as required by the arbitrator for testimony
regarding previous rent adjustments in the park. Within fifteen (15) days after
close of the hearing, the arbitrator shall make his or her determination,
pursuant to the standards hereinafter set forth, approving or disapproving a
rent adjustment for the mobilehome spaces specified in the application for a
discretionary rent adjustment.
   E.   The arbitrator shall approve such rent adjustment as he or she
determines to be just, fair, and reasonable, while assuring the park owner a
just and reasonable return on his or her property. Such rent adjustment may be
either below or above the proportional change in the consumer price index. The
arbitrator shall consider, but not be limited to, the following factors in
making such determinations:
      1.   Changes in the CPI;
      2.   The rent lawfully charged for comparable mobilehome spaces in the
city and surrounding areas;
      3.   The history and pattern of all prior rent adjustment of the park,
and any prior arbitration proceedings;
      4.   The completion of any capital improvements or rehabilitation work
related to the mobilehome spaces specified in the application, and the cost
thereof, including the cost of materials, labor, construction interest, permit
fees, and such other items as the arbitrator deems appropriate;
      5.   Changes in property taxes and other taxes related to the park;
      6.   Changes in master land or facilities lease rent, or mortgage
payments incurred in financing the purchase or improvement of the park or
incurred in an involuntary refinancing;
      7.   Changes in the utility charges for the park and the extent, if any,
of reimbursement from the tenants;
      8.   Changes in reasonable operating and maintenance expenses;
      9.   The amount and quality of services provided by the owner to each
affected tenant;
      10.   The need for rehabilitation work;
      11.   Employee and incidental expenses.
   F.   Pursuant to its determination, the arbitrator may order any adjustment
in rent which he or she deems appropriate or consistent with this chapter, and
such order shall be final. There shall be no appeal to the city council. The
arbitrator may also order an adjustment for a limited time only when it is
apparent that capital expenses or any other relevant factor will change after a
determined period of time.
   G.   The total cost of the arbitration and the city's administrative costs
shall be borne by the owner if the arbitrator approves a rent adjustment equal
to or below the formula rent adjustment authorized by section
5.48.060 of this chapter. The total cost of arbitration and the city's
administrative costs shall be borne by the affected tenants if the arbitrator
approves a rent adjustment equal to the amount requested by the owner as a
discretionary adjustment. If the arbitrator approves an adjustment which is
less than the requested discretionary adjustment, the owner and tenants shall
share the total costs in accordance with the ratios set out in table 5.48.080
(G) of this section.
TABLE 5.48.080(G)
 
Owner's share of total  1 - Rent approved by arbitrator - Formula adjusted rent
cost =
                            Rent requested by owner     - Formula adjusted rent
Tenant's share of total     Rent approved by arbitrator - Formula adjusted rent
cost =
                            Rent requested by owner     - Formula adjusted rent
 
For the purpose of these ratios, the formula adjusted rent shall be based on a
time period beginning on the month of the effective date of the last rent
adjustment and ending on the date of the first available release of the
consumer price index which has been received by the city prior to the
application for a discretionary adjustment. The city shall establish fees based
on an hourly basis to provide for its administrative costs. (Ord. 2532 § 7,
2003: Ord. 2207 § 1, 1993)
5.48.090: MEDIATION:
   A.   Upon request by both a mobilehome park owner and at least fifty percent
(50%) of the tenants of an affected park, the commission shall act as mediator
in the negotiation of any lease having a term of at least one year. However,
the failure to successfully negotiate such a lease shall not deprive any person
of any remedy or recourse set forth in this chapter.
   B.   No owner shall force a tenant to sign a lease in an attempt to avoid
the provisions of this chapter relating to amounts that may be charged for
space rent. (Ord. 2532 § 8, 2003: Ord. 2207 § 1, 1993)
5.48.100: APPLICATION FOR DISCRETIONARY RENT DECREASE:
   A.   The majority of affected mobilehome owner-occupants in a park may, by
signed petition, submit an application to the city to request a discretionary
decrease in space rents to compensate for an alleged reduction in services,
provided that the reduction of services has occurred within one hundred twenty
(120) days prior to the date of submittal of the discretionary rent decrease
application; or to compensate mobilehome owner-occupants for utility charges
which are billed to them separately after having previously been included in
space rents.
   B.   The application for a discretionary rent decrease shall be accompanied
by documentation which precisely describes the alleged reduction in services
and the date that such reduction occurred, along with the monetary value of the
reduction.
   C.   The application shall be accompanied by written evidence satisfactory
to the city that the mobilehome park owner was served with a copy of the
application in its completed form at least thirty (30) days prior to the date
of submittal of the discretionary rent decrease application to the city.
   D.   When an application for a discretionary rent decrease is received by
the city, the commission shall call a meeting for the purpose of mediating the
issue of the alleged reduction of services or separate billing of charges. The
mediation meeting shall be held no sooner than ten (10) days nor later than
thirty (30) days of the date the completed application is submitted to the
city, and the mobilehome park owner and the mobilehome owner- occupants filing
the application shall be notified of the time and place of the meeting. Nothing
in this chapter shall prevent the meeting from being held in an appropriate
location on the premises of the affected park.
   E.   At the mediation meeting, the commission will hear testimony relating
to the matters which are at issue. If the mobilehome park owner agrees to
restore an alleged reduction of services, the mediation meeting shall be
continued for an appropriate time period as approved by the commission. At the
date of the continued mediation meeting the commission will again consider the
issues and determine whether there has been a resumption of services. The
commission, after considering all evidence shall either approve, reject or
modify the proposed discretionary rent decrease request and shall, in
compliance with state law, base its decision upon the demonstrated value of any
verified reduction of services. Any rent reduction or accumulation of rent
reductions approved in accordance with this section shall also serve to reduce
space rents as subsequently adjusted by formula rent adjustments, until removed
by a discretionary rent increase or as hereafter set forth.
   F.   An application for a discretionary rent decrease shall be accompanied
by a seven hundred dollar ($700.00) deposit as a processing fee to pay the
city's actual costs of conducting the mediation meeting. The deposit shall be
replenished, from time to time, as deemed necessary by city staff to ensure
that the city's costs are covered. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the total
cost incurred by the city shall be paid by the mobilehome park owner if the
commission approves the requested rent decrease. However, if the commission
denies the request for a discretionary rent decrease, the costs incurred by the
city shall be paid by the mobilehome park owner-occupants.
   G.   An owner and any mobilehome owner-occupants in an affected park may
voluntarily agree to adjust rents downward for any reason including because of
a decrease of services. However, the commission shall be notified within thirty
(30) days of the agreement to provide a record of such change. (Ord. 2532 § 9,
2003: Ord. 2458 § 8, 2000: Ord. 2207 § 1, 1993)
5.48.110: VACANCIES:
A mobilehome park owner shall not increase the rental rate (the amount of rent
being paid by the seller of the mobilehome at the time of the sale) of a
mobilehome space to a subsequent mobilehome owner-occupant for that space;
provided, however, that nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a mobilehome
park owner from increasing the monthly space rent for a mobilehome park space
when the mobilehome has been removed from the park, where the mobilehome has
been abandoned by its owner, or when a legal eviction of a mobilehome owner-
occupant is effected by the property owner. (Ord. 2532 § 10, 2003; Ord. 2458 §
9, 2000: Ord. 2207 § 1, 1993)
5.48.120: RETALIATORY EVICTION:
   A.   No park owner or representative of an owner shall intimidate, threaten,
harm, retaliate, annoy, harass or otherwise interfere in any manner with any
mobilehome owner-occupant's exercise of any of the rights conferred by this
chapter or the constitutions of the United States and the state of California,
or that mobilehome owner-occupant's right to participate in any action or
proceeding brought by any interested party pursuant to this chapter, including
public participation and the signing of petitions. The city recognizes that
many residents in mobilehome parks are elderly and are easily intimidated by
threats. The city further recognizes the mobilehome owner-occupant's right to
participate, with others, in any matter for the mutual benefit of park
residents.
   B.   In any action brought to recover possession of a mobilehome space, the
court may consider as grounds for denial any violation of this chapter.
Further, the determination that the action was brought in retaliation for the
exercise of any rights conferred by this chapter shall be grounds for denial.

5.98.010: FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS:
The city council finds and declares as follows:
   A.   There exists in the city substandard and unsanitary residential
buildings and dwelling units, the physical conditions and characteristics of
which render them unfit or unsafe for human occupancy and habitation and cause
such buildings and units to be detrimental to, or jeopardize, the health,
safety and welfare of their occupants and of the public.
   B.   The existence of such substandard buildings and dwelling units
threatens the physical, social and economic stability of sound residential
areas, and of their supporting neighborhood facilities and institutions;
necessitates disproportionate expenditures of public funds for law enforcement
and remedial action; impairs the efficient and economical exercise of
governmental powers and functions; and destroys the amenity of residential
areas and neighborhoods, and of the community as a whole.
   C.   The business of renting or leasing rental dwelling units, as defined
herein, has resulted in instances of absentee landlords and/or off site
managers, which, in turn, has increased the likelihood of instances of
substandard buildings and dwelling units, health violations and crime, all of
which are a public nuisance.
   D.   For the above stated reasons, it is hereby declared to be the policy of
the city that:
      1.   It is in the public interest of the residents of the city to protect
and promote the existence of sound and wholesome residential buildings,
dwelling units and neighborhoods by the adoption and enforcement of such
standards, regulations and procedures as will remedy the existence or prevent
the development or creation of dangerous, substandard or unsanitary and
deficient residential buildings and dwelling units; and

disturbs the peace of the neighborhood or causes excessive discomfort to any
reasonable person of normal sensitivity residing in the area. It is unlawful
and shall be a public nuisance for any person to own or keep any animal in
violation of this chapter. A violation of this chapter shall be punishable as a
misdemeanor unless determined by the city attorney, in exercising his or her
prosecutorial discretion, to be punishable as an infraction.
   B.   The standards to be considered in determining whether a violation of
the provisions of this chapter exists include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      1.   The level of the noise made by the animal;
      2.   The level and intensity of background noise;
      3.   The proximity of the noise to residential sleeping areas;
      4.   The density of habitation within the area;
      5.   The time of day or night when the noise occurs; and
      6.   The duration of the noise.
   C.   As used in this chapter, a "neighborhood" means an area in which at
least three (3) single-family dwellings or one multiple- family dwelling are
located within two hundred feet (200') of the boundary line of the premises
upon which the animal allegedly causing noise is located.
   D.   If any animal persistently barks, howls, yelps, whines or makes noise,
and disturbs the peace of the neighborhood as provided in this chapter, the dog
or other animal may be declared a public nuisance pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter. It is unlawful for any person, after being informed in writing
pursuant to the provisions of this subsection that his or her animal has been
declared a public nuisance, to fail, refuse or neglect to take whatever steps,
or use whatever means are necessary, to assure that such animal does not
disturb residents in the vicinity in which the animal is kept. If within a
period of ten (10) days after the issuance of written notice to the person
owning, keeping, harboring or having in his or her care or custody said animal
has not been abated as a nuisance, such person shall be subject to prosecution
under this chapter.
   E.   When the animal control officer of the city is notified of a possible
noisy animal by a complaint from a complaining person, the animal control
officer shall issue a noisy animal warning notice. Such notice shall specify
that the animal is in violation of this chapter and that the noisy animal must
be abated to avoid further city action. The animal control officer shall meet
with the person keeping the alleged noisy animal, review the specifics of the
complaint and attempt to obtain a resolution of the alleged noisy animal
violation. A notice summarizing the outcome of the meeting and complaint shall
be mailed to the residence of the owner or keeper of the noisy animal who shall
have a period of ten (10) days in which to abate the nuisance.
   F.   When the animal control officer receives a second notice of a complaint
concerning the same noisy animal, the animal control officer shall send, if the
first warning went unheeded, a second notice of a complaint which constitutes
written notice of violation of this chapter. Such notice shall be mailed to the
owner or the keeper of the animal, postage prepaid first class mail with return
receipt requested. If delivery is refused, follow up by first class mail is
sufficient. If no action has been taken by the owner or the keeper of the
animal, and upon receiving a third complaint, the animal control officer shall
send to the complaining party a set of complaint forms, accompanied by a letter
with instructions to complete and return the forms within fourteen (14) days of
receipt. The complaining party shall be informed that further action may not be
warranted if the animal is controlled, but that in any case no further action
can be taken to control the animal until the completed complaint forms are
received by the animal control department.
   G.   Upon receipt of the completed complaint forms, the animal control
officer, or his or her supervisor, may file a petition requesting a hearing
before the animal control board to determine whether the animal should be
declared a public nuisance. All complaints received from the public and from
any complaining persons shall be attached to the petition. The animal control
board established pursuant to chapter 6.05 of this title shall administer the
provisions of this chapter.
   H.   The animal control board shall notify the owner or keeper of the animal
that a hearing has been scheduled and that the owner or keeper of such animal
may present evidence at the hearing. The animal control board shall serve upon
the owner or keeper of the animal notice of the hearing by postage prepaid
first class mail with return receipt requested and shall provide the owner or
keeper of the animal with a copy of the petition. If delivery is refused,
follow up by first class mail is sufficient.
   I.   The hearing before the animal control board shall be open to the public
and shall be held not less than ten (10) working days or more than thirty (30)
working days after service of the notice of hearing upon the owner or keeper of
the animal. The animal control board may admit all relevant evidence, including
incident reports and affidavits of witnesses; the board may limit the scope of
discovery and may shorten the time to produce records or witnesses. The board
may decide all issues even if the owner or keeper of the animal fails to appear
at the hearing. The board may find, upon a preponderance of the evidence, that
the noisy animal is a public nuisance.
   J.   After the hearing conducted pursuant to subsection I of this section,
the animal control board shall either personally or by postage prepaid first
class mail notify the owner or keeper of the animal of the board's
determination and any orders issued by the board. If the board determines that
the animal is a public nuisance, the owner or keeper of the animal shall comply
with the board's order within ten (10) days after the date of the
determination.
   K.   Any person who neglects or refuses to abate the condition within the
time specified in the written nuisance notice is guilty of a misdemeanor unless
determined by the city attorney, in exercising his or her prosecutorial
discretion, to be punishable as an infraction.
   L.   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the city attorney
from commencing a civil or criminal proceeding to abate a public nuisance under
this chapter or other applicable law.
   M.   If, at the time an animal is declared a public nuisance and in
violation of this chapter, no person is in possession of the premises upon
which the animal is located, any animal control officer or police officer may
enter the private property and remove the animal from the premises. An animal
so removed shall be impounded and may be returned to its owner upon payment of
impound and boarding fees. Written notice that an animal has been impounded
pursuant to this section shall be posted upon the premises and mailed to the
owner of the property first class, postage prepaid. (Ord. 2249 § 1, 1994: Ord.

attorney shall thereafter cause a report of the action and an accurate account
of costs to be filed with the city clerk. (Ord. 2812, 2015)

Industrial                          Any time               75
 
   B.   No person shall operate, or cause to be operated, any source of sound
at any location within the city or allow the creation of any noise on property
owned, leased, occupied or otherwise controlled by such person which causes the
noise level when measured on any other property to exceed:
      1.   The noise standard for that land use specified in table 1 of this
section for a cumulative period of more than thirty (30) minutes in any hour;
or
      2.   The noise standard specified in table 1 of this section plus five
(5) dB for a cumulative period of more than fifteen (15) minutes in any hour;
or
      3.   The noise standard specified in table 1 of this section plus ten
(10) dB for a cumulative period of more than five (5) minutes in any hour; or
      4.   The noise standard specified in table 1 of this section plus fifteen
(15) dB for a cumulative period of more than one minute in any hour; or
      5.   The noise standard specified in table 1 of this section plus twenty
(20) dB or the maximum measured ambient level, for any period of time.
   C.   If the measured ambient level exceeds the allowable noise exposure
standard within any of the first four (4) noise limit categories above, the
allowable noise exposure standard shall be adjusted in five (5) dB increments
in each category as appropriate to encompass or reflect said ambient noise
level. In the event the ambient noise level exceeds the fifth noise limit
category, the maximum allowable noise level under this category shall be
increased to reflect the maximum ambient noise level.
   D.   The ambient noise shall be measured at the same location along the
property line utilized in subsection
8.06.060B of this chapter, with the alleged offending noise source inoperative.
If the alleged offending noise source cannot be shut down, the ambient noise
shall be estimated by performing a measurement in the same general area of the
source but at a sufficient distance that the noise from the source is at least
ten (10) dB below the ambient in order that only the ambient level be measured.
If the difference between the ambient and the noise source is five (5) to ten
(10) dB, then the level of the ambient itself can be reasonably determined by
subtracting a one decibel correction to account for the contribution of the
source.
   E.   In the event the alleged offensive noise contains a steady, audible
tone such as a whine, screech, hum, or is a repetitive noise such as hammering
or riveting, or contains music or speech conveying informational content, the
standard limits set forth in table 1 of this section shall be reduced by five
(5) dB. (Ord. 2579 § 1, 2004)
8.06.080: INTERIOR NOISE STANDARDS:
   A.   No person shall operate or cause to be operated any source of sound, or
allow the creation of any noise, which causes the noise level when measured
inside a neighboring receiving occupied building to exceed the following
standards:
      1.   The noise standard for that land use specified in table 2 of this
section for a cumulative period of more than five (5) minutes in any hour.
      2.   The noise standard for that land use specified in table 2 of this
section plus five (5) dB for a cumulative period of more than one minute in any
hour.
      3.   The noise standard for that land use specified in table 2 of this
section plus ten (10) dB for the maximum measured ambient noise level for any
period of time.
   B.   If the measured ambient level exceeds the allowable exterior noise
exposure standard in table 1 of this chapter, the allowable interior noise
exposure level shall be adjusted in five (5) dB increments as appropriate to
reflect the ambient noise level.

(10) days after the imposition of the fine. The request must state the grounds

"Waste matter" is defined for the purpose of this chapter as unused or
discarded matter, having no substantial market value, which is exposed to the

be issued to abate such nuisance. Such notice shall be headed "NOTICE TO CLEAN
PREMISES" in letters not less than one inch (1") in height and shall, in

fourteen (14) days will result in abatement by the city, and the notice shall
further provide that a lien may be placed upon the property and that charges
may be collected with the taxes. Notices served by means other than posting as
provided by this chapter shall contain a description of the property in general
terms reasonably sufficient to identify the location of the nuisance.

Within ten (10) days from the date of posting, mailing, or personal service of
the required notice, the owner or person occupying or controlling such lot or
premises affected may appeal to the city council of the city of Redlands.

not more than twenty (20) days thereafter, it shall proceed to hear and pass
upon such appeal, and the decision of the city council thereupon shall be final
and conclusive.
   B.   It shall be the duty of the owner, the agent of the owner, or the
person in charge of any lot or premises in the city within ten (10) days from
the date of notification as provided herein, or in the case of an appeal to the

same is sustained, to remove the nuisance as stated. (Prior code § 58106)
8.40.080: ABATEMENT PROCEDURE:
If the owner fails or neglects to remove the nuisance as herein defined within
the time specified in this chapter, the chief of the fire department or his

work may be done by city crews or by private contractor. The fire department
shall send a demand for payment of the cost shown in the statement and paid by
the city, in addition to an administrative fee established by resolution of the
city council of the city, to the owner of the property by posting in the United
States mail, and may cause a statement of lien in the amount of the cost and
service charge to be filed with the recorder of San Bernardino County on each
separate affected property. Liens shall thereafter be released immediately upon
full payment to the city, or upon direction by the city council of the city.
   A.   A report of the proceedings and an account of the unreimbursed cost of
abating the nuisance on each separate property shall be filed with the city
clerk on or before July 10 following the abatement of the nuisance. The city
clerk shall thereupon set the report and accounts for hearing before the city
council at the second regular or an adjourned or a special meeting in the month
of July following the abatement of the nuisance; said report shall be available
for public inspection in the city clerk's office.
   B.   The city council shall consider the reports and accounts at the time
set for hearing, together with any objections or protests by interested
parties. Any owner of land or person interested therein may present a written
or oral protest or objections to the report and account. At the conclusion of
the hearing, the city council shall approve, correct, or modify the reports and
accounts. The city council shall adopt a resolution providing for the
collection of such amounts along with the taxes upon the respective parcels of
land as they are shown on the last available tax roll. If within five (5) days
after the hearing before the city council, payment is made by the property
owner of the amount due for the abatement of the nuisance, the amount shall not
be collected with the taxes and all liens shall be released.
   C.   Not less than five (5) days after the hearing before the city council,
but not after August 1 following the abatement of the nuisance, the city clerk
shall cause to be prepared and filed with the auditor of San Bernardino County
a certified copy of the resolution of the city council.
   D.   The provisions of sections 39580 to 39584, inclusive, of the Government
Code are incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. The county
auditor shall enter each assessment in the county tax roll opposite the parcel
of land. The amount of the assessment shall be collected at the time and in the
manner of ordinary municipal taxes; and if delinquent the amount is subject to
the same penalties and procedure of foreclosure and sale as is provided for
ordinary municipal taxes. (Ord. 2356 § 1, 1997: prior code § 58107)
8.40.090: CHEMICAL CONTROL:
The city council may, by resolution, find and declare that weeds on specified
parcels of property are seasonal and recurrent nuisances, that the efficient
and economical control of such nuisances requires preventive chemical control
of such nuisances upon those parcels. The resolution shall refer to street
addresses if such parcels front upon public streets, and if not, the resolution
shall refer to lot and block numbers according to a recorded subdivision or
parcel map. Thereafter, the city shall mail postcard notices to the owner of
the affected parcels, as they and their addresses appear on the county's
assessment roll. Each notice shall refer to and describe the property, state
that weeds thereon have been declared by resolution to be seasonal and
recurrent nuisances, and that the city will apply preventive chemical control
and may file a lien and recover the cost with the taxes unless the owner
supplies evidence of preventive chemical control already applied. If acceptable
evidence of preventive chemical control is not supplied by the owner, the city
may apply the preventive chemical control and recover costs pursuant to the
procedure applicable to weed abatement set forth in this chapter. (Prior code §
58108)
8.40.100: VIOLATION; PENALTY:
The owner, occupant, or agent of any lot or premises within the city who shall
permit or allow the existence of a public nuisance as defined in this chapter,
upon any lot or premises owned, occupied, or controlled by him, or who shall
violate any of the provisions of this chapter, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to a fine of not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00), or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six
(6) months, or both such fine and imprisonment. (Prior code § 58109)

Pursuant to the determination made, and the authority granted by the state
under sections 22660 et seq., of the Vehicle Code to abate and remove
abandoned, dismantled, inoperative, junked and wrecked vehicles, and/or parts
thereof as public nuisances, and in accordance with the city's police power
authority, the city council makes the following findings and declarations:
   A.   The accumulation or storage of dismantled, wrecked, inoperative,
junked, abandoned vehicles, or parts thereof, on private or public property is
found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private and public
property, to promote blight and deterioration, invite plundering, to create
fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the
health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and
to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare of the public.
   B.   Therefore, the presence of abandoned, dismantled, inoperative, junked
or wrecked vehicles, or parts thereof, on private or public property (other
than on streets, public roadways, alleys, right of way and highways) in the
city, except as expressly permitted in this chapter, is declared to constitute
a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter. (Ord. 2346 § 1, 1997)
8.56.050: EXCEPTIONS:
   A.   This chapter shall not apply to any vehicle, or parts thereof, which is
completely enclosed within a building consisting of four (4) walls and roof and
constructed in a lawful manner, where such vehicle is not visible from the
street or other public or private property or a vehicle, or parts thereof,
which is stored or parked in a lawful manner on property used in connection
with the business of a licensed dismantler, garage, vehicle dealer or junkyard.
   B.   This exception shall not authorize the maintenance of a public or
private nuisance as defined under the provisions of law other than this
chapter. (Ord. 2346 § 1, 1997)
8.56.060: CHAPTER SUPPLEMENT TO EXISTING LAW:
This chapter is not the exclusive means for the regulation of abandoned,
dismantled, inoperative, junked or wrecked vehicles, or parts thereof, or
public nuisances within the city. It shall supplement and be in addition to the
other regulatory codes, statutes and ordinances heretofore or hereafter enacted
by the city, the state or any other legal entity or agency having jurisdiction
over the same. (Ord. 2346 § 1, 1997)
8.56.070: PROHIBITED USES:
Any abandoned, dismantled, inoperative, junked or wrecked vehicles, or parts
thereof, or fully or partially disassembled vehicle (including vehicles without
hoods, fenders, engines, body panels, headlights, trunk lids, wheels, windows
or windshields) when placed or kept for more than seventy two (72) hours in
residential, commercial or industrial sites (except licensed vehicle impound
storage yards, garages, vehicle dealers, junkyards and/or dismantling yards)
and visible from outside the parcel of land upon which such is or are kept, is
prohibited and constitutes a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 2346 § 1, 1997)
8.56.080: DUTY TO ABATE:
   A.   No person shall cause, permit, maintain, conduct or otherwise allow an
abandoned, dismantled, inoperative, junked or wrecked vehicle, or parts
thereof, to be openly stored within the city.
   B.   It shall be the duty of every owner, and/or occupant, in control of any
land located within the city to remove, abate and prevent the recurrence of
open storage of such a vehicle. Any recurrence of such condition of a specific
vehicle on the same property may be deemed a continuation of the original
condition and additional notification requirements under sections
8.56.100 and
 8.56.210 of this chapter shall not be required. (Ord. 2346 § 1, 1997)
8.56.090: EMERGENCY ABATEMENT AND OTHER SERVICES:
   A.   Emergency Abatement: When a "vehicle" defined by this chapter as a
public nuisance constitutes an immediate hazard or threat of harm and the
situation calls for abatement sooner than the procedures in this chapter allow,
the director, the Redlands police department or the Redlands fire department
may take or cause emergency removal of such nuisance with such notice to
parties concerned, or without notice, as the particular circumstances
reasonably allow. Required notification procedures prior to disposal of such
vehicle(s) shall be followed.
   B.   Request For Service: If any member of the public, except self- storage
operators, requests the city, in writing, to remove abandoned, dismantled,
inoperative, junked or wrecked vehicles, or parts thereof, the director is
authorized to provide processing and removal for a fee which covers all city
costs. The city or its contractors may dispose of the removed abandoned,
dismantled, inoperative, junked or wrecked vehicles or parts thereof, through
transfer of title or lien sale process, or as otherwise authorized by law.
   C.   Complaints: The director shall investigate complaints associated with
abandoned, dismantled, inoperative, junked or wrecked vehicles or parts
thereof. The complaint may be made verbally, or in writing, and must have situs
address and/or assessor parcel number with a description of the violation. The
process referred to in section
8.56.100 of this chapter will be utilized for abatement if such is determined
to be appropriate. (Ord. 2346 § 1, 1997)
8.56.100: ABATEMENT PROCEDURES FOR VEHICLES WHICH ARE A PUBLIC NUISANCE:
   A.   A ten (10) day notice of intent to abate and remove shall be given to
the property owner to remove the vehicle or vehicles, or parts thereof, as a
public nuisance, unless the property owner and the owner of the vehicle have
signed releases authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the
vehicles or parts thereof. Notification shall be given either by personal
delivery or posting the property, and shall be mailed by registered or
certified mail addressed to the property owner's last known address or
residence addresses as the same appears in the public records or the last
equalized assessment roll, and to the last registered and/or legal owner of the
vehicle by registered or certified mail to the last address listed with the
department of motor vehicles. If such a vehicle is in such condition that
identification numbers are not available to determine ownership, notice need
not be given to the last registered and/or legal owner of the vehicle.
   B.   The notice shall be substantially as follows:
You are hereby notified to abate this public nuisance by removal of the vehicle
(s), or parts thereof, within ten (10) days from the date of mailing of this
notice. If you fail to do so, the public nuisance and such dismantled, wrecked,
junked, inoperative, abandoned vehicle(s), or parts thereof, may be abated and
removed by the City or its contractor and all the costs for abatement and
removal, together with administrative costs, may be assessed to the legal owner
of the land on which the public nuisance and such dismantled, junked,
abandoned, inoperative vehicles, or parts thereof, are located.
   C.   The ten (10) day notice shall also set forth the procedures and time
period for filing an appeal. The notice shall contain a statement of the
hearing rights of the owner of the property on which the vehicle is located and
of the owner of the vehicle. The statement shall include notice to the property
owner that the property owner may appear in person at a hearing or may submit a
sworn statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the
land, with the reasons for such denial, in lieu of appearing.
   D.   If the nuisance is not abated and a request for a hearing has not been
received within the time period given in the notice, the city, its authorized
agent, contractor or employee is authorized to abate the nuisance.
   E.   A notice of intent to abate and remove shall not be required for
removal of a vehicle, or parts thereof, which is inoperable due to the absence
of a motor, transmission or wheel and incapable of being towed; is valued at
less than two hundred dollars ($200.00); and is determined to be a public
nuisance presenting an immediate threat to public health or safety; provided
that the property owner has signed a release authorizing removal and waiving
further interest in the vehicle, or parts thereof. Pursuant to Vehicle Code
section 22661, notice of intent to dispose of the vehicle, or parts thereof,
shall be provided to the last registered and legal owner prior to final
disposition. If the vehicle, or parts thereof, are not claimed and removed
within twelve (12) days after the notice is mailed, the city, or its
contractor, may authorize disposal of the vehicle and parts thereof. The city
and its contractors shall not be liable for damage caused to a vehicle, or
parts thereof, by removal pursuant to this section. This section shall only
apply to inoperable vehicles located upon a parcel that: 1) is zoned for
agricultural use; or 2) is not improved with a residential structure containing
one or more dwelling units.
   F.   Notice shall be given to the department of motor vehicles within five
(5) days after the date of removal of vehicles under this section, identifying
the vehicle, or parts thereof, and any evidence of registration available,
including, but not limited to, the registration card, certificates of ownership
or license plates.
   G.   No vehicle which has been abated or removed as a public nuisance shall
thereafter be reconstructed or made operable unless it is a vehicle which
qualifies for either horseless carriage license plates or historical vehicle
license plates pursuant to Vehicle Code section 5004, in which case the vehicle
may be reconstructed or made operable.
   H.   The city, its employees and agents, and contract services shall not be
liable for damage caused to a vehicle, or parts thereof, by removal pursuant to
this chapter. (Ord. 2346 § 1, 1997)
8.56.110: PAYMENT FOR ABATEMENT OF VEHICLES WHICH ARE A PUBLIC NUISANCE:
   A.   When abatement has been completed, the director may render to the city
finance director an itemized statement covering work necessary for the
abatement. The finance director may present the property owner a demand for
payment by mail. If payment is not made on behalf of the property owner within
sixty (60) days after mailing of such bill, the director may file the necessary
documents to make the cost of the abatement of the nuisance a special
assessment against that parcel of land as provided in Government Code section
38773.5. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject to the
same penalties and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary
municipal taxes.
   B.   All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of
municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any
real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or
conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide
encumbrancer of value has been created and attached thereon, prior to the date
on which the first installment of such taxes would become delinquent, then the
cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property, but
instead, shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.
   C.   Notices or instruments relating to abatement proceedings or special
assessment shall be entitled to recordation. Costs of removal and
administrative costs are a debt to the city from the owner of the property and/
or vehicle and may be enforced as such in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 2346 § 1, 1997)
8.56.120: APPEAL OF ABATEMENT:
   A.   Upon written request by the legal owner of the vehicle under title or
requiring registration under the Vehicle Code, or the owner of the land on
which such vehicle is located, received by the city within ten (10) days after
mailing the notice of intent to abate and remove, or a sworn written statement
from the owner of the land claiming nonresponsibility for the vehicle(s), a
public hearing shall be held by the vehicle abatement appeals board on the
abatement and removal of such vehicle(s), and parts thereof, as a public
nuisance.
   B.   The sworn written statement shall be construed as a request for hearing
which does not require the presence of the owner submitting such a request. The
vehicle abatement appeals board shall hear and act on appeals within sixty (60)
days of filing and its determination shall be conclusive. The owner of the land
on which the vehicle is located may appear in person at the hearing, or present
a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the
vehicle on the land, with the reasons for such denial.
   C.   If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the
land without the consent of the landowner and that the property owner has not
subsequently acquiesced in its presence, then the city shall not assess the
costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon
which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such cost from the
owner. If such a request is not received within such period as described in
this section, then the director shall have the authority to remove the vehicle.
(Ord. 2346 § 1, 1997)
8.56.130: APPEALS OF CHARGES:
Any appeal from charges for the cost of removal and abatement must be filed
within sixty (60) days from the date of billing or mailing of a bill which
shows abatement charges. The appeal shall be heard by the vehicle abatement
appeals board. (Ord. 2346 § 1, 1997)
8.56.140: CANCELLATION OF CHARGES:
All or any portion of any such special assessment, penalty, or costs heretofore
entered, shall on order of the vehicle abatement appeals board be canceled as
uncollected, or refunded by the city if collected, if it or they were entered,
charged or paid:
   A.   More than once;
   B.   Through clerical error;
   C.   Through the error or mistake of the vehicle abatement appeals board,
the director or the person designated by the board to give notice to abate
regarding any material fact relevant to the determination of a charge;
   D.   Illegally;
   E.   The owner of the land was not responsible for the vehicle(s);
   F.   On property acquired after the lien date by the state or by any county,
city, school district, or other political subdivision and because of this
public ownership, not subject to sale for delinquent taxes. (Ord. 2346 § 1,
1997)
8.56.150: PROCEDURE FOR REFUND OF PAYMENT:
No order for a refund under section
 8.56.140 of this chapter shall be made except on a claim verified by the
person who paid the special assessment, or his or her guardian, executor or
administrator and filed within three (3) years after making the payment sought
to be refunded. (Ord. 2346 § 1, 1997)
8.56.160: PAYMENT FOR ABATEMENT OF ABANDONED VEHICLES:
   A.   Abandonment of any vehicle on public or private property shall
constitute a prima facie presumption that the last registered owner of record
is responsible for the abandonment and is liable for the cost of removal and
disposition of the vehicle. When the abatement has been completed, the director
may render to the city finance director an itemized statement covering work
necessary for abatement and the finance director may present to the registered
owner of the vehicle a demand for payment of the costs required for removal and
disposition of the vehicle pursuant to Vehicle Code section 22669 and
appropriate provisions of this chapter, not to exceed those for towing and
seven (7) days of storage.
   B.   The limitation of this section shall not apply if the registered owner
or legal owner of the vehicle has completed and returned to the lien holder a
declaration of opposition form within the time specified in Vehicle Code
section 22851.8. (Ord. 2346 § 1, 1997)
8.56.170: DISPOSAL OF VEHICLES WHICH ARE A PUBLIC NUISANCE:
If a vehicle or part thereof is removed from a property as a public nuisance,
the vehicle or parts thereof may be disposed of by removal to a scrap yard,
licensed automobile dismantler's yard or any suitable site determined by the
city for processing as scrap. (Ord. 2346 § 1, 1997)
8.56.180: ABATEMENT PROCEDURES FOR ABANDONED VEHICLES:
   A.   If an abandoned vehicle and parts thereof are removed from a property,
and the estimated value of the vehicle is three hundred dollars ($300.00) or
less, a distinctive notice which states that the vehicle will be removed by the
city or its contractors shall be securely attached to the vehicle not less than
seventy two (72) hours before the vehicle is removed. Immediately after the
removal of the vehicle, the city shall notify the stolen vehicle system of the
department of justice in Sacramento of the removal.
   B.   Within forty eight (48) hours of the removal, excluding weekends and
holidays, a notice shall be sent to the registered and legal owners of the
vehicle by registered or certified first class mail to the last address listed
with the department of motor vehicles, and to any other person known to have an
interest in the vehicle. This notice shall include the following information:
      1.   The name, address and telephone number of the city;
      2.   The location of the place of storage and description of the vehicle
which shall include, if available, make, license plate number, vehicle
identification number, and mileage;
      3.   The authority and purpose for removing the vehicle;
      4.   A statement that the vehicle will be disposed of fifteen (15) days
from the date of the notice;
      5.   A statement that the owners and interested persons, or their agents,
have an opportunity for a poststorage hearing to determine the validity of the
storage, if the request is made in person, in writing, or by telephone within
ten (10) days from the date of the notice that, if the owner or interested
person or his/her agent, disagrees with the decision of the city the decision
may be reviewed pursuant to section 11523 of the Government Code, and that
during the time of the initial hearing or during the time the decision is being
reviewed pursuant to section 11523 of the Government Code, the vehicle in
question shall not be disposed of;
      6.   Any requested hearings shall be conducted within forty eight (48)
hours of the request, excluding weekends and holidays.
   C.   Failure of either the registered or legal owner or interested person or
their agent to request or to attend a scheduled hearing shall satisfy due
process poststorage validity hearing requirements.
   D.   If after fifteen (15) days from the notification date, the vehicle
remains unclaimed and the towing and storage fees have not been paid, and if no
request for a poststorage hearing was made or a poststorage hearing was not
attended, the city may authorize disposal of the vehicle on a form approved by
the department of motor vehicles. If the vehicle is claimed by the owner within
fifteen (15) days of the notice date, the lien holder which is storing the
vehicle may collect reasonable fees for services rendered, but may not collect
lien sale fees as provided for in Vehicle Code section 22851.12.
   E.   If the names and addresses of the registered and legal owners of the
vehicle are not available from the records of the department of motor vehicles,
the city may authorize disposal of the vehicle at any time after the removal.
   F.   Disposal of the vehicle may only be to a licensed dismantler or scrap
iron processor. A vehicle disposed of pursuant to this section shall not be
reconstructed or made operable, unless it is a vehicle which qualifies for
either horseless carriage or historical vehicle license plates. A copy of the
city's authorization for disposal shall be forwarded to the licensed dismantler
within five (5) days of the disposal to a licensed dismantler. A copy of the
city's authorization for disposal shall be retained by the lien holder who
stored the vehicle for a period of ninety (90) days if the vehicle is disposed
of to a scrap iron processor.
   G.   The city, or at the request of the city the lien holder, shall obtain a
copy of the names and addresses of all persons having an interest in the
vehicle, if any, from the department of motor vehicles either directly or by
use of the California law enforcement telecommunications system. This section
does not require the city or lien holder to obtain a copy of the actual record
on file at the department of motor vehicles. (Ord. 2346 § 1, 1997)
8.56.190: ABATEMENT PROCEDURES FOR ABANDONED VEHICLES VALUED AT GREATER THAN
THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS:
After the abatement and removal process has occurred, and the poststorage
notification requirements described in section
8.56.180 of this chapter have been met, a lien sale may be conducted on every
removed, abandoned vehicle with a value of over three hundred dollars ($300.00)
and such sale may be carried out if all fees and costs for the removal, storage

8.70.010: PURPOSE:
The city council finds that it is in the interest of public health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of Redlands to regulate the location, size and
appearance of newsracks within city limits. The city council further finds that
without such regulation, such newsracks may pose a hazard to public safety. The
city council finds that the regulation and registration of location, size and
appearance of newsracks will minimize any potential danger to the public
safety.
Further, the city council finds that it is in the interest of public health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of Redlands to protect minors from viewing
publicly displayed harmful matter, and that pursuant to Penal Code sections
313.1(d) and (e) the city is authorized to adopt ordinances which restrict the
display of harmful matter to minors by the use of blinder racks. The city
council also finds that there exists an increasing trend toward the display of
harmful matter, within the meaning of Penal Code section 313, within newsracks
within the city of Redlands, and that restriction of public display of such
harmful matter will keep the adverse impacts of such harmful matter upon minors
to a minimum. This chapter is enacted for the purposes of minimizing potential
dangers to public safety and reducing the adverse impacts of harmful matter
upon minors. (Ord. 2228 § 1, 1993)

guided solely by the following criteria:
      1.   First priority shall be given to newsracks used for the sale of
publications which have been adjudicated to be newspapers of general
circulation for San Bernardino County, pursuant to the procedures set forth in
section 6000 et seq., of the California Government Code.
      2.   Second priority shall be given to newsracks used for the sale of
daily publications (those published on 5 or more days in a calendar week) which

weekly publications (those published on at least 1 but less than 5 days in a
calendar week) which have not been adjudicated to be newspapers of general

   C.   In the event that there is a conflict between newspapers within the
same priority seeking the same location, and there are insufficient newsracks
spaces remaining to accommodate the conflicting newspapers after first filling
as many spaces as possible by utilizing the criteria as set forth above, then
the director of community development or his designated representative shall
assign the space or spaces at random by placing the names of all applicants for
the remaining spaces at a location into a container from which the names shall
be drawn, one at a time until the remaining number of unfilled newsracks at
that particular location has been filled. Such drawing shall be open to the
public at a time and date designated by the director of community development
or his designated representative. (Ord. 2228 § 1, 1993)

such newsrack, move, align, remove such attachment, or otherwise move such rack
or racks in order to restore them to a legal condition.
   C.   Any newsrack which has been tagged, and which notice of violation has
been mailed to the registered owner on file with the city, which remains in

location so as to eliminate the danger to the health, safety and welfare of the
public. The director of community development or his designated representative
shall notify the owner thereof by mailing a notice of removal to the last known
address of the owner. Such notice shall state the date the newsrack was
removed, the reasons therefor, the location and procedure for claiming the
newsrack, and the procedure for obtaining a postremoval hearing before the
director of community development or his designated representative, if desired.

8.72.010: DECLARATION OF PUBLIC NUISANCE:
The city council has determined that the accumulation and storage of wrecked,
dismantled or abandoned shopping carts, or parts thereof, on public or private
property creates a condition tending to reduce property values, promote blight
and deterioration, constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the
health and safety of minors, and be aesthetically detrimental to the community
and injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the
presence of wrecked, dismantled or abandoned shopping carts, or parts thereof,
on public or private property, is declared to constitute a public nuisance
which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2266 § 1, 1995)
8.72.020: DEFINITIONS:
The following definitions shall apply to this chapter:
   PARKWAY: That area between the sidewalks and the curb of any street, and

transporting goods of any kind. (Ord. 2266 § 1, 1995)
8.72.030: ABANDONED CART:
When a shopping cart is left standing on any public or private property, the
shopping cart shall be deemed to be abandoned and therefore a public nuisance
pursuant to this chapter. The provisions of this section shall not apply to
shopping carts left standing on private property (including the common areas of
shopping centers adjacent thereto) of the owner of the shopping cart according
to the name of such owner affixed thereto as required by section
8.72.070 of this chapter. In the event that a shopping cart is left standing on
any public or private property or, in the event the cart violates section
8.72.070 of this chapter, the owner thereof shall be responsible and liable for
the removal and disposition of the abandoned shopping cart as provided in this
chapter.
The city manager may exempt a shopping cart owner from the provisions of this
section if the cart owner has implemented a plan whereby employees provide cart
retrieval, or whereby the cart owner has entered into a contract with a cart
retrieval service and has provided the city with proof of such contract,
provided the frequency of cart retrieval service meets the city manager's
approval. (Ord. 2266 § 1, 1995)
8.72.040: ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT:
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the provisions of this chapter
shall be administered and enforced by the city manager or his authorized
representative. In the enforcement of this chapter, the city manager or his
authorized representative may enter onto public or private property to examine
a shopping cart, or parts thereof, or to obtain information as to the identify
of a shopping cart and to remove, or cause the removal of, a shopping cart, or
parts thereof, declared to be a nuisance pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 2266 §
1, 1995)
8.72.050: SHOPPING CART ABATEMENT:
Upon discovering the existence of a wrecked, dismantled or abandoned shopping
cart, or parts thereof, on public or private property within the city, the city
manager, or his authorized representative shall have the authority to cause the
abatement and removal thereof in accordance with the procedure described in
this chapter. (Ord. 2266 § 1, 1995)
8.72.060: ASSESSMENTS FOR SHOPPING CART REMOVAL; HEARINGS:
   A.   Upon the abatement and removal of any shopping cart located on public
or private property within the city, the city manager or his authorized
representative shall notify the owner thereof (if the same can be ascertained)
by mailing a notice of abatement to the last known address of the owner. Such
notice shall state the date the shopping cart was removed from public or
private property, the location and procedure for retrieval of the shopping
cart, and a statement that, in order to receive a hearing with regard to the
removal of the shopping cart, the owner or its agent shall submit a request for
such hearing either in person or in writing within ten (10) days of the date
appearing on the notice. Any such shopping cart removed and stored pursuant to
these provisions shall be released to the owner thereof if claimed within
thirty (30) days after such removal and upon the payment of reasonable
administrative fees. Such administrative fees shall be waived if, after a
hearing has been requested, a determination is made at such hearing that upon a
finding of good cause, the administrative fees shall be waived.
   B.   The administrative fees for the removal and storage of the shopping
cart shall be established or modified by resolution of the city council and
shall include the actual cost of removal and storage of any shopping cart, or

   C.   Any hearing which is requested shall be conducted within ten (10) days
of the receipt of the request for such hearing, excluding weekends and
holidays, by the city manager, or his designee, who shall serve as the hearing
officer. The failure of either the owner or its agent to request a hearing
shall satisfy the hearing requirement. If it is determined at a hearing that
reasonable grounds for the abatement and removal of a shopping cart are not
established, no fee for removal and storage of such shopping cart shall be
imposed. At the close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall determine
whether good cause was shown for the abatement or removal of the shopping cart
from public or private property. The decision of the hearing office shall be
deemed the final administrative determination. If good cause is shown for the
abatement and removal of the shopping cart, the owner or its agent shall have
fifteen (15) days from the date of the hearing to retrieve its shopping cart
upon payment of the administrative fee. If good cause is not shown for the
abatement and removal of the shopping cart from public or private property, the
administrative fee shall be waived and the owner or its agent shall have
fifteen (15) days to retrieve its shopping cart from the storage area.
   D.   Any shopping carts which are not retrieved by their owner within thirty
(30) days after the mailing of written notice of abatement when such owner has
not requested a hearing in accordance with this section, or within thirty (30)
days storage of the cart by the city in all other cases, shall be deemed to be
permanently abandoned and may be sold at public auction or otherwise disposed
of at the end of thirty (30) days following such notice.
   E.   At such time as shall be convenient to the city, the city shall
advertise for the sale of permanently abandoned (as provided in subsection D of
this section) shopping carts. Notice of such sale shall be posted in three (3)
conspicuous places located within the city. Ten (10) days after the posting of
such notice and the time and place fixed in the notice for said sale (or at
such times and places as the sale shall be reasonably continued) such shopping
cart may be sold along with other shopping carts, and delivered to the highest
bidder free and clear of the claims of the owner thereof.
   F.   The proceeds of such sale shall be disbursed to the city. (Ord. 2266 §
1, 1995)
8.72.070: IDENTIFICATION OF SHOPPING CARTS:
All shopping carts used in the city shall be properly identified by the owner
thereof, including the name of the local store in which such shopping cart is
to be used. All persons owning shopping carts within the city for use of their
customers to take outside of the buildings shall have firmly affixed thereto
the owner's identification. (Ord. 2266 § 1, 1995)
8.72.080: REMOVAL FROM PREMISES PROHIBITED; EXCEPTIONS:

store, market or other mercantile establishment in the city, any shopping cart,
wagon or similar device, bearing a notification affixed thereto in a

8.72.090: ABANDONMENT PROHIBITED:

8.76.010: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate adult oriented businesses to
promote the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Redlands and to
prevent communitywide adverse economic impacts, increased crime, decreased
property values and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought
about by the concentration of adult oriented businesses in close proximity to
each other, or proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools for minors,
churches and residentially zoned districts. The city council of the city of
Redlands finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the
concentration of adult oriented businesses causes an increase in the number of
transients in the area and an increase in crime, and in addition to the effects
described above, can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere.
The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing
a limitation or prohibition on the content of any communicative materials,
including adult oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect
of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to adult oriented
materials protected by the first amendment, or to deny access by the
distributors and exhibitors of adult oriented entertainment to their intended
market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or
legitimize the distribution of obscene material. Rather it is, the purpose of
this chapter to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
concentration of adult oriented businesses, or their close proximity to
incompatible uses, while permitting the location of adult oriented businesses
in certain areas. (Ord. 2455 § 1, 2000: Ord. 2345 § 2, 1997)

   H.   All interior areas of the adult oriented business shall be illuminated
at a minimum of the following foot-candles, minimally maintained and evenly
distributed at ground level:

9.24.050: POLICE SERVICE FEE:
   A.   Purpose: The city finds and determines that minors who are repeatedly
detained and supervised by police personnel for violating curfew and daytime
loitering laws impose an extraordinary burden on the manpower and resources of
the police department because juveniles taken into custody by police personnel
must be supervised in an unsecured area of the police department until they are
released to a parent or guardian. police officers who supervise minors who have
been detained are then unavailable to carry out police duties in the field and
this decreases the level of police protection, thereby decreasing public safety
in the community. The purpose of this section is to defray the reasonable costs
that the city incurs to provide extraordinary police services to respond to,
detain, and supervise repeat curfew and daytime loitering violators.
As used in this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
   REPEAT CURFEW OR DAYTIME LOITERING VIOLATOR: Any minor: 1) who has been
detained and taken into custody by city police personnel on more than one
occasion in a twelve (12) month period for violating section
9.24.020 or
9.24.040 of this chapter and 2) who has been reprimanded by the San Bernardino
juvenile court because said court finds it to be true that the minor violated
section
9.24.020 or
9.24.040 of this chapter on more than one occasion in a twelve (12) month
period.
   RESPONSIBLE PARTY: Any parent, legal guardian, or other person in charge or
control of a repeat curfew violator.
   B.   Police Services Fee Established; Debt To City: A responsible party
shall be liable for a police services fee whenever the city's police personnel
respond to, detain, and supervise a repeat curfew or daytime loitering
violator. The city council shall establish the amount of the police services
fee by resolution. The police services fee charged to a responsible party shall
be a debt to the city by the responsible party. Any responsible party owing
money to the city pursuant to this section shall be liable in an action brought
by the city to recover such amount, including reasonable attorney fees.
   C.   Billing: The chief of police, or his or her designee, shall notify the
finance department in writing of: 1) the name and address of the responsible
party, 2) the date and time of the initial violation and of the repeat
violation of section
9.24.020 or
9.24.040 of this chapter, 3) the names of the police personnel who responded
to, detained and supervised the repeat curfew or daytime loitering violator,
and 4) the date that the repeat curfew or daytime loitering violator was
reprimanded by the San Bernardino juvenile court for the repeat violation. The
finance department may adopt administrative procedures for the purposes of
implementing the provisions of this section.
   D.   Appeal: Any responsible party who receives a bill from the finance
department pursuant to this section may, within fifteen (15) days after

9.34.010: LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE:
   A.   The city council of the city of Redlands finds that there is a current

welfare and safety of the citizens of Redlands.

dramatic increase of sales, reports of sales, thefts and possession of over the

regularly victimized by those persons who steal these substances, drugs and
products on a regular basis.

PSYCHOACTIVE BATH SALTS, PSYCHOACTIVE HERBAL INCENSE, AND OTHER SYNTHETIC DRUGS

Drugs Prohibited

9.36.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   Recreational use of psychoactive bath salts, psychoactive herbal
incense, and similar products commonly known as "synthetic drugs" has been
documented to cause hallucinations, agitation, psychosis, aggression, suicidal
and homicidal ideations, cannibalism, and death. While state and federal laws
and regulations prohibit some synthetic drugs, the makers of these drugs
continually alter the composition of the compounds in their products so as to
escape the scope of those laws and regulations. The purpose and intent of this
chapter is to provide the city with measures to address the dangers to the
community posed by synthetic drugs that are not regulated by state or federal
law.
   B.   Synthetic drugs are extremely dangerous and are gaining popularity at
an alarming rate among high school and college aged individuals, as well as
among parolees and probationers. These drugs are widely available in stores
throughout the city, despite the state of California's attempt to ban such
drugs under Health And Safety Code sections 11375.5 (banning synthetic
stimulant compounds and derivatives) and 11401 (banning "analogs" of controlled
substances) (collectively "state synthetic drug laws"), and the federal
government's attempt to ban such drugs under the controlled substances act (the
"CSA") (21 USC § 81 et seq.). The city council further finds that the dangers
of synthetic drugs, which have been documented to cause hallucinations,
agitations, psychosis, aggression, suicidal and homicidal ideations,
cannibalism, and death, require regulation.
   C.   While the state synthetic drug laws and the CSA prohibit certain
compounds that are used to create synthetic drugs, they are not comprehensive
enough to eliminate the distribution and sale of all synthetic drugs in the
city. Specifically, the city council finds that the makers of synthetic drugs
continually alter the composition of the compounds in their products so as to
not come under the prohibition of the state synthetic drug laws, the CSA, and
other law and regulations that attempt to prohibit the sale of synthetic drugs.
In fact, products which plainly are being marketed for use as synthetic drugs
are now being packaged with advertisements stating that the product does not
contain compounds specifically banned by the state synthetic drug laws. Thus
the city council finds that in order to implement an effective measure
prohibiting the distribution and sale of synthetic drugs, it is necessary to
look at all factors related to the sales and marketing of synthetic drugs.
These factors will help city officials determine whether a product that does
not come under the purview of state synthetic drug laws or the CSA is
nevertheless a synthetic drug because it is intended for recreational drug use.
   D.   While the question of whether a given product is being distributed or
sold for use as a recreational drug must be determined on a case by case basis,
the city council finds that the following evidentiary factors are helpful in
determining whether a given product is in fact a synthetic drug:
      1.   Marketing: Synthetic drugs are rarely, if ever, suitable for their
marketed uses. For example, a synthetic drug in the form of a powder might be
marketed as a "glass cleaner", even though the powder cannot reasonably be used
to clean glass.
      2.   Sales Location: Synthetic drugs are typically sold in liquor stores,
smoke shops and gas stations, yet synthetic drugs are marketed as products that
are not typically sold by these businesses. For example, synthetic drugs are
often marketed as bath salts, spice, incense, potpourri, skin treatments,
cleaning products and plant food; however, these types of products are
typically not sold in liquor stores, smoke shops or gas stations.
      3.   Warning Labels: Synthetic drugs often use warning labels such as:
"not for human consumption" and "not for purchase by minors". Bona fide bath
salts, incense, cleaning products and the like do not typically bear such
labels. Of particular relevance are labels that indicate a given product does
not contain chemical compounds banned by state synthetic drug laws, which bona
fide bath salts, incense, cleaning products and the like would not have any
reason to advertise.
      4.   Price: Synthetic drugs are typically more expensive than products
that are used for the synthetic drug's marketed use. For example, a synthetic
drug marketed as "glass cleaner" might be priced at fifty dollars ($50.00) for
an eighth (1/8) of an ounce, while bona fide glass cleaner is priced at
approximately five dollars ($5.00) for twenty six (26) ounces.
      5.   Similarity To Illicit Street Drugs: Synthetic drugs often resemble
illicit street drugs and/or use brand names and packaging that are designed to
make the product appear similar to illicit drugs. For example, many synthetic
drugs are sold as white powders packaged in vials (resembling cocaine) or dyed
green to appear similar to marijuana. Additionally, brand names are often
similar to street slang for illicit drugs and have no relation to the products
that are purportedly being sold. These brand names are always changing, but
include "Eight Ballz", "Spice", "Black Mamba", "K-2", "Puff", "Sugar Sticks",
"Green Buddha", "Diable Botanical Incense", "Scooby Snax Potpourri", "Grape Ape
Herbal Incense", "Three Monkey Incense", "Mr. And Mrs. Marley", "Cloud 9
Incense", and a group of synthetic drugs marketed as from "The Spice Guy".
   E.   An effective way to prevent and abate the health, safety and welfare
concerns that exist as a result of the marketing, distribution, and sale of
synthetic drugs in manners that brazenly seek to circumvent state and federal
law is through the administrative, civil and criminal enforcement procedures
set forth in title 1,
 chapter 1.22 and title 8,
chapter 8.04 of this code. This chapter shall not apply to any activity already
regulated by the state synthetic drug laws, the CSA, or any other applicable

DRUGS PROHIBITED:
   A.   It is unlawful for any person to possess, store, provide, distribute,
or sell any synthetic drug within the city.
   B.   Merely disclaiming a synthetic drug as "not safe for human consumption"
will not avoid the application of this section.
   C.   It is unlawful for any person to store, provide, sell, or distribute or
to permit the storage, provision, sale or distribution of synthetic drugs from
any real property owned, possessed, managed, or controlled by that person in
the city.
   D.   The enforcing officer may consider any of the following evidentiary
factors to determine if the product is a synthetic drug:
      1.   The product is not suitable for its marketed use (such as
crystalline or powder being marketed as "glass cleaner");
      2.   The business providing, distributing or selling the product does not
typically provide, distribute or sell products that are used for that product's
marketed use (such as a liquor store selling "plant food");
      3.   The product contains a warning label that is not typically present
on products that are used for that product's marketed use (such as "not for
human consumption", "not for purchase by minors", or "does not contain
chemicals banned by Health And Safety Code section 11375.5");
      4.   The product is significantly more expensive than products that are
used for that product's marketed use (such as a half of a gram of a substance
marketed as "glass cleaner" costing $50.00);
      5.   The product resembles an illicit street drug (such as cocaine,
methamphetamine or marijuana); or
      6.   The product's name or packaging uses images or slang referencing an
illicit drug (such as "Eight Ballz" or "Green Buddha"). (Ord. 2795, 2013)
9.36.040: PUBLIC NUISANCE:

shall be entitled to recover attorney fees incurred in any such action or
proceeding. (Ord. 2795, 2013)
9.36.050: CONFISCATION OF SYNTHETIC DRUGS:
Because the use of synthetic drugs has been documented to cause hallucinations,
agitation, psychosis, aggression, suicidal and homicidal ideations,
cannibalism, and death, any violation of this chapter presents a grave and
imminent danger not only to the person consuming the synthetic drug, but also
to the public at large. Any police officer who issues a criminal citation under
this chapter shall confiscate any synthetic drugs and store them, pending the
conclusion of the criminal case. (Ord. 2795, 2013)
9.36.060: SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF BUSINESS LICENSE:
No person holding a validly issued city business license and owning or
operating a business in the city may use that business to provide, distribute,
or sell any synthetic drug or any substance claimed or represented to be a
synthetic drug. A violation of this chapter by the holder of a validly issued
city business license shall constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of
a business license in accordance with the procedures set forth in title 5,
chapter 5.04 of this code. (Ord. 2795, 2013)
9.36.070: PENALTIES:

such action would be in the interest of justice, he/she may specify in the
accusatory pleading that the offense shall be an infraction.
   B.   Each person committing, causing, or maintaining a violation of this
chapter or failing to comply with the requirements set forth herein shall be
deemed guilty of a separate offense for each and every day during any portion
of which any violation of any provision of this chapter is committed,
continued, maintained, or permitted by such person and shall be punishable
accordingly. (Ord. 2795, 2013)
9.36.080: SEIZURE OF EVIDENCE:
Any products or substances possessed, provided, distributed, or sold in
violation of any provision of this chapter shall be seized and stored in
accordance with law. (Ord. 2795, 2013)

9.38.010: PURPOSE:
This chapter protects tenants from pretextual evictions in which property
owners invoke substantial renovation or demolition of a unit as "just cause"
under Civil Code §§ 1946.2, 1947.12, and 1947.13 as adopted by Assembly Bill
1482 (the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, the "Act"), and as may be subsequently
amended, by requiring evicting property owners show a government-approved
demolition and/or remodeling permit to the tenant prior to initiating an
eviction for demolition or substantial remodel of residential real property.
(Ord. 2942 § 2, 2022)
9.38.020: DEFINITIONS:
The following words and phrases, whenever used in this chapter, shall be
construed as defined in this section:

              amended.
RESIDENTIAL   Shall have the same meaning as in Civil Code § 1946.2, as may be
REAL          amended.
PROPERTY:
              The replacement or substantial modification of any structural,
              electrical, plumbing, or mechanical system that requires a permit
              from a government agency, or the abatement of hazardous
              materials, including lead-based paint, mold, or asbestos, in
              accordance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, that
SUBSTANTIALLY cannot be reasonably accomplished in a safe manner with the
REMODEL:      tenant in place and that requires the tenant to vacate the
              residential real property for at least 30 days. Cosmetic
              improvements alone, including painting, decorating, and minor
              repairs, or other work that can be performed safely without
              having the residential real property vacated, do not qualify as
              substantial rehabilitation.
TENANCY:      Shall have the same meaning as in Civil Code § 1946.2, as may be
              amended. (Ord. 2942 § 2, 2022)
 
9.38.030: NOTICE OF EVICTION BASED ON INTENT TO DEMOLISH OR SUBSTANTIALLY
REMODEL RESIDENTIAL REAL PROPERTY:
Before an owner of residential real property issues a notice to terminate a
tenancy for a no- fault just cause eviction based on demolition or a
substantial remodel of residential real property, the owner shall have obtained
all necessary permits for the substantial remodel and/or demolition from all
applicable government agencies. All termination notices for no-fault just cause
eviction described in this chapter shall include a copy of all issued permits,
which permits must then be in effect, and not be expired or revoked. The owner
shall include reasonably detailed information in the termination notice
regarding each of (i) the scope of the work, (ii) why the work cannot be
reasonably accomplished in a safe manner with the tenant in place, and (iii)
why the work requires the tenant to vacate for at least thirty (30) days. These
requirements are in addition to and do not supersede any other obligation the
owner may have under applicable local, state, and federal law. No other legal
remedies available to owners are affected by this chapter. (Ord. 2942 § 2,
2022)
9.38.040: RELOCATION PAYMENTS:
To the extent applicable for a no-fault just cause eviction for intent to
demolish or substantially remodel residential real property under California
Civil Code § 1946.2(b)(2)(D), the owner must provide relocation assistance in
the form of: (i) a rent waiver equal to two months of the tenant's rent that
was in effect when the owner issued the notice to terminate the tenancy; or
(ii) a payment of four thousand five hundred dollars ($4,500), whichever is
greater. The direct payment of four thousand five hundred dollars ($4,500)
shall be paid to the tenant in two payments. The first payment shall be two-
thirds (2/3) of the rental assistance to be paid within fifteen (15) calendar
days after the notice of termination is served on the tenant and the second
payment shall be one-third (1/3) of the rental assistance to be paid when the
tenant vacates the residential real property. The notice of termination shall
state the terms of the applicable rental assistance. (Ord. 2942 § 2, 2022)
9.38.050: EXCLUSIONS:
The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the types of residential real
properties or residential circumstances described in California Civil Code §
1946.2(e). (Ord. 2942 § 2, 2022)
9.38.060: APPLICATION:
This chapter shall apply to notices of terminations issued on or after the
effective date of this chapter and to tenancies: (1) where the tenant remains
in possession; and (2) the period of notice required for notices of termination
under California Civil Code §§ 1946.1 and 1946.2 have not expired as of the
effective date of this chapter. (Ord. 2942 § 2, 2022)
9.38.070: ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES:
An owner's failure to comply with this chapter shall render any notice of
termination of tenancy issued void. The requirements of this chapter may be
asserted by the tenant as an affirmative defense in an unlawful detainer
proceeding. In addition to any other remedies available in law and equity, any
owner of residential real property who intentionally violates this chapter when
issuing an invalid termination notice pursuant to this chapter shall be liable
in a civil action to the tenant for a civil penalty in an amount of up to
fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) and/or reasonable attorney's fees and costs,
each as determined by the court. (Ord. 2942 § 2, 2022)

10.42.140: Violations
10.42.010: PURPOSE:
This chapter shall be known as, and may be cited as, the "Preferential Parking
Code." This chapter is enacted pursuant to authority granted by Sections 22507
and 22507.5 of the California Vehicle Code. Preferential parking zones are
necessary to alleviate serious problems in certain residential areas of the
City due, in part, to the parking of motor vehicles on streets by nonresidents
of the immediate area for extended periods of time and the nonuse of available
public transit alternatives to automobile travel by nonresidents which has
resulted in neighborhood decline in affected areas because of traffic
congestion, noise, air pollution, traffic hazards, and inability of residents
to park their vehicles reasonably close to their residences. (Ord. 2897 § 3,
2019)
10.42.020: PETITION FORMS:
The Municipal Utilities and Engineering Department shall provide petition forms
for preferential parking zones upon the written request of any five (5)
residents of a proposed zone, one (1) of whom shall be designated in the
request as the official representative of the zone advocates. (Ord. 2897 § 3,
2019)
10.42.030: ESTABLISHMENT OF A PREFERENTIAL PARKING ZONE:
   A.   Proceedings for establishment of a preferential parking zone may be
initiated by petition containing the signatures of at least sixty (60) percent
of the residents of all units of occupancy fronting curbs proposed to be
included in the zone. The petition shall include a description of the proposed
zone boundaries, the proposed restriction, and the days and hours the
restriction is proposed to be effective. The petition shall state that all
signatories desire to have preferential parking restrictions imposed and that
all signatories are willing to pay associated administrative costs necessary to
establish such zone. Each signatory shall affix his or her signature, printed
name, and address to the petition which petition shall be circulated by the
zone advocates. Not more than sixty (60) days after the petition form is
provided by the MUED Department pursuant to section
10.42.020 of this Code, the signed and completed petition shall be submitted to
the Traffic and Parking Commission.
   B.   The Traffic and Parking Commission shall set a place and time for a
public discussion on the proposed zone. The MUED Director shall mail notice of
the hearing at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing to all property owners,
residents, and other occupants within the proposed zone and within three
hundred (300) feet of the boundaries of the proposed zone.
   C.   Following public discussion, the Traffic and Parking Commission shall
make a recommendation to the City Council regarding whether the preferential
parking zone should be established. Following receipt of the recommendation of
the Traffic and Parking Commission, the City Council shall, by resolution,
determine whether the preferential parking zone shall be established. Said
determination shall be based upon factors which may include but are not limited
to, the following:
      (1)   High Demand: More than seventy-five (75) percent of the on-street
spaces are occupied during the days and hours proposed for parking restriction;
and
      (2)   Self Contained Area: The zone, alone or in combination with other
existing or potential preferential parking zones, constitutes a self-contained
area of parking demand and supply. For purposes of this section, "self-
contained area" shall mean an area of sufficient size to allow for resident
parking, using boundaries such as major streets, nonresidential land uses,
transition to higher or lower density residential areas, water bodies and other
natural features; and using surveys of existing conditions to determine the
extent of the area impacted by nonresident parking.
   D.   Each preferential parking zone shall be identified by a letter or
combination of letters which shall be the official designation of the zone.
(Ord. 2897 § 3, 2019)
10.42.040: TERMINATION OF A PREFERENTIAL PARKING ZONE:
The City Council may terminate a preferential parking zone upon receipt of a
petition calling for termination which has been received and transmitted by the
City Clerk, and which contains the signatures and corresponding printed name
and address representing a majority (fifty percent (50%) plus one (1)) of the
dwelling units in the zone. The City Council may also terminate a preferential
parking zone, without submission of a petition requesting termination, by
resolution setting forth the reasons for such termination which reasons may
include, but are not limited to, changes in circumstances which led to the
original establishment of the zone. (Ord. 2897 § 3, 2019)
10.42.050: PERMIT ISSUANCE:
   A.   Parking permits for preferential parking zones shall be issued by the
Department of Finance. No more than one (1) permit shall be issued for each
vehicle for which application is made. Each permit issued shall show by code,
color or both, the particular preferential parking zone for which it has been
issued and resident permits shall include the license plate number of the motor
vehicle for which it was issued.
   B.   Preferential parking permits for residents shall be issued only upon
application of a legal resident of the established zone who is the registered
owner or has exclusive use and control of the vehicle for which application is
made. Proof of residency and ownership or exclusive use and control shall be
demonstrated as determined by the Finance Director.
   C.   The number of preferential parking permits, if any, that may be issued
pursuant to this chapter shall be determined and calculated as follows:
   (1)   Residents: No more than three (3) permits for residents shall be
issued to any one (1) residence. Permits issued to residents shall remain valid
while the applicant continues to reside at the address set forth on the
application and remains the owner of the vehicle for which the permit is
issued.
   (2)   Visitors: Not more than two (2) visitor preferential parking permits
shall be issued to any one (1) residence for the use of visitors to the home of
the applicant. Visitor permits shall remain valid while the applicant continues
to reside at the address set forth on the application. (Ord. 2897 § 3, 2019)
10.42.060: PERMIT FEE:
Applications for issuance of initial permits or transfer permits when the
holder of a permit in one zone moves to another zone and desires a permit for
the new zone, or a replacement permit in the case of a lost or mutilated
permit, shall be filed with the Department of Finance and shall be accompanied
by the fee established by resolution of the City Council. Fees may be prorated
for periods of less than one (1) year except that no refund shall be issued for
cancellation of a permit unless the zone is terminated by City Council action.
The Finance Director shall not issue a replacement permit unless the Finance
Director has received satisfactory evidence that the permit being replaced has
been lost or mutilated. (Ord. 2897 § 3, 2019)
10.42.070: PERMIT DISPLAY:
Preferential parking permits for residents shall be prominently displayed and
firmly attached to the left side of the rear bumper of the vehicle for which
the permit was issued. Permits for visitors shall be prominently displayed

chapter and, upon written notification, that person must surrender the permit
to the Finance Director or prove its destruction or disfigurement to the
Finance Director's satisfaction.
   B.   Any person whose preferential parking permit has been revoked shall not
be issued a new permit for one (1) calendar year following revocation and must
submit a new application and pay the fee required for a new permit. (Ord. 2897

city engineer need not give the permit holder of record further notification
that further building inspection by the department of building and safety will
be withheld from his project until street repairs are completed as approved by
the city engineer.
   D.   The time limitations specified by this section are subject to
extensions upon written request and evidenced that the work could not proceed

of any ordinance now in force or hereafter adopted by the city in the exercise
of its police power during the term hereof; and if such failure, neglect or
refusal shall continue for more than three (3) days after demand by the

addition to all rights and remedies allowed by law to the city, thereupon may
revoke said permit. (Prior code § 76029)
12.16.250: LIABILITY FOR DAMAGE:
In the event that it becomes necessary for the engineer, with the approval of
the city manager, to revoke a permit in accordance with the provisions of this

12.22.110: Duty To Deny Final Building Permit Approval
12.22.010: FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   The Redlands city council has found and determined that:
      1.   There is a lack of adequate curbs, gutters, water and wastewater
facilities, storm drains, streetlights, sidewalks, streets, trails and other
rights of way in various areas of the city, which is prejudicial and dangerous
to the public health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the city;
      2.   The lack of improved sidewalks in the city in many instances forces
pedestrians, including schoolchildren, to walk in the streets and to be subject
to the hazards of vehicular traffic;
      3.   The lack of improved sidewalks during rainy weather has caused
unhealthy conditions resulting from pedestrians walking through mud and water
along streets or dirt shoulders;
      4.   Streets and highways of inadequate width and design hinder vehicular
movements and may constitute a hazard to the safety and health of users;
      5.   The lack of curbs, storm drains, water and wastewater facilities and
other street improvements results in poor drainage and a collection of filth
and waste;
      6.   The lack of improved streets impedes the operation of firetrucks,
police cars and other emergency vehicles as well as the operation of street
sweepers and refuse collection vehicles; and
      7.   The lack of adequate recreational trails and pathways causes
pedestrians, bicyclists and equestrians to use other unsafe or inappropriately
designed rights of way which may constitute a hazard to the safety and health
of such users.
   B.   It is the purpose of the city in adopting the provisions of this
chapter to:
      1.   Impose reasonable requirements of dedication and improvements upon
persons engaged in the development, construction, reconstruction or remodeling
of buildings which tend to result in increased demands upon the existing public
rights of way, streets, highways and utility facilities in the city, thereby
increasing the danger to the public health, safety and welfare;
      2.   Extend the basic requirements of the state subdivision map act by
establishing standards and requirements for dedication and improvements in
connection with the development of land in which no subdivision is involved;
      3.   Alleviate the undesirable situation found to exist in subsection A
of this section by spreading the cost of public improvements upon abutting
property in an equitable manner, and by causing the installation of those
improvements required by the city to serve property about to be developed at
the time of its development.
   C.   The city intends to require, in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter, the dedication of portions of the public rights of way, including
streets, highways, alleys, trails, pathways, streetlights, water, wastewater
and storm drain facilities, and the construction of improvements contiguous to
the property from the property line to the centerline of the public rights of
way as necessitated by the nature and type of building or structure being
constructed and the use to which the property is being put.
   D.   The provisions of this chapter are intended to be additional to any
other requirement of law pertaining to the provision of public facilities and
improvements, and nothing in this chapter shall be construed to excuse
compliance with any other requirement for the provision of public facilities or
improvements. (Ord. 2578 § 1, 2004)

street, highway, alley, trail or pathway described or identified in the city's
general plan, any applicable specific plans or as otherwise required by the
director in accord with an established city street system, plan or standard.

other required public facilities. All rights of way shall be accompanied by a
title examination and be free of all liens and encumbrances.

instance, the director shall determine whether or not the necessary
improvements exist and are in accordance with the general plan and such
specific plans. Each building permit application shall be so endorsed at the
time it is issued.

determination of the director, also apply to any person who alters, enlarges or
expands, or causes to be altered, enlarged or expanded, any building in the
city, if such work exceeds seven hundred fifty (750) square feet. (Ord. 2578 §
1, 2004; amd. Ord. 2907, 5-5-2020)
12.22.050: PUBLIC UTILITY RELOCATIONS:

satisfactory evidence that such person has made arrangements with such public
utility company for the relocation or modification of such public utility
facilities. (Ord. 2578 § 1, 2004)
12.22.060: CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS:
If the director determines that public improvements are required, these public
improvements shall be designed to city standards and their construction
guaranteed by an improvement agreement secured by a bond or cash deposit, prior
to issuance of a building permit for the subject property. If the building
permit is not exercised, the improvement obligation shall terminate and the
security shall be returned. (Ord. 2578 § 1, 2004)
12.22.070: DEFERRAL OF IMPROVEMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Upon written application, the director, by written order, may recommend to the
city council the deferral of any of the improvements required by this chapter
if the director finds that the public health, safety and welfare of the
inhabitants of the city will not be endangered by the deferment of the
construction of the improvements, and that any one of the following exists:
   A.   There is a lack of adequate data in regard to the grades, plans or
surveys which complicates the construction of the improvements and indicates
they should be deferred to a later time;
   B.   The construction of the improvements is included in an approved or
pending assessment district or otherwise guaranteed as provided by city
ordinance;
   C.   Construction of the improvements would be incompatible with the present
state of the neighborhood's development, or be impractical or premature because
of the condition of the surrounding property; or
   D.   Construction of the improvements would create a hazardous or defective
condition. (Ord. 2578 § 1, 2004)
12.22.080: CONDITIONS OF DEFERRAL:
Any deferral of improvements pursuant to this chapter shall be conditioned on
the filing with the director of a future improvement secured by one of the
following at the sole discretion of the public works director:
   A.   A bond or bonds by one or more duly authorized corporate sureties in a
form approved by the city attorney;
   B.   A deposit, either with the city or with a responsible escrow agent or

12.22.090: WAIVER OR MODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS:
Upon written application made before issuance of the building permit,
accompanied by a fee in an amount established by city council resolution, the
city council may, after a public hearing noticed in the same manner as is
required for public hearings on application for variances from the requirements
of zoning, waive or modify any of the requirements of this chapter if, based
upon substantial evidence, the city council finds that the conditions of
subsections A and B of this section, or of subsection C of this section, are
met as follows:
   A.   The street fronting on the subject property has already been improved
to the maximum feasible and desirable state, recognizing there are some such
streets which may have less than standard improvements when necessary to
preserve the character of the neighborhood, and to avoid unreasonable
interference with existing conditions such as mature trees, walls, yards and
open space; and
   B.   The granting of the waiver or modification will not perpetuate a

underground facilities have not been provided, the director of public works
shall forthwith proceed to do the work; provided, however, if such premises are
unoccupied and no electric or communications services are being furnished
thereto, the director of public works shall in lieu of providing the required
underground facilities, have the authority to order the disconnection and
removal of any and all overhead service wires and associated facilities
supplying utility service to said property. Upon completion of the work by the
director of public works, he shall file a written report with the city council
setting forth the fact that the required underground facilities have been
provided and the cost thereof, together with a legal description of the

shall hear and consider the report and all protests, if there be any, and then
proceed to affirm, modify or reject the assessment.
   G.   If any assessment is not paid within fifteen (15) days after its
confirmation by the council, the amount of the assessment shall become a lien
upon the property against which the assessment is made by the director of
public works and the director of public works is directed to turn over to the
assessor and tax collector a notice of lien on each of said properties on which
the assessment has not been paid, and said assessor and tax collector shall add
the amount of said assessment to the next regular bill for taxes levied against
the premises upon which said assessment was not paid. The assessment shall be
due and payable at the same time as said property taxes are due and payable,
and if not paid when due and payable shall bear interest at the rate of six
percent (6%) per annum. (Prior code § 93205)

   A.   Event:

determination by the chief to deny the application or approve the application
subject to conditions; or
            (2)   Twenty five (25) days, but less than forty five (45) days,
prior to the date of such event in which case the opportunity to appeal to the
city council is deemed waived.
         b.   Shall be denied, approved or approved subject to conditions by
the chief within ten (10) days after receipt of the application. After the
decision, the chief shall immediately attempt to notify the applicant orally

conditions, shall be in writing and must be received by the chief within six
(6) days after written notice of the chief's decision was sent to the
applicant. The writing may be by telegram, facsimile or any written document
sent by the applicant. Failure to accept as set forth herein or failure to file
a timely appeal to the city council shall automatically be deemed a withdrawal
of the application. If the applicant files a valid written acceptance and

automatically issue upon receipt of the written acceptance by the chief. The
chief shall immediately notify the city manager and the city attorney that the
permit has been issued.

accept timely, if the appeal was upheld by the city council, shall

      4.   Because time is of the essence, there shall be no appeal to the city
council from the decision of the chief where the exercise of free speech rights

deemed a withdrawal of the application. If the applicant files a valid written
acceptance and complies with the applicable conditions precedent, if any, the
permit will automatically issue upon receipt of the written acceptance by the
chief. The chief shall immediately notify the city manager and the city
attorney that the permit has been issued.
      3.   If the applicant has filed a completed application at least seven
(7) days before the event and the permit is denied or conditioned in a manner
unacceptable to the applicant, the applicant, within forty eight (48) hours of
oral or written notification of the chief's decision, whichever occurs first,
may appeal in writing to the city manager, presenting facts and reasons why the
denial or conditions should be reversed or deleted, respectively, and the
application granted or granted as modified. The appeal hearing shall be at a
time and place mutually agreeable to the parties. If the parties cannot agree
on the time or place, the appeal hearing shall be the next day at four o'clock

12.40.090: ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATION; APPROVAL AND ISSUANCE OF PERMIT:
When the chief determines that a completed application has been filed for a
permit authorizing an event in a manner required by this chapter, and that
there are no grounds for denying such permit, the chief shall approve such
application subject to all the general conditions hereinafter required by this
chapter with any special conditions authorized by this chapter and determined
by the chief to be necessary in order to protect the safety of persons and
property and the control of pedestrian and vehicular traffic in and around the
site of the event. (Ord. 2617 § 1, 2005)
12.40.100: ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATION; PERMIT CONDITIONING OR DENIAL OF
PERMIT:
The following factors shall be considered by the chief in determining whether
the imposition of reasonable permit conditions pursuant to section
12.40.160 of this chapter will satisfy public health, safety or welfare
concerns and allow the event to proceed as modified. If not, the chief shall
deny the application for a permit.
   A.   The person applying for the permit has failed to provide supplemental
application information requested by the chief or has otherwise failed to
complete the application;
   B.   The information contained in the application, including supplemental
application information requested by the chief, is found to be false in any
material respect;
   C.   An application for another event to be held on the same date as that
requested by the applicant has been previously filed or approved, and such
other event is so close in time and location to the event proposed by the
applicant as to cause undue traffic congestion or to place the city in a
position of being unable to meet the needs for police services for both events;
   D.   The time, route or size of the event will substantially interrupt the
safe and orderly movement of traffic contiguous to the site or route of the
event or disrupt the use of a street at its peak traffic time;
   E.   The concentration of persons, animals or vehicles at the site of the
event or at the site of an assembly or disbanding area around the event will
prevent proper police, fire or ambulance services from reaching areas
contiguous to the event;
   F.   The size of the event will require the diversion of so many city police
officers to ensure that participants stay within the boundaries or route of the
event and to protect participants in the event, that police protection to the
rest of the city will be seriously jeopardized; provided, however, that nothing
herein authorizes the denial of a permit because of the need to protect
participants from the conduct of others if reasonable permit conditions can be
imposed;
   G.   Given the size and nature of the event, the reasonably available number
of city police officers and other personnel is not sufficient to ensure the
safety of participants or the attending public;
   H.   The event consists of a parade that will not move from its point of
origin to its point of termination in three (3) hours or less;
   I.   The location of the event will substantially interfere with
construction or maintenance work previously scheduled to take place on or along
the city street, parking facility, sidewalk or other public right of way to be
occupied by the event;
   J.   The event will occur at a time when a school is in session and along a
route or at a location adjacent to the school or a class thereof, and the noise
created by the activities of the event will substantially disrupt the
educational activity of such school or class;
   K.   The decorative material on parade floats is not noncombustible or flame
retardant or motorized parade floats and towing apparatus are not provided with
portable fire extinguishers readily accessible to the operator, as provided in
the uniform fire code;
   L.   The application is not timely submitted and there is insufficient time
to investigate and process the application pursuant to the time lines herein.
(Ord. 2617 § 1, 2005)
12.40.110: PERMIT CONDITIONS; ANIMALS:

reasonable requirements concerning the time, place or manner of conducting such
event, as necessary to protect the safety of persons and property or to control
vehicular and pedestrian traffic in and around the site of the event, provided

kind in a city park poses physical risks of harm for which the city may have
liability unless such use is reasonably regulated. Additionally, the right of
persons to speak is properly limited with regard to time, place and manner by
balancing the correlative constitutional rights of the citizens of this
community to privacy and freedom from the public nuisance of excessively loud
and unnecessary sound. (Ord. 2081 § 1, 1989: Ord. 1931 § 6, 1986: prior code §

following provisions:

12.44.100: AMPLIFIED SOUND; GRANT OR DENIAL OF PERMIT:
   A.   In determining whether to grant or deny a permit, the director shall be
guided by the following considerations:
      1.   The extent to which sound may carry into private or residential
areas of the city.

      3.   The necessity for careful and safe provision of electricity and the
safety of individuals near such electrical sources.

disagreement with the content of any proposed talks, addresses, lectures, or
musical presentations. (Ord. 2823, 2015)

Upon denial by the director of an application made pursuant to this section,
the applicant may appeal to the city council within two (2) days thereafter by
filing an application and a copy of the notice of denial with the city clerk,
and requesting a hearing. The city clerk shall set the appeal for hearing by

prior code § 72205(e))

using the park or with nearby residents in the comfortable and reasonable
enjoyment of their premises, the director shall request the person in charge of
the assembly, or any other person appearing to be involved in the production of
the sound, to immediately reduce the level thereof. If the sound is not reduced
within five (5) minutes to a reasonable level, the director may immediately
contact the parks division staff to curtail the power source. (Ord. 2823, 2015)
12.44.135: ADDITIONAL ALTERNATE POWER SOURCES; APPROVAL, INSPECTION AND FEES:
Any additional or alternate power source for lighting or other purposes which
may be required must be approved for such use by the city's building and safety
division and by the director, for safety, noise and appropriateness. The
building and safety division shall inspect all connections, wiring, and
components of sound, lighting and/or wiring systems prior to rehearsal and/or
performance, and may impose a fee for such inspections as established by
resolution of the city council. (Ord. 2823, 2015)

12.52.010: PURPOSE OF CHAPTER:
Redlands is graced by the presence of thousands of mature trees that contribute
long term aesthetic, environmental and economic benefits to the city.
Aesthetically, trees offer dimensions in the form of color, shape, texture,
scale and variety. Mature trees are often integral components of many historic
sites and their presence contributes to the site's cultural and historic
significance. Environmental benefits derived from trees include the filtering
of air pollutants, increasing atmospheric oxygen levels, the stabilization of
soils, reducing heat convection, decreasing wind speed and reducing the
negative effects of solar glare. The biological diversity of wildlife and plant
communities is enhanced by the favorable conditions created by trees. The
economic benefits derived from trees include increased property values and
additional revenue generated by businesses, visitors and new residents
attracted to the urban forest image of the city. Trees are a major capital
asset of the city and like any valuable community asset, they require
appropriate care and protection. Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter
to:
   A.   Preserve and grow Redlands' canopy cover by protecting landmark, native
and specimen, and public trees in specified areas and expanding the protection
of street trees and trees on public property.
   B.   Safeguard the city's urban forest by providing for the regulation of
the protection, planting, maintenance and removal of public trees in the city.
   C.   Protect the visual and aesthetic character of the city.
   D.   Improve and enhance property values by conserving and adding to the
distinctive and unique aesthetic character of the many areas of the city.
   E.   Improve the quality of life for residents, visitors and wildlife.
   F.   Create favorable conditions for the protection of designated landmark,
native and specimen, and public trees for the benefit of current and future
residents of the city.
   G.   Maintain and enhance the general health, safety and welfare of the city
and its residents by assisting in counteracting air pollution and in minimizing
soil erosion and other related environmental damage. (Ord. 2554 § 1, 2004)

located primarily on private property to create a hazard or to create danger or
likelihood of harm to any public place, public area, parkway or street or to
public health, safety or welfare. It shall be the duty of any person owning or
occupying real property bordering on any street upon which property there may

Permits for tree trimming and removals shall only be issued to authorized tree
trimming companies pursuant to this chapter.
   C.   Issuance Of Permits: The director or the superintendent may issue a
permit provided for herein if the proposed work complies with the following
criteria:
      1.   It is desirable for the aesthetics of the area or neighborhood and

      2.   It addresses a defined and verified public health, welfare and
safety concern, including the removal of dead, dying or diseased trees, trees
or branches within the defined limits of the California public utilities
commission clearance requirements from electrical facilities, trees damaged as
a result of a traffic accident or other accidental cause, and trees causing
damage to private or public property where such damage cannot be remedied
without removal of the tree; or
      3.   It relates to an approved development project where the subject
trees interfere with the ability of the developer to comply with and implement
the approved conditions of approval; and

a tree or trees from a parkway or tree lawn in connection with the paving of a
sidewalk, or the paving or widening of the portion of a street or highway used
for vehicular traffic, the city shall require that such trees be replanted or
replaced. In the event conditions prevent planting on the parkway or tree lawn,
this requirement will be satisfied if any equivalent number of trees, at least
fifteen (15) gallon or greater in size as determined by the director, and
species as approved by the director, are planted in an attractive manner on the
adjoining property or location designated by the director.

accordance with this chapter. Such replacement shall meet the standards of
species and placement as provided for in the permit issued by the director or
the superintendent. The person proposing to remove any tree shall bear the cost
of removal and replacement of all trees removed.
   H.   Permit Fee Required: Before the director or superintendent shall issue

12.55.070: PERMITS FOR A-FRAME AND VERTICAL POLE BANNER SIGNS:
   A.   The public right of way areas and display sign times regulated by this
section are designated to constitute a limited access, public forum which is
strictly limited and open only to those persons and entities described in this
section, and on the terms stated in this section.
   B.   An "A-frame" or a "freestanding vertical pole banner" sign may be
placed in the public right of way, on the public sidewalk directly in front of
the store or other establishment displaying the sign. Such signs may have no
more than two (2) display faces, and each display face shall be a flat, smooth
surface, and remain completely free of dangerous protrusions such as tacks,
nails or wires; however, cutouts of any shape are allowed. Sign faces shall be
back to back. No ribbons, streamers, balloons or attachments of any kind may be
affixed to the sign. Signs may not consist of any moving parts or include a
display face which is hinged, or which otherwise swings or hangs from the "A-
frame", and must be stretched taut on the "freestanding vertical pole banner".
No glass, breakable materials or illumination is allowed for such signs. Signs
shall be physically stable and balanced flat on the sidewalk, and must be self-
supporting, stable and weighted, and constructed to withstand overturning by
wind or contact.

land use districts within the east valley corridor specific plan;
      11.   Specific plan 25; and
      12.   Specific plan 33.
   D.   An "A-frame" or a "freestanding vertical pole banner" sign may be
placed in the public right of way only when the business establishment for
which such sign is permitted is open. The sign must be placed on the public
sidewalk, directly in front of such business.
   E.   Each display face shall have a maximum area of six (6) square feet. An
"A-frame" sign shall not exceed three feet (3') in height or two feet (2') in
width. A "freestanding vertical pole banner" sign shall not exceed six feet
(6') in height at its highest point, including structural mechanism, or two
feet (2') in width. Changeable copy area of the sign is permitted for one
hundred percent (100%) of the display face. No such sign may have special
illumination and the display portion may have no parts which move, flash, blink
or fluoresce. Fluorescent or "Day-Glo" colors are not allowed. No paper or
nonrigid changeable copy areas are allowed.
   F.   An "A-frame" or a "freestanding vertical pole banner" sign shall not be
permanently affixed to any object, structure or the ground, including utility
poles, light poles, trees or other plants, or any merchandise or products
displayed outside buildings. At no time shall a sign be placed in the street or
in any position which impedes the smooth and safe flow of vehicular and
pedestrian traffic, or which interferes with driver or pedestrian sightlines or
corner clear zone requirements as specified by the city. No sign shall be
placed in such a manner as to obstruct access to a public sidewalk, public
street, driveway, parking space, fire door, fire escape or handicapped person
access. A clear area of at least six feet (6') in width shall be maintained for
pedestrian use over the entire length of the sidewalk in front of the business,
and no sign shall be placed within eight feet (8') of a permanent pedestrian
seating structure or area, or placed within a city parkway.
   G.   Signs shall not obscure or interfere with the effectiveness of any
official notice or public safety device. Signs shall not simulate in color or
design a traffic sign or signal, or make use of words, symbols or characters in
such a manner as may confuse pedestrians or drivers.
   H.   Every sign and all parts thereof shall be kept in good repair. The
display surface shall be kept clean, neatly painted and free from dust, rust
and corrosion. Any cracked, broken surfaces, missing sign copy or other
unmaintained or damaged portion of a sign shall be repaired or replaced or
removed within twenty (20) days following notice by the city.
   I.   The "A-frame" and "freestanding vertical pole banner" signs allowed by
this section may be displayed only by business establishments with ground floor
frontage on streets, whose business is not already identified on a multiple-
tenant street sign, who hold a currently valid city business license, who are
not currently in violation of, or nonconformance with, any of the zoning, land
use, environmental or business laws of the city, and who do not have a
freestanding sign.
   J.   An application (in a form to be supplied by the city) and application
fee (as established by resolution of the city council) will be required prior
to the issuance of permit to allow a sign on the sidewalk in the public right
of way. The permit will be issued by the city of Redlands municipal utilities
and engineering department. The permit attaches to the business at the location
specified. If the business is sold or transferred, and remains at the same
location, then the permit shall automatically transfer to the new owner or
transferee, who shall be bound to the terms and conditions of the original
permit. However, if the business which first obtained the permit moves to a
different location, or if the location is then taken by a new business, a new
application and permit shall be required.
   K.   A permit is issued for one year, but may be revoked or canceled at will
by the city. Any permit may be revoked for noncompliance, thirty (30) calendar
days after notice of noncompliance remains uncured, or in the case where the
sign constitutes a threat to the public health, safety or welfare. When a
permit is revoked, the owner of the sign must physically remove it from the
public right of way within twenty four (24) hours of notice of revocation. Upon
failure to do so, the city may summarily remove the sign and hold it in storage
for a maximum of thirty (30) days, during which time the owner may reclaim the
sign upon payment of costs of removal and storage.
   L.   There is no guarantee that the city will continue the program stated
herein. Permittees hold no expectation of renewal of any given permit, acquire
no vested right to continue displaying the sign on public property, and waive
all claims of uncompensated taking of private property as to the permitted sign
when they submit an application for such sign. Each permittee must apply for
permit renewal within sixty (60) days before the annual date of original
issuance. Renewal may be sought on a form prepared by the city for that purpose
with a fee as established by resolution of the city council. The city has no
duty to remind or notify any permittee of the need to renew. Failure to timely
seek renewal means that a new application must be submitted, with the new
application fee. At the city's option, any given permit may be renewed by a
stamp, sticker or official notation on the original permit, or by an entirely
new permit, or by a letter indicating renewal.
   M.   The city may give notice, by any reasonable means, that consent to
display an "A-frame" and "freestanding vertical pole banner" sign is or shall
be withdrawn temporarily so as to serve a more urgent or more important public
need, such as, without limitation, dealing with a natural disaster, a traffic
emergency, a temporary need to make more space available on the public right of
way, a civil disturbance, a parade, an election or other special event. In
urgent situations, the city may summarily remove a permitted sign without
notice, for a time sufficient to deal with the urgency. All permittees shall
comply with all notices to temporarily remove the permitted signs, and to
return them to display only in accordance with the city's directions.
   N.   A business issued a permit under this section shall obtain public
liability insurance from an insurance company licensed to do business in the
state of California which provides "occurrence" coverage against liability for
death, personal injury or property damage arising out of or in any way
connected with such event. Such insurance shall be in the amount of at least
one million dollars ($1,000,000.00), combined single limit, and shall name the
city and the city's elected officials, employees and agents as additional
insureds under the coverage afforded. In addition, such insurance shall be
primary and noncontributing with respect to any other insurance available to
city. Proof of such insurance with endorsements, in a form approved by the
city's risk manager, shall be filed with the city prior to the issuance of the
permit, and such insurance shall be maintained in full force and effect as long
as the "A-frame" or "freestanding vertical pole banner" is displayed.
   O.   The city may, at any time and for any reason, cancel or modify this
program allowing "A-frame" and "freestanding vertical pole banner" signs in the
public right of way. (Ord. 2785, 2013)
12.55.080: REAL ESTATE FOR SALE "KIOSK" SIGNS IN PARTICULAR LOCATIONS:

officer of the city by simply informing the applicant of the nature of the
error in issuance. Any applicant whose permit is revoked as issued in error
may, at any time thereafter, submit a new permit application which cures any
deficiencies in the original application. The application fee shall apply
separately to each new application. Applications which fully comply with the
terms and conditions of this chapter shall be duly issued. Applications which
are denied, or permits which are revoked or suspended, may be appealed in the
same manner as denials of sign permits, as described in this code.

12.60.030: SCOPE:
   A.   In General: There shall be a type of encroachment permit entitled a
"wireless encroachment permit," which shall be subject to all of the same
requirements as an encroachment permit would under
Chapter 12.16 in addition to all of the requirements of this chapter. Unless
exempted, every person who desires to place a wireless facility in the public
rights-of-way or modify an existing wireless facility in the public rights-of-
way must obtain a wireless encroachment permit authorizing the placement or
modification in accordance with this chapter. Except for small cell facilities,
facilities qualifying as eligible facilities requests, or any other type of
facility expressly allowed in the public rights-of-way by state or federal law,
no other wireless facilities shall be permitted pursuant to this chapter.
   B.   Exemptions: This chapter does not apply to:
      1)   The placement or modification of facilities by the City or by any
other agency of the state solely for public safety purposes.
      2)   Installation of a "cell on wheels," "cell on truck" or a similar
structure for a temporary period in connection with an emergency or event, but
no longer than required for the emergency or event, provided that installation
does not involve excavation, movement, or removal of existing facilities.
   C.   Other Applicable Requirements: In addition to the wireless encroachment
permit required herein, the placement of a wireless facility in the ROW
requires the persons who will own or control those facilities to obtain all
permits required by applicable law, and to comply with applicable law,
including, but not limited to, applicable law governing radio frequency (RF)
emissions.
   D.   Pre-existing Facilities In The ROW: Any wireless facility already
existing in the ROW as of the date of this chapter's adoption shall remain,
subject to the provisions of this Code in effect prior to the effective date of
this chapter, unless and until an extension of such facility's then-existing
permit is granted, at which time the provisions of this chapter shall apply in
full force going forward as to such facility. The review of any request for a
renewal of a permit for such pre-existing facilities shall be conducted
pursuant to this chapter, rather than the portions of this Code that it was
previously reviewed under.
   E.   Public Use: Except as otherwise provided by California law, any use of
the public right-of-way authorized pursuant to this chapter will be subordinate
to the City's use and use by the public.
   F.   Administration:
      1)   Director: The Director is responsible for administering this
chapter. As part of the administration of this chapter, the Director may:
         i.   Interpret the provisions of this chapter;
         ii.   Develop and implement standards governing the placement and
modification of wireless facilities consistent with the requirements of this
chapter, including regulations governing collocation and resolution of
conflicting applications for placement of wireless facilities;
         iii.   Implement acceptable designs and development standards for
wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way, taking into account the zoning
districts bounding the public rights-of-way;
         iv.   Develop forms and procedures for submission of applications for
placement or modification of wireless facilities, and proposed changes to any
support structure consistent with this chapter;
         v.   Collect, as a condition of the completeness of any application,
any fee established by this chapter;
         vi.   Establish deadlines for submission of information related to an
application, and extend or shorten deadlines where appropriate and consistent
with state and federal laws and regulations;
         vii.   Issue any notices of incompleteness, requests for information,
or conduct or commission such studies as may be required to determine whether a
permit should be issued;
         viii.   Require, as part of, and as a condition of completeness of any
application, mailing labels sufficient to notify the owners of all adjacent
properties of the placement or modification of the wireless facility and
proposed changes to any support structure by letter. "Adjacent properties"
shall include all lots which directly abut or are directly across any public or
private right-of-way from the subject location;
         ix.   Subject to appeal as provided herein, determine whether to
approve, approve subject to conditions, or deny an application; and
         x.   Take such other steps as may be required to timely act upon
applications for placement of wireless facilities, including issuing written
decisions and entering into agreements to mutually extend the time for action
on an application.
      2)   Appeal:
         i.   Any  person adversely affected by the decision of the Director
pursuant to this chapter may, upon completion of the City's form of appeal and
payment of the fee established by resolution of the City Council, appeal the
Director's decision to the City Manager, which may decide the issues de novo,
and whose written decision will be the final decision of the City. An appeal by
a wireless infrastructure provider must be taken jointly with the wireless
service provider that intends to use the personal wireless services facility.
         ii.   Where the Director grants an application based on a finding that
denial would result in a prohibition or effective prohibition under applicable
federal law, the decision shall be automatically appealed to the City Manager.
All appeals must be filed within five (5) business days of the written decision
of the Director, unless the Director extends the time therefor. An extension
may not be granted where extension would result in approval of the application
by operation of law.
         iii.   Any appeal shall be conducted so that a timely written decision
may be issued in accordance with applicable law.
   G.   General Standards For Wireless Facilities In The Public Rights-of-Way:
      1)   Generally: Wireless facilities in the ROW shall meet the minimum
requirements set forth in this chapter and the wireless regulations, in
addition to the requirements of any other applicable law.
      2)   Regulations: The wireless regulations and decisions on applications
for placement of wireless facilities in the ROW shall, at a minimum, ensure
that the requirements of this section are satisfied, unless it is determined
that applicant has established that denial of an application would, within the
meaning of federal law, prohibit or effectively prohibit the provision of
personal wireless services, or otherwise violate applicable laws or
regulations. If that determination is made, the requirements of this chapter
may be waived, but only to the minimum extent required to avoid the prohibition
or violation.
      3)   Minimum Standards: All applicants shall design and locate wireless
facilities in accordance with the design standards and wireless regulations set
forth separately by resolution adopted by the City Council.
   H.   Applications:
      1)   Submission: Unless the wireless regulations provide otherwise, an
applicant shall submit a paper copy and an electronic copy of any application,
amendments, or supplements to an application, or responses to requests for
information regarding an application to the Director.
      2)   Pre-application Meeting: Prior to filing an application for a
wireless encroachment permit, an applicant is encouraged to schedule a pre-
application meeting with the Director to discuss the proposed facility, the
requirements of this chapter, and any potential impacts of the proposed
facility.
      3)   Content: An applicant shall submit an application on the form
approved by the Director, which may be updated from time-to-time, but in any
event shall require the submission of all required fees, documents,
information, and any other materials necessary to allow the Director to make
required findings and ensure that the proposed facility will comply with
applicable federal and state law, this Code, and will not endanger the public
health, safety, or welfare. If no form has been approved, applications must
contain all information necessary to show that applicant is entitled to the
wireless encroachment permit requested, and must specify whether the applicant
believes state or federal law requires action on the application within a
specified time period.
      4)   Fees: Application fees shall be required to be submitted with any
application for a wireless encroachment permit. The City Council is hereby
authorized to determine, or cause to be determined, the amount, type, and other
terms of such fees from time to time by means of resolution. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no application fee shall be refundable, in whole or in part, to
an applicant for a wireless encroachment permit unless paid as a refundable
deposit.
      5)   Waivers: Requests for waivers from any requirement of this section
shall be made in writing to the Director or his or her designee. The Director
may grant or deny a request for a waiver pursuant to this subsection. The
Director may grant a request for waiver if it is demonstrated that,
notwithstanding the issuance of a waiver, the City will be provided all
information necessary to understand the nature of the construction or other
activity to be conducted pursuant to the permit sought. All waivers approved
pursuant to this subsection shall be (1) granted only on a case-by-case basis,

additional insureds. The permittee shall use its best efforts to provide thirty
(30) days' prior notice to the City of the cancellation or material
modification of any applicable insurance policy.
         x.   Indemnities: The permittee and, if applicable, the owner of the
property upon which the wireless facility is installed shall defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the City, its agents, officers, officials, and employees (i)
from any and all damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs, and expenses,
and from any and all claims, demands, law suits, writs of mandamus, and other
actions or proceedings brought against the city or its agents, officers,
officials, or employees to challenge, attack, seek to modify, set aside, void
or annul the city's approval of the permit, and (ii) from any and all damages,
liabilities, injuries, losses, costs, and expenses, and any and all claims,

kind or form, whether for personal injury, death or property damage, arising
out of or in connection with the activities or performance of the permittee or,
if applicable, the property owner or any of each one's agents, employees,
licensees, contractors, subcontractors, or independent contractors. In the
event the city becomes aware of any such actions or claims the city shall
promptly notify the permittee and, if applicable, the property owner and shall

terminated. The security shall be in the amount equal to one hundred percent
(100%) of the cost of physically removing the facility and all related
facilities and equipment on the site, based on the higher of two (2)
contractor's quotes for removal that are provided by the permittee. The
permittee shall reimburse the City for staff time associated with the
processing and tracking of the bond, based on the hourly rate adopted by the
City Council. Reimbursement shall be paid when the security is posted and
during each administrative review.
         xii.   Adverse Impacts On Adjacent Properties: The permittee shall
undertake all reasonable efforts to avoid undue adverse impacts to adjacent
properties and/or uses that may arise from the construction, operation,
maintenance, modification, and removal of the facility.
         xiii.   Noninterference: The permittee shall not move, alter,
temporarily relocate, change, or interfere with any existing structure,
improvement, or property without the prior consent of the owner of that
structure, improvement, or property. No structure, improvement, or property
owned by the City shall be moved to accommodate a permitted activity or
encroachment, unless the City determines that such movement will not adversely
affect the City or any surrounding businesses or residents, and the permittee
pays all costs and expenses related to the relocation of the City's structure,
improvement, or property. Prior to commencement of any work pursuant to a
wireless encroachment permit, the permittee shall provide the City with
documentation establishing to the city's satisfaction that the permittee has
the legal right to use or interfere with any other structure, improvement, or
property within the public right-of-way or city utility easement to be affected
by the permittee's facilities.
         xiv.   No Right, Title, Or Interest: The permission granted by a
wireless encroachment permit shall not in any event constitute an easement on

shall vest or accrue in the Permittee by reason of a wireless encroachment
permit or the issuance of any other permit or exercise of any privilege given
thereby.
         xv.   No Possessory Interest: No possessory interest is created by a
wireless encroachment permit. However, to the extent that a possessory interest
is deemed created by a governmental entity with taxation authority, the
permittee acknowledges that the City has given to permittee notice pursuant to
California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 107.6 that the use or occupancy of
any public property pursuant to a wireless encroachment permit may create a
possessory interest which may be subject to the payment of property taxes
levied upon such interest. Permittee shall be solely liable for, and shall pay
and discharge prior to delinquency, any and all possessory interact taxes or
other taxes, fees, and assessments levied against the permittee's right to
possession, occupancy, or use of any public property pursuant to any right of
possession, occupancy, or use created by this permit.
         xvi.   General Maintenance: The site and the facility, including, but
not limited to, all screening, camouflaging or paint materials, landscaping,
fencing, and related transmission equipment, must be maintained in a neat and
clean manner and in accordance with all approved plans. All graffiti on
facilities must be removed at the sole expense of the permittee within forty
eight (48) hours after notification from the City.
         xvii.   RF Exposure Compliance: All facilities must comply with all
standards and regulations of the FCC and any other state or federal government
agency with the authority to regulate RF exposure standards. After transmitter
and antenna system optimization, but prior to unattended operations of the
facility, permittee or its representative must conduct on-site post-
installation RF emissions testing to demonstrate actual compliance with the FCC
OET Bulletin 65 RF emissions safety rules for general population/uncontrolled
RF exposure in all sectors. For this testing, the transmitter shall be
operating at maximum operating power, and the testing shall occur outwards to a
distance where the RF emissions no longer exceed the uncontrolled/general
population limit. The permittee shall submit documentation of this testing
within ninety (90) days after installation of the facility.
         xviii.   Testing: Testing of any equipment shall take place on
weekdays only, and only between the hours of 8:30 A.M. and 4:30 P.M., except
that testing is prohibited on holidays that fall on a weekday. In addition,
testing is prohibited on weekend days.
         xix.   Modifications: No changes shall be made to the approved plans
without review and approval in accordance with this chapter.
         xx.   Agreement With City: If not already completed, the permittee
shall enter into the appropriate agreement with the City, as determined by the
City, prior to constructing, attaching, or operating a facility on municipal
infrastructure. This permit is not a substitute for such agreement.
         xxi.   Conflicts With Improvements: For all facilities located within
the ROW, the permittee shall remove or relocate, at its expense and without
expense to the City, any or all of its facilities when such removal or
relocation is deemed necessary by the city by reason of any change of grade,
alignment, or width of any right-of-way, for installation of services, water
pipes, drains, storm drains, power or signal lines, traffic control devices,
right-of-way improvements, or for any other construction, repair, or
improvement to the right-of-way.
         xxii.   Abandonment: If a facility is not operated for a continuous
period of six (6) months, the wireless encroachment permit and any other permit
or approval therefor shall be deemed abandoned and terminated automatically,
unless before the end of the six (6) month period (i) the Director has
determined that the facility has resumed operations, or (ii) the City has
received an application to transfer the permit to another service provider. No
later than ninety (90) days from the date the facility is determined to have
ceased operation or the permittee has notified the Director of its intent to
vacate the site, the permittee shall remove all equipment and improvements
associated with the use and shall restore the site to its original condition to
the satisfaction of the Director. The permittee shall provide written
verification of the removal of the facilities within thirty (30) days of the
date the removal is completed. If the facility is not removed within thirty
(30) days after the permit has been discontinued pursuant to this subsection,
the site shall be deemed to be a nuisance, and the City may cause the facility
to be removed at permittee's expense or by calling any bond or other financial
assurance to pay for removal. If there are two (2) or more users of a single
facility or support structure, then this provision shall apply to the specific
elements or parts thereof that were abandoned, but will not be effective for
the entirety thereof until all users cease use thereof.
         xxiii.   Encourage Co-location: Where the facility site is capable of
accommodating a co-located facility upon the same site in a manner consistent
with the permit conditions for the existing facility, the owner and operator of
the existing facility shall allow co-location of third party facilities,
provided the parties can mutually agree upon reasonable terms and conditions.
         xxiv.   Records: The permittee must maintain complete and accurate
copies of all permits and other regulatory approvals issued in connection with
the facility, which includes without limitation this approval, the approved
plans and photo simulations incorporated into this approval, all conditions
associated with this approval and any ministerial permits or approvals issued
in connection with this approval. In the event that the permittee does not
maintain such records as required in this condition or fails to produce true
and complete copies of such records within a reasonable time after a written
request from the City, any ambiguities or uncertainties that would be resolved
through an inspection of the missing records will be construed against the
permittee.
         xxv.   Attorneys' Fees: In the event the City determines that it is
necessary to take legal action to enforce any of these conditions, or to revoke
a permit, and such legal action is taken, the permittee shall be required to
pay any and all costs of such legal action, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, incurred by the City, even if the matter is not prosecuted to a final
judgment or is amicably resolved, unless the City should otherwise agree with
permittee to waive said fees or any part thereof. The foregoing shall not apply
if the permittee prevails in the enforcement proceeding.
      2)   Eligible Facilities Requests: In addition to the conditions provided
in Section 9(a) of this chapter and any supplemental conditions imposed by the
Director or the City Manager, as the case may be, all permits for an eligible
facility requests granted pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to the
following additional conditions, unless modified by the approving authority:
         i.   Permit Subject To Conditions Of Underlying Permit: Any permit
granted in response to an application qualifying as an eligible facilities
request shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the underlying permit.
         ii.   No Permit Term Extension: The City's grant or grant by operation
of law of an eligible facilities request permit constitutes a federally-
mandated modification to the underlying permit or approval for the subject
tower or base station. Notwithstanding any permit duration established in
another permit condition, the city's grant or grant by operation of law of an
eligible facilities request permit will not extend the permit term for the
underlying permit or any other underlying regulatory approval, and its term
shall be coterminous with the underlying permit or other regulatory approval
for the subject tower or base station.
         iii.   No Waiver Of Standing: The city's grant or grant by operation
of law of an eligible facilities request does not waive, and shall not be
construed to waive, any standing by the city to challenge Section 6409(a) of
the Spectrum Act, any FCC rules that interpret Section 6409(a) of the Spectrum
Act, or any modification to Section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act.
      3)   Small Cell Facilities Requests: In addition to the conditions
provided in Section 9(a) of this chapter and any supplemental conditions
imposed by the Director or the City Manager, as the case may be, all permits
for a small cell facility granted pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to
the following condition, unless modified by the approving authority:
         i.   No Waiver Of Standing: The city's grant of a permit for a small
cell facility request does not waive, and shall not be construed to waive, any
standing by the city to challenge any FCC orders or rules related to small cell
facilities, or any modification to those FCC orders or rules.
   K.    Breach; Termination Of Permit:
      1)    For Breach: A wireless encroachment permit may be revoked for
failure to comply with the conditions of the permit or applicable law. Upon
revocation, the wireless facility must be removed; provided that removal of a
support structure owned by City, a utility, or another entity authorized to
maintain a support structure in the right-of-way need not be removed, but must
be restored to its prior condition, except as specifically permitted by the
City. All costs incurred by the City in connection with the revocation and
removal shall be paid by entities who own or control any part of the wireless
facility.
      2)   For Installation Without A Permit: Any wireless facility installed
without a wireless encroachment permit (except for those exempted by this

City, a utility, or another entity authorized to maintain a support structure
in the right-of-way need not be removed, but must be restored to its prior
condition, except as specifically permitted by the City. All costs incurred by
the City in connection with the revocation and removal shall be paid by
entities who own or control any part of the wireless facility.
      3)   Violation: Any violation of this chapter will be subject to the same
penalties as a violation of
Chapter 1.20 of this Code.
   L.   Infrastructure Controlled By City: The City, as a matter of policy,
will negotiate agreements for use of municipal infrastructure. The placement of
wireless facilities on those structures shall be subject to the agreement. The
agreement shall specify the compensation to the City for use of the structures.
The person seeking the agreement shall additionally reimburse the City for all
costs the City incurs in connection with its review of, and action upon the
person's request for, an agreement.
   M.   Nondiscrimination: In establishing the rights, obligations and
conditions set forth in this chapter, it is the intent of the City to treat
each applicant or public right-of-way user in a competitively neutral and
nondiscriminatory manner, to the extent required by law, and with
considerations that may be unique to the technologies, situation and legal
status of each particular applicant or request for use of the public rights-of-
way. (Ord. 2894 §2, 2019)

This chapter establishes the CITY OF REDLANDS WATER CONSERVATION PLAN. (Ord.
2151 § 1, 1991)
13.06.020: INTENT:
The city council of the city of Redlands declares that the public health,
safety and general welfare requires that water resources available to the city
be put to maximum beneficial use, that the waste or unreasonable use of water
be prevented, and that the conservation of such water must occur to protect the
people and property of the city of Redlands. (Ord. 2151 § 1, 1991)
13.06.030: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to reduce the nonessential use of water
to conserve city water supplies, thereby minimizing the effect of a shortage of
water supplies on city users. The water conservation plan here established is
to:
      1.   Protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and property
owners of the city;
      2.   Assure the maximum beneficial use of city water supplies; and
      3.   Attempt to provide sufficient water supplies to meet the basic needs
of human consumption, sanitation and fire protection.
   B.   This chapter shall remain in effect until the city council declares by
ordinance that the provisions of this chapter are no longer applicable to
existing water supply conditions and the supply of water available for
distribution within the city's service area has been replenished or augmented.
(Ord. 2151 § 1, 1991)
13.06.040: AUTHORIZATION:
   A.   The city is authorized to implement the provisions of this chapter
following a public hearing as specified below upon the city council's
determination by majority vote of the entire council that such implementation
is necessary to protect the public health and safety.
   B.   A public hearing shall be held to determine whether to adopt a water
conservation plan, and, if so, which measures provided herein should be
implemented. A similar public hearing shall be held by the city council prior
to the implementation or termination of each incremental water conservation
stage pursuant to section
13.06.080 of this chapter. Notice of the time and place of these public
hearings shall be published not less than ten (10) days before the hearing in a
newspaper of general circulation.
   C.   Upon adoption by the city council, the provisions of this chapter shall
become effective immediately. Notice of the implementation of successive stages
of water conservation shall be given to water users immediately both by
publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation within ten (10)
days after adoption, and by a notice enclosed with the next regular city
invoice for water or utility service.
   D.   If the city council cannot meet in time to act to protect the public
interest pursuant to this chapter, the city manager or his designee is hereby
authorized and directed to implement such provisions of this chapter upon his
or her written determination that the city cannot supply adequate water to meet
the ordinary demands of water consumers, and that such implementation is
necessary to protect the public health or safety. Such written determination
shall be presented to the city council at its next meeting for review,
revocation or ratification. Such meeting shall be held as soon as possible.
(Ord. 2151 § 1, 1991)
13.06.050: APPLICATION:
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all persons, customers, and
property served water by the city wherever situated. (Ord. 2151 § 1, 1991)
13.06.060: GENERAL PROHIBITION:
No water user shall make, cause, use, or permit the use of water supplied by
the city for residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, governmental or
any other use in a manner contrary to this chapter. Waste or the unreasonable
or nonbeneficial use of water is prohibited in the city of Redlands. (Ord. 2151
§ 1, 1991)
13.06.070: MANDATORY CONSERVATION; STAGE CRITERIA:
The director of the public works department shall recommend guidelines for
adoption by the city council setting forth the criteria to determine when water
supply conditions in the city require the implementation or termination of each
water conservation stage. Such guidelines shall be updated when the director
determines that water availability so requires. The director shall include in
such guidelines a calendar symbol system designating allowed days for
irrigation. (Ord. 2151 § 1, 1991)
13.06.080: MANDATORY CONSERVATION; PHASE IMPLEMENTATION:
The public works department shall monitor the projected supply and demand for
water by its customers on a daily basis during the months of June, July,
August, September, and October and shall recommend to the city manager the
extent of conservation required through the implementation and/or termination
of particular conservation stages to allow the department to prudently plan for
and supply water to its customers. Thereafter, the city manager may recommend
to the city council the implementation or termination of the appropriate stage
of water conservation in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
chapter. The city council may implement or terminate the appropriate stage
pursuant to section
13.06.040 of this chapter. Notice of the implementation or termination of each
stage shall be given pursuant to subsection
13.06.040C of this chapter.
   A.   Stage I, Voluntary Conservation Measures: Water users are requested to
limit their water use from June 1 to October 1 of each year to an amount

(Ord. 2151 § 1, 1991)
13.06.090: RELIEF FROM COMPLIANCE:
A city water user may file a request for relief from any provision of this
chapter. The city manager shall review all requests and hold a hearing with
each applicant. The city manager may grant relief from the provisions of this
chapter if he determines that special circumstances make compliance not
reasonably possible, or that the restrictions herein would either:
   A.   Cause an unnecessary and undue hardship to the water user or the
public; or
   B.   Cause an emergency condition affecting the health, sanitation, fire
protection or safety of the water user or of the public.
Such relief may be granted only upon written request to the city. Upon granting
such relief, the city manager may impose any conditions he determines to be
just and proper. The city manager shall make his determination within fourteen
(14) days of receipt of the request for relief and shall inform the applicant
of the decision in writing.
An applicant shall have the right to appeal the city manager's decision
regarding his or her application to the city council or its designee. The
appeal must be in writing and received by the city within ten (10) days of the
date of the city manager's written decision. The appeal shall be heard by the
city council or its designee within a reasonable period of time from the date
the appeal is filed. The city shall provide written notice to the applicant of
the time and date of the hearing. The city council or its designee, at its
discretion, may affirm, reverse or modify the city manager's decision and
impose any conditions it deems proper. The decision of the city council shall
be final. (Ord. 2151 § 1, 1991)
13.06.100: FAILURE TO COMPLY:
Violation by any customer of the water use prohibitions of this chapter shall
be penalized as follows:
   A.   First Violation; Notice Of Noncompliance: The city manager is
authorized and directed to issue a written notice of noncompliance to any water
user who, in the reasonable judgment of the city manager, has failed or refused
in a significant way to comply with those water use curtailment provisions of
this chapter currently in effect. Any such notice of violation shall specify
the time, place and manner of noncompliance, and shall specify a reasonable
period to achieve compliance. Any notice of noncompliance shall be directed to
the customer of record for the premises where the noncompliance was observed.
Delivery may be through regular mail or by personal delivery with a declaration
of delivery returned to the city manager.
   B.   Second Violation; Warning Of Penalties: For a second violation by any
customer of the water use curtailment provisions of this chapter currently in
effect, a written warning notice of the future imposition of penalties on the
customer's water bill shall be issued. Any such warning notice shall specify
the time, place and manner of noncompliance and shall require compliance within
two (2) days. Any warning notice shall be directed to the customer of record
for the premises where the violation has occurred. Delivery will be made by
personal delivery with a declaration of delivery returned to the city manager.
   C.   Third Violation; Imposition Of Penalties:
      1.   For a third violation by any customer of this chapter, a citation
shall be issued and a surcharge imposed on the customer's next regular water
bill. The surcharge shall consist of a percentage of the customer's commodity
charge as shown on the most recent water bill, based upon the water
conservation stage then in effect at the time of the most recent violation. The
penalty surcharge for each stage is shown below:
 
Stage II  25 percent
Stage III 50 percent
Stage IV  75 percent
 
As an example, if a water user's most recent commodity charge is twenty five
dollars ($25.00), a third violation while the city is in stage III would result
in the imposition of a twelve dollar fifty cent ($12.50) surcharge.
      2.   If a water customer cited for a third violation fails or refuses to
comply with the requirements of this chapter or to pay any outstanding water
bills including surcharges, the city manager is hereby granted discretionary
authority pursuant to California Water Code section 375 to cause a flow
restricting device to be installed at the meter to reduce water availability to
the customer's service address. Pursuant to California Water Code section
35423, if installation of a flow restrictor is infeasible, impractical or is
unlikely to induce compliance with this chapter, the city manager may authorize
a shutoff of service to the premises involved. (Ord. 2151 § 1, 1991)
13.06.110: HEARING REGARDING VIOLATIONS:
   A.   Any customer receiving notice of a second or subsequent violation
pursuant to section
13.06.100 of this chapter shall have a right to a hearing by the city manager
within fifteen (15) days of mailing or other delivery of the notice of
violation.
   B.   The customer's written request for a hearing within the fifteen (15)
day period shall automatically stay the imposition of monetary penalties on the
customer's water bill until the city manager renders his decision. The decision
of the city manager shall be final and not subject to further appeal pursuant
to this code. (Ord. 2751, 2011)
13.06.120: CITY MANAGER DELEGATION:
The city manager may delegate all duties and responsibilities hereunder. (Ord.
2151 § 1, 1991)
13.06.130: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
chapter, or the application of same to any person or set of circumstances is
held to be unconstitutional, void, or invalid, such decision shall not affect
the remaining portions of this chapter which shall remain in full force and
effect, and all provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable for
that purpose. (Ord. 2151 § 1, 1991)
13.06.140: INCOMPATIBLE PROVISIONS:
To the extent any provision of this chapter is incompatible with or at variance
with any prior adopted ordinance or resolution, the provisions of this chapter
shall take precedence, and all prior ordinances and resolutions shall be
interpreted to harmonize with and not change the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2151 § 1, 1991)
13.06.150: PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY NOT TO BE AFFECTED:
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require the city to curtail the
supply of water to any customer when such water is required by that customer to
maintain an adequate level of public health or public safety. (Ord. 2151 § 1,
1991)
13.06.160: EXEMPTION FROM CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT:
The city council determines that the adoption of this chapter and
implementation of the measures set forth herein are exempt from review under
the California environmental quality act 1  because it is an action taken to
mitigate or prevent a water shortage emergency, and to protect natural
resources. The city council directs the city manager or his designee to prepare
and file a notice of exemption as soon as possible following adoption of the
ordinance codified in this chapter. (Ord. 2151 § 1, 1991)

shut off at the curb cock on the inlet side of the meter. The jurisdiction and
responsibility of the division shall end at the meter and the division will in
no case be liable for damages beyond the meter. (Prior code § 59109)
13.08.060: PRESSURE MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY REPAIR SHUTDOWNS:
The division shall not accept any responsibility for the maintenance of
pressure and it reserves the right to discontinue service while making
emergency repairs or for other cause, which in the discretion of the division
necessitates such discontinuance. Consumers dependent upon continuous water
supply should provide their own emergency storage of water. (Prior code §
59110)
13.08.070: SEPARATE SERVICE REQUIRED FOR EACH CONNECTION:
   A.   Each parcel of land under separate ownership must be provided with a
separate service, and any violation thereof will be sufficient cause for the
board to remove the service until the said violation is corrected and a fee of
five dollars ($5.00) paid for reconnecting the service. Two (2) or more
dwelling units under one ownership and on the same lot or parcel of land may be
supplied through the same service; provided, however, that the board shall
reserve the right to limit the number of dwelling units or the area of land
under one ownership to be supplied by one service.
   B.   Not more than one service for domestic, commercial, irrigation or
industrial supply shall be installed or used for one business or parcel of
land, except under special conditions, and by consent of the board.
   C.   When property provided with a service is subdivided, each service shall
be considered as belonging to the lot or parcel of land upon which it fronts.
(Prior code § 59111)
13.08.080: FIRE AND PROTECTIVE SERVICE CONNECTION:
   A.   This service shall be used only for water consumed in the extinguishing
of fires. Upon the completion of the installation, the valve governing the same
will be closed and sealed and shall remain so until a written order is received
from the owner of the premises to have the water turned on. The board shall not
be held liable for damages of any kind whatsoever that may occur to the
premises served by reason of the installation, maintenance, use, fluctuation of
pressure, or interruption of supply.
   B.   If water is used through a fire connection for any other purpose than
the extinguishing of fires, the board shall have the right to place a meter on
the fire connection at the owner's expense or to shut off the entire water
supply from such premises. Upon the installation of such meter, the water rates
as adopted by resolution under provisions of
chapter 13.12 of this title shall apply.
   C.   The board shall have the right to take a domestic, commercial or
industrial service from the fire connection at the curb to supply the same
premises as those to which the fire service connection belongs. The board shall
also have the right to determine the proportion of the installation costs
properly chargeable to each connection, if such segregation of costs shall
become necessary.
   D.   The board reserves the right to install on all fire connections a check
valve of a type approved by the National Board of Fire Underwriters and to
equip the same with a bypass meter; such installations shall be at the expense
of the owner of the property and the regular domestic water rates as set forth
by resolution hereof shall apply for all water used through such service except
for fire protection purposes only. (Prior code § 59112)
13.08.090: APPLICATION FOR SERVICE:
   A.   Upon application for water service, each applicant shall be required to
sign an application for service, wherein the city is released from all
liability by applicant that may be caused by water escaping or flowing from any
water pipe, hose, water conduit, faucet, hydrant, valve, or other connections
or appliance at any point within said premises, and wherein applicant also
guarantees payment of all sums to become due for water service furnished in
pursuance of the said application until notification to the water division to
discontinue or transfer such service.
   B.   If upon application for water service, a service connection is found to
have produced no revenue in the twenty (20) years immediately prior to date of
application and the service has been physically disconnected from the main,
such connection will be considered abandoned and all requirements under this
chapter through chapter 13.32 of this title shall be in effect in establishing
a new service connection. (Prior code § 59118)

13.12.010: FRONTAGE CHARGES:
   A.   The water main frontage charge is established to implement the Redlands
general plan and to finance the construction of local water distribution mains
and main extensions, by providing for more equitable sharing of costs of those
mains. Included are eight inch (8") minimum size water mains or twelve inch
(12") minimum size water mains if required for fire flow, required within the
development and/or along the frontage of the development and water main
extensions from the development to a point where the new mains can tie into two

The frontage charge shall be equal to the frontage charge per foot, as
specified by subsection D of this section, multiplied by the total length of
all property lines contiguous to street right of way or easement wherein there
are water mains accessible to the property.
   B.   A percentage of the frontage charge collected, set by section
13.24.050 of this title, shall be refunded to the person, or persons,
corporation or agency originally paying for said water main to which the
connection has been made. See section
13.24.050 of this title for rules governing application for refunds.
   C.   Twenty five percent (25%) of the sum collected as frontage charges
shall be credited to the water fund balance. Seventy five percent (75%) of the
sum collected in frontage charges in accordance with this section shall be
credited to the reserve for frontage charge reimbursement which shall be

10, 1989: Ord. 1944 § 1, 1986: prior code § 59103)
13.12.020: DUE DATE:
   A.   The city may use a unified billing system for city provided services.
The charges for water, wastewater, and refuse service, or any other city
provided services, may be billed on one bill and collected as one item. Failure
to pay the amount due in full for any of the services may result in the
discontinuation of water services.
   B.   All bills and charges for service shall be due and payable upon
presentation and shall become delinquent twenty six (26) days thereafter. If
the bill is not paid on, or prior to, said due date, the billing shall be
considered delinquent and a late charge shall be levied upon the unpaid balance
as follows:
      1.   For any account with an unpaid balance, a onetime charge of ten
percent (10%) of the unpaid balance per service shall be assessed.
      2.   This charge shall be due and payable immediately upon accrual.
      3.   Upon request from the customer, one (1) late charge may be waived by
city staff once every twelve (12) months.
      4.   In lieu of imposing a late charge upon a customer's delinquent water
service billings, the City may offer to any customer of the city's water
service who has a delinquent water service billing the option to participate in
the city's automatic payment plan rather than be responsible for the payment of
late charges pursuant to subsection 1, above. Such participation, if agreed to
by the water service customer, shall be for a period of one (1) year. In the
event the customer terminates his or her participation in the automatic payment
plan during such one (1) year period, the customer shall immediately become
liable for the late charges and penalties that would otherwise have been
imposed on the customer's delinquent water service account.
   C.   Service may be discontinued upon written notice required by law if
payment of all charges is not made prior to the date such service becomes
delinquent, to the extent authorized by law.
   D.   If any owner or agent pays for water service on more than one property
or unit, service may be discontinued on all properties for failure to pay on
any one property. Procedures and charges for restoration of service are set
forth by resolution and section
13.12.050 of this chapter.
   E.   Failure to receive a bill shall not relieve the customer of liability.
Any amount due shall be deemed a debt to the city, and any person, firm or
corporation failing, neglecting, or refusing to pay said indebtedness shall be
liable in a civil action brought by the city in any court of competent
jurisdiction for the amount thereof.
   F.   In addition to any other remedies it may have for the collection of
delinquent accounts, the city may cause notice of a hearing on delinquent
accounts in accordance with Government Code sections 25831 and 38790.1. Such
notice shall be mailed to property owners listed as delinquent accounts not
less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing. At the hearing, the
city council shall hear any objections or protests of such property owners. The
city council may make such revisions, corrections or deletions to the report of
delinquent accounts as it deems just, after which, by resolution, the report
shall be confirmed. The delinquent charges set forth in the delinquent account
report may be placed as a lien on such properties for the amount of such
delinquent charges plus legal fees and administration costs. A certified copy
of the confirmed report shall be filed with the city clerk for the current tax
roll. The lien created attaches upon recordation, in the office of the county
recorder, of a certified copy of the resolution of confirmation. All laws
applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of city ad valorem property
taxes shall be applicable to such liens. (Ord. 2944 § 1, 2022: Ord. 2903 § 2,
2019: Ord. 2800, 2013)
13.12.025: ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PLAN:
   A.   The City shall offer an alternative payment plan to a water service
customer under certain circumstances and under terms and conditions set by
resolution of the city council. A customer shall be eligible for an alternative
payment plan if all three (3) of the following circumstances are satisfied:
      1.   The customer is willing to enter into an alternative payment
schedule with respect to all delinquent charges.
      2.   The customer is not currently in default on any other pre-existing
alternative payment plan under this section.
      3.   The customer has not been in default on their municipal services
account for longer than sixty (60) days.
   B.   The customer must comply with the payment plan and remain current as
charges accrue in each subsequent billing period. The customer may not request
further payment plans for any subsequent unpaid charges while paying delinquent
charges pursuant to a payment plan. Where the customer fails to comply with the
terms of the payment plan for sixty (60) days or more, meaning that the full
agreed upon payment is not made toward the unpaid delinquent balance on his or
her account, the City may discontinue water service per Section 13.12.020C to
the extent authorized by law. (Ord. 2975 § 1, 2025: Ord. 2903 § 3, 2019)
13.12.030: GUARANTEE OF FUTURE PAYMENT:
The water charge shall begin when a service is installed and the meter is set.
Before the water shall be turned on by the division for any purposes
whatsoever, the property owner or his authorized agent shall first sign a form
in which he guarantees the payment of future water bills for the services
required. The property owner or his authorized agent will be held liable for
water used until the division is notified in writing to discontinue the
service. (Prior code § 59106)
13.12.040: WATER USE WITHOUT MAKING REGULAR APPLICATION:
A person, firm or corporation taking possession of premises and using water
from an active service connection without having made application to the
division for water service, shall be held liable for the water delivered from
the date of the last recorded meter reading, and if the meter is found
inoperative, the quantity consumed will be estimated. If proper application for
water service is not made upon notification to do so by the division, and if
accumulated bills for service are not paid immediately, the service may be
discontinued by the division without further notice. (Prior code § 59107)
13.12.050: TURNING ON AND OFF OF WATER SUPPLY:
   A.   A charge to establish a new account will be collected by the city. The
amount shall be established by resolution.
   B.   Upon request, the city will shut off the water supply without charge
for emergency purposes, and it is understood that the city will turn on the
water supply after repairs have been made.
   C.   If the service must be discontinued for nonpayment of bill(s), a charge
as set by resolution will be made by the city which must be paid in full prior
to restoration of service, including the minimum amount of prepayment as set by
this chapter in the event any previous prepayments have already been applied.
   D.   Any person requesting water service for a premises for which a notice
of violation of the California Health And Safety Code or a notice of
substandard building has been issued must provide evidence of a current legal
right to occupy the premises and clearance by either the development services
director or the quality of life director before the restoration of service.
   E.   If a city representative is prevented from discontinuing service, or if
service is turned back on by anyone other than an authorized representative,
the city may take any further steps it deems necessary to effect the
disconnection and prior to the restoration of service, all delinquent charges
and applicable miscellaneous charges must be paid in full before service will
be restored as set by resolution, including the minimum amount of prepayment as
set by this chapter in the event any previous prepayments have already been
applied. (Ord. 2834, 2016)
13.12.060: REFUNDS AND ADJUSTMENTS:
This section shall apply to sewer and water billings. If a customer is entitled
to a refund for any reason, such as overpayment of a closing bill or other just
cause, a demand shall be made by the customer for a refund of such overpayment,
and subject to verification by the city, a city warrant shall be issued to the
customer in the amount of the overcharge. In the event the overpayment was made
on a bill which is not a closing bill, the amount overpaid shall be credited to
the customer's account.
   A.   Undercharge: In the case of a discovered sewer or water undercharge,
when the undercharge is the result of a city error or omission, there shall be
no back charge adjustment for services with meters smaller than or equal to one
inch (1") in size. Proper billing shall begin with the first cycle billing
after the discovered error and the customer shall be notified in writing of the
charge and the reason for the charge. For services with meters which are
greater than one inch (1") in size, discovered sewer or water undercharges
shall be referred to the director of public works for determination of back
charges due.
   B.   Overcharge: In the case of a detected overcharge, the overcharge shall
be adjusted back for a period of up to four (4) years. The customer shall be
notified of the charge and the reason for the charge. No interest will be paid
on the adjustment.
(Ord. 2903 § 4, 2019: Ord. 1948 § 1, 1986: prior code § 59119)
13.12.070: DISPUTED BILLS:
   A.   In the event of a complaint by a customer that his or her water bill is
excessive, a reread shall be made on the meter and a check shall be made to
determine in particular if there are leaks in the meter. Should no leak in the
meter be found, then, upon request of the customer, the meter shall be removed
and be subject to a test upon it as set forth in detail in section
13.16.030 of this title. In the event the meter tests within the approved
limitations, and the customer continues to question the water bill, a personal
investigation of said premises served by the meter shall be made by the water
superintendent or his appointed representative. Should such investigation find
no reason to adjust said bill, the customer may make application (including
payment of the application fee established by resolution of the city council)
to the board for a final and binding, non-appealable ruling.
   B.   In the event a customer disputes his or her water bill for any other
reason than such bill being excessive for disputed usage, the customer may make
application (including payment of the application fee established by resolution
of the city council) to the board for a final and binding, non-appealable
ruling.
(Ord. 2903 § 5, 2019: prior code § 59120)
13.12.080: PREPAYMENT:
   A.   Prepayment Deposit Required: The city shall require a prepayment from
all customers for municipal utility service who have not established credit
with the city by having a satisfactory payment record for a one (1) year
period. A "satisfactory payment record" means that all payments have been made
in full to the city on or before the original due date. The prepayment amount
required shall be three (3) times the cost of the estimated monthly service to
the customer, or seventy dollars ($70.00), whichever is greater. The prepayment
amount shall be applied as a credit to the customer's account at the end of one
(1) year, provided the customer has maintained a payment record for water
service satisfactory to the city. If the customer's payment record is not
satisfactory at the end of the one (1) year period, the prepayment shall be
held for a second year, or as long as necessary, to establish a satisfactory
twelve (12) month payment record. Any prepayment amount being held will be
applied against the customer's closing bill if the customer orders the service
discontinued, and any credit balance refunded to the customer. If requested by
the customer, the prepayment may be made in two (2) equal payments, one at the
establishment of service, and the second within thirty (30) days of the
establishment of service.
   B.   Deposit Waiver: The requirement for establishing and maintaining credit
may not be waived or reduced except upon a finding of good credit by the
municipal utilities and engineering director and the management services/
finance director. In such cases where the prepayment deposit waiver is granted,
the customer must authorize auto deduction of bill amounts on a monthly basis
from a bank account.
   C.   Findings of good credit may be established by the new customer if he or
she presents a valid letter of reference from another utility for services
received in the previous twenty four (24) months demonstrating no
disconnections for non-payment, no late payments and no outstanding balances
during the last twelve (12) consecutive billing cycles.

13.20.070: Discontinuance Of Service
13.20.080: Right Of Entry
13.20.010: CROSS CONNECTION UNLAWFUL; EXCEPTION:
No person, firm or corporation shall install or maintain any physical
connection between any private source of water supply and the city water
supply; provided, however, that subject to the approval of the board of health
of the state, the city may maintain emergency connections with other public
utilities serving water. (Prior code § 59123)
13.20.020: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   The purpose of these regulations is:
      1.   To protect the public water supply against actual or potential cross
connections by isolating within the premises contamination or pollution that
may occur because of some undiscovered or unauthorized cross connection on the
premises;
      2.   To eliminate existing connections between drinking water systems and
other sources of water that are not approved as safe and potable for human
consumption;
      3.   To eliminate cross connections between drinking water systems and
other sources of water or process water used for any purpose whatsoever which
jeopardize the safety of the drinking water supply;
      4.   To prevent the making of cross connections in the future.
   B.   These regulations are in accordance with the state of California
department of public health Administrative Code, title 17 entitled "Regulations
Relating To Cross Connections".
   C.   It is the intent of these regulations to recognize that there are
varying degrees of hazard and to apply the principle that the degree of
protection should be commensurate with the degree of hazard. (Prior code §
59125)
13.20.030: DEFINITIONS:
As used in this chapter:
   AIR GAP SEPARATION: A physical break between a supply pipe and a receiving
vessel. The air gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe,
measured vertically above the top rim of the vessel, in no case less than one
inch (1").
   APPROVED CHECK VALVE: A check valve that seats readily and completely and
has been previously approved for use in this service by the city. It must be
carefully machined to have free moving parts and assured watertightness. The
face of the closure element and valve seat must be bronze, composition, or
other noncorrodible material which will seat tightly under all prevailing
conditions of field use. Pins and bushings shall be of bronze or other
noncorrodible, nonsticking material, machined for easy, dependable operation.
The closure element (e.g., clapper) shall be internally weighted or otherwise
internally equipped to promote rapid and positive closure in all sizes where
this feature is obtainable.
   APPROVED DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY: An assembly which has previously been
approved for use in this service by the city and consists of at least two (2)
independently acting approved check valves including tightly closing shutoff
valves on each side of the check valve assembly and suitable leak detector
drains plus connections available for testing the watertightness of each check
valve.
   APPROVED REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE: A device
which has previously been approved for use in this service by the city and
consists of incorporating two (2) or more check valves and an automatically
operating differential relief valve located between the two (2) checks, two (2)
shutoff valves, and equipped with necessary appurtenances for testing. The
device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two (2)
check valves, less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the
device.
At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between check valves shall be less
than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve the
differential relief valve shall operate to maintain this reduced pressure by
discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two (2) pounds per
square inch or less the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere, thereby
providing an air gap in the device. To be approved, these devices must be
readily accessible for maintenance and testing and installed in a location
where no part of the valve will be submerged.
   APPROVED WATER SUPPLY: Any water supply approved by or under the public
health supervision of a public health agency of the state of California, or its
political subdivisions. In determining what constitutes an approved water
supply, the state department of public health reserves final judgment as to its
safety and potability.
   AUXILIARY SUPPLY: Any water supply on or available to the premises other
than the public water supply.
   CITY: As used in chapters 13.08 through 13.32 of this title, means the cross
connection control board of the city which is herein established and shall
consist of the city manager, the director of public works and the water
superintendent and engineer.
   CROSS CONNECTIONS: Any unprotected connection between any part of a water
system used or intended to supply water for drinking purposes and any source or
system containing water or substance that is not or cannot be approved as safe,
wholesome, and potable for human consumption. (Prior code § 59126)
13.20.040: PROTECTION REQUIRED; WHERE:
   A.   Each service connection from the city water system for supplying water
to premises having an auxiliary water supply shall be protected against
backflow of water from the premises into the public water system, unless the
auxiliary water supply is accepted as an additional source by the water
purveyor, and is approved by the public health agency having jurisdiction.
   B.   Each service connection from the city water system for supplying water
to premises on which any substance is handled in such a fashion as to permit
its entry into the water system, shall be protected against backflow of the
water from the premises into the public system. This shall include the handling
of process waters and waters originating from the city water supply system
which have been subject to deterioration in sanitary quality.
   C.   Backflow prevention devices shall be installed on the service
connection to any premises that have internal cross connections unless such
cross connections are abated to the satisfaction of the city and approved by
the state or local health department. (Prior code § 59127)
13.20.050: PROTECTION REQUIRED; TYPE:
The protective device required shall depend on the degree of hazard as
tabulated in this section:
   A.   At the service connection to any premises where there is an auxiliary
water supply handled in a separate piping system with no known cross
connection, the city water supply shall be protected by an approved double
check valve assembly.
   B.   At the service connection to any premises on which a substance that
would be objectionable (but not necessarily hazardous to health), if introduced
into the public water supply, is handled so as to constitute a cross
connection, the city water supply shall be protected by an approved double
check valve assembly.
   C.   At the service connection on any premises on which there is an
auxiliary water supply where cross connections are known to exist which cannot
be presently eliminated, the public water supply system shall be protected by
an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. A double
check valve assembly may be used in lieu of such device if local experience
indicates that double check valves are reliably operated and if approved by the
water purveyor and local health agency.
   D.   At the service connection to any premises on which any material
dangerous to health or toxic substance in toxic concentration is or may be
handled, the public water supply shall be protected by an air gap separation.
The air gap shall be located as close as practicable to the service cock and
all piping between the service cock and receiving tank shall be entirely
visible. If these conditions cannot reasonably be met, the public water supply
shall be protected with either an approved reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention device, or an approved double check valve assembly, providing the
alternative is acceptable to both the water purveyor and the local health
agency.
   E.   At the service connection to any sewage treatment plant or sewage
pumping station the city water supply shall be protected by an air gap
separation. The air gap shall be located as close as practicable to the service
cock and all piping between the service cock and receiving tank shall be
entirely visible. If these conditions cannot be reasonably met, the public
water supply shall be protected with an approved reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention device, providing this alternative is acceptable to both
the water purveyor and local health agency. Final decision in this matter shall
rest with the state department of public health. (Prior code § 59128)
13.20.060: RESPONSIBILITIES:
   A.   It shall be the responsibility of the city to make the determination if
any service connection or the handling of substances within the premises served
is deemed to constitute a hazard to the city water system and to determine the
degree of hazard and establish the requirements for protection. The city shall
accomplish this in conjunction with the local health agency.
   B.   It shall be the responsibility of the user of the water to install and
maintain the required protective device as specified by the city and to have
the device inspected and tested periodically by a person approved as qualified
by the city. Inspection intervals shall be one year maximum. Required interval
may be less if determined by the city that a history of malfunctioning has been
established or if the degree of hazard makes more frequent inspections
advisable. All devices shall be disassembled for maintenance and repair at
least every five (5) years. All test results and all maintenance steps taken
shall be reported regularly in forms to be provided by the city and maintained
on file at the city offices. Failure to file with the city the required test
and maintenance reports will require the city to consider the connection
unprotected and service may be discontinued. (Prior code § 59129)
13.20.070: DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE:
   A.   Service of water to any premises may be discontinued by the water
division after reasonable notification if unprotected cross connections exist
on the premises, or if any defect is found in an installed backflow preventive
device has been removed or bypassed, and service will not be restored until
such conditions or defects are corrected.
   B.   Discontinuance of service may be summary, immediate and without notice
whenever, in the judgment of the water superintendent of the water division,
such action is necessary to protect the purity of the water supply or the
safety of the water system, and the water superintendent's determination shall
be final and conclusive. (Prior code § 59130)
13.20.080: RIGHT OF ENTRY:
The city representative assigned to inspect premises relative to possible
hazards shall carry proper credentials of his office, upon exhibition of which
he shall have the right of entry, during usual business hours, to inspect any
and all buildings and premises in the performance of his duty. This right of
entry shall be a condition of water service in order to provide assurance that
the continuation of service to the premises will not constitute a menace to the
health, safety and welfare of the people throughout the city's water system.

irrigation shall be provided through a separate water meter service.
   C.   The dwelling unit shall be less than one thousand five hundred (1,500)
square feet of livable area.
Removal of the age restriction or an increase in the size of the unit will
result in a reassessment of the charges.
   WATER STOCK AND WATER RIGHTS: The water stock and water rights identified
and referred to in the "Water and Wastewater Rate Study Update - 1991" as
prepared by the Public Works Department and approved by the City which
identifies water stock and water rights needed to serve new development that
will be required to obtain City water service. (Ord. 2880, 2019)
13.40.030: DEVELOPER REQUIREMENTS:
For any development project that will require water service or incremental
water demand from the City, a water source acquisition charge shall be approved
by the City Council and shall be paid as a condition of final approval of that
development. The charge due shall be that amount in effect on the date approval
of the development is given by the City. ( Ord. 2962, 2024: Ord. 2880, 2019)
13.40.040: ADJUSTMENT OF CHARGES:

approved by the City Council by a percentage equal to the percentage change in
the construction cost index of the Engineering News-Record's "Construction Cost
Index" - twenty (20) cities annual average for the preceding twelve (12) month
period. The purpose of this adjustment is to offset the effects of inflation
related construction cost increases or any deflation related decreases. If this
index should cease publication, the Finance Director shall use any appropriate
official index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or similar agency
as may then exist or may then be most nearly equivalent thereto. (Ord. 2962,

owners do not wish to have said sewer main extension constructed under an
assessment district or bond issue, shall petition the City Engineer and deposit
with him a fee to cover the cost of preparation of plans and specifications for
said sewer extension. The fee shall be at six percent (6%) of the City
Engineer's estimate of the cost of construction, but in no case shall be less
than twenty five dollars ($25.00). Such fee shall be refunded when the
construction is completed. Should construction not begin within one year of
such petition or not be completed, such fee shall be forfeited. If in the
opinion of the City Engineer, such sewer extension is necessary and the
construction thereof feasible, he shall prepare plans and specifications for
the construction thereof. (Prior Code § 83100)
13.44.020: PETITION BY TWO OR MORE OWNERS:
Two (2) or more property owners representing at least eighty percent (80%) of
the total property frontage adjacent to the proposed main installation which
can be connected to the City sewer system, and where no sewer main exists
adjacent to the property, and where the owners do not wish to have such sewer
main extension constructed under an assessment district shall petition the City
Engineer and obtain from him a cost estimate of the total of such main
construction, inspection, and engineering. All sewer extensions to be
constructed by this method shall be subject to review by and recommendations of

the construction thereof feasible, he shall prepare plans and specifications
for the construction thereof. (Prior Code § 83101)
13.44.030: CONTRACT:
After plans and specifications are prepared by the City Engineer, the property
owner, or owners, shall contract with a private contractor for the construction
of such sewer extension. (Prior Code § 83102)
13.44.040: USE OF LABOR:
The property owner, or owners, may request the City Engineer to use force
account labor or call for bids with the approval of the City Council after said
property owner, or owners, have met the requirements as provided in section
13.44.050 of this chapter. (Prior Code § 83103)
13.44.050: PAYMENT:
Payment for sewer construction shall be made as follows:
   A.   The property owner, or owners, shall deposit with the City Engineer an
amount which, in the estimation of the City Engineer, will be sufficient to
cover the entire cost of construction of the sewer extension.
   B.   The property owners representing at least eighty percent (80%) of the
property frontage adjacent to the proposed sewer main shall deposit with the
City Engineer an amount which, in the estimation of the City Engineer, will be
sufficient to cover eighty percent (80%) or more of the entire cost of
engineering, construction, inspection and supervision of the sewer main
extension.
   C.   If the amount estimated by the city engineer as set forth in subsection
A of this section, is not sufficient to cover the entire cost of such completed
sewer construction either at a bid price or by force account, the city engineer
shall notify the property owner, or owners, involved of the additional amount
necessary to complete payment on the work, and within ten (10) days thereafter
such property owner, or owners, shall pay such additional amount with the city
engineer. Should the property owner, or owners, fail to pay such additional
amount, the city engineer shall present a statement to the property owner, or
owners, for their share of the increased cost, and showing all expenditures on
behalf of the proposed sewer construction. Or, if a surplus remains, the city
engineer shall thereafter order the refund to the property owner, or owners, of
all the money deposited by them except that amount shown to have been expended
on behalf of the proposed construction.
   D.   If the total project cost estimated by the city engineer as set forth
in subsection B of this section, is not sufficient to cover the entire
completed cost of engineering, construction, inspection and supervision either
at a bid price or by force account, the city engineer shall notify the property
owners affected of the additional amount necessary to complete payment on such
work, and within ten (10) days thereafter, such property owners shall pay such
additional amount with the city engineer. Should the property owner, or owners,
fail to pay such additional amount, the city engineer shall present a statement
to the property owner, or owners, for their share of the increased cost, and
showing all expenditures on behalf of the proposed sewer construction. Or, if a
surplus remains, the city engineer shall thereafter order the refund to the
property owner, or owners, of all the money deposited by them except that
amount shown to have been expended on behalf of the proposed construction.
(Prior code § 83200)
13.44.060: DEPOSIT OF CONSTRUCTION COSTS:
Where a surety bond or other security has been posted with the city
guaranteeing the construction of a sewerage system in connection with a
subdivision or other development as required, the city engineer shall determine
whether immediate construction of said sewerage system or any other portion
thereof is necessary to promote the public interest. The person posting such
bond shall be referred to herein as "developer". Upon the recommendation from
the city engineer, the city council may require such sewerage system or any
portion thereof to be constructed by contract with the city. The procedure for
making such construction contracts shall be as follows:
   A.   The city shall call for bids based on the developer's construction
plans and award a contract in form satisfactory to the city to the lowest
qualified bidder.
   B.   The city shall administer the contract, inspect construction in
accordance with all rules, regulations, and laws of the city, and pay
construction costs.
   C.   The city shall be reimbursed by developer for all such construction and
inspection costs.
   D.   Reimbursement shall be made to the city prior to issuance of any
building permit to developer for construction of any subdivision or other
development which the sewerage system extension referred to in the bond or
other security, is designed to serve. In no event may reimbursement be made in
accordance herewith more than one year after the effective date of the bond or
other security.
   E.   The principal named in the bond or other security shall be held liable
for any payment due to the city. (Prior code § 83201)
13.44.070: SUBDIVISIONS, LOT SPLITS OR NEW RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS:
If a city sewer is available in a street or right of way adjoining property to
be subdivided, or upon which a new residential building is to be erected, the
owner of the property shall construct a sewer collection system to serve such
residential building or each lot in the subdivision or lot split, in accordance
with the standard specifications approved by the city engineer. (Prior code §
83300)
13.44.080: WHEN SEWER NOT AVAILABLE:
   A.   If a city sewer is not available near a development project, the
applicant for the development project shall construct, at his own expense, a
sewer line to the nearest usable city sewer, except as hereinafter provided, in
accordance with standard specifications, and the provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Where a city sewer is not available, the applicant for the development
project shall construct, or cause to be constructed, at his expense, a sewer
line for a distance of one hundred feet (100') per lot or seventy five feet
(75') per dwelling unit, whichever is greater, from the nearest point of the
property, to the existing sewer line, in accordance with standard
specifications approved by the city engineer. An owner of industrial or
commercial property shall construct, at his expense, a sewer line for a
distance of one hundred feet (100') per four hundred (400) gallons per day of
sewage produced, as estimated by the city engineer, or one hundred feet (100')
per lot, whichever is greater, from the nearest point of the property to the
existing sewer line, in accordance with standard specifications.
   C.   When an applicant for a development project is not required to extend
the sewer in accordance with subsection B of this section, he shall provide
plans for connecting the tract to the nearest public sewer and construct dry
sewers in the subdivision to provide for future service to every parcel,
including the construction of sewer laterals from the sewer main to the
property line. The developer's engineer shall provide the city with an as built
plan showing the location and depth of each lateral. The septic tank and
cesspool shall be constructed in a location and manner as specified by the
chief building official to minimize the expense of a future connection to the
public sewer.
   D.   The city council may waive the requirements of subsection C of this
section upon written request by an applicant for a development project. The
factors which the city council may consider are the following:
      1.   There are no sewer trunk main extensions identified in the city's
capital improvement program for the sewerage tributary area, up gradient of an
available sewer which may reasonably serve the development project;
      2.   If residential in character, the development project is proposed as
very low density as defined in the Redlands general plan and will not adversely
impact local ground water quality;
      3.   The properties between the proposed project and an available sewer
have been developed without sewage facilities and it is unlikely that such
facilities will be constructed for such properties within a reasonably
foreseeable time after construction of the proposed project. (Ord. 2394 § 1,
1999: Ord. 1941 § 1, 1986: prior code § 83400)
13.44.090: OVERSIZING SEWER LINES:
The subdivider or lot owner shall pay the full cost of the mains installed not
to exceed eight inches (8") nominal diameter, unless the size of the
subdivision or other requirements of the development requires a larger main. In
such case, the owner or subdivider will pay the total cost, regardless of size.
Except as provided above, if the city requires a line larger than eight inches
(8") to be used as a trunk line, such trunk line shall be paid for by the owner
or subdivider with an allowance made by the city to cover the difference in
cost of the materials used between eight inches (8") and the size additional
cost due to labor and other reasons as a result of installing lines greater
than eight inches (8") in size; the allowance for the difference in material
cost will be increased by thirty percent (30%). The owner or subdivider shall
have a properly qualified licensed contractor make the installation. The city
shall determine the amount of allowance for lines over eight inches (8") in
size according to the material costs available to the city. (Ord. 1941 § 2,
1986: prior code § 83401)
13.44.100: COST PRORATION:
Immediately after the completion of sewer construction, in accordance with this
chapter the city engineer shall prorate the entire cost thereof against all
lots or property that may ultimately be benefited by direct connection to the
sewer in proportion to the frontage thereof, or if the lots be irregular in
shape, then in such manner as may in the opinion of the city engineer provide
an equitable distribution of costs. (Prior code § 83402)
13.44.110: CONNECTIONS:
In no event shall any owner of property benefited by such sewer be permitted to
connect thereto without first paying the frontage charge or other prorated
charge placed against said property by the city engineer. No person, firm or
corporation shall connect any property with the city sewer without first
obtaining a permit and paying the frontage charge or other prorated charge.
(Ord. 1941 § 3, 1986: prior code § 83403)
13.44.120: FRONTAGE CHARGE:
   A.   The sewer main frontage charge is established to implement the Redlands
general plan and finance the construction of local sewer collection mains and
main extensions, by providing for more equitable sharing of costs of those
mains. Included are eight inch (8") minimum size sewer mains required within
the development, and sewer main extensions from the development to a point
where the new main can tie into an existing main or if an existing sewer is not
available at that point, then to a point a distance from the development as
defined in section
13.44.080 of this chapter.
The frontage charge shall be equal to the frontage charge per foot, as
specified by subsection D of this section, multiplied by the total length of
all property lines contiguous to street right-of-way or easements wherein there
are sewer mains accessible to the property.
   B.   A percentage of the frontage charge collected, set by section
 13.44.130 of this chapter, shall be refunded to the owner or developer
originally paying for said sewer main, to which the connection has been made.
See section
13.44.130 of this chapter for rules governing application for refunds.
   C.   Twenty five percent (25%) of the sum collected as frontage charges
shall be credited to the Sewer Service Fund balance. Seventy five percent (75%)
of the sum collected in frontage charges in accordance with this section and
sections
13.44.110 through
13.44.130 of this chapter shall be credited to the reserve for frontage charge
reimbursement which shall be established in the Sewer Service Fund.
Reimbursements shall be paid out of this reserve. Any accumulation of funds
beyond the amount necessary to meet refund obligations shall be credited from
time to time, to the reserve for capital in the Sewer Service Fund.
   D.   Sewer main frontage charge per foot shall be thirty dollars ($30.00).
(Ord. 2682 § 5, 2007: Ord. 2654 § 2, 2007: Ord. 2608 § 9, 2005: Ord. 2079 §§
11, 12, 1989: Ord. 1941 § 3, 1986: Prior Code § 83404)
13.44.130: REFUNDING OF COSTS:
   A.   There shall be no refunding of costs for the installation of any sewer
mains within any development or for sewer connections to lots within any
development or for connections to any lot contiguous to the mains that had a
sewer connection prior to the installation of the new main. For all new sewer
connections to lots contiguous to all such mains installed by the owner or
developer and not within the development, tract, or subdivision the City shall
refund to the original owner or developer that installed the sewer main seventy
five percent (75%) of the sum collected as frontage charges in accordance with
section
13.44.120 of this chapter, which refund shall not be transferable except to
legal heirs and assigns. No refunds shall be made after ten (10) years from
completion of such new sewer main.
   B.   Any person or persons entitled to any refund under the provisions of
chapter 3.44 of this Code and this division shall make application for refund
to the Public Works Director. All applications shall be in writing and shall be
made annually within the calendar year for which the refund is requested. (Ord.
1941 § 3, 1986: Prior Code § 83405)
13.44.140: ASSESSMENT ACT:
When connecting to a sewer line financed by voluntary assessment or Improvement
Act of 1911 or similar acts, in which the connecting property has shared in the
sewer construction costs, the connection charge shall be only the normal
plumbing connection and street cutting fees. (Prior Code § 83406)
13.44.150: DEDICATIONS:
All sewers constructed under the provisions of the ordinance codified herein or
any other ordinance and located in a right-of- way or easement owned by or
dedicated to the City shall become the property of the City. (Ord. 1941 § 4,
1986: Prior Code § 83407)
13.44.160: PRIVATE SEWER LATERALS:
   A.   Defined: A private sewer lateral (PSL) shall have the same meaning as a
"private sewer" as defined in the California Plumbing Code, and shall more
particularly mean a pipe or pipes and appurtenances that carry wastewater and
liquid waste from the structure(s) served to the point of connection at the
public sewer line located in the City right-of-way or easement, regardless of
whether the structure(s) is [are] publicly or privately owned. A PSL is
associated with a parcel, if it, or any portion of it, is located upon the
parcel or conveys wastewater and liquid waste from any structure located on
that parcel. More than one PSL may be associated with an individual parcel. A
PSL may be located on abutting parcels in order to provide access to an
available public sewer.
   B.   Maintenance: Each property owner shall, at the property owner's
expense, inspect, maintain in good working order, repair and replace, as
necessary, the PSL so that it does not cause or contribute to any sewage
overflow from either the PSL or the public sewer. The PSL shall be free of
displaced joints, open joints, root intrusion, substantial deterioration of the
line, cracks, leaks, inflow, infiltration of extraneous water, fats, oils and
grease, sediment deposits or any other similar conditions, defects or
obstructions likely to cause or contribute to blockage of the PSL or the public
sewer. The owner shall perform such duties as may be required in response to
observed overflows or seepage attributable to the lateral, or as discovered by
smoke testing, televising or other surveys of the lateral. Where such
maintenance requires excavation or replacement of existing sewer facilities,
the owner shall apply for and receive an encroachment permit from the City.

   A.   Prohibited Discharge Standards: Except as hereinafter provided, it is
unlawful for any person to discharge, or cause to be discharged, into any
public sewer or any opening leading to a public sewer of the city any pollutant
or wastewater which causes pass-through or interference, or any material which
will cause significant damage to any part of the city's POTW. This prohibition
shall apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to
categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state or local
pretreatment standards or requirements.
The following is a nonexclusive list of other specifically prohibited wastes:
      1.   Any earth, sand, rocks, ashes, gravel, plaster, concrete, semisolid
(partially solid), solid or viscous material in quantities or volume which will
obstruct the flow of sewage in the public sewer or any object that will cause
clogging of sewage pumps or sewage sludge pumps or interfere or cause pass-
through with the normal operation of the wastewater treatment facilities.
      2.   Pollutants, which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or
fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health or
safety problems.
      3.   Any liquids, solids, gases or pollutants that either alone or by
interaction with other substances cause flammable or explosive conditions
including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of
less than one hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit (140°F) (60°C) using the test
methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
      4.   Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points and in such
manner as designated by the director.

hundred four degrees Fahrenheit (104°F) (40°C), or which will inhibit
biological activity in the treatment facilities resulting in interference.
      7.   Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral
oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass-through.
      8.   Pollutants, including, but not limited to, oxygen demanding
pollutants (biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, etc.), released
in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either
singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with
the POTW.
      9.   Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater
which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to
create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or prevent entry into the sewers
for maintenance or repair.
      10.   Storm water, surface water, ground water, artesian well water, roof
runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized
water, noncontact cooling water and unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically
authorized by the director.

      15.   Any material which causes abnormal sulfide generation or abnormal
maintenance or operation costs of any part of the public sewer system, becomes
a nuisance or menace to public health, or any strongly odorous wastes or wastes
tending to create odors.
      16.   Special restrictions apply to water softening devices. It is
unlawful to install, replace or enlarge apparatus for softening all or any part
of the water supply to any premises when such apparatus is an ion exchange
softener or demineralizer of the type that is regenerated on the site of use.
The owner of an existing water softening or conditioning apparatus may continue
to operate said apparatus after the owner registers and certifies the apparatus
with the city pursuant to the requirements set forth in the California Health
and Safety Code. The certification shall include the following information:
         a.   The name and address of the owner;
         b.   The equipment manufacturer;

after February 15, 1983, may discharge waste into the public sewer or to the
ground if the equipment has a mineral capacity in excess of one and one-half
(11/2) cubic feet. Multiple units installed to supply water to the same
premises shall be considered a single apparatus for the purposes of this
chapter. Any person installing or operating water treating apparatus of any
kind shall make such apparatus accessible to the director for inspection at all
times and shall make such reports and pay any fee relative to such apparatus as
the director may require.
      17.   Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section
shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged
to the POTW. This includes the prohibition of increased use of process water or
dilution as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve
compliance with federal, state or local limitations, unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.6(d).
   B.   Pretreatment Standards: The categorical pretreatment standards found at
40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts 405–471 are incorporated.
   C.   Local Limits: The director may develop and implement pollutant
limitations. These limitations are necessary to assure compliance with the
city's waste discharge requirements including the prohibition against pass-
through of any pollutants that cause a violation of a permit or cause
interference with the POTW. Through the issuance of an industrial user permit,
the pollutant allocations may be allocated among industrial user classes or
individual users considering factors such as equity, technical feasibility,
economic feasibility, pollution prevention and waste minimization measures,
anticipated growth and enforcement feasibility. Specific pollutant limits shall
not be developed and enforced without individual public notice to affected
persons or users. The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance,
resolution, or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW. (Ord. 2268 § 1, 1995)
13.52.040: PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER:
   A.   Pretreatment Facilities: Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and the prohibitions of this
chapter within the time limit specified by EPA, the state, or the director,
whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be
provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
director for review, and shall be approved by the director before such
facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures
shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such
facilities as necessary to produce discharge acceptable to the city under the
provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Additional Pretreatment Measures:
      1.   Whenever deemed necessary, the director may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste
streams, and perform such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and ensure the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      2.   The director may require any person discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on its property and at its expense, a suitable storage
and flow control facility to insure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      3.   All nondomestic users shall be required to install and maintain a
grease, oil and/or sand interceptor when the director finds that such facility
is necessary for the proper handling of liquid waste containing grease,
flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful constituents which may be properly
eliminated from the collection system by use of an interceptor. An interceptor
is not required for a building used solely for residential purposes except
where common food preparation occurs. All interception units shall be of the
type and capacity approved by the director and shall be so located to be easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected,
cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at its expense. When an
interceptor is cleaned, the removed sediment, liquid and floating material
shall be legally disposed of other than to the city's POTW or storm drain.
      4.   Users with potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   C.   Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans: At least once every two (2)
years, the director shall evaluate whether each user needs an accidental
discharge/slug control plan. The director may require any user to develop,
submit for approval and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the director may
develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan
shall address, at a minimum, the following:
      1.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      2.   Description of stored chemicals;
      3.   Procedures for immediately notifying the director of any accidental
or slug discharge; and
      4.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   D.   Hauled Wastewater: Hauled waste may be introduced into the POTW only at
locations designated by the director, and at such times as are established by
the director. Such waste shall not violate any provision of this chapter or any
other requirements of the city. The director shall require septic tank waste
haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. No load may be discharged
without prior consent of the director. The director may require samples to be
collected from each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards
and may require the waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior
to discharge. Waste haulers shall complete a waste tracking form provided by
the city for every load. This form shall include, but not be limited to, the
name and address of the waste hauler, permit number, truck identification,
names and addresses of sources of waste and volume and characteristics of the
waste along with the origin and known or suspected waste constituents. (Ord.
2268 § 1, 1995)
13.52.050: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT APPLICATION:
   A.   Wastewater Analysis: When requested by the director, a user shall
submit information to the city on the nature and characteristics of its
wastewater within sixty (60) days of the request. The director is authorized to
prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update
this information.
   B.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirement:
      1.   No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the
POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the director,
except that a significant industrial user that has filed a timely application
pursuant to this chapter may continue to discharge for the time period
specified therein.
      2.   The director may require other users to obtain wastewater discharge
permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
      3.   Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge
permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and subjects the wastewater
discharge permittee to the sanctions described herein. Obtaining a wastewater
discharge permit shall not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with
all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other
requirements of federal, state and local law.
   C.   Wastewater Discharge Permitting; Existing Connections: Any user
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging wastewater
into the POTW prior to February 15, 1983, and who wishes to continue such
discharges in the future, shall, within sixty (60) days after said date, apply
to the director for a wastewater discharge permit.
   D.   Wastewater Discharge Permitting; New Connections: Any user required to
obtain a wastewater discharge permit who proposes to begin or recommence
discharging into the POTW shall obtain such permit prior to the beginning or
recommencing of such discharge. An application for this wastewater discharge
permit shall be filed at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date
upon which any discharge will begin or recommence.
   E.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Application Contents: All users required to
obtain a wastewater discharge permit must submit a permit application. The
director may require all users to submit as part of an application the
following information:
      1.   All information required by this chapter;
      2.   Description of activities, facilities, and plant processes on the
premises, including a list of all raw materials;
      3.   Number and type of employees, hours of operation and proposed or
actual hours of operation;
      4.   Each product produced by type, amount, process or processes and rate
of production;
      5.   Type and amount of raw materials processed (average and maximum per
day);
      6.   Site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing plans, and details
to show all sewers; floor drains; and appurtenances by size, location, and
elevation and all points of discharge;
      7.   Time and duration of discharges; and
      8.   Any other information required by the director to evaluate the
wastewater discharge permit application.
Incomplete or inaccurate applications shall not be processed and will be
returned to the user for revision.
   F.   Application Signatories And Certification: All wastewater discharge
permit applications and user reports must be signed by an authorized
representative of the user and contain the following certification statement:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gathered and evaluated the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage
the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations.
   G.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Decisions: The director will evaluate the
data furnished by the user and may require additional information. This
additional information may be gathered by inspections of user facilities and/or
the use of a sample to collect wastewater samples to characterize the
pollutants in the user's discharge. This information gathering shall be in
accordance with section
13.52.080 of this chapter. After evaluation of the data furnished, the director
will determine whether or not to issue a wastewater discharge permit. The
director may deny any application for a wastewater discharge permit. (Ord. 2268
§ 1, 1995)
13.52.060: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT ISSUANCE PROCESS:
   A.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Duration: A wastewater discharge permit
shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five (5) years from
the effective date of the permit. Each wastewater discharge permit shall
indicate a specific date upon which it will expire.
   B.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Contents: A wastewater discharge permit
shall include such conditions as are deemed reasonably necessary by the
director to prevent pass-through or interference, protect the quality of the
water body receiving the treatment plant's effluent, protect worker health and
safety, facilitate sludge management and disposal and protect against damage to
the POTW.
      1.   Wastewater discharge permits shall contain:
         a.   The duration of the wastewater discharge permit;
         b.   A statement that the wastewater discharge permit is
nontransferable without prior written notification to the city in accordance
with this chapter and provisions for furnishing the new owner or operator with
a copy of the existing wastewater discharge permit;
         c.   Effluent limits based on applicable pretreatment standards;
         d.   Self-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification and record
keeping requirements. These requirements shall include an identification of
pollutants to be monitored, sampling location, sampling frequency, and sample
type based on federal, state and local law; and
         e.   A statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for
violation of pretreatment standards and requirements, and any applicable
compliance schedule. Such schedule may not extend the time for compliance
beyond that required by applicable federal, state or local law.
      2.   Wastewater discharge permits may contain, but need not be limited
to, the following:
         a.   Limits on the average and/or maximum rate of discharge, time of
discharge and/or requirements for flow regulation and equalization;
         b.   Requirements for the installation of pretreatment technology,
pollution control, or construction of appropriate containment devices designed
to reduce, eliminate or prevent the introduction of pollutants into the
treatment works;
         c.   Requirements for the development and implementation of spill
control plans or other special conditions including management practices
necessary to adequately prevent accidental, unanticipated or nonroutine
discharges;
         d.   Development and implementation of waste minimization plans to
reduce the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW;
         e.   The unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for the
management of the wastewater discharged to the POTW;
         f.   Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and
sampling facilities and equipment;
         g.   A statement that compliance with the wastewater discharge permit
does not relieve the permittee of responsibility for compliance with all
applicable federal and state pretreatment standards, including those which
become effective during the term of the wastewater discharge permit; and
         h.   Other conditions deemed appropriate by the director to ensure
compliance with this chapter, and state and federal laws, rules and
regulations.
   C.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Appeals: The director shall provide public
notice of the issuance of a wastewater discharge permit. Any person, including
the user, may petition the director to reconsider the terms of a wastewater
discharge permit within ten (10) calendar days of notice of its issuance.
      1.   Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be
a waiver of the administrative appeal.
      2.   In its petition, the appealing party shall indicate the wastewater
discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and
the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the wastewater
discharge permit.
      3.   The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not be
stayed pending the appeal.
      4.   If the director fails to act within twenty (20) days after receipt
of an appeal, the appeal shall be deemed denied. Decisions not to reconsider a
wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater discharge permit, or not
to modify a wastewater discharge permit shall be considered final
administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.
      5.   Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final
administrative wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a
complaint with the appropriate court within the appropriate state statute of
limitations.
   D.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Modification: Wastewater discharge permits
shall not be transferred to a new owner or operator without prior written
approval of the director. The notice of transfer to the director shall include
a written certification by the new owner or operator which:
      1.   States that the new owner or operator has no immediate intent to
change the facility's operations and processes;
      2.   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer will occur; and
      3.   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
wastewater discharge permit. Failure to provide advance written notice to the
director of a transfer renders the wastewater discharge permit void as of the
date of facility transfer.
   E.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Revocation: The director may revoke a
wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the
following reasons:
      1.   Failure to notify the director of significant changes to the
wastewater prior to the changed discharge;
      2.   Failure to provide prior notification to the director of changed
conditions pursuant to the requirements of this chapter;
      3.   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in
the wastewater discharge permit application;
      4.   Falsifying self-monitoring reports;
      5.   Tampering with monitoring equipment;
      6.   Refusing to allow the director timely access to the facility
premises and records;
      7.   Failure to meet effluent limitations;
      8.   Failure to pay fines;
      9.   Failure to pay sewer charges;
      10.   Failure to meet compliance schedules;
      11.   Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge
permit application;
      12.   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business
ownership of a permitted facility; or
      13.   Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms
of the wastewater discharge permit or this chapter.
Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or
transfer of business ownership. All wastewater discharge permits issued to a
particular user are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit
to that user.
   F.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Reissuance: A user with an expiring
wastewater discharge permit shall apply for wastewater discharge permit
reissuance by submitting a complete permit application to the director, a
minimum of ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the user's existing
wastewater discharge permit.
   G.   Regulation Of Waste Received From Other Jurisdictions:
      1.   If another municipality, or user located within another
municipality, contributes wastewater to the POTW, the city shall enter into an
agreement with the contributing municipality. Prior to entering into such an
agreement, the director shall request the following information from the
contributing municipality:
         a.   A description of the quality and volume of wastewater discharged
to the POTW by the contributing municipality;
         b.   An inventory of all users located within the contributing
municipality that are discharging to the POTW; and
         c.   Such other information as the director may deem necessary.
      2.   The agreement shall contain the following:
         a.   A requirement for the contributing municipality to adopt a sewer
use ordinance which is at least as stringent as this chapter and local limits
which are at least as stringent as those in this chapter. The requirement shall
specify that such ordinance and limits must be revised as necessary to reflect
changes made to this chapter or local limits;
         b.   A requirement for the contributing municipality to submit a
revised user inventory on at least an annual basis;
         c.   A provision specifying which pretreatment, implementation
activities, including wastewater discharge permit issuance, inspection and
sampling, and enforcement, will be conducted by the contributing municipality;
which of these activities will be conducted by the director; and which of these
activities will be conducted jointly by the contributing municipality and the
director;
         d.   A requirement for the contributing municipality to provide the
director with access to all information that the contributing municipality
obtains as part of its pretreatment activities;
         e.   Limits on the nature, quality, and volume of the contributing
municipality's wastewater at the point where it discharges to the POTW;
         f.   Requirements for monitoring the contributing municipality's
discharge;
         g.   A provision ensuring the director access to the facilities of
users located within the contributing municipality's jurisdictional boundaries
for the purpose of inspection, sampling and any other duties deemed necessary
by the director; and
         h.   A provision specifying remedies available for breach of the terms
of the agreement. (Ord. 2268 § 1, 1995)
13.52.070: REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Reserved.
   B.   Reporting Requirements For Industrial Users Upon Effective Date Of
Categorical Pretreatment Standard-Baseline Report: Within one hundred eighty
(180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or
one hundred eighty (180) days after the final administrative decision made upon
a category determination submission under section 403.6(a)(4), whichever is
later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment
standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW
shall be required to submit to the control authority a report which contains
the information listed in subsections B1 through B7 of this section. At least
ninety (90) days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources, and sources
that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the control authority a
report which contains the information listed in subsections B1 through B5 of
this section.
New sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the
method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable
pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information
requested in subsections B4 and B5 of this section:
      1.   Identifying Information: The user shall submit the name and address
of the facility including the name of the operator and owners;
      2.   Permits: The user shall submit a list of any environmental control
permits held by or for the facility;
      3.   Description Of Operations: The user shall submit a brief description
of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial
classification of the operation(s) carried out by such industrial user. This
description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points
of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes;
      4.   Flow Measurement: The user shall submit information showing the
measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW
from each of the following:
         a.   Regulated process streams; and
         b.   Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula of section 403.6(e). (See subsection B5d of this section.)
The control authority may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where
justified by cost or feasibility considerations;
      5.   Measurement Of Pollutants:
         a.   The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to
each regulated process;
         b.   In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and
analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by
the standard or control authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge
from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or
mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of
daily operations. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a best
management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit
documentation as required by the control authority or the applicable standards
to determine compliance with the standard;
         c.   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection
B5;
         d.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of
section 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated
in accordance with section 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting
data shall be submitted to the control authority;
         e.   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR
part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant
in question, or where the administrator determines that the part 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods
or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the
administrator;
         f.   The control authority may allow the submission of a baseline
report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides
information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment
measures;
         g.   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW;
      6.   Certification: A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative
of the industrial user (as defined in subsection B1 of this section) and
certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment
standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional
operation and maintenance (O and M) and/or additional pretreatment is required
for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements;
and
      7.   Compliance Schedule: If additional pretreatment and/or O and M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which
the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O and M.
The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the applicable pretreatment standard.
         a.   Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has
been modified by a removal allowance (section 403.7), the combined waste stream
formula (section 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance
(section 403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by this
subsection B, the information required by subsection B6 of this section and
this subsection B7 shall pertain to the modified limits.
         b.   If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal
allowance (section 403.7), the combined waste stream formula (section 403.6
(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (section 403.13) after
the user submits the report required by this subsection B, any necessary
amendments to the information requested by subsection B6 of this section and
this subsection B7 shall be submitted by the user to the control authority
within sixty (60) days after the modified limit is approved.
   C.   Compliance Schedule For Meeting Categorical Pretreatment Standards: The
following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by subsection B7 of
this section:
      1.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
industrial user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards
(e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final
plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction,
completing construction, etc.).
      2.   No increment referred to in subsection C1 of this section shall
exceed nine (9) months.
      3.   Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a
progress report to the control authority including, at a minimum, whether or
not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if
not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress,
the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to
return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more
than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the control
authority.
   D.   Report On Compliance With Categorical Pretreatment Standard Deadline:
Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial
user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
control authority a report containing the information described in subsections
B4 through B6 of this section. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass
or concentration limits established by the control authority in accordance with
the procedures in section 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable
measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation),
this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate
sampling period.
   E.   Periodic Reports On Continued Compliance:
      1.   Any industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard
(except a nonsignificant categorical user as defined in section 403.3(v)(2)),
after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a
new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to
the control authority during the months of June and December, unless required
more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the control authority or the
approval authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such categorical pretreatment
standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the
discharge reported in subsection B4 of this section except that the control
authority may require more detailed reporting of flows. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (or
pollution prevention alternative), the user shall submit documentation required
by the control authority or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine
the compliance status of the user. At the discretion of the control authority
and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays,
budget cycles, etc., the control authority may modify the months during which
the above reports are to be submitted.
      2.   The control authority may authorize the industrial user subject to a
categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated
by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the
following conditions:
         a.   The control authority may authorize a waiver where a pollutant is
determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the
facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an
applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
         b.   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the permit or other equivalent individual control
mechanism, but in no case longer than five (5) years. The user must submit a
new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent
control mechanism.
         c.   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes. The request for a
monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with subsection K1 of this
section and include the certification statement in section 403.6(a)(2)(ii).
Nondetectable sample results may only be used as a demonstration that a
pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR part 136 with
the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.
         d.   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the control authority must
be included as a condition in the user's control mechanism. The reasons
supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request
for the waiver must be maintained by the control authority for three (3) years
after expiration of the waiver.
         e.   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's
control mechanism by the control authority, the industrial user must certify on
each report with the statement below, that there has been no increase in the
pollutant in its waste stream due to activities of the industrial user:
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing
compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR            [specify
applicable National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best
of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of
           [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the
facility since filing of the last periodic report under 40 CFR 403.12(e)(l).
         f.   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present based on changes that occur in the user's operations,
the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of subsection
E1 of this section or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by
the control authority; and notify the control authority.
         g.   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
      3.   The control authority may reduce the requirement in subsection E1 of
this section to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year,
unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the approval
authority, where the industrial user meets all of the following conditions:
         a.   The industrial user's total categorical wastewater flow does not
exceed any of the following:
            (1)   0.01 percent of the design dry weather hydraulic capacity of
the POTW, or five thousand (5,000) gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as
measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the industrial
user discharges in batches;
            (2)   0.01 percent of the design dry weather organic treatment
capacity of the POTW; and
            (3)   0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for
any pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard for
which approved local limits were developed by a POTW in accordance with section
403.5(c) and subsection D of this section;
         b.   The industrial user has not been in significant noncompliance, as
defined in section 403.8(0)(2)(viii), for any time in the past two (2) years;
         c.   The industrial user does not have daily flow rates, production
levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that decreasing the
reporting requirement for this industrial user would result in data that are
not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period pursuant
to subsection G3 of this section;
         d.   The industrial user must notify the control authority immediately
of any changes at its facility causing it to no longer meet conditions of
subsection E3a or E3b of this section. Upon notification, the industrial user
must immediately begin complying with the minimum reporting in subsection E1 of
this section; and
         e.   The control authority must retain documentation to support the
control authority's determination that a specific industrial user qualifies for
reduced reporting requirements under subsection E3 of this section for a period
of three (3) years after the expiration of the term of the control mechanism.
      4.   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the control authority in accordance with the procedures
in section 403.6(c), the report required by subsection E1 of this section shall
contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all
other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed
only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other
measure of operation), the report required by subsection E1 of this section
shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting
period.
   F.   Notice Of Potential Problems, Including Slug Loading: All categorical
and noncategorical industrial users shall notify the POTW immediately of all
discharges that could cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings,
as defined by section 403.5(b), by the industrial user.
   G.   Monitoring And Analysis To Demonstrate Continued Compliance:
      1.   Except in the case of nonsignificant categorical users, the reports
required in subsections B, D, E, and H of this section shall contain the
results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the
nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the control
authority, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable
pretreatment standards. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the
control authority in lieu of the industrial user. Where the POTW performs the
required sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the user will
not be required to submit the compliance certification required under
subsections B6 and D of this section. In addition, where the POTW itself
collects all the information required for the report, including flow data, the
industrial user will not be required to submit the report.
      2.   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation,
the user shall notify the control authority within twenty four (24) hours of
becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority
within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Where the
control authority has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
industrial user, the control authority must perform the repeat sampling and
analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to
perform the repeat analysis. Resampling is not required if:
         a.   The control authority performs sampling at the industrial user at
a frequency of at least once per month; or
         b.   The control authority performs sampling at the user between the
time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the
control authority receives the results of this sampling.
      3.   The reports required in subsections B, D, E and H of this section
must be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis
performed during the period covered by the report, which data are
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The control
authority shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and
assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil
and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants,
twenty four (24) hour composite samples must be obtained through flow
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where time
proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control
authority, the samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision
to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user
file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a twenty four (24) hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and
sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the control authority, as appropriate.
      4.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety
(90) day compliance reports required in subsections B and D of this section, a
minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols,
oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which
historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the control authority may authorize a lower
minimum. For the reports required by subsections E and H of this section, the
control authority shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess
and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements.
      5.   All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the administrator pursuant to section 304(h) of the act and
contained in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test
procedures approved by the administrator. (See sections 136.4 and 136.5.)
Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the
administrator. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not include sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutants in question, or where the administrator
determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and
analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other
parties, approved by the administrator.
      6.   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in
subsection E or H of this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the
appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the control
authority, using the procedures prescribed in subsection G5 of this section,
the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
         a.   Reporting Requirements For Industrial Users Not Subject To
Categorical Pretreatment Standards: The control authority must require
appropriate reporting from those industrial users with discharges that are not
subject to categorical pretreatment standards. Significant noncategorical
industrial users must submit to the control authority at least once every six
(6) months (on dates specified by the control authority) a description of the
nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by
the control authority. In cases where a local limit requires compliance with a
best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user must
submit documentation required by the control authority to determine the
compliance status of the user. These reports must be based on sampling and
analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and in accordance with
the techniques described in part 136 and amendments thereto. This sampling and
analysis may be performed by the control authority in lieu of the significant
noncategorical industrial user.
   H.   Annual POTW Reports:   POTWs with approved pretreatment programs shall
provide the approval authority with a report that briefly describes the POTW's
program activities, including activities of all participating agencies, if more
than one jurisdiction is involved in the local program. The report required by
this subsection shall be submitted no later than one year after approval of the
POTW's pretreatment program and at least annually thereafter, and shall
include, at a minimum, the following:
      1.   An updated list of the POTW's industrial users, including their
names and addresses, or a list of deletions and additions keyed to a previously
submitted list. The POTW shall provide a brief explanation of each deletion.
This list shall identify which industrial users are subject to categorical
pretreatment standards and specify which standards are applicable to each
industrial user. The list shall indicate which industrial users are subject to
local standards that are more stringent than the categorical pretreatment
standards. The POTW shall also list the industrial users that are subject only
to local requirements. The list must also identify industrial users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards that are subject to reduced reporting
requirements under subsection E3 of this section, and identify which industrial
users are nonsignificant categorical industrial users;
      2.   A summary of the status of industrial user compliance over the
reporting period;
      3.   A summary of compliance and enforcement activities (including
inspections) conducted by the POTW during the reporting period;
      4.   A summary of changes to the POTW's pretreatment program that have
not been previously reported to the approval authority; and
      5.   Any other relevant information requested by the approval authority.
   I.   Notification Of Changed Discharge: All industrial users shall promptly
notify the control authority (and the POTW if the POTW is not the control
authority) in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of
pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous
wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under
subsection O of this section.
   J.   Compliance Schedule For POTWs: The following conditions and reporting
requirements shall apply to the compliance schedule for development of an
approvable POTW pretreatment program required by section 403.8.
      1.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
development and implementation of a POTW pretreatment program (e.g., acquiring
required authorities, developing funding mechanisms, acquiring equipment);
      2.   No increment referred to in subsection J1 of this section shall
exceed nine (9) months;
      3.   Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the POTW shall submit a progress
report to the approval authority including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the
date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason
for delay, and the steps taken by the POTW to return to the schedule
established. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the approval authority.
   K.   Signatory Requirements For Industrial User Reports: The reports
required by subsections B, D, and E of this section shall include the
certification statement as set forth in section 403.6(a)(2)(ii), and shall be
signed as follows:
      1.   By a responsible corporate officer, if the industrial user
submitting the reports required by subsections B, D, and E of this section is a
corporation. For the purpose of this subsection, a "responsible corporate
officer" means:
         a.   A president, secretary, treasurer, or vice president of the
corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who
performs similar policy or decision making functions for the corporation, or
         b.   The manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or
operating facilities, provided, the manager is authorized to make management
decisions which govern the operation of the regulated facility including having
the explicit or implicit duty of making major capital investment
recommendations, and initiate and direct other comprehensive measures to assure
long term environmental compliance with environmental laws and regulations; can
ensure that the necessary systems are established or actions taken to gather
complete and accurate information for control mechanism requirements; and where
authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in
accordance with corporate procedures.
      2.   By a general partner or proprietor if the industrial user submitting
the reports required by subsections B, D and E of this section is a
partnership, or sole proprietorship respectively.
      3.   By a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in
subsection K1 or K2 of this section if:
         a.   The authorization is made in writing by the individual described
in subsection K1 or K2 of this section;
         b.   The authorization specifies either an individual or a position
having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility from which the
industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager,
operator of a well or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent
responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental matters for
the company; and
         c.   The written authorization is submitted to the control authority.
      4.   If an authorization under subsection K3 of this section is no longer
accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the
overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental
matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of
subsection K3 of this section must be submitted to the control authority prior
to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
   L.   Signatory Requirements For POTW Reports: Reports submitted to the
approval authority by the POTW in accordance with subsection H of this section
must be signed by a principal executive officer, ranking elected official or
other duly authorized employee. The duly authorized employee must be an
individual or position having responsibility for the overall operation of the
facility or the pretreatment program. This authorization must be made in
writing by the principal executive officer or ranking elected official, and
submitted to the approval authority prior to or together with the report being
submitted.
   M.   Provisions Governing Fraud And False Statements: The reports and other
documents required to be submitted or maintained under this section shall be
subject to:
      1.   The provisions of 18 USC section 1001 relating to fraud and false
statements;
      2.   The provisions of sections 309(c)(4) of the act, as amended,
governing false statements, representation or certification; and
      3.   The provisions of section 309(c)(6) regarding responsible corporate
officers.
   N.   Record Keeping Requirements:
      1.   Any industrial user and POTW subject to the reporting requirements
established in this section shall maintain records of all information resulting
from any monitoring activities required by this section, including
documentation associated with best management practices. Such records shall
include for all samples:
         a.   The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the names
of the person or persons taking the samples;
         b.   The dates analyses were performed;
         c.   Who performed the analyses;
         d.   The analytical techniques/methods used; and
         e.   The results of such analyses.
      2.   Any industrial user or POTW subject to the reporting requirements
established in this section (including documentation associated with best
management practices) shall be required to retain for a minimum of three (3)
years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such
monitoring activities are required by this section) and shall make such records
available for inspection and copying by the director and the regional
administrator (and POTW in the case of an industrial user). This period of
retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation
regarding the industrial user or POTW or when requested by the director or the
regional administrator.
      3.   Any POTW to which reports are submitted by an industrial user
pursuant to subsections B, D, E, and H of this section shall retain such
reports for a minimum of three (3) years and shall make such reports available
for inspection and copying by the director and the regional administrator. This
period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved
litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants by the industrial user or the
operation of the POTW pretreatment program or when requested by the director or
the regional administrator.
   O.   Notification Of Proper Authorities:
      1.   The industrial user shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste
management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing
of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of,
would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must
include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the
EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or
other). If the industrial user discharges more than one hundred kilograms (100
kg) of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also
contain the following information to the extent such information is known and
readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All
notifications must take place within one hundred eighty (180) days of the
effective date of this rule. Industrial users who commence discharging after
the effective date of this rule shall provide the notification no later than
one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge of the listed or
characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this subsection need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications
of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The
notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already
reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12 (b), (d), and
(e).
      2.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection O1 of
this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than
fifteen kilograms (15 kg) of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.301(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of
more than fifteen kilograms (15 kg) of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar
month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR
261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a onetime notification.
Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
      3.   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the
POTW, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety
(90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
      4.   In the case of any notification made under this subsection O, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
   P.   Annual Certification By Nonsignificant Categorical Industrial Users: A
facility determined to be a nonsignificant categorical industrial user pursuant
to section 403.3(v)(2) must annually submit the following certification
statement, signed in accordance with the signatory requirements in subsection L
of this section. This certification must accompany any alternative report
required by the control authority:
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing
compliance with the categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR
               , I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that
during the period from                  , to                   [month, days,
year]:
   (a)    The facility described as                 [facility name] met the
definition of a non- significant categorical Industrial User as described in
section 403.3(v)(2); (b) the facility complied with all applicable Pretreatment
Standards and requirements during this reporting period; and (c) the facility
never discharged more than 100 gallons of total categorical wastewater on any
given day during this reporting period. This compliance certification is based
upon the following information:
   Q.   Electronic Reporting: The control authority that chooses to receive
electronic documents must satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 3 (electronic
reporting). (Ord. 2662 § 1, 2007: Ord. 2268 § 1, 1995)
13.52.080: COMPLIANCE MONITORING:
   A.   Right Of Entry; Inspection And Sampling: The director shall have the
right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is
complying with all requirements of this chapter and any wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the director ready access
to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
      1.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the director will be permitted to enter without
delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
      2.   The director shall have the right to set up on the user's property,
or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling
and/or metering of the user's operations.
      3.   The director may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own
expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated per the manufacturer of the device's guidelines to ensure their
accuracy.
      4.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the director and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
      5.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the director access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   B.   Search Warrants: If the director has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this
chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the director may seek
issuance of a search warrant from the appropriate court. (Ord. 2268 § 1, 1995)
13.52.090: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
   A.   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys,
wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from the director's inspection and sampling
activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the
user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the director, that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the
user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to
the permit program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not
be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public
without restriction. (Ord. 2268 § 1, 1995)
13.52.100: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
   A.   The director shall publish at least annually, in a newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time, during the previous
twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. For the purposes of this section, a
user is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the
following criteria:
      1.   "Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits", defined here as
those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits, as defined;
      2.   "Technical review criteria (TRC) violations", defined here as those
in which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken
for each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds
the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) multiplied by the
applicable TRC (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH);
      3.   Any other discharge violation of a pretreatment standard or
requirement as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) that the POTW determines has caused,
alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through,
including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
      4.   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
human health, welfare or to the environment, or has resulted in the POTW's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      5.   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
      6.   Failure to provide within forty five (45) days after the due date,
any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, ninety (90) day
reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules;
      7.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
      8.   Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a
violation of best management practices, which the POTW determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program. (Ord. 2662 § 2, 2007: Ord. 2268 § 1, 1995)
13.52.110: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
   A.   Notification Of Violation: When the director finds that a user has
violated any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
director may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten
(10) calendar days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for
any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any
action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a notice of violation.
   B.   Compliance Orders: When the director finds that a user has violated any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may
issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the
user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come
into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances
are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   C.   Emergency Suspensions: The director may immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to
present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
      1.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence
its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings of this chapter are initiated against the user.
      2.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show
cause or termination hearing under this chapter.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section.
   D.   Termination Of Discharge: In addition to the provisions of this
chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
      1.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      2.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      3.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      4.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      5.   Violation of the pretreatment standards of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under this chapter why the proposed action
should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar
to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2268
§ 1, 1995)
13.52.120: JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
   A.   Injunctive Relief: When the director finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the director may petition the appropriate court through the city
attorney's office for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action
as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement
for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive
relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against a user.
   B.   Civil Penalties:
      1.   Any user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, an order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a
maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per
day for as long as the violation continues, plus actual damages incurred by the
city. In the case of a monthly or other long term average discharge limit,
penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
      2.   The director may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
      3.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as
justice requires.
      4.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   C.   Criminal Prosecution:
      1.   Any user who violates any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit, an order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by
a fine of not more than the maximum fine and/or imprisonment allowed under
state law per violation, per day.
      2.   Any user who introduces any substance into the POTW which causes
personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor punishable by a fine not more than the maximum fine and/or
imprisonment allowed under state law per violation, per day. This penalty shall
be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property
damage available under state law.
      3.   Any user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations,
or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other
documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter,
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies,
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of
not more than the maximum fine and/or imprisonment allowable under state law
per violation, per day.
   D.   Remedies Nonexclusive: The remedies provided for in this chapter are
not exclusive. The director may take any, all, or any combination of these
actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan.
However, the director may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant user. (Ord. 2268 § 1, 1995)
13.52.130: SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION:
   A.   Performance Bonds: The director may decline to issue or reissue a
wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any
provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless
such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to
exceed a value determined by the director to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance.
   B.   Liability Insurance: The director may decline to issue or reissue a
wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any
provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the
user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient
to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
   C.   Water Supply Severance: Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water
service to the user may be severed. Service shall only recommence, at the
user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
   D.   Public Nuisance: A violation of any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and
shall be corrected or abated as directed by the director. Any person creating a
public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of this code governing such
nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing,
abating or remedying such nuisance. (Ord. 2268 § 1, 1995)
13.52.140: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS:
   A.   Pretreatment Charges And Fees: The city may adopt by resolution
reasonable fees for the reimbursement of its costs of establishing,
implementing and operating the city's pretreatment program which may include,
but are not limited to, the cost of processing wastewater discharge permit
applications for monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures, the review
of monitoring reports submitted by users, for reviewing and responding to
accidental discharge procedures and construction for filing appeals and other
fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements of this
chapter. (Ord. 2268 § 1, 1995)

boundaries shall annex to the city of Redlands as a condition of receiving
water and/or sewer connections to the city's water and/or sewerage system.
(Ord. 2302 § 1, 1996)
13.60.040: PROCESSING DATES:
   A.   For each calendar year, the initial deadline for submitting
applications to the city's municipal utilities department for availability of
water and/or sewer connections shall be January 4 of such year. Applications
may be submitted any time prior to January 4.
   B.   For each calendar year, the second deadline for submitting applications
to the city's municipal utilities department for availability of water and/or
sewer connections shall be June 1 of such year.
   C.   The express intent of the city council for establishing two (2) filing
dates for applications for availability of water and/or sewer connections is:
      1.   To implement the provisions of the voter approved initiative zoning
ordinance proposition "R", as amended by measure "N", and ensure that no more

residential dwelling units constructed outside the city's corporate boundaries;
      2.   To ensure that applications for water and/or sewer connections
outside the city's boundaries are made in good faith and at the times when both
the applicants for projects and the city reasonably believe that the proposed
projects will effect connections to the city's water and/or sewerage system;
and
      3.   To ensure that no project unreasonably impedes the efforts of
another project which, in good faith, is attempting to obtain a water and/or
sewer connection to the city's water and/or sewerage system. (Ord. 2302 § 1,
1996)
13.60.050: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
Water and/or sewer connections shall be made in accordance with the following
provisions:
   A.   Applications for availability of water and/or sewer connections shall
be filed with the municipal utilities department. The applicant shall be the
owner of the property for which the connection is requested, or the authorized
agent of the owner who has the written consent of the owner to file an
application. Submittal of an application shall be accompanied by the payment of
the applicable processing fee in the amount established by the city council.
The processing fee shall not be refundable.
   B.   An application for availability of a water and/or sewer connection
shall expire at the end of the calendar year for which it is filed. A new
application shall be filed, and the applicable fees for reapplication shall be
paid, for each subsequent calendar year during which a water and/or sewer
connection that was the subject of an expired application is sought.
   C.   As a condition of receiving a water and/or sewer connection, the
property upon which the project is located and the proposed use shall be
consistent with the goals and implementing policies of the Redlands general
plan.
   D.   Pursuant to the requirements of CEQA, application shall be made to the
city for environmental review by the city as part of the application for a
water and/or sewer connection and the preannexation agreement required by this
chapter. Submittal of the application for environmental review shall be
accompanied by the payment of the applicable processing fee in the amount
established by the city council. The processing fee shall not be refundable.
   E.   Concurrent with the filing of an application for availability of a
water and/or sewer connection, the applicant shall also make application to the
city community development department for a preannexation agreement. Submittal
of the application for a preannexation agreement shall be accompanied by
payment of the applicable processing fee in the amount as established by the
city council. The processing fee shall not be refundable.
   F.   Water and/or connections shall be distributed to minor projects on a
first come, first served basis. The number of available connections for minor
projects for each year shall be set by resolution of the city council.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no such resolution is adopted for any given
calendar year, the number of available connections for minor projects for such
year shall be equal to the number of available connections for minor projects
established for the previous year.
   G.   Availability for water and/or sewer connections for major projects for
each year shall be set by resolution of the city council. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if no such resolution is adopted for any given calendar year, the
number of available connections for major projects shall be equal to the number
of available connections for major projects established for the previous year.
The availability of water and/or sewer connections shall be issued on a
priority basis for the calendar year. The determination of a major project's
priority for issuance of water and/or sewer availability shall be made by the
municipal utilities director based upon the date of receipt of a completed
application and the applicant's compliance with the requirements of this
chapter.
   H.   Upon the city's receipt of completed applications for a water and/or
sewer connection, environmental review and the preannexation agreement, the
municipal utilities director and community development director shall present
the applications to the city council for its determination on whether the
public health, safety and welfare, and the best interests of the citizens of
Redlands, are served by the city's continued processing of the applications.
Applications for a sewer connection shall be approved only for those projects
receiving domestic water from the city's water system, unless specific findings
are made by the city council that the provision of city sewer service to a
project not receiving city domestic water is in the best interests of the
public health, safety and welfare. In making its determination, the city
council may consider, among other factors:
      1.   The relationship of the property and its proposed use to the city's
general plan and zoning ordinances;
      2.   The relationship of the property and its proposed use to the city's
water and sewer master plans, and the city's water and sewer capital
improvement programs;
      3.   The proximity of the property to the city's boundaries and existing
utility infrastructure;
      4.   The proposed potential for new revenue sources for the city to pay
for city services provided to the project as a result of annexation and
development of the property; and
      5.   The proposed standards for development of the property.
If the determination is made that the project is consistent with the city's
general plan, the municipal utilities director shall continue processing the
application for a water and/or sewer connection. If the project is determined
to be inconsistent with the city's general plan, the municipal utilities
director shall deny the application for a water and/or sewer connection.
   I.   Unless exempt, pursuant to Government Code section 56133 all projects
making application for availability for a water and/or sewer connection shall
also make application to the city for approval of the extension of city utility
services outside city boundaries from LAFCO.
   J.   All projects shall have received final approval from the public agency
having planning approval authority for the project prior to the approval of a
water and/or sewer connection by the city. For purposes of this subsection,
"final approval" shall mean the last discretionary approval required by the
applicant from such public agency to proceed with construction of the
applicant's project.
   K.   In the event a connection to the city's water and/or sewerage system is
not made in the calendar year for which the availability application was
approved, the project shall lose its availability and the applicant shall
resubmit an application for availability in compliance with this chapter,
including making payment of any applicable resubmittal fees, before any water
or sewer connection may be made. (Ord. 2302 § 1, 1996)
13.60.060: AVAILABILITY OF WATER AND/OR SEWER CONNECTIONS:
   A.   All projects applying for availability of water and/or sewer service
connections shall be subject to the following conditions:

      2.   To ensure that operation of the city's water and/or sewerage system
conforms with all requirements of the state department of health services, the
local regional water quality control board and the sound operational policies
of the city, the municipal utilities director may, at his or her discretion,
condition or reject any application that is determined to be contrary to
applicable regulatory requirements and detrimental to the city's water and/or
sewer system. Any decision by the municipal utilities director to condition or
reject an application pursuant to this subsection shall be made in writing to
the applicant. In the event an applicant disagrees with the municipal utilities
director's decision, the applicant may appeal the decision to the city council
by filing a written request therefor with the city clerk of the city within
fourteen (14) days of the date of the written decision of the municipal
utilities director. Upon receipt of the appeal, the city council shall consider
the appeal and either approve, modify or disapprove the decision of the
municipal utilities director.
   B.   The applicant for a water and/or sewer connection shall comply with the
following conditions before a physical connection to the city's water and/or
sewerage system will be permitted, and meters set:

comply with the infrastructure improvement requirements of the municipal
utilities director, make application for and comply with the required
conditions of a construction permit, install the required infrastructure
improvements in accordance with city requirements and specifications, receive
approval of a water and/or sewer service connection and pay all applicable city
fees established by the city council. Such fees shall be those in effect when
the city determines that the applicant is physically ready to connect and the
city has received a written request from the applicant to physically connect to
a city water and/or sewer main. Prepayment of fees is prohibited.
      2.   The owner of the property to be served shall enter into a
preannexation agreement with the city, which shall be subject to recordation in
the official records of the county of San Bernardino and shall constitute a
covenant running with the land, which requires the owner to irrevocably consent
to annexation proceedings and/or commence proceedings to annex the property to
the city at the request of the city, and which requires the payment to the city
of an amount equivalent to all capital improvement and other development fees
which would be applicable to the property if it were within city limits. The
preannexation agreement shall provide, among other things, that in the event
the property is not annexed to the city in accordance with the terms of the
agreement, the owner of the property shall pay each year to the city, as
liquidated damages, a sum equal to the property taxes and any sales taxes the
city would have received had the property been annexed. The preannexation
agreement shall further provide that the failure to make such liquidated
damages payments shall be cause for the city to cease water and/or sewer
service to the project.
      3.   Applicants for water and/or sewer connections made under the
provisions of this chapter shall comply with all rules and regulations
established by the city. (Ord. 2820, 2015: Ord. 2302 § 1, 1996)

the annual amount of availability set by resolution of the city council. All
other applications shall be entitled, in order of their priority and subject to
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, to receive all availability
applied for up to and including the amount of annual availability remaining as
set by resolution of the city council.
      3.   In the event there remains unallocated availability after compliance
with subsection A of this section and this subsection, any remaining
availability shall be distributed to the applicants in accordance with their
respective priority basis until all the amount of annual availability set by
resolution of the city council has been allocated.
   C.   Any application for availability which was subject to the January 4

determination of whether the public health, safety and welfare, and the best
interests of the citizens of Redlands, are served by the city's continued
processing of the applications. Applications for a sewer connection shall be
approved only for those projects receiving domestic water from the city's water
system, unless specific findings are made by the city council that the
provision of city sewerage service to a project not receiving city domestic
water is in the best interests of the public health, safety and welfare. In
making its determination of a project's consistency with the Redlands general
plan, the city council may consider, among other factors:
      1.   The relationship of the property and its proposed use to the city's
general plan and zoning ordinances;
      2.   The relationship of the property and its proposed use to the city's
water and sewer master plans, and the city's water and sewer capital
improvement programs;
      3.   The proximity of the property to the city's boundaries and existing
utility infrastructure;
      4.   The proposed potential for new revenue sources for the city as a
result of annexation and development of the property; and
      5.   The proposed standards for development of the property.
If the determination is made that the project is consistent with the city's
general plan, the municipal utilities director shall continue processing the
application for a water and/or sewer connection. If the project is determined
to be inconsistent with the city's general plan, the municipal utilities
director shall deny the application for a water and/or sewer connection.
   G.   Unless exempt, pursuant to Government Code section 56133 all projects
making application for a water and/or sewer connection shall also make
application to the city for approval of the extension of city utility services
outside city boundaries from LAFCO.
   H.   All projects shall have received final approval from the public agency
having planning approval authority for the project prior to the approval of a
water and/or sewer connection by the city. For purposes of this subsection,
"final approval" shall mean the last discretionary approval required by the
applicant from such public agency to proceed with construction of the
applicant's project. (Ord. 2301 § 1, 1996)
13.62.050: REQUIREMENTS FOR WATER AND/OR SEWER CONNECTIONS:
   A.   All projects applying for water and/or sewer connections shall be
subject to the following conditions:
      1.   The municipal utilities director shall determine the development
requirements, including the infrastructure improvements which must be
constructed and the fees which must be paid for the project, to provide city
potable and nonpotable water and/or sewer connections to the project.
      2.   To ensure that operation of the city's water and/or sewerage system
conforms with all requirements of the state department of health services, the
local regional water quality control board and the operational policies of the
city, the municipal utilities director may, at his or her discretion, condition
or reject any application for a water and/or sewer connection that is
determined to be contrary to applicable regulatory requirements and detrimental
to the city's water or sewerage system. Any decision by the municipal utilities
director to condition or reject an application pursuant to this subsection
shall be made in writing to the applicant. In the event an applicant disagrees
with the municipal utilities director's decision, the applicant may appeal the
decision to the city council by filing a written request therefor with the city
clerk of the city within fourteen (14) days from the date of the written
decision of the municipal utilities director. An appeal of the municipal
utilities director's decision shall be made on the city's form for appeal and
shall be accompanied by payment of the applicable appeal fee. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the city council shall consider the appeal and either approve,
modify or disapprove the decision of the municipal utilities director.
   B.   The applicant for a water and/or sewer connection shall comply with the
following conditions before a physical connection to the city's water and/or
sewerage system will be permitted, and meters set:
      1.   The applicant shall submit for review and approval improvement plans
which comply with the infrastructure improvement requirements of the municipal
utilities director, make application for and comply with the required
conditions of a construction permit for such infrastructure improvements,
install the required infrastructure improvements to provide potable and/or
nonpotable water to the project in accordance with city requirements and
specifications and receive approval for a water and/or sewer connection. The
applicable fees shall be those in effect when the city determines that the
applicant is physically ready to connect the project to the city's water and/or
sewerage system and, the city has received a written request from the applicant
to physically connect to a city water and/or sewer main. Prepayment of fees is
prohibited.
      2.   Prior to, and as a condition of the approval of a physical
connection to the city's water and/or sewerage system, the owner of the
property for which a water and/or sewer connection is sought shall enter into a
preannexation agreement with the city, which shall be subject to recordation,
in the official records of the county of San Bernardino and shall constitute a
covenant running with the land, requiring the owner and the owner's successors
in interest to irrevocably consent to annexation proceedings and/or commence
proceedings to annex the property to the city at the request of the city. The
preannexation agreement shall provide, among other things, that in the event
the property is not annexed to the city in accordance with its terms, the owner
of the property shall pay each year to the city, as liquidated damages, a sum
equal to the property taxes and any sales taxes the city would have received
had the property been annexed. The preannexation agreement shall further
provide that the failure to make such liquidated damages payments shall be
cause for the city to cease water and/or sewer service to the project.
      3.   Applicants for water and/or sewer connections made under the
provisions of this chapter shall comply with all rules and regulations
established by the city. (Ord. 2301 § 1, 1996)

action is a reasonable use of City staff and resources.
   C.   Responsible Entity For Enforcement: Enforcement pursuant to this
chapter may be undertaken by the City Enforcement Official, which may be the
City Manager or their designated entity, legal counsel, or combination thereof.

entities of its obligations under the ordinance.
      3.   For incidences of prohibited container contaminants found in
containers, the City or its designee will issue an informational Notice of
Contamination to any generator found to have prohibited container contaminants
in a container. Such notice will be provided via a cart tag or other
communication immediately upon identification of the prohibited container
contaminants or within ten (10) days after determining that a violation has
occurred. If the City or its designee observes prohibited container
contaminants in a generator's containers on more than two (2) occasions, the
City or its designee may arrange for pick up and disposal of contaminated
containers and assess contamination processing fees (such as return trip fees
and extra pick-up fees) on the generator.
      4.   To address violations of this Chapter, the City shall issue a Notice
of Violation requiring compliance within thirty (30) calendar days after
issuance of the notice, or such shorter reasonable specific time period as the
City Enforcement Official shall assign within which the generator must correct
or otherwise remedy each violation, but in no event less than twenty-four (24)
hours from the date and time the Notice of Violation is issued.
      5.   Absent compliance by the respondent within the deadline set forth in
the Notice of Violation, the City shall commence an action to impose penalties,
via an administrative citation and fine, pursuant to the Chapter/Section
addressing fines and penalties of our MC, unless the City determines compliance
deadline extensions as set forth in Section 13.67.130(f) are found to be
warranted by extenuating circumstances.
   E.   Penalty Amounts For Types Of Violations: The penalty amounts for
violation of this Chapter shall be consistent with the City's Administrative
Remedies Ordinance or fee schedule (Resolution 8045 of the City of Redlands)
and assessed as the rates referenced.
   F.   Compliance Deadline Extension Considerations: The City may extend the
compliance deadlines set forth in a Notice of Violation issued if it finds that
there are extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the respondent that
make compliance within the deadlines impracticable, including the following:
      1.   Acts of God such as earthquakes, wildfires, flooding, and other
emergencies or natural disasters;
      2.   Delays in obtaining discretionary permits or other government agency
approvals; or,
      3.   Deficiencies in organic waste recycling infrastructure or edible
food recovery capacity and the City is under a corrective action plan with
CalRecycle pursuant to 14 CCR Section 18996.2 due to those deficiencies.
   G.   Appeals Process: Persons receiving an administrative citation
containing a penalty for an uncorrected violation may request a hearing to
appeal the citation. A hearing will be held only if it is requested within the
time prescribed and consistent with the City's procedures in the City's codes
for appeals of administrative citations. Evidence may be presented at the
hearing. The City will appoint a hearing officer who shall conduct the hearing
and issue a final written order.
   H.   Education Period For Non-Compliance: Beginning January 1, 2022 and
through December 31, 2023, the City will conduct inspections, route reviews
and/or waste evaluations, and compliance reviews, depending upon the type of
regulated entity, to determine compliance, and if the City determines that
organic waste generator, self-hauler, hauler, tier one commercial edible food
generator, food recovery organization, food recovery service, or other entity
is not in compliance, it shall provide educational materials to the entity
describing its obligations under this chapter and a notice that compliance is
required by January 1, 2022, and that violations may be subject to
administrative civil penalties starting on January 1, 2024.

City determines that an organic waste generator, self-hauler, hauler, Tier One
or Tier Two Commercial Edible Food Generator, food recovery organization, food
recovery service, or other entity is not in compliance with this chapter, it
shall document the noncompliance or violation, issue a Notice of Violation, and
take enforcement action as needed. (Ord. 2945 § 1, 2022)

and persons owning, leasing or controlling land adjacent to such buildings or
structures, shall at all times:
   Maintain an effective fuel modification zone by removing, clearing, or
modifying away combustible vegetation and other flammable materials from areas
within 100 feet from such buildings or structures. (See exception 3 for fire-
resistive construction and other features for approval and/or a reduction of
the fuel modification zone.) The fuel modification zone may be replanted with
either approved irrigated, fire-resistant planting material or approved non-
irrigated, drought-tolerant, fire-resistant plant material. Use of plants,
trees, and/or shrubs on the Redlands fire department wildland urban interface
high fire severity area undesirable list, must be specifically approved by the
fire code official. Use of any of the plantings on the list is subject to
periodic, ongoing inspections by the fire department to ensure proper
maintenance. Inspections may incur fees payable by the property owner. Failure
to maintain the plants and trees on this list in accordance with plan approval
could result in the plants, trees, and/or shrubs being ordered to be removed at
the expense of the property owner. Replanting of the fuel modification zone may
be required for erosion control.
      Exceptions:
      1.   Single specimens of trees, ornamental shrubbery or similar plants
used as ground covers, provided that they do not form a means of rapidly
transmitting fire from the native growth to any structure.

modification zone may be reduced where fire-resistive structures or other
features are constructed. However, in no case shall the fuel modification zone
be reduced to less than 30 feet. See California building code chapter 7A and
international wildland-urban interface code for the minimum requirements of a
fire-resistive structure.
   Remove portions of trees, which extend within 10 feet of the outlet of a
chimney,
   Maintain trees adjacent to or overhanging a building free of deadwood, and
   Maintain the roof of a structure free of leaves, needles or other dead
vegetative growth.
   If the owner fails to correct such conditions, the fire code official is
authorized to cause the same to be done and make the expense of such correction
a lien upon the property where such condition exists.

regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the city of Redlands of San Bernardino County does
hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. (Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and
welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in
specific areas by establishing requirements and restrictions designed to
protect human life and health, minimize expenditure of public money for costly
flood control projects and damage to public facilities and utilities, minimize
the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public, maintain a stable tax base by
providing for the sound use and development of areas of special hazards so as
to minimize future flood blight areas and ensure that potential buyers are
notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard. (Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.020: DEFINITIONS:
The following words shall have the meanings ascribed to them:
   ACCESSORY USE: A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal
use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
   ALLUVIAL FAN: A geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan shaped
deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from
mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley
floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris
flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.
   APEX: The point of highest elevation on an alluvial fan, which on
undisturbed fans is generally the point where the major stream that formed the
fan emerges from the mountain front.
   APPEAL: A request for a review of the chief building official's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance
rate map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to three feet (3'),
a clearly defined channel does not exist, the path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate, and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   BASE FLOOD: A flood which has a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). Base flood is
the term used throughout this chapter.
   BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings, structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCROACHMENT: The advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill,
excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain
which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM): The official map on which the
federal emergency management agency or federal insurance administration has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the floodway.
   FLOOD, FLOODING, OR FLOODWATER: A. A general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of
inland or tidal waters, the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface
waters from any source, and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and
   B.   The condition resulting from flood related erosion.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP: The official map on which the federal emergency
management agency or federal insurance administration has delineated the areas
of flood hazards.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map on which the federal
emergency management agency or federal insurance administration has delineated
both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk of premium zones
applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal insurance
administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the
flood boundary and floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: The city's chief building official.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing,
where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited
to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: This chapter, subdivision regulations,
building codes, health regulations, ordinances (such as grading and erosion
control) and other applications of police power regulations which control
development in flood prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local
regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing
and reducing flood loss and damage.
   FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD PRONE AREA: Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source (see definition of Flood, Flooding, Or Floodwater).
   FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1')
(referred to as "regulatory floodway").
   FLOODWAY FRINGE: That area of the floodplain on either side of the
"regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION: As related to sections
15.32.180 and
15.32.190 of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud
on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city will
consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government
responsibilities and remains a part of the city for fifty (50) to one hundred
(100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base
flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage
from floods, while future owners of the property and the city as a whole are
subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those
increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the
property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be
insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water.
   GOVERNING BODY: The city council of the city of Redlands that is empowered
to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and
general welfare of its citizenry.
   HARDSHIP: As related to section
15.32.190 of this chapter, means the exceptional hardship that would result
from a failure to grant a requested variance. The city council requires that
the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved.
Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience,
aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the
disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an
exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means
without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or
requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different
use than originally intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
   A.   Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a
listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined
by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the national register;
   B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district;
   C.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states
with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary
of the interior; or
   D.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior or
directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs.
   LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including
basement (see definition of Basement), for:
   A.   An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that
is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area
other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor
provided it conforms to applicable nonelevation design requirements, but not
limited to:
      1.   The wet floodproofing standard in subsection
15.32.110C of this chapter;
      2.   The anchoring standards in subsection
15.32.110A of this chapter;
      3.   The construction materials and methods standards in subsection
15.32.110B of this chapter; and
      4.   The standards for utilities in section
15.32.120 of this chapter.
   B.   Residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as
they are considered to be basements (see definition of Basement). This
prohibition includes below grade garages and storage areas.
   MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE: The cost to replace the structure in new condition and
adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued
since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure
shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a
building cost estimation guide recognized by the building construction
industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account
the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence
as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or
other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued
depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost
estimation guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a
report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by
written explanation of the differences.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevation shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced.
   MINIMUM NECESSARY: To afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter.
   MUDSLIDE (MUDFLOW) PRONE AREA: An area with land surfaces and slopes of
unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a
potential for mudflow.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, means structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of
floodplain management regulations adopted by this community, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this city.
   OBSTRUCTION: Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building,
wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill structure, vegetation or other material
in, along, across or projection into any watercourse which may alter, impede,
retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to
its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of
water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE: As related to section
15.32.190 of this chapter, means that the granting of a variance must not
result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire
community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully
obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable
lake or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:
   A.   Built on a single chassis;
   B.   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULATORY FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot
(1').
   REMEDY A VIOLATION: To bring a structure or other development into
compliance with state and local floodplain management regulations, or, if that
is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts
may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development
from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal
financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
   RIVERINE: Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream or brook.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): An area in the floodplain subject to a one
percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year and is shown on an
FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, or AH.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and other proposed
new development and means the date the building permit was issued; provided,
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180)
days of the permit date. The "actual start" means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of manufactured home on a
foundation. "Permanent construction" does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling, the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include the excavation of basements, footings, piers or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground;
including a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure.
   VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this
chapter.
   VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, other certification, or other evidence of compliance
required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or the datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas.
   WATERCOURSE: A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur. (Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.030: APPLICABILITY OF CHAPTER PROVISIONS:
This chapter applies to all areas of special flood hazards within the
jurisdiction of the city. (Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.040: ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD:
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal insurance
administration (FIA) of the federal emergency management agency (FEMA) in the
flood insurance study (FIS) dated July 3, 1978, and the flood insurance rate
map (FIRMs) and flood boundary and floodway maps (FBFMs), dated January 3,
1979, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are adopted by reference
and declared to be a part of this chapter. This flood insurance study (FIS) and
attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may
be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this
chapter and which are recommended to the city council by the chief building
official. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at 35 Cajon Street, Suite 20,
department of building and safety. (Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.050: COMPLIANCE REQUIRED:
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted or altered without full compliance with the provisions of this
chapter and other applicable regulations. Any violations of the provisions of
this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing in this chapter shall
prevent the city from taking any action necessary to prevent or remedy a
violation. (Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.060: ABROGATION OR GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflicts or
overlaps, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.070: INTERPRETATION:
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be
considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the city
and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes. (Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.080: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on occasions and flood heights
may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that
land outside the areas of special flood hazards, or uses permitted within such
areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not
create liability on the part of the city, any elected official, officer or
employee thereof, the state of California, or the federal insurance
administration, federal emergency management agency, for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any rule or regulation made pursuant to
this chapter. (Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.090: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT; REQUIRED; APPLICATION:
A development permit shall be obtained before construction or development
begins within any area of special flood hazard. Application for a development
permit shall be made on forms furnished by the chief building official and may
include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the
nature, location, dimensions and elevation of the area in question; existing or
proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities and the
location of the foregoing; provided, however, the following information is

floor (including basement) of all structures; and
      2.   For a crawl space foundation, located and total net area of
foundation opening as required in section
15.32.110 of this chapter; and
      3.   For foundations placed on fill, the location and height of fill, and
compaction requirements (compacted to 95 percent using the standard proctor
test method); and
   C.   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
nonresidential structure will be floodproofed, as required in section
15.32.110 of this chapter; and

15.32.110 of this chapter; and
   E.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development. (Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.100: CHIEF BUILDING OFFICIAL; DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
The chief building official, as the designated floodplain administrator, shall
administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying
development permits in accordance with its provisions and the chief building
official duties and responsibilities shall include, but not be limited to:
   A.   Permit Review:
      1.   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
      2.   Ensure that all other state and federal permits have been obtained;
      3.   Determine that the site is reasonably safe from flooding; and
      4.   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely
affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point.
   B.   Review, Use And Development Of Other Base Flood Data:
      1.   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance
with section
15.32.040 of this chapter, the chief building official shall obtain, review and
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state or other sources, or if no base flood elevation data is available from a
federal or state agency or other source, in order to administer section
15.32.110 of this chapter. Any such information shall be submitted to the city
for adoption; or
      2.   If no base flood elevation data is available from a federal or state
agency or other source, then a base flood elevation shall be obtained using one
of the two (2) methods from the FEMA publication "Managing Floodplain
Development In Approximate Zone A Areas-A Guide Of Obtaining And Developing
Base (100-Year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995, in order to administer
section
15.32.110 of this chapter.
         a.   Simplified method:
            (1)   100-year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the
appropriate regression equation found in a U.S. geological survey publication,
or the discharge-drainage area method; and
            (2)   Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the Quick-
2 computer program developed by FEMA; or
         b.   Detail method:
            (1)   100-year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the
U.S. army corps of engineers' HEC-HMS computer program; and
            (2)   Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the U.S. army
corps of engineers' HEC-RAS computer program.
   C.   Notification Of Other Agencies:
      1.   In alteration or relocation of a watercourse:
         a.   Notify adjacent communities and the California department of
water resources prior to alteration or relocation;
         b.   Submit evidence of such notification to the FEMA; and
         c.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
      2.   Base Flood Elevation Changes Due To Physical Alterations:
         a.   Within six (6) months of information becoming available or
project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall
submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data
to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
         b.   All LOMR’s for flood control projects are approved prior to the
issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on
Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR’s). Approved CLOMR’s allow
construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as
specified in the “start of construction” definition.
      Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those
physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and
floodplain management requirements are based on current data.
      3.   Changes In Corporate Boundaries:
         a.   Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have
been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the
community clearly delineating the new corporate limits.
   D.   Documentation Of Floodplain Development: Obtain and maintain for public
inspection and make available as needed the following:
      1.   Certification required by sections
15.32.110 and
15.32.140 of this chapter (lowest floor elevations);
      2.   Certification required by subsection
15.32.110C4 of this chapter (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential
structures);
      3.   Certification of elevation required by subsection
15.32.110C5 of this chapter (wet floodproofing standards);
      4.   Certification of elevation required by section
15.32.130, "Subdivision Standards", of this chapter;
      5.   Certification required by section
15.32.160 of this chapter (floodway encroachments);
      6.   Reports required by section
 15.32.170 of this chapter (mudflow standards).
   E.   Map Determinations: Make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact
location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example,
where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions). Any person contesting the location of a boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in sections
15.32.180 and
15.32.190 of this chapter.
   F.   Remedial Action: Take action to remedy violations of this chapter.
(Ord. 2914 § 1 (part), 2020; Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.110: CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS:
In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:

them or contamination from them during flooding. (Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.130: SUBDIVISION STANDARDS:
   A.   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the special flood
hazard area and the elevation of the base flood.
   B.   All final subdivision plans shall provide the elevation of proposed
structures and pads. If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the
lowest floor and pad elevation shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer or surveyor and provided to the chief building official.
   C.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage.
   D.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
   E.   All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to
flood hazards. (Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.140: STANDARDS FOR MANUFACTURED HOMES:
   A.   All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within
zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map, on sites
located: 1) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 2) in a new
manufactured home park or subdivision; 3) in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; 4) in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage"
as the result of a flood, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that
the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to at least two feet (2')
above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement.
   B.   All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH,

verification shall be provided to the chief building official. (Ord. 2837,
2016)
15.32.150: STANDARDS FOR RECREATIONAL VEHICLES:
All recreational vehicles placed on sites within a floodplain shown on the
city's flood insurance rate map will either:
   A.   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days;
   B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is
ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has

anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in section
15.32.140 of this chapter. (Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.160: FLOODWAYS:
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section
15.32.040 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Because the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters
which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
   A.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in the base flood levels during the occurrence
of the base flood discharge.
   B.   If the above is satisfied, all new construction, substantial
improvements, and proposed development shall comply with all other applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.170: MUDSLIDE (MUDFLOW) PRONE AREAS:
   A.   The chief building official shall review permits for proposed
construction of other development to determine if it is proposed within a
mudslide area.
   B.   Permits shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed site and
improvement will be reasonably safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be
considered in making this determination include, but are not limited to: 1) the
type and quality of soils; 2) evidence of groundwater or surface water
problems; 3) depth and quality of any fill; 4) overall slope of the site; 5)
weight that any proposed development will impose on the slope.
   C.   Within areas which may have mudslide hazards, the chief building
official shall require that: 1) a site investigation and further review be made
by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering; 2) the proposed grading,
excavation, new construction, and substantial improvement be adequately
designed and protected against mudslide damages; 3) the proposed grading,
excavation, new construction, and substantial improvement not aggravate the
existing hazard by creating either on site or off site disturbances; 4)
drainage, planting, watering, and maintenance not endanger slope stability.
(Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.180: APPEAL BOARD:
   A.   The planning commission shall hear and decide the appeals and requests
for variances from the requirements of this chapter when it is alleged that
there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the
chief building official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
In passing upon such applications, the planning commission shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
provisions of this chapter, and:
      1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      2.   The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      5.   The necessity for the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      6.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      9.   The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and
      11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system, and streets and bridges.
   B.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the regulatory flood elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the
chief building official in the office of the county recorder for San Bernardino
County and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of
title to the affected parcel of land.
   C.   Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the
purposes of this chapter, the planning commission may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter. The chief building official shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the federal insurance administration upon
request. (Ord. 2837, 2016)
15.32.190: VARIANCE CONDITIONS:
   A.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-
half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing sections
15.32.090 through
15.32.170 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing
the variance increases.
   B.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of historic structures listed in the national register of historic
places or the state inventory of historic places, upon a determination that the
proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
   C.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   D.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   E.   Variances shall be issued upon:
      1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      3.   A determination that the granting of a variance would not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of, the
public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   F.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of this chapter are
satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and creates no additional
threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
   G.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
      1.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage; and
      2.   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain
administrator in the Office of the San Bernardino County Recorder and shall be
recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected
parcel of land.
   H.   The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency. (Ord. 2914 § 1 (part), 2020; Ord. 2837, 2016)

ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS
15.36.010: SHORT TITLE:
This chapter shall be known as the SIGN CODE. (Ord. 2552 § 1, 2004)
15.36.020: INTENT AND PURPOSE:
   A.   This chapter establishes regulations for the erection, maintenance and
use of signs and other exterior advertising media within the City to:
      1.   Safeguard and enhance property values;
      2.   Protect public and private investment in buildings and open spaces;
      3.   Improve the appearance of the City as a place in which to live and
work, and as an attraction to nonresidents who come to visit or trade;
      4.   Encourage sound signing practices as an aid to business, and to
provide information to the traveling public;
      5.   Prevent excessive and confusing sign displays;
      6.   Reduce hazards to motorists and pedestrians; and
      7.   Promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   B.   The City has a reputation as a community of natural beauty rendering it
highly attractive to visitors and potential future residents. The City Council
has determined that the natural, traditional and manmade advantages of the City
substantially contribute to the residential character of the community and to
its aesthetic, cultural and economic values. The unregulated and uncontrolled
erection and maintenance of signs, billboards and advertising structures
results in a gaudy and garish atmosphere that would be out of harmony with the
fine attributes and excellent character of the City. The City Council further
determines that the lack of regulation and control of signs results in costly
and unfair competition for the public eye through the proliferation, increased
height, and size of signs, and that the safety of the general public requires
that the structural elements and location of signs be regulated.
   C.   The reasonable and proper regulation of signs and advertising
structures is conducive to the fullest enjoyment by the people of the community
of natural and traditional advantages, and necessary to prevent depreciation of
property values, and the regulation of signs results in a more fair and
equitable public exposure of the advertising displays of all businesses, large
and small, and that the appearance of the commercial areas will be protected.
   D.   It is also the intent of this chapter to recognize that the eventual
elimination of existing signs that do not conform with the provisions of this
chapter is as important as is prohibiting new signs that would violate these
regulations. (Ord. 2552 § 1, 2004)
15.36.030: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all zones established by
title 18 of this Code. Except as noted below, a "sign", as defined in this
chapter, may be affixed, erected, constructed, placed, established, mounted or
maintained only in compliance with the standards, procedures and other
requirements of this chapter. The standards regarding number and size of signs
regulated by this chapter are maximum standards, unless otherwise stated. In
those areas of the City where specific plan sign standards or sign programs
have been adopted by ordinance or resolution, those sign standards or sign
programs shall apply; provided, however, the "substitution" provisions of this
section shall apply to such programs and plans. This chapter shall not apply to
the following signs:
      1.   Signs which are not visible from any public vehicular or pedestrian
right of way;
      2.   Signs required by federal or state law which do not exceed the
minimum number and dimensional requirements of such law;
      3.   Signs and advertising for the California state lottery as authorized
by Government Code section 8800 et seq.;
      4.   Signs containing a maximum area of two (2) square feet or less;
      5.   Holiday decorations and lights;
      6.   Flags and any other insignia of any government that do not display a
commercial message and are attached to poles; provided that no more than three
(3) flags/poles are permitted on property containing less than one acre of
land, and no more than six (6) flags/poles are permitted on property containing
more than one acre of land. Poles for flags and insignia shall not exceed
thirty feet (30') in height and flags shall not exceed forty two (42) square
feet in surface area. Such flags shall be maintained in good condition and free
of tattering or tearing. The city has a compelling interest in permitting the
identification of government facilities;
      7.   Street address signs. The city has a compelling interest in
permitting such signs to promote the identification of property to guide
emergency response personnel; provided such signs shall not exceed two (2)
square feet in area or the size required by the city's fire department,
whichever is greater;
      8.   Official traffic signs or other municipal directional signs, legal
notices, advertisements prescribed by law and placed by governmental entities,
and signs indicating the location of buried utility lines or any notices posted
by a governmental officer in the scope of the officer's duty. The city has a
compelling interest in permitting such signs to comply with state and local
laws and to promote public safety;
      9.   Memorial tablets and identification plaques installed by a
recognized governmental historical agency. The city has a compelling interest
in permitting such signs to promote interest in historical structures and
events and to promote public safety and identification;
      10.   Time and temperature signs containing no advertising copy. The city
has a compelling interest in permitting such signs to promote awareness of
local conditions for individuals with medical problems;
      11.   Signs not exceeding two (2) square feet and carried by individuals
who are standing, sitting or traveling along any public sidewalk or other
public property;
      12.   Signs located on city owned property;
      13.   Signs located in the interior of a building or enclosed area;
      14.   Signs designated by the city as a historic resource, provided that
the original verbiage, symbols and structure of the sign are retained.
   B.   All sign programs that were approved prior to the effective date hereof
are subject only to the "substitution" provisions of this section; provided,
however, that if any such sign program is proposed for amendment to increase
overall sign area allowed, then the sign program shall be amended to conform
with all development and design standards of this chapter.
   C.   In each instance, and under the same conditions in which this chapter
permits any sign, a sign containing an ideological, political or other
noncommercial message of the same dimensions shall be permitted. Noncommercial
messages may be placed on any sign otherwise permitted by this chapter.
   D.   Real estate signs may be placed as authorized by Civil Code section 713
et seq., provided they shall comply with the type, number, area, height,
special restrictions and permitting requirements applicable to temporary signs
in the zoning district in which the real estate sign is located. (Ord. 2552 §
1, 2004)

[https://export.amlegal.com/media/83e6f9bede83de1bc7971dbe4caa0435d5d7cb31/
IMAGES/0-0-0-42.png]
      2.   For signs whose shape is irregular (such as individual letters
placed on a wall or a monument sign), the area shall be measured by enclosing
the sign elements within up to eight (8) straight, intersecting lines.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/83e6f9bede83de1bc7971dbe4caa0435d5d7cb31/
IMAGES/0-0-0-44.png]
   B.   Where a sign has two (2) faces, the area of the largest sign face shall
be included in determining the area of the sign, so long as the two (2) sides
are within five degrees (5°) of parallel.
Where a sign has two (2) or more faces which are more than five degrees (5°)
from parallel, the sign area shall be computed as the sum of the area of each
sign face.
   C.   The area of spherical, cylindrical, or other three-dimensional signs
shall be measured by calculating the area of an elevation drawing of the sign.
   D.   Where a sign contains a frame, background, or other material used to
differentiate the sign from the background on which it is placed, the sign area
shall be measured to include the entire frame, background, or other material.
   E.   The area of a monument sign which is supported by a base which is
architecturally distinct from the sign face itself shall not include the area
of the base. See figure 11 of this section.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/83e6f9bede83de1bc7971dbe4caa0435d5d7cb31/
IMAGES/0-0-0-46.png]
   F.   The supports of a pedestal sign shall not be included in the area of a
sign, unless they form an integral part of the sign face.
   G.   The following standards shall be used to determine the area of signs
containing multiple elements. Figure 12 herein illustrates these measurement
methods.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/83e6f9bede83de1bc7971dbe4caa0435d5d7cb31/
IMAGES/0-0-0-48.png]
      1.   Regardless of their spacing, the letters forming a word or name
shall be considered a single sign.
      2.   When two (2) or more separate items in a sign (such as a word and a
logo) are separated horizontally or vertically by less than twice the width or
height of the largest item, the items shall be considered a single sign, and
the area shall be determined by measuring the area enclosed by a perimeter
enclosing all of the items.
      3.   When two (2) or more separate items (such as a word and a logo) are
separated horizontally or vertically by more than twice the width or height of
the largest item, the items shall be considered two (2) signs, and the area of
each item shall be determined individually.
   H.   For signs placed on an awning or other translucent surface lighted from
below or behind (other than a window), the sign area shall be calculated to

that the preservation of these structures will promote the general welfare by
maintaining an invaluable link to the City's rich and distinguished past. The
City's permit procedures for demolishing structures therefore recognize that
the City's historic structures should be preserved and, that if a structure is
approved for demolition, mitigation measures and conditions should be
considered and imposed prior to the demolition which provide the opportunity
for persons to rescue potentially historic structures from destruction by
purchasing the structure's site, relocating the structure, or otherwise
preserving for posterity the historic and cultural significance of the
structure. (Ord. 2899 §5, 2019)
15.44.030: APPLICABILITY:

significance and demolition of the structure is determined to be exempt from
the preparation of a negative declaration or environmental impact report under
CEQA, the Director shall thereafter issue the demolition permit in accordance
with this Code.
      2.   If the Director determines that the structure may have historical
significance and/or that its demolition requires the preparation of a negative
declaration or an environmental impact report under CEQA, the demolition permit
application shall be referred to the City's Historic and Scenic Preservation
Commission for further review and action. (  (Ord. 2899 §5, 2019)
15.44.070: HISTORIC AND SCENIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION REVIEW:
   A.   Demolition permit applications for structures fifty (50) years of age
and older shall be scheduled for review by the Historic and Scenic Preservation
Commission, and an initial study shall be prepared in accordance with CEQA by
City staff. Notice of the commission's meeting shall be given to the applicant
and the public in accordance with the City's guidelines implementing CEQA.
Review of such applications shall occur in accordance with subsections B and C
of this section.
   B.   Upon referral of a demolition permit application from the Director, the
Historic and Scenic Preservation Commission shall schedule the application for
review, with at least ten (10) days' prior written notice provided to the
applicant and the public. A report shall be prepared by the City's Historic
Preservation Officer regarding the application and, if the structure proposed
for demolition is part of a Fire Department training exercise, a representative
of the Fire Department shall also review and sign the report as "concurring"
with its contents prior to its distribution to the Historic and Scenic
Preservation Commission. A copy of the report shall be provided to the
applicant.
   C.   The Historic and Scenic Preservation Commission shall determine the
potential historical significance of the structure and the need for any further
environmental review, and make its own determinations whether the structure is
historically significant and/or subject to further environmental review under
CEQA. The commission may then subsequently approve, condition or deny the
permit application after completion of any required environmental review.
Following action by the commission, the Historic Preservation Officer shall
notify the applicant (and in the case of a fire training exercise, the Fire
Chief) in writing of the determination of the commission and the applicant's
right of appeal pursuant to section
15.44.080 of this chapter.
      1.   If the commission determines that the structure has no historical
significance and the permit application is approved, the application shall be
exempt from further review by the City under this chapter unless an appeal is
made to the City Council. If no appeal is filed within the time provided for by
this chapter, the Community Development Department shall thereafter issue the
demolition permit in accordance with this Code.
      2.   If the commission determines that the structure has historical
significance, the commission shall conduct the appropriate environmental review
and subsequently approve, condition or deny the application.  (Ord. 2899 §5,
2019)
15.44.080: APPEAL OF COMMISSION DECISION:
   A.   Any person may appeal a decision of the Historic and Scenic
Preservation Commission to the City Council. The person making the appeal shall
file the same within ten (10) days of the date of the commission's decision
with the City Clerk. The appeal shall be in writing, on the form provided by
the City Clerk, and shall be accompanied by payment of the applicable fees.
Upon receiving a request for an appeal to the City Council, the City Clerk
shall notify the applicant for the demolition permit, in writing, and shall
place the appeal on the agenda for the next regular Council meeting scheduled
to be held at least ten (10) days after the date on which the appeal is
received.
   B.   At the appeal, the City Council shall hear testimony from the
applicant, staff and the public concerning the historical, architectural or
cultural significance of the structure. After considering the determination by
the commission, together with all testimony from interested persons, the City
Council shall confirm, modify or reject the decision of the commission.
   C.   After hearing testimony at the public hearing, if the City Council
determines that the demolition of the structure is justified, the permit to
demolish the structure shall be issued in accordance with this Code. If the
City Council determines, after hearing evidence at the public hearing, that the
demolition shall be postponed as ordered by the commission, the demolition
permit shall not be issued until expiration of the period for delay imposed by
the commission. The decision of the City Council shall be final.  (Ord. 2899
§5, 2019)
15.44.090: MITIGATION MEASURES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL:
   A.   The City shall identify potentially feasible measures to mitigate
significant adverse changes in the significance of a historical resource. The
City shall ensure that any adopted mitigation measures to mitigate or avoid
significant adverse changes are fully enforceable through permit conditions,
agreements or other measures. In rendering any decision under this chapter, the
City recognizes that a project which is mitigated or conditioned to follow the
Secretary of the Interior's "Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties
With Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and Reconstructing
Historic Buildings"; or the Secretary of the Interior's "Standards for
Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings" (1995),
Weeks and Grimmer, shall be considered as mitigated to a level of less than a
significant impact on the historical resource.
   B.   In addition to any mitigation measures that might be imposed pursuant
to the authority of CEQA, the City shall have the right to reasonably condition
the issuance of a demolition permit to further the goals of this chapter and to
protect the public health, safety and welfare interests of its citizens.
   C.   If a demolition permit application is conditioned by the imposition of
a delay of its issuance, the City shall reasonably cooperate with the applicant
and the owner of the structure for the purposes of saving the structure through
purchase of the property, relocating the structure, or by any other means to
rescue the structure from demolition, in the shortest time possible. The City
shall make every reasonable effort to provide for the preservation of the
structure, but nothing in this chapter shall require the City to purchase,
relocate or otherwise expend City funds in connection with the efforts to save

15.54.010: PURPOSE:
   A.   The city council of the city of Redlands finds:
      1.   That the waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject
to ever increasing demands;
      2.   That the continuation of California's economic prosperity is
dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses;
      3.   That it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and
efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource;
      4.   That landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California
by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to
the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire
protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development;
      5.   That landscape design, installation, maintenance and management can
and should be water efficient; and
      6.   That section 2 of Article X of the California constitution specifies
that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for
the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to
waste or unreasonable method of use.
   B.   Consistent with the legislative findings, the purpose of the model
ordinance codified in this chapter is to:
      1.   Promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that
integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water;
      2.   Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing,
maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and
rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that
requires cross-sector collaboration of industry, government and property owners
to achieve the many benefits possible;
      3.   Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste
prevention for existing landscapes;
      4.   Use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied
water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the
lowest practical amount;
      5.   Promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with
neighboring local and regional agencies;
      6.   Encourage local agencies and water purveyors to use economic
incentives that promote the efficient use of water, such as implementing a
tiered-rate structure; and
      7.   Encourage local agencies to designate the necessary authority that
implements and enforces the provisions of the model water efficient landscape
ordinance or its local landscape ordinance.
   C.   Landscapes that are planned, designed, installed, managed and
maintained with the watershed based approach can improve California's
environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals.
Such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of
climatic extremes. Consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of this
chapter, conditions in the urban setting will be improved by:
      1.   Creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing
compaction, incorporating organic matter that increases water retention, and
promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage, oxygen
production, shade, habitat and esthetic benefits.
      2.   Minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements,
reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides, and planting
climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas.
      3.   Conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater
wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that need minimal
supplemental water after establishment.
      4.   Protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment use and
landfill disposal trips, selecting recycled and locally sourced materials, and
using compost, mulch and efficient irrigation equipment to prevent erosion.
      5.   Protecting existing habitat and creating new habitat by choosing
local native plants, climate adapted non-natives and avoiding invasive plants.
Utilizing integrated pest management with least toxic methods as the first
course of action. (Ord. 2917, 2021: Ord. 2724 § 1, 2009)
15.54.020: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   This chapter shall apply to all of the following landscape projects:
      1.   New construction projects with an aggregate landscape area equal to
or greater than five hundred (500) square feet requiring a building or
landscape permit, plan check or design review;
      2.   Rehabilitated landscape projects with an aggregate landscape area
equal to or greater than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet
requiring a building or landscape permit, plan check, or design review;
      3.   Existing landscapes limited to sections
15.54.230,
15.54.240 and
15.54.250; and
      4.   Cemeteries. Recognizing the special landscape management needs of
cemeteries, new and rehabilitated cemeteries are limited to sections
15.54.080,
15.54.150 and
15.54.160; and existing cemeteries are limited to sections
15.54.230,
15.54.240 and
15.54.250.
   B.   For local land use agencies working together to develop a regional
water efficient landscape ordinance, the reporting requirements of the
ordinance codified in this chapter became effective December 1, 2015, and the
remainder of such ordinance as effective no later than February 1, 2016.
   C.   Any project with an aggregate landscape area of two thousand five
hundred (2,500) square feet or less may comply with the performance
requirements of this chapter or conform to the prescriptive measures contained
in section
15.54.310, Appendix D.
   D.   This chapter does not apply to:
      1.   Registered local, state or federal historical sites;
      2.   Ecological restoration projects that do not require a permanent
irrigation system;
      3.   Mined land reclamation projects that do not require a permanent
irrigation system; or
      4.   Existing plant collections, as part of botanical gardens and
arboretums open to the public. (Ord. 2917, 2021: Ord. 2724 § 1, 2009)

damage or malfunction are required for all on non-residential landscapes and
residential landscapes of five thousand (5,000) square feet or larger.
         h.   Master shut-off valves are required on all projects except
landscapes that make use of technologies that allow for the individual control
of sprinklers that are individually pressurized in a system equipped with low
pressure shut down features.
         i.   The irrigation system shall be designed to prevent runoff, low
head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where irrigation water
flows onto nontargeted areas, such as adjacent property, nonirrigated areas,
hardscapes, roadways, or structures.
         j.   Relevant information from the soil management plan, such as soil
type and infiltration rate, shall be utilized when designing irrigation
systems.
         k.   The design of the irrigation system shall conform to the
hydrozones of the landscape design plan.
         l.   The irrigation system must be designed and installed to meet, at

the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, American Society of
Agricultural and Biological Engineers’/International Code Council’s (ASABE/ICC)
802-2014 “Landscape Irrigation Sprinkler and Emitter Standard.” All sprinkler
heads installed in the landscape must document a distribution uniformity low
quarter of 0.65 or higher using the protocol defined in ASABE/ICC 802-2014.
         n.   It is highly recommended that the project applicant or city
inquire with the local water purveyor about peak water operating demands (on
the water supply system) or water restrictions that may impact the
effectiveness of the irrigation system.
         o.   In mulched planting areas, the use of low volume irrigation is
required to maximize water infiltration into the root zone.
         p.   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall have matched
precipitation rates, unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer's
recommendations.
         q.   Head to head coverage is recommended. However, sprinkler spacing

heads where low point drainage could occur.
         t.   Areas less than ten (10) feet in width in any direction shall be
irrigated with subsurface irrigation or other means that produces no runoff or
overspray.
         u.   Overhead irrigation shall not be permitted within twenty four
inches (24") of any nonpermeable surface. Allowable irrigation within the
setback from nonpermeable surfaces may include drip, drip line, or other low
flow nonspray technology. The setback area may be planted or unplanted. The
surfacing of the setback may be mulch, gravel, or other porous material. These
restrictions may be modified if:
            (1)   The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no
runoff occurs; or
            (2)   The adjacent nonpermeable surfaces are designed and
constructed to drain entirely to landscaping; or
            (3)   The irrigation designer specifies an alternative design or
technology, as part of the landscape documentation package and clearly
demonstrates strict adherence to irrigation system design criteria in
subsection A1i of this section. Prevention of overspray and runoff must be
confirmed during the irrigation audit.
         v.   Slopes greater than twenty five percent (25%) shall not be
irrigated with an irrigation system with a application rate exceeding 0.75
inches per hour. This restriction may be modified if the landscape designer
specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the landscape
documentation package, and clearly demonstrates no runoff or erosion will
occur. Prevention of runoff and erosion must be confirmed during the irrigation
audit.
      2.   Hydrozone:
         a.   Each valve shall irrigate a hydrozone with similar site, slope,
sun exposure, soil conditions, and plant materials with similar water use.
         b.   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall be selected
based on what is appropriate for the plant type within that hydrozone.
         c.   Where feasible, trees shall be placed on separate valves from
shrubs, ground covers, and turf to facilitate the appropriate irrigation of
trees. The mature size and extent of the root zone shall be considered when
designing irrigation for the tree.
         d.   Individual hydrozones that mix plants of moderate and low water
use, or moderate and high water use, may be allowed if:
            (1)   Plant factor calculation is based on the proportions of the
respective plant water uses and their plant factor; or
            (2)   The plant factor of the higher water using plant is used for
calculations.
         e.   Individual hydrozones that mix high and low water use plants
shall not be permitted.
         f.   On the landscape design plan and irrigation design plan,
hydrozone areas shall be designated by number, letter, or other designation. On
the irrigation design plan, designate the areas irrigated by each valve, and
assign a number to each valve. Use this valve number in the hydrozone
information table (see appendix B, section A). This table can also assist with
the irrigation audit and programming the controller.
   B.   The irrigation design plan, at a minimum, shall contain:
      1.   Location and size of separate water meters for landscape;
      2.   Location, type and size of all components of the irrigation system,
including controllers, main and lateral lines, valves, sprinkler heads,
moisture sensing devices, rain switches, quick couplers, pressure regulators,
and backflow prevention devices;

(i.e. production home developments) an auditing rate of 1 in 7 lots or
approximately fifteen percent (15%) will satisfy this requirement.
   C.   For new construction and rehabilitated landscape projects installed
after December 1, 2015, as described in section
15.54.050:
      1.   The project applicant shall submit an irrigation audit report with
the certificate of completion to the city that may include, but is not limited
to: inspection, system tune-up, system test with distribution uniformity,
reporting overspray or run off that causes overland flow, and preparation of an
irrigation schedule, including configuring irrigation controllers with
application rate, soil types, plant factors, slope, exposure and any other
factors necessary for accurate programming;
      2.   The city shall administer programs that may include, but not be
limited to, irrigation water use analysis, irrigation audits, and irrigation
surveys for compliance with the maximum applied water allowance. (Ord. 2917,
2021: Ord. 2724 § 1, 2009)
15.54.170: IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY:
For the purpose of determining estimated total water use, average irrigation
efficiency is assumed to be 0.75 for overhead spray devices and 0.81 for drip
system devices. (Ord. 2917, 2021: Ord. 2724 § 1, 2009)

use met entirely by graywater. (Ord. 2917, 2021)
15.54.200: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND RAINWATER RETENTION:
   A.   Stormwater management practices minimize runoff and increase
infiltration which recharges groundwater and improves water quality.
Implementing stormwater best management practices into the landscape and
grading design plans to minimize runoff and to increase on site retention and
infiltration are encouraged.
   B.   Project applicants shall refer to the city or regional water quality
control board for information on any applicable stormwater technical
requirements.
   C.   All planted landscape areas are required to have friable soil to
maximize water retention and infiltration. Refer to section
15.54.100A3.
   D.   It is strongly recommended that landscape areas be designed for capture
and infiltration capacity that is sufficient to prevent runoff from impervious
surfaces (i.e. roof and paved areas) from either: the one inch, 24-hour rain
event or the 85th percentile, 24-hour rain event, and/or additional capacity as
required by any applicable local, regional, state or federal regulation.
   E.   It is recommended that storm water projects incorporate any of the
following elements to improve on-site storm water and dry weather runoff
capture and use:
      1.   Grade impervious surfaces, such as driveways, during construction to
drain to vegetated areas.
      2.   Minimize the area of impervious surfaces such as paved areas, roof
and concrete driveways.
      3.   Incorporate pervious or porous surfaces (e.g., gravel, permeable
pavers or blocks, pervious or porous concrete) that minimize runoff.
      4.   Direct runoff from paved surfaces and roof areas into planting beds
or landscaped areas to maximize site water capture and reuse.
      5.   Incorporate rain gardens, cisterns, and other rain harvesting or
catchment systems.
      6.   Incorporate infiltration beds, swales, basins and drywells to
capture storm water and dry weather runoff and increase percolation into the
soil.
      7.   Consider constructed wetlands and ponds that retain water, equalize
excess flow, and filter pollutants. (Ord. 2917, 2021: Ord. 2724 § 1, 2009)
15.54.210: PUBLIC EDUCATION:
   A.   Publications: Education is a critical component to promote the
efficient use of water in landscapes. The use of appropriate principles of
design, installation, management and maintenance that save water is encouraged
in the community.
      1.   The city shall provide information to owners of permitted
renovations and new, single-family residential homes regarding the design,
installation, management, and maintenance of water efficient landscapes based
on a water budget.
   B.   Model Homes: All model homes that are landscaped shall use signs and
written information to demonstrate the principles of water efficient landscapes
described in this chapter.
      1.   Signs shall be used to identify the model as an example of a water
efficient landscape featuring elements such as hydrozones, irrigation
equipment, and others that contribute to the overall water efficient theme.
Signage shall include information about the site water use as designed per the
local ordinance; specify who designed and installed the water efficient
landscape; and demonstrate low water use approaches to landscaping such as
using native plants, graywater systems, and rainwater catchment systems.
      2.   Information shall be provided about designing, installing, managing,
and maintaining water efficient landscapes. (Ord. 2917, 2021)
15.54.220: ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW:
The city must comply with the California environmental quality act (CEQA), as
appropriate. (Ord. 2917, 2021)
15.54.230: PROVISIONS FOR EXISTING LANDSCAPES:
The city may by mutual agreement, designate another agency, such as a water
purveyor, to implement some or all of the requirements contained in this
chapter. Local agencies may collaborate with water purveyors to define each
entity’s specific responsibilities relating to this chapter. (Ord. 2917, 2021)
15.54.240: IRRIGATION AUDIT, IRRIGATION SURVEY, AND IRRIGATION WATER USE
ANALYSIS:
   A.   This section shall apply to all existing landscapes that were installed
before December 1, 2015 and are over one (1) acre in size.
      1.   For all landscapes in this division A that have a water meter, the
city shall administer programs that may include, but not be limited to,
irrigation water use analyses, irrigation surveys, and irrigation audits to
evaluate water use and provide recommendations as necessary to reduce landscape
water use to a level that does not exceed the maximum applied water allowance
for existing landscapes. The maximum applied water allowance for existing
landscapes shall be calculated as: MAWA = (0.8)(ETo)(LA)(0.62).
      2.   For all landscapes in this division A that do not have a meter, the
city shall administer programs that may include, but not be limited to,
irrigation surveys and irrigation audits to evaluate water use and provide
recommendations as necessary in order to prevent water waste.
   B.   All landscape irrigation audits shall be conducted by a certified
landscape irrigation auditor. (Ord. 2917, 2021)
15.54.250: WATER WASTE PREVENTION:
   A.   Local agencies shall prevent water waste resulting from inefficient
landscape irrigation by prohibiting runoff from leaving the target landscape
due to low head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where water
flows onto adjacent property, non-irrigated areas, walks, roadways, parking
lots, or structures. Penalties for violation of these prohibitions shall be
established locally.
   B.   Restrictions regarding overspray and runoff may be modified if:
      1.   The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no runoff
occurs; or
      2.   The adjacent non-permeable surfaces are designed and constructed to
drain entirely to landscaping. (Ord. 2917, 2021)
15.54.260: EFFECTIVE PRECIPITATION:
The city may consider effective precipitation (25% of annual precipitation) in
tracking water use and may use the following equation to calculate maximum
applied water allowance:
MAWA = (ETo - Eppt) (0.62) [(0.55 x LA) + (0.45 x SLA)] for residential areas.
MAWA = (ETo - EPPT) (0.62) [(0.45 x LA) + (0.55 x SLA)] for non-residential
areas. (Ord. 2917, 2021)
15.54.270: REPORTING:

square feet is subject to this section. A 4,000 square foot nursery structure
that is proposed to be expanded by 500 square feet and which has outdoor
storage of 1,000 square feet is subject to this section.) (Ord. 2557 § 2, 2003)
16.02.030: SOCIOECONOMIC COST/BENEFIT STUDY REQUIRED:
Every private development proposal subject to the city's voter approved 1997
general plan amendment commonly known as "measure U" and which requires a
general plan amendment, zoning amendment, specific plan or preannexation
agreement for outside city utility connections to noncontiguous property, and
every private development proposal requiring a conditional use permit,
commission review and approval or other discretionary permit for a structure
and/or related outdoor use greater than five thousand (5,000) square feet,
shall make application to the city for a socioeconomic analysis and cost/
benefit study, which shall also be included in the environmental documents
prepared for the development proposal, to the extent permitted by law. The
socioeconomic analysis and cost/benefit study shall identify the source of
funding for necessary public infrastructure necessary to serve the development
proposal and reflecting the effect of the development proposal on the city. The
socioeconomic analysis and cost/benefit study shall also address the effect of
the development proposal on public school facilities and resources and, to the
extent permitted by law, recommend proposed mitigation measures for any
identified adverse impacts on school facilities. (Ord. 2557 § 2, 2003)
16.02.040: NOTICE:
The approving body for the development proposal shall conduct at least one
public hearing at which the public may appear and be heard to consider the
socioeconomic cost/benefit study after providing ten (10) days' prior notice,
published once in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. (Ord.
2557 § 2, 2003)
16.02.050: FINDINGS:
Except as otherwise provided for herein, approval of a development private
proposal requiring a socioeconomic study shall occur only if the approving body
for the development proposal determines that, based upon the socioeconomic
study and substantial evidence in the record that the private development
proposal: a) will not create unmitigated physical blight within the city or
overburden public services, including, without limitation, police and fire
protection services; and b) the benefit of the development proposal to the city
outweighs any direct cost to the city that may result. The approving body may,
however, approve a development proposal for which the socioeconomic study fails
to make the required findings or determinations if the approving body finds and
determines upon a four-fifths (4/5) vote of its total authorized membership
that the benefits to the city from the development proposal outweigh the
negative socioeconomic effects that may result. In addition to the aforesaid
findings, the approving body shall, in granting approval of the development
proposal, make any required findings for the particular land use applications
under review. (Ord. 2557 § 2, 2003)
16.02.060: EXEMPTIONS FROM CHAPTER REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Development proposals that directly further the primary institutional
purposes of churches, hospitals, schools (including private schools and
universities) and organizations such as the YMCA and YWCA, on sites held by
such entities as of March 1, 1997, are exempt from the provisions of this
chapter provided such development proposals are: 1) nonresidential in
character; or 2) provide only dormitory, staff housing or senior congregate
care facilities for those exempt entities.
   B.   Development proposals initiated by the city including, but not limited
to, general plan amendments, amendments to this code, zone changes, specific
plan amendments and other land use entitlement actions. (Ord. 2557 § 2, 2003)

PROPERTY SLOPE CALCULATION
SECTION:
16.04.010: Purpose And Intent
16.04.020: Applicability
16.04.030: Calculation Of Slope
16.04.040: Provision Of Digital Data
16.04.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to implement the goals and policies
of the Redlands general plan relating to the calculation of property slope and
the determination of permitted densities by ensuring that the city employs the
most accurate, reasonably available data to determine the slope of the property
which is the subject of proposed development projects. As a prerequisite of
determining an application for a development project to be deemed complete, an
applicant shall obtain from the city's community development department, a
calculation of the natural cross slope of the property which is the subject of
the development project. (Ord. 2658 § 1, 2008)
16.04.020: APPLICABILITY:
This chapter shall apply to all applications submitted to the city for
development project proposals unless the city's community development director,
or the director's designee, concludes that the determination of average cross
slope for a property is unnecessary to the city's processing of the development
project proposal. (Ord. 2658 § 1, 2008)
16.04.030: CALCULATION OF SLOPE:
"Average cross slope" shall be determined by the city's community development
department, and shall mean the method of determining the natural cross slope of
property using the following equation:
 
         I x L x 0.0023
         A
I      = Contour interval in feet.
         Combined length in feet of contour lines measured on the property
         which is the site of the development project. Contour lines shall be
         produced using the highest resolution digital elevation model ("DEM")
L      = reasonably available to the city. (Coarse resolution DEMs produced
         overly simplified contour lines, resulting in artificially low natural
         core slope measurements.) As higher quality DEMs become available, the
         community development department shall evaluate use of such DEMs to
         perform the average cross slope analysis.
A      = The acreage of the property which is the subject of the development
         project.
0.0023 = A constant which converts square feet into acres and expresses slope
         in percent.
 
(Ord. 2658 § 1, 2008)
16.04.040: PROVISION OF DIGITAL DATA:
To assist the city in determining property slope, the applicant for a
development project subject to this chapter may be requested by the city to
submit to the city one copy of a digitized development project site plan and
elevations, including all CAD or GIS data used in, or to produce, the plan and
elevations. This data shall be in a format that requires no conversion or
translation for the city to make use of the data. The data may be used by the
city in its discretion dependent upon its determination of the accuracy of such
determination. (Ord. 2658 § 1, 2008)

this title. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.07.030: ACCOMPANYING DATA AND REPORTS:
The tentative map shall be accompanied by the following data and reports:
   A.   Street Names: A list of proposed street names for any unnamed street or
alley for review by the city engineer; except in the case of tentative maps for
condominium conversions.
   B.   Soils Report: A preliminary soils report prepared in accordance with
the provisions of the uniform building code. If the preliminary soils report
indicates the presence of critically expansive soils or other soil problems
which, if not corrected, would lead to structural defects, the soils report
accompanying the final map shall contain an investigation of each lot within
the subdivision.
   C.   Title Report: A preliminary title report, acceptable to the department,
showing the legal owners at the time of filing the tentative map.
   D.   Environmental Review: Information shall be submitted as required by the
department to allow a determination on environmental review to be made in
accordance with CEQA. The subdivider shall deposit and pay all fees as may be
required for the preparation and processing of environmental review documents.
   E.   Preliminary Engineering Calculations: Information shall be submitted as
required by the standard engineering specifications to demonstrate the adequacy
of the design of the proposed improvements. Such information shall include
design parameters and engineering calculations.
   F.   Phasing: If the subdivider plans to file multiple final maps on the

development director.
   G.   Other Reports: Any other data or reports deemed necessary by the
department.
   H.   Drainage Study: Information shall be submitted prepared by a registered
civil engineer showing the amount of water coming through, and generated by,
the project and describing how these flows will be handled on site and
downstream. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.07.040: GEOTECHNICAL REPORTS:
   A.   Three (3) copies of a preliminary engineering soils report and
engineering geology report, prepared by a civil engineer and engineering
geologist registered in the state and based upon adequate borings, shall be
submitted to the city building official for subdivisions of five (5) or more
parcels. The city building official may require that such reports be submitted
for subdivisions of four (4) or less parcels.
   B.   A preliminary soils and/or geology report may be waived by the city
building official provided the city building official finds that, due to the
knowledge the city has as to the soil and geologic conditions in the
subdivision, no preliminary analysis is necessary. Such knowledge would include
the nature, distribution and strength of the existing soils, and the necessary
grading procedures and design criteria for corrective measures, and the geology
of the site and the effect of geologic conditions on the proposed development.
   C.   If the city has knowledge of, or the preliminary soils and geology
reports indicate, the presence of soil or geologic conditions which, if
corrective measures are not taken, could lead to structural defects, a soils
and/or geologic investigation of each lot in the subdivision may be required by
the city building official. Such soils and/or geologic investigation shall be
done by a civil engineer and/or geologist registered in the state who shall
recommend regarding the adequacy of the sites to be developed by the proposed
grading and the effect of the soil or geologic conditions on the proposed
development. The city may approve the subdivision, or portion thereof, where
soils or geologic problems exist if the city determines that the recommended
actions provide for procedures and design criteria for corrective measures as
necessary covering the structures and adequacy of the sites to be developed by
the proposed grading. A condition of the issuance of any building permit may
require that the approved recommended action be incorporated in the grading
plans and/or specifications and, if necessary, the plans and specifications for
the construction of each structure.
   D.   Where preliminary soils and/or geology reports are prepared, final
reports shall be submitted prior to the acceptance of the improvements or the
release of occupancy permits indicating the specific actions taken pursuant to
the preliminary report recommendations. Such reports shall have sufficient
field data submitted to indicate full compliance with the preliminary or
subsequent progress report recommendations as they were applied to specific
areas or improvements.
   E.   Geotechnical reports must also comply with applicable city
administrative policies and standards. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.07.050: STREET NAMES:
Each street which is to be dedicated which is a continuation of, or
approximately the continuation of, any existing dedicated street shall be shown
on the tentative map and shall be given the same name as such existing street.
The proposed name of each other street shown on the tentative map shall be
submitted to the city for approval in accordance with current city street
naming policies prepared by the public works department. The approved street
name shall be shown on the tentative map. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.07.060: DEPARTMENT REVIEW:
The tentative map application shall be filed with the department. The
application shall be determined by the department to be complete only when the
form and contents of the tentative map conform to the requirements of section
17.07.020 of this chapter and when all accompanying data and reports, as
required by section
17.07.030 of this chapter, and all fees and/or deposits as required by section
17.01.060 of this title, have been submitted and accepted by the department.
The subdivider shall file with the department the number of tentative maps the
community development director may deem necessary. The department shall forward
copies of the tentative map to the affected public agencies and utilities which
may, in turn, forward to the department their findings and recommendations.
(Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.07.070: PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION:
   A.   Notice Of Public Hearings: Upon receipt of a complete tentative map
application, the department shall prepare a report with recommendations. The
department shall set the matter for public hearing before the planning
commission. A copy of the department report shall be forwarded to the
subdivider at least three (3) days prior to the public hearing. At least ten
(10) calendar days before the public hearing, a notice shall be given of the
time, date and place of the hearing, including a general explanation of the
matter to be considered and a general description of the area affected, and the
street address, if any, of the property involved. The notice shall be published
at least once in a newspaper of general circulation, published and circulated
in the city.
In addition to notice by publication, the department shall give notice of the
hearing by mail or delivery to the subdivider, the owner of the subject real
property, if different from the subdivider, and to all persons, including
businesses, corporations, or other public or private entities, shown on the
last equalized assessment roll as owning real property within three hundred
feet (300') of the property which is the subject to the proposed application.
The department shall also give notice of the hearing by mail or delivery to
each agency expected to provide water, sewage, streets, roads, schools or other
essential facilities or services to the subdivision, whose ability to provide
those facilities and services may be significantly affected. A proposed
conversion of residential real property to a condominium, community apartment
or stock cooperative project shall be noticed in accordance with section
66451.3 of the subdivision map act.
In the event that the proposed application has been submitted by a person other
than the property owner shown on the last equalized assessment roll, the city
shall also give notice by mail or delivery to the owner of the property as
shown on the last equalized assessment roll. In addition, notice shall be given
by mail or personal delivery to any person who has filed a written request with
the city. The request may be submitted at any time during the calendar year and
shall apply for the balance of the calendar year. The department may give such
other notice that it deems necessary or advisable. Substantial compliance with
these provisions for notice shall be sufficient, and a technical failure to
comply shall not affect the validity of any action taken according to the
procedures in this title.
   B.   Action: The planning commission shall make its recommendation to the
city council, or shall approve, conditionally approve or deny the tentative map
if the planning commission is the approving body, and the department shall
report the decision of the planning commission to the city council and the
subdivider within fifty (50) days after the tentative map application has been
determined to be complete. If the approving body is the city council, the city
council shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the tentative map
within thirty (30) days after it receives the recommendation of the planning
commission. In reaching a decision upon the tentative map, the approving body
shall consider the effect of that decision on the housing needs of the region
and balance these needs against the public service needs of its residents and
available fiscal and environmental resources.
   C.   Approval: The tentative map may be approved or conditionally approved
by the approving body if it finds that the proposed subdivision, together with
the provisions for its design and improvement, is consistent with the general
plan, any applicable specific plan, and all applicable provisions of this code.
The approving body may require as a condition of its approval that the payment
by the subdivider of all development fees required to be paid at the time of
the application for, or issuance of, a building permit or other similar permit
shall be made at the rate for such fees in effect at the time of such
application or issuance.
The approving body may modify or delete any of the conditions of approval
recommended in the department's report. The approving body may add additional
requirements as a condition of its approval.
If no action is taken by the approving body within the time limits specified in
this section, the tentative map, as filed, shall be deemed to be approved if it
complies with all other applicable provisions of the subdivision map act, this
title, this code, and the general plan.
   D.   Denial: The tentative map may be denied by the planning commission on
any of the grounds provided by the subdivision map act or this code. The
planning commission shall deny approval of the tentative map if it makes any of
the following findings:
      1.   That the proposed map is inconsistent with the general plan or any
applicable specific plan, or other applicable provisions of this code;
      2.   That the site is not physically suitable for the type of
development;
      3.   That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed density of
development;
      4.   That the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are
likely to cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and avoidably
injure fish or wildlife or their habitat. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
planning commission may approve such a tentative map if an environmental impact
report was prepared with respect to the project and a finding was made pursuant
to section 21081(c) of CEQA that specific economic, social or other
considerations make infeasible the mitigation measures or project alternatives
identified in the environmental impact report;
      5.   That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements are
likely to cause serious public health problems;
      6.   That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will
conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or
use of, property within the proposed subdivision. In this connection, the
planning commission may approve a map if it finds that alternate easements, for
access or for use, will be provided, and that these will be substantially
equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. This subsection shall
apply only to easements of record or to easements established by judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction, and no authority is hereby granted to the
planning commission to determine that the public at large has acquired
easements for access through or use of property within the proposed
subdivision; or
      7.   Subject to section 66474.4 of the subdivision map act, that the land
is subject to a contract entered into pursuant to the California land
conservation act of 1965 (commencing with section 51200 of the Government Code)
and that the resulting parcels following a subdivision of the land would be too
small to sustain their agricultural use. (Ord. 2744, 2014: Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.07.080: CITY COUNCIL REVIEW:
If a tentative map is approved or conditionally approved, the department shall
forthwith make a written report thereof to the city council. The city council
shall, by a majority vote, have the right to call up the tentative map for city
council review at a city council meeting by a request to the community
development director, which must be made within twenty one (21) days of the
final action by the planning commission or the date of the city council's next
regularly scheduled meeting after the planning commission's decision. If the
council decides to review the map, it shall conduct a public hearing after
giving notice pursuant to subsection
17.07.070A of this chapter. In addition, notice shall be given to the planning
commission. The public hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days after the
city council decides to review the map. The city council may add, modify or
delete conditions if the city council determines that such changes are
necessary to ensure that the tentative map conforms to the subdivision map act
and this code. The city council may deny the tentative map on any of the
grounds contained in subsection
17.07.070D of this chapter. Within ten (10) days following the conclusion of
the hearing, the city council shall render its decision. If the city council
does not act within the time limits set forth in this section, the tentative
map shall be deemed to have been approved or conditionally approved as last
approved or conditionally approved by the planning commission insofar as it
complies with all other applicable provisions of the subdivision map act, this
title, this code and the general plan. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.07.090: EXTENSION OF TIME FOR PLANNING COMMISSION OR CITY COUNCIL ACTION:
Any applicable time limits for acting on the tentative map application may be
extended by mutual consent of the subdivider and the planning commission or the
city council in accordance with state law. A waiver of applicable time limits
may be required to permit concurrent processing of related project approvals or
environmental review on the same development project. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.07.100: APPEALS OF PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION:
The subdivider or any interested person adversely affected by any planning
commission action, other than the city council, with respect to the tentative
map may, within ten (10) days after the decision, file an appeal in writing
with the city clerk or the community development director. The city council
shall consider the appeal within thirty (30) days after the date of filing of
the appeal, unless the appellant consents to a continuance. Within ten (10)
days following the conclusion of the hearing, the city council shall render its
decision. The appeal shall be a public hearing after notice has been given
according to subsection
17.07.070A of this chapter. In addition, notice shall be given to the planning
commission. The council may sustain, modify, reject or overrule any
recommendations or rulings of the planning commission and may make any findings
which are consistent with the provisions of the subdivision map act or this
title.
If the city council fails to act upon an appeal within the time limits set
forth in this section, the tentative map shall be deemed to be approved or
conditionally approved as last approved or conditionally approved by the
planning commission insofar as it complies with all other applicable provisions
of the subdivision map act, this title, this code and the general plan. (Ord.
2481 § 1, 2002)
17.07.110: EXPIRATION:
   A.   The approval or conditional approval of a tentative map shall expire
twenty four (24) months from its approval by either the planning commission or
city council, whichever occurs last. However, if in connection with a tentative
map for which the filing of multiple final maps is authorized, the subdivider
is made subject to a requirement of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00)
or more to construct or improve or finance the construction or improvement of
public improvements outside the boundaries of the tentative map, or if the
tentative map is on property subject to a development agreement authorized by
sections 65864 et seq., of the Government Code, then the expiration date shall
be extended in accordance with section 66452.6(a) of the subdivision map act.
An extension to the expiration date may also be approved as provided in section

approval of a tentative map only if a stay of the time period is approved by
the planning commission. After service of the initial petition or complaint
upon the city, the subdivider shall, in writing, to the community development
director, request a stay in the time period of the tentative map. Within forty
(40) days after receiving the request, the planning commission shall either
stay the time period for up to five (5) years or deny the requested stay. The
request for the stay shall be a hearing with notice to the subdivider and to
the appellant, and upon conclusion of the hearing, the planning commission
shall, within ten (10) days, render its decision. The subdivider or any
interested person may appeal action of the planning commission on the stay to
the city council within ten (10) days of such action in accordance with section
17.07.100 of this chapter.
   C.   The period of time specified in subsection A of this section shall not
include any period of time during which a development moratorium is in effect
according to section 66452.6 of the subdivision map act. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)

for requesting the extension.
   B.   Planning Commission Action: The department shall review the request and
submit the application for the extension, together with a report, to the
planning commission for approval, conditional approval or denial at the next
regularly scheduled planning commission meeting. A copy of the department's
report shall be forwarded to the subdivider prior to the planning commission
meeting on the extension. In approving, conditionally approving or denying the
request for extension, the planning commission shall make findings supporting
its decision, including findings with respect to the potential impact of any
increases in applicable development fees which have occurred since the date of
the approval or conditional approval of the tentative map.
   C.   Time Limit Of Extensions: The time at which the tentative map expires
may be extended by the planning commission for a period not exceeding a total
of six (6) years.
   D.   Appeal Of Extension: The subdivider or any interested person adversely
affected may appeal any action of the planning commission on the extension to
the city council in accordance with section
17.07.100 of this chapter, except that any such appeal shall be filed within
fifteen (15) days after the action by the planning commission. If the council
does not act within the time limits set forth in section
17.07.100 of this chapter, the extension shall be deemed to have been approved
or conditionally approved as approved by the planning commission, insofar as
the tentative map complies with all other applicable provisions of the
subdivision map act, this title, this code and the general plan. (Ord. 2744,
2014: Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.07.130: AMENDMENTS TO APPROVED OR CONDITIONALLY TENTATIVE MAP:
Minor amendments to the approved or conditionally approved tentative map or
conditions of approval may be approved by the department upon application by
the subdivider or on the department's own initiative, provided:

and forty percent (40%) of the original lot area.
      2.   Setbacks And Yards: The proposed lots shall be designed to allow the
existing and/or future dwelling units to comply with the applicable objective
standards for yards and setbacks. This setback standard is only enforced to the
extent that it does not prevent two (2) primary dwelling units on the lot at
eight hundred (800) square feet each. No setback shall be required for an
existing structure or a structure constructed in the same location and to the
same dimensions as an existing structure.
      3.   Lot Coverage: The proposed lots shall be designed to allow the
existing and/or future dwelling units to comply with the applicable objective
standard for maximum lot coverage, to the extent practicable. This lot coverage
standard is only enforced to the extent that it does not prevent two (2)
primary dwelling units on the lot at eight hundred (800) square feet each.
   G.   Not Historic: The lot to be split must not be a historic property or
within a historic district that is included in the State Historic Resources
Inventory. Nor may the lot be or be within a site that is designated by
ordinance as a city or county landmark or as a historic property or district.
   H.   No Prior Urban Lot Split: The lot to be split must not have been
established through a prior SB 9 urban lot split, and the lot to be split must
not be adjacent to any lot that was established through a prior SB 9 urban lot
split by the owner of the lot to be split or by any person acting in concert
with the owner.
   I.   Easements:
      1.   The owner must enter into an easement agreement with each public-

of public services and facilities to each of the resulting lots.
      2.   Each easement must be shown on the tentative parcel map.
      3.   Copies of the unrecorded easement agreements must be submitted with
the Development Application. The easement agreements must be recorded against
the property before the final map may be approved, in accordance with Section
17.12.050 of this Chapter.
      4.   If an easement is recorded and the project is not completed, making
the easement moot, the property owner may request, and the City will provide, a
notice of termination of the easement, which the owner may record.
   J.   Lot Access: Each resulting lot shall have access to, provide access to,
or adjoin a public right-of-way. The minimum access width shall be at least
fifteen feet (15').
   K.   Utilities:

urban lot split application.
      4.   Housing that has been occupied by a tenant in the last three (3)
years. The applicant and the owner of a property for which an urban lot split
is sought must provide a sworn statement as to this fact with the application
for the parcel map. The City may conduct its own inquiries and investigation to
ascertain the veracity of the sworn statement, including but not limited to,
surveying owners of nearby properties; and the City may require additional
evidence of the applicant and owner as necessary to determine compliance with
this requirement.
   N.   Nonconforming Conditions: An urban lot split may be approved without
requiring a legal nonconforming zoning condition or lot standard to be
corrected. This provision shall supersede Section
18.184.040 (Nonconforming Lots) of Title 18 of the Redlands Municipal Code for
the duration that applicable State law remains in effect.
   O.   Fire Hazard Mitigation Measures: For a proposed subdivision on a lot

period of less than thirty (30) days.
      2.   Expressly prohibits any non-residential use of the lots created by
the urban lot split.
      3.   States that the property is formed by an urban lot split, and is
therefore subject to the City's urban lot split regulations, including all
applicable limits on dwelling size and development. (Ord. 2985, 2025)
17.12.040: ACTION BY DEVELOPMENT SERVICES DIRECTOR:
   A.   Upon receipt of a tentative parcel map application that is determined
by the Development Services Department to be complete, the Department shall
review the proposal and render a decision within the time limits prescribed by
State law. An application for a tentative parcel map for an urban lot split is
approved or denied ministerially, by the Development Services Director, without
discretionary review.
   B.   The tentative parcel map may be approved or conditionally approved by
the Development Services Director if staff finds that the proposed subdivision,
together with the provisions for its design and improvement, is consistent with
the general plan, any applicable specific plan, and all applicable provisions
of this code. The Development Services Director may require as a condition of
approval that the payment by the subdivider of all development fees required to
be paid at the time of the application for, or issuance of, a building permit
or other similar permit shall be made at the rate for such fees in effect at
the time of such application or issuance.
      If no action is taken by the Development Services Director within sixty
(60) days from the date the City receives a tentative map application, or such
other time limits specified in applicable State law, the tentative parcel map,
as filed, shall be deemed to be approved.
   C.   Conditions Of Approval:
      1.   A tentative parcel map for an urban lot split is approved
ministerially if it complies with all the requirements of this chapter. The
tentative parcel map may not be recorded. A final parcel map is approved
ministerially as well, but not until the owner demonstrates that the required
documents have been recorded, such as the deed restriction and any easements.
      2.   The approval shall require the owner and applicant to hold the City
harmless from all claims and damages related to the approval and its subject
matter.
      3.   The approval shall require the owner and applicant to reimburse the
City for all costs of enforcement, including attorneys' fees and costs
associated with enforcing the requirements of this code.
      4.   Other conditions of approval may be attached to enforce any other
requirements, including, but not limited to: applicable development standards;
standard requirements; engineering design requirements or other design
regulations; and any other conditions to protect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
   D.   Denial: The tentative parcel map may be denied by the Development
Services Director on any of the grounds or objective standards provided by the
Subdivision Map Act, California Government Code Section 66411.7, or this Code.
The Development Services Director shall deny approval of the tentative parcel
map if the Department makes any of the following findings to the extent they
are related to the design or to improvements of a parcel, consistent with
Calif. Gov. Code section 66411.7:
      1.   That the proposed map is inconsistent with objective zoning
standards, objective subdivision standards, or objective design review
standards that are related to the design or to improvements of a parcel;
      2.   That the site is not located within a single-family residential
zone;
      3.   That the site is a designated historic property or located within a
historic district;
      4.   That the project site or design of the subdivision does not meet the
applicable criteria and requirements of California Government Code Section
66411.7, California Government Code Section 65913.4 (subparagraphs (B) to (K),
inclusive, of paragraph 6 of subdivision (a)), or the Subdivision Map Act;
      5.   That the proposed lot split would have a specific, adverse impact
upon public health and safety for which there is no feasible method to
satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific, adverse impact; or
      6.   That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will
conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or
use of, property within the proposed subdivision; provided, however, the
Development Services Director may approve a map if it finds that alternate
easements, for access or for use, will be provided, and that these will be
substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. This
subsection shall apply only to easements of record or to easements established
by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and no authority is hereby
granted to the Development Services Director to determine that the public at
large has acquired easements for access through or use of property within the
proposed subdivision.
   E.   Specific Adverse Impacts:
      1.   Notwithstanding anything else in this section, the City may deny an
application for an urban lot split if the Building Official makes a written
finding, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the project would have
a "specific, adverse impact" on public health and safety for which there is no
feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse
impact.
      2.   "Specific adverse impact" has the same meaning as in the California
Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2): "a significant, quantifiable, direct,
and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public health or
safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the
application was deemed complete" and does not include (1) inconsistency with
the zoning ordinance or general plan land use designation or (2) the
eligibility to claim a welfare exemption under Revenue and Taxation Code
Section 214(g).
      3.   The Building Official may consult with and be assisted by Planning
staff, Engineering staff, and others as necessary in making a finding of
specific, adverse impact.
   F.   Notice Of Denial: If an application for an urban lot split is denied,
then the Development Services Director shall notify the applicant within sixty
(60) days from receipt of the application and provide a full set of comments to
the applicant with a list of items that are defective or deficient and a
description of how the application can be remedied. (Ord. 2985, 2025)
17.12.050: CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL:

improvements; any additional on-site parking spaces (if the criteria and
provisions of current State law are met); or other provisions in State law.

   B.   Standards For Reservation Of Land: Where a park, recreational facility,
fire station, library or other public use is shown on the general plan or an
adopted specific plan, the subdivider may be required by the city to reserve
sites as so determined by the city in accordance with the policies and
standards contained in the general plan or the adopted specific plan. The
reserved area must be of such size and shape as to permit the balance of the
property within which the reservation is located to develop in an orderly and
efficient manner. The amount of land to be reserved shall not make development
of the remaining land held by the subdivider economically infeasible. The
reserved area shall be consistent with the general plan or the adopted specific
plan and shall be in such multiples of streets and parcels as to permit an
efficient division of the reserved area in the event that it is not acquired
within the prescribed period.
   C.   Procedure: The public agency for whose benefit an area has been
reserved shall, at the time of approval of the final map or parcel map, enter
into a binding agreement to acquire such reserved area within two (2) years
after the completion and acceptance of all improvements, unless the period of
time is extended by mutual agreement.
   D.   Payment To Subdivider: The purchase price for the reserved area shall
be the market value thereof at the time of the filing of the tentative map,
plus the taxes against the reserved area from the date of the reservation and
any other costs incurred by the subdivider in the maintenance of the reserved
area, including interest costs incurred on any loan covering the reserved area.
   E.   Termination: If the public agency for whose benefit an area has been
reserved does not enter into a binding agreement in accordance with this
section, the reservation of the area shall automatically terminate. (Ord. 2481
§ 1, 2002; amd. Ord. 2912, 7-21-2020)
17.15.060: LOCAL TRANSIT FACILITIES:
As a condition of approval of a tentative map, the subdivider shall dedicate,
or make an irrevocable offer of dedication, of land within the subdivision for
local transit facilities such as shelters, benches, bus turnouts, landing pads,
park and ride facilities and similar items which directly benefit the residents
of the subdivision, if:
   A.   The subdivision as shown on the tentative map has the potential for two
hundred (200) dwelling units or more if developed to the maximum density shown
on the general plan or contains one hundred (100) acres or more, and
   B.   If the city finds that transit services are or will, within a
reasonable time period, be made available to the subdivision.
The provisions of this section do not apply to condominium projects or stock
cooperatives which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing
apartment building which is more than five (5) years old when no new dwelling
units are added. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002; amd. Ord. 2912, 7-21-2020)
17.15.070: BRIDGES AND MAJOR THOROUGHFARES:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to make provision for assessing
and collecting fees as a condition of approval of a final map or as a condition
of issuing a building permit for the purpose of defraying the actual or
estimated cost of constructing bridges or major thoroughfares pursuant to
section 66484 of the subdivision map act, and in order to implement the
circulation-transportation element of the general plan and, in the case of
bridges, the transportation provisions thereof.
   B.   Definitions: For the purposes of this section, the following words and
phrases shall have the following meanings:
      CONSTRUCTION: Design, acquisition of right of way, administration of
construction contracts, actual construction and inspections.
      MAJOR THOROUGHFARE: A roadway as shown on the circulation- transportation
element of the general plan whose primary purpose is to carry through traffic
and provide a network connecting to the state highway system.
   C.   Payment Of Fees Generally:
      1.   Prior to filing a final map which includes land within an area of
benefit established pursuant to this section, the subdivider shall pay or cause
to be paid any fees established and apportioned to such property pursuant to
this section for the purpose of defraying the actual or estimated cost of
constructing bridges over waterways, railways, freeways or canyons or
constructing major thoroughfares.
      2.   Prior to the issuance of a building permit for construction on any
property within an area of benefit established pursuant to this section, the
applicant for such permit shall pay or cause to be paid any fees established
and apportioned pursuant to this section for the purpose of defraying the
actual or estimated cost of constructing bridges over waterways, railways,
freeways or canyons or constructing major thoroughfares, unless such fees have
been paid pursuant to subsection C1 of this section.
      3.   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections C1 and C2 of this
section:
         a.   Payment of bridge fees shall not be required unless the planned
bridge facility is an original bridge serving the area or an addition to any
existing bridge facility servicing the area at the time of adoption of the
boundaries of the area of benefit.
         b.   Payment of major thoroughfare fees shall not be required unless
the major thoroughfares are in addition to, or a reconstruction of, any
existing major thoroughfares serving the area at the time of the adoption of
the area of benefit.
   D.   Consideration In Lieu Of Fees: Upon application by the subdivider or
applicant for a building permit, the city council, in the case of subdivisions
of five (5) or more parcels, or the planning commission, in the case of
subdivisions of four (4) or less parcels, may accept consideration in lieu of
the payment of fees required pursuant to this section; provided that the city
council or planning commission, as the case may be, first finds upon
recommendation of the public works director, that the substitute consideration
has a value equal to or greater than the fee; and provided further that the
substitute consideration is in a form acceptable to the city council or
planning commission, as the case may be.
   E.   Public Hearing: Prior to establishing an area of benefit, a public
hearing shall be held by the city council at which time the boundaries of the
area of benefit, the costs, whether actual or estimated, and a fair method of
allocation of costs to the area of benefit and fee apportionment, and the fee
to be collected, shall be established. Notice of the public hearing shall be
given pursuant to subsection
17.07.070A of this title and shall include preliminary information related to
the boundaries of the area of benefit, estimated cost and the method of fee
apportionment.
   F.   Amount: The amount of the fees and the areas of benefit established
pursuant to this section may be established by ordinance or resolution.
   G.   Exemptions: Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection F of this
section, payment of such fees shall not be required for:
      1.   The use, alteration or enlargement of an existing building or
structure or the erection of one or more buildings or structures accessory
thereto, or both, on the same lot or parcel of land; provided, that the total
value, as determined by the building official, of all such alteration,
enlargement or construction completed within any one year period does not
exceed one-half (1/2) of the current market value, as determined by the
building official, of all existing buildings on such lot or parcel of land, and
the alteration or enlargement of the building is not such as to change its
classification of occupancy as defined by the uniform building code.
      2.   The following accessory buildings and structures: private garages,
children's playhouses, radio and television receiving antennas, windmills,
silos, tank houses, shops, barns, coops and other buildings which are accessory
to one- family or two-family dwellings.
   H.   Protest:
      1.   At any time not later than the hour set for hearing objections to
the proposed bridge facility or major thoroughfare, any owner of property to be
benefitted by the improvement may file a protest against the proposed bridge
facility or major thoroughfare or against the extent of the area to be
benefitted by the improvements or against both of them. Such protests must be
in writing and must contain a description of the property in which each signer
thereof is interested, sufficient to identify such property, and, if the
signers are not shown on the last equalized assessment roll as the owners of
such property, must contain or be accompanied by written evidence that such
signers are the owners of such property. All such protests shall be delivered
to the city clerk and no other protest or objections shall be considered. Any
protest may be withdrawn, in writing, by the owners making such protests, at
any time prior to the conclusion of the public hearing.
      2.   If there is a written protest filed with the city clerk by the
owners of more than one-half (1/2) of the area of the property to be benefitted
by the improvement, and sufficient protests are not withdrawn so as to reduce
the area represented to less than one-half (1/2) of that to be benefitted, then
the proposed proceedings shall be abandoned and the city council shall not, for
one year from the filing of that written protest, commence or carry on any
proceedings for the same improvement, or that portion thereof so protested
against, under the provisions of this section. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002; amd. Ord.
2912, 7-21-2020)
17.15.080: SUPPLEMENTAL IMPROVEMENT CAPACITY:
   A.   As a condition of approval of a tentative map, there may be imposed a
requirement that improvements installed by the subdivider for the benefit of
the subdivision contain supplemental size, capacity, number or length for the
benefit of property not within the subdivision and that those improvements be
dedicated to the public. However, when such supplemental size, capacity, number
or length is solely for the benefit of property not within the subdivision, the
city shall, subject to the provisions of sections 66486 and 66487 of the
subdivision map act, enter into an agreement with the subdivider to reimburse
the subdivider for that portion of the cost of such improvements equal to the
difference between the amount it would have cost the subdivider to install such
improvements to serve the subdivision only and the actual cost of such
improvements.
   B.   The city council shall determine the method for payment of the costs
required by a reimbursement agreement, which method may include, but shall not
be limited to, the following:
      1.   The collection from other persons, including public agencies, using
such improvements for the benefit of real property not within the subdivision,
a reasonable charge for such use.
      2.   The contribution to the subdivider of that part of the cost of the
improvements that is attributable to the benefit of real property outside the
subdivision and the levy of a charge upon the real property benefitted to
reimburse the city for such costs, together with interest thereon, if any, paid
to the subdivider.
      3.   The establishment and maintenance of local benefit districts for the
levy and collection of such charge or costs from the property benefitted.
   C.   No charge, area of benefit or local benefit district shall be
established unless and until a public hearing is noticed and held thereon by
the city council in accordance with the provisions of subsection 17.15.080E of
this chapter and the city council finds that the charge, area of benefit or
local benefit district is reasonably related to the cost of such supplemental
improvements and the actual ultimate beneficiaries thereof.
   D.   In addition to the notice required by subsection
17.15.080E of this chapter, written notice of the hearing shall be given to
those who own property within the proposed area of benefit as shown on the last
equalized assessment roll, and the potential users of the supplemental
improvements insofar as they be ascertained at the time. Such notices shall be
mailed by the city clerk at least ten (10) days prior to the date established
for the hearing. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002; amd. Ord. 2912, 7-21-2020)
17.15.090: RESERVED:
(Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.15.100: SOLAR ACCESS EASEMENTS:
As a condition of approval of a tentative map, there may be imposed, in
accordance with the provisions of section 66475.3 of the subdivision map act, a
requirement that the subdivider dedicate easements for the purpose of assuring
that each parcel or unit in the subdivision shall have the right to receive
sunlight across adjacent parcels or units in the subdivision for any solar
energy system, as defined in section 801.5 of the State Civil Code. In
establishing such easements, consideration shall be given to feasibility,
contour, configuration of the parcel to be divided and cost. Required easements
shall not result in reducing allowable densities or the percentage of a lot
which may be occupied by a building or a structure under applicable planning
and zoning in force at the time such tentative map is filed.
At the time of tentative map approval, the planning commission, as the case may
be, shall specify the following:
   A.   The standards for determining the exact dimensions and locations of
such easements.
   B.   Any restrictions on vegetation, buildings and other objects which would
obstruct the passage of sunlight through the easement.
   C.   The terms for conditions, if any, under which an easement may be
revised or terminated.
The foregoing provisions of this section do not apply to condominium projects
which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing building where no
new structures are added. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002; amd. Ord. 2912, 7-21-2020)
17.15.110: REIMBURSEMENTS TO A TELEPHONE CORPORATION OR CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEM
FOR UNDERGROUNDING OR RELOCATION:
Whenever the city imposes as a condition to its approval of a tentative map or
a parcel map a requirement that necessitates replacing, undergrounding or
permanently or temporarily relocating existing facilities of a telephone
corporation or cable television system, the subdivider shall reimburse the
telephone corporation or cable television system for all costs for the
replacement, undergrounding or relocation. All these costs shall be billed to
the subdivider directly by the telephone corporation or cable television system
after they are incurred, and shall include a credit for any required advance
payments and for the salvage value of any facilities replaced. In no event
shall the telephone corporation or cable television system be reimbursed for
costs incurred in excess of the cost to replace the facilities with
substantially similar facilities. In no event shall the city be obligated for
such reimbursement. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002; amd. Ord. 2912, 7-21-2020)

17.17.010: GENERAL:
The subdivider shall construct all required improvements, both on site and off
site, in accordance with the standard engineering specifications and other
approved standards as provided by this title and by the city council's
resolutions establishing such standards. No final map shall be presented to the
council, or parcel map to the planning commission, for approval until the
subdivider either completes the required improvements, or enters into an
agreement with the city agreeing to do the work. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.17.020: REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   General: In addition to all improvements required as conditions of
approval of the tentative map or by city ordinance or resolution, the
improvements set forth below shall be required of all subdivisions.
Requirements for construction of on site and off site improvements for
subdivisions of four (4) or less parcels shall be noted on the parcel map, or
waiver of parcel map or the subdivision improvement agreement recorded prior to
or concurrent with the parcel map. Completion of improvements shall be in
accordance with section
17.17.100  of this chapter.
   B.   Frontage Improvements: The frontage of each lot shall be improved to
its ultimate adopted geometric section, including street structural section,
curbs, sidewalks, driveway approaches and transitions.
   C.   Storm Drainage: Storm water runoff from the subdivision shall be
collected and conveyed by an approved storm drain system. The storm drain
system shall be designed for ultimate development of the watershed and shall be
capable of collecting and conveying runoff generated by a 100-year flood. The
storm drain system shall provide for ultimate development of the watershed and
shall be capable of collecting and conveying runoff generated by a 100- year
flood. The storm drain system shall provide for the protection of abutting and
off site properties that would be adversely affected by any increase in runoff
attributed to the development. Off site storm drain improvements may be
required to satisfy this requirement.
   D.   Sanitary Sewers: Each unit or lot within the subdivision shall be
served by an approved sanitary sewer system in accordance with the provisions
of this code.
   E.   Water Supply: Each unit or lot within the subdivision shall be served
by an approved domestic water system, in accordance with the provisions of this
code.
   F.   Utilities: Each unit or lot within the subdivision shall be served by
gas, electric, and other necessary facilities.
   G.   Underground Utilities:
      1.   All existing and proposed utilities within the subdivision or
development parcel, and along peripheral streets of the subdivision site or
development parcel, shall be placed underground except those facilities
exempted by the public utilities commission regulations, or unless specifically
exempt from this requirement under subsections a-e below. Undergrounding shall
be required for overhead lines on either side of peripheral streets.
         a.   A subdivision parcel map (not including any site development)
that creates only two (2) parcels, and does not exceed four (4) gross acres in
total area of the subdivision, shall not be subject to the undergrounding
requirement or payment of an in-lieu fee.
         b.   Affordable housing developments, where at least fifty percent
(50%) of the dwelling units are reserved for low- or very-low income
households, shall not be subject to the undergrounding requirement or payment
of an in-lieu fee.
         c.   Parcels with less than three hundred and fifty (350) linear feet
of street frontage may pay an in-lieu fee by right for the affected side(s)
that is less than three hundred fifty feet (350') in length.
         d.   Parcels with greater than three hundred and fifty (350) linear
feet of street frontage shall underground the utilities along the affected side
(s) that is greater than three hundred fifty feet (350') feet in length, or may
request a waiver of undergrounding with the findings contained in subsections
G3a and G3b of this section to be made and payment of an in-lieu fee.
         e.   Parcels with an existing private school educational facility to
which any modifications, building additions, or site expansions are proposed,
shall not be subject to the undergrounding requirement or payment of an in-lieu
fee.
      2.   The developer may request that the undergrounding requirement along
peripheral streets be waived by the approving body which may, at its
discretion, accept a fee in lieu of the undergrounding. The amount of fee shall
be determined by calculating the linear distance of the project site's street
frontage and applying the applicable linear foot fee(s) established by City
Council. The requirement for undergrounding or payment of an in lieu fee shall
be a condition of approval of the tentative map or applicable development
permit.
      3.   Undergrounding requirements may be waived or modified by the
approving body only upon making one of the following findings:
         a.   The subdivision or development parcel is within an area where
existing utilities have not been undergrounded and that undergrounding is
either impractical due to physical constraints, or the surrounding neighborhood
is absent of similar improvements; or
         b.   Requiring undergrounding is likely to result in a
disproportionate economic impact or time delay that would make the project
economically infeasible in the sole discretion of the decision-making body, and
based upon substantial evidence submitted by the applicant or developer.
      4.   A subdivision or development meeting the requirements of subsection
G1c and G1d, or where undergrounding requirements have been waived pursuant to
subsections G3a and G3b of this section, the in lieu fee as established by
calculating the linear distance of the project site's street frontage and
applying the applicable linear foot fee(s) established by City Council shall be
made a condition of approval of the tentative map.
      5.   In lieu fees shall be deposited in a special undergrounding account
to be used as approved by the city council for future undergrounding of
utilities throughout the city.
      6.   The provisions of this subsection are in addition to, and not in
substitution for or limitation of, the provisions of this code.
   H.   Fencing: Each parcel or lot within the subdivision that is adjacent to
property containing a public facility shall have an approved fence adequate to
prevent unauthorized access between the properties.
   I.   Other Improvements: Other improvements including, but not limited to,
grading, street lights, fire hydrants, signs, street lines and markings, street
trees and shrubs, landscaping, monuments, bicycle facilities, fences and smoke
detectors, or fees in lieu of any of the foregoing, shall also be required as
determined by the city engineer in accordance with this code, the general plan
and city standards and specifications.
   J.   Off Site Improvements: If the subdivider is required to construct off
site improvements on land in which neither the subdivider nor the city has
sufficient title or interest to allow construction, the city shall, within one
hundred twenty (120) days of recording the final map, acquire by negotiation or
commence condemnation of the land. If the city fails to meet the one hundred
twenty (120) day time limit, the condition for the construction shall be
waived. Prior to approval of the final map, the city may require the subdivider
to enter into an agreement to complete the off site improvements at the time
the city acquires title or an interest in the land. The subdivider shall pay
the cost of acquiring off site land or an interest in the land required to
construct the off site improvements. (Ord. 2966, 2024: Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.17.030: DEFERRED IMPROVEMENT AGREEMENTS:
   A.   Subdivisions Of Four Or Less Parcels: The frontage improvements along
peripheral streets may be deferred when deemed necessary by the city engineer.
When improvements are deferred, the subdivider and/or owner of the real
property shall enter into an agreement with the city, in form acceptable to the
city engineer and city attorney, for the installation of all frontage
improvements at a time in the future as specified by the city. The agreement
shall provide for the following:
      1.   Construction of improvements shall commence within ninety (90) days
of the receipt of the notice to proceed from the city and shall be completed
within the time specified by section
17.17.100 of this chapter.
      2.   That in the event of a default by the subdivider and/or owner, the
city is authorized to cause construction to be done and charge the entire cost
and expense to the subdivider and/or owner, including interest from the date of
notice of said cost and expense until paid.
      3.   That the agreement shall be recorded with the county recorder at the
expense of the subdivider and/or owner and shall constitute notice to all
successors and assigns of title to the real property of the obligations set
forth therein, and shall also constitute a lien in such amount necessary to
fully reimburse the city, including interest as provided above, subject to
foreclosure in the event of a default in payment.
      4.   That in event of litigation occasioned by any default of the
subdivider and/or owner, the subdivider and/or owner agree to pay all costs
involved, including reasonable attorneys fees, and that the same shall become a
part of the lien against the real property.
      5.   That the terms "subdivider" and "owner" include, respectively, not
only the subdivider and the present owner of the real property but also heirs,
successors, executors, administrators and assigns thereof, it being the intent
of the parties that the obligations undertaken shall run with the real property
and constitute a lien against it.
      6.   Any other improvement security as required by section
17.17.080 of this chapter.
      7.   Any other provisions required by the city as reasonably necessary to
effectuate the purposes and provisions of the subdivision map act and this
code.
The agreement shall not relieve the subdivider or owner from any other specific
requirements of the subdivision map act, this code or law. The construction of
deferred improvements shall conform to the provisions of this code in effect at
the time of construction.
   B.   Remainders: Where a remainder is made part of a final or parcel map,
the subdivider may enter into an agreement with the city to construct
improvements within the remainder at some future date and prior to the issuance
of a permit or other grant of approval for the development of a remainder. The
improvements shall be at the subdivider's expense. In the absence of such an
agreement, the city may require fulfillment of the construction requirements
within a reasonable time following approval of the final or parcel map and
prior to the issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for the
development of the remainder, upon a finding that fulfillment of the
construction requirements is necessary for reasons of:
      1.   The public health and safety, or
      2.   The required construction is a necessary prerequisite to the orderly
development of the surrounding area. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.17.040: DESIGN:
   A.   General: The design and layout of all required improvements, both on
site and off site, private and public, shall conform to generally accepted
engineering standards, standard engineering specifications, the subdivision map
act and applicable provisions of this code.
   B.   Energy Conservation: The design of a subdivision for which a tentative
map is required shall provide, to the extent feasible, for future passive or
natural heating or cooling opportunities in the subdivision.
Examples of passive or natural heating opportunities in subdivision design
include design of lot size and configuration to permit orientation of a
structure in an east-west alignment for southern exposure and to permit
orientation of a structure to take advantage of shade or prevailing breezes. In
providing for future passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities in the
design of a subdivision, consideration shall be given to local climate,
contour, configuration of the parcel to be divided and other design and
improvement requirements. The provision shall not result in reducing allowable
densities, or the percentage of a lot which may be occupied by a building or
structure under applicable planning and zoning in force at the time the
tentative map is filed.
The requirements of this subsection do not apply to condominium projects which
consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing building when no new
structures are added.
For the purpose of this subsection, "feasible" means capable of being
accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking
into account economic, environmental, social and technological factors.
   C.   Cable Television Service: The design of a subdivision for which a
tentative map or parcel map is required shall provide one or more appropriate
cable television systems an opportunity to construct, install and maintain, on
land identified on the map as dedicated or to be dedicated to public utility
use, any equipment necessary to extend cable television services to each
residential parcel in the subdivision. For the purpose of this subsection,
"appropriate cable television systems" means those franchised or licensed to
serve the geographical area in which the subdivision is located. This
subsection shall not apply to the conversion of existing dwelling units to
condominiums, community apartments, or stock cooperatives. (Ord. 2481 § 1,
2002)
17.17.050: ACCESS:
All lots or parcels shall have access to a public street improved to the
standards set forth in this title. Private streets shall not normally be
permitted. However, if the approving body determines that the most logical
development of the land requires that lots be developed with access to private
streets such a development may be approved. The subdivider shall submit a
development plan showing the alignment, width, grade and material
specifications of any proposed private street, the topography and means of
access to each lot and the drainage, sewer and water service and fire
protection for the lots served by such private street. The private street shall
be constructed in accordance with standard engineering specifications of the
city as approved by the city engineer. Construction of the private street shall
be completed prior to the completion of the construction and/or occupancy of
the lots. The subdivider shall be required to provide a feasible method for the
maintenance of such private streets, which method shall be subject to the prior
approval of the city engineer and city attorney.
If flag lots are approved as part of the subdivision, the requirements,
including the improvements to the stem of the flag lots, shall be as described
for private streets in the preceding paragraph. Reserve strips, or nonaccess at
the end of streets or at the boundaries of subdivisions, shall be dedicated
unconditionally to the city when required by the city. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.17.060: IMPROVEMENT PLANS:
   A.   General: Improvement plans shall be prepared under the direction of and
signed by a registered civil engineer licensed by the state. Improvement plans

included.
The form of all plans shall conform to additional requirements as may be
established by the city engineer. The final form of all plans shall be approved
by the city engineer.
   C.   Contents: The improvement plans shall show complete plans, profiles and
details for all required improvements to be constructed, both public and
private, including common areas.
Reference may be made to the city of Redlands or state standard plans in lieu
of duplicating the drawings.
   D.   Supplementary Plans And Calculations: Hydrology, hydraulic plans and
calculations, bond or other security estimates and any structural calculations
as may be required, shall be submitted with the improvement plans to the city
engineer. All calculations shall be legible, systematic and signed and dated by
a registered civil engineer licensed by the state and in a form approved by the
city engineer.
   E.   Review By The City Engineer: The subdivider shall submit the
improvement plans and all computations to the city engineer for review. Upon

conditions of the approval of the tentative map, the city engineer shall sign
and date the plans. The city engineer may make a reproducible set of the plans
for use by the city. The originals will be returned to the subdivider.
Approval of the improvement plans shall not be construed as approval of the

Approval by the city engineer shall in no way relieve the subdivider or the
subdivider's engineer from responsibility for the design of the improvements
and for any deficiencies resulting from the design or from any required
conditions of approval of the tentative map.
   G.   Revision To Approved Plans:
      1.   By Subdivider: Requests by the subdivider for revisions to the
approved plans appearing necessary or desirable during construction shall be
submitted in writing to the city engineer or authorized representative and
shall be accompanied by revised drawings showing the proposed revision. If the
revision is acceptable to the city engineer and consistent with the tentative
map, the originals shall be submitted to the city engineer's office for
initialing. The originals shall be returned to the subdivider and the revised
plans shall be immediately transmitted to the city engineer. Construction of
any proposed revision will not be permitted to commence until revised plans
have been received and approved by the city engineer.
      2.   By City Engineer: When revisions are deemed necessary by the city
engineer to protect the public health and safety, or as field conditions may
require, a request in writing shall be made to the subdivider. The subdivider
shall revise the plans and transmit the originals to the city engineer for
initialing within the time specified by the city engineer.
Upon receipt of the initialized originals, the subdivider shall immediately
transmit revised drawings to the city engineer. Construction of all or any
portion of the improvements may be stopped by the city engineer until revised
drawings have been submitted.
The subdivider may appeal revisions required by the city engineer to the city
council by filing an appeal in writing with the city manager within fifteen
(15) days following receipt of the request to revise the plans.
      3.   Plan Checking And Inspection Costs For Revisions: Costs incurred by
the city for the checking of plans or calculations or inspection as a result of
revisions to the approved plans shall be borne by the subdivider at actual

and obligations for which the security was given.

by a specified date by the city when the completion of the improvements are
found to be necessary for public health or safety or for the orderly
development of the surrounding area. This finding shall be made by the city
engineer or authorized representative. The specified date, when required, shall
be stated in the subdivision improvement agreement. Improvements shall be
completed prior to final building inspection or occupancy of any unit within

and the submittal of adequate evidence to justify the extension. The request
shall be made not less than thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the
subdivision improvement agreement.
The subdivider shall enter into a subdivision improvement agreement extension
with the city. For subdivisions of five (5) or more parcels, the agreement
shall be prepared by the city engineer, approved by the city attorney, executed
by the subdivider and surety and transmitted to the city council for its

the planning commission prior to the extension agreement being executed by the
mayor, and the mayor shall not execute that agreement if it is called up by the
planning commission until the planning commission has completed its review as
set forth herein. Any member of the planning commission shall have the right to
call up that agreement for planning commission review by a written request to

subsection
17.07.070A of this title. In addition, notice shall be given to the planning
commission. The public hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days after the
date of the request for review. The commission may add, modify or delete
conditions if the commission determines that such changes are necessary to
ensure that the agreement conforms to the subdivision map act and this code.
The planning commission may deny the agreement on any of the grounds contained
in this title. Within ten (10) days following the conclusion of the hearing,
the commission shall render its decision. If the planning commission does not
act within the time limits set forth in this section, the agreement shall be
deemed to have been approved or conditionally approved as last approved or
conditionally approved by the planning commission insofar as it complies with
all other applicable provisions of the subdivision map act, this title, this
code and the general plan.
In consideration of a subdivision improvement agreement extension, the
following may be required:
      1.   Revision of improvement plans to provide for current design and
construction standards when required by the city engineer;
      2.   Revised improvement construction estimates to reflect current
improvement costs as approved by the city engineer;
      3.   Increase of improvement securities in accordance with revised
construction estimates;

The city council or planning commission, as the case may be, may impose
additional requirements as recommended by the city engineer or as it may deem
necessary as a condition to approving any time extension for the completion of
improvements. The costs incurred by the city in processing the agreement shall
be paid by the subdivider at actual cost plus twenty five percent (25%) of such
cost for overhead expenses.
   D.   As Built Plans: Upon completion of the improvements, the subdivider
shall submit to the city engineer a reproducible set of as built improvement
plans. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)

   A.   General: With respect to all subdivisions, when all improvement
deficiencies have been corrected and as built improvement plans submitted, the
completed subdivision improvements shall be considered by the city engineer for
acceptance.
Acceptance of the improvements shall imply only that the improvements have been
completed satisfactorily and that public improvements have been accepted for
public use.
   B.   Acceptance: If the subdivision improvements have been accepted by the
city engineer and public improvements have been dedicated on the final map or
parcel map, the city clerk shall file an acceptance of public improvements with
the county recorder.
   C.   Acceptance Of A Portion Of The Improvements: When requested by the
subdivider in writing, the city engineer may consider acceptance of a portion
of the improvements. Such improvements will be accepted by the city engineer
only if the city engineer finds that it is in the public interest to do so and
such improvements are for the use of the general public.
Acceptance of a portion of the improvements shall not relieve the subdivider
from any other requirements imposed by this title. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)

In addition to the applicable requirements and procedures set forth in this
title and the subdivision map act, conversions of existing rental housing to
condominiums, community apartments, stock cooperatives, and any other
subdivision which is a conversion of existing rental housing shall be subject
to the additional requirements of this chapter. The provisions of this chapter
shall not apply to limited equity cooperatives, as defined in Health and Safety
Code section 33007.5, the subdivision of which shall be governed by the
procedures set forth in the subdivision map act 1 . At the time the tentative
map application is filed, the subdivider shall submit concurrently a complete

conversions need not comply with the additional requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
 
Notes
1 1. Gov.C. § 66410 et seq.
17.25.020: INTENT:
   A.   The conversion of residential structures from one individual ownership
to condominiums or any other form of multiple ownership interests creates
special community problems, both social and economic. Conversions may
significantly affect the balance between rental and ownership housing within
the city and thereby reduce the variety of individual choices of tenure, type,
price and location of housing; increase overall rents; decrease the supply of
rental housing for all income groups; displace individuals and families; and
disregard the needs of the prevailing consumer market.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidelines to evaluate those
problems, the impact any conversion application may have on the community, and
to establish requirements which shall be included in any conversion approval.
   B.   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any conversion of a
residential structure from one individual ownership to any form of multiple
ownership, including, but not limited to, condominiums, stock cooperatives and
community housing projects, but not including limited equity cooperatives, the
subdivision of which shall be governed by the procedures set forth in the
subdivision map act. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.25.030: PURPOSE:
This chapter is enacted for the following reasons:
   A.   To establish procedures and standards for the conversion of existing
multiple-family rental housing to condominiums;
   B.   To reduce the impact of such conversions on tenants who may be required
to relocate due to the conversion of apartments to condominiums by providing
for procedures for notification and adequate time and assistance for relocation
to comparable rental housing and rates;
   C.   To assure that purchasers of converted housing have been properly
informed as to the physical condition of the structure which is offered for
purchase;
   D.   To ensure that converted housing achieves a high standard of
appearance, quality and safety, and is consistent with the goals of the city;
   E.   To ensure that the project sponsor provides for improvements or
rehabilitation to result in a project which provides housing which is in good
condition and without hidden needs for maintenance and repair;
   F.   To provide a desirable balance of rental and ownership housing and a
variety of individual choice of tenure, type, price and location of housing;
   G.   To provide the opportunity for low and moderate income persons to
participate in the ownership process, as well as to maintain a supply of rental
housing for low and moderate income persons; and
   H.   To assure that adequate rental housing is available in the community.
(Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.25.040: APPLICATION PROCEDURES:
The following procedures and regulations shall apply to condominium conversion
tentative map applications:
   A.   Tentative Maps: Condominium conversions may be permitted in any
residential district subject to the provisions as set forth in title 18 of this
code, and subject to the approval of a tentative map. Such applications shall
contain all the information required for a tentative map pursuant to this code.
   B.   Acceptance: The community development department shall accept
applications for condominium conversions if any one of the following factors
exists:
      1.   Conversions may be approved when the vacancy rate of multiple-
family rental developments within the city, as determined by the community
development director, is equal to or more than five percent (5%), unless the
conversion will result in a decrease of the vacancy rate to less than four and
nine-tenths percent (4.9%); or
      2.   Tenants lawfully in possession of seventy five percent (75%) of the
units indicate their desire (1 vote per unit) to convert such units to
condominium ownership in writing to the city. Tenants shall be provided with
information on all estimated costs, including, but not limited to, the unit
cost, down payment requirements, financing, estimated property management
costs, and homeowners' association fees. Specific estimates of such costs shall
be acknowledged in writing by the city. If the conversion is approved, the
developer shall provide information to the city on the number of tenants who
actually purchased. If at any time during the conversion approval process a
sufficient number of tenants decide not to purchase, or if misrepresentation is
discovered, the commission shall have sufficient grounds for denial; or
      3.   The applicant agrees to sell or rent at affordable prices forty
percent (40%) of the units to low or moderate income households, as defined in
section 50093 of the California Health and Safety Code, with a minimum of
twenty percent (20%) of the units affordable to lower income households, as
defined in section 50079.5 of the California Health and Safety Code. If the
units are to be made available for purchase, the sales price of such units
shall not exceed two and five-tenths (2.5) times the annual median income for
low or moderate income households as defined by California Health and Safety
Code section 50093. Resale controls shall be included as a deed restriction as
specified by the planning commission. If the units are to be for rental, they
shall either be included in the county administered section 8 program, or the
maximum rent allowed shall keep the units within the low or moderate income
housing stock. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.25.050: REQUIRED REPORTS AND INFORMATION:
The project as a whole shall be in good repair on the interior and the exterior

each of the unsold units. The amount of the fee, if conditions warrant, may be
increased above the established fee by the planning commission. Such funds
shall be used solely and exclusively as a contingency fund for emergencies
which may arise relating to open space areas, exterior portions of dwelling
units, and such other restoration or repairs as may be assumed by the
homeowners' association. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)

applications for rent increases, the planning commission shall consider the
University of California housing office apartment vacancy and rental rate
report or residential rent component of the San Bernardino area cost of living
index of the United States department of labor, the condition of the unit,
prevailing rents for similar units, and a reasonable rate of return on the
owner's investment.
   F.   Special Cases:
      1.   All nonpurchasing tenants sixty two (62) years of age or older and
all nonpurchasing medically proven permanently disabled tenants shall be
offered a lifetime lease. Rents for such tenants shall not be increased for two
(2) years after the filing of the project application. At the end of the two
(2) year period, any increase in rent shall first be approved by the planning
commission. When reviewing applications for rent increases, the planning
commission shall consider the residential rent component of the San Bernardino
area cost of living index of the United States department of labor, the
condition of the unit, prevailing rents for similar units, and a reasonable
rate of return on the owners investment.
      2.   The following nonpurchasing tenants shall receive a minimum of
twelve (12) months' relocation time, measured from the tentative map approval,
to find replacement housing:
         a.   Tenants with low or moderate incomes as defined in California
Health and Safety Code section 50093;
         b.   Tenants with minor children in school.
   G.   Moving Expenses: The subdivider shall provide moving expenses equal to
three (3) times the monthly rent to any tenant, in compliance with the terms of
the subject lease, who relocates from the building to be converted after city
approval of the tentative map. When the tenant has given notice of his intent
to move prior to city approval of the tentative map, eligibility to receive
moving expenses shall be forfeited.
   H.   Relocation Assistance: Relocation assistance shall be provided by the
subdivider to nonpurchasing tenants for a minimum period of four (4) months
following the tentative map approval. Information on available rental units in
the same general area with costs comparable to the preconverted apartments
shall be provided regularly and updated. Copies of the list shall be posted on
site, dated, and provided to the department.
   I.   Discrimination: No discrimination in the sale of any unit shall be
based on age, and a statement to this effect shall be included in the
covenants, conditions and restrictions. Projects created exclusively for the
purpose of providing senior citizen housing shall be exempted from this
requirement.
   J.   Certification Of Occupancy: A certificate of occupancy shall be issued
by the building official prior to the occupancy of units after sales.
   K.   Effect Of Proposed Conversions On The City's Low Income And Moderate
Income Housing Supply: In reviewing requests for the conversion of existing
apartments to condominiums, the planning commission shall also consider the
following:
      1.   Whether or not the amount and impact of the displacement of tenants,
if the conversion is approved, would be detrimental to the health, safety or
general welfare of the community;
      2.   The role the apartment structure plays in the existing housing
rental market. Particular emphasis will be placed on the evaluation of rental
structures to determine if the existing apartment complex is serving low income
and moderate income households. Standard definitions of low income and moderate
income and low income and moderate income rents used by the federal and state
governments shall be used in the evaluation;
      3.   The need and demand for lower cost home ownership opportunities
which are increased by the conversion of apartments to condominiums; and
      4.   If the planning commission determines that vacancies in the project
have been increased for the purpose of preparing the project for conversion,
the application may be disapproved. In the evaluation of the current vacancy
level under this subsection, the increase in rental rates for each unit over
the preceding three (3) years and the average monthly vacancy rate for the
project over the preceding two (2) years shall be considered.
   L.   Findings: The planning commission shall not approve an application for
a condominium conversion unless the planning commission finds that:
      1.   All the provisions of the subdivision map act, this title, and other
applicable provisions of this code are met;
      2.   The proposed conversion is consistent with the general plan and the
adopted housing element and any applicable specific plan;
      3.   The proposed conversion will conform to the provisions of this code
in effect at the time of the project approval, except as otherwise provided in
this section;
      4.   The overall design and physical condition of the condominium
conversion achieves a high standard of appearance, quality and safety;
      5.   The proposed conversion will not displace a significant percentage
of low income or moderate income, permanently or totally disabled, or senior
citizen tenants, or delete a significant number of low income and moderate
income rental units from the city's housing stock at the time when no
equivalent housing is readily available in the Redlands area;
      6.   The application process has conformed to all the requirements of the
subdivision map act and this title; and
      7.   The dwelling units to be converted have been constructed and used as
rental units for at least five (5) years prior to the application for
conversion or have received an approved housing allocation. (Ord. 2481 § 1,
2002)

full compliance with the provisions of the subdivision map act and this title
has been filed for record by the county recorder.
   C.   Conveyances of any part of a division of real property for which a
final or parcel map is required by the subdivision map act or this title shall
not be made by parcel or block number, letter or other designation, unless and
until such map has been filed for record by the county recorder.
   D.   This section does not apply to any parcel or parcels of a subdivision
offered for sale or lease, contracted for sale or lease, or sold or leased in
compliance with or exempt from any law, including this title, regulating the
design and improvement of subdivisions in effect at the time the subdivision
was established.
   E.   Nothing contained in subsections A and B of this section shall be
deemed to prohibit an offer or contract to sell, lease or finance real property
or to construct improvements thereon where such sale, lease or financing, or
the commencement of such construction, is expressly conditioned upon the
approval and filing of a final map or parcel map, as required under subdivision
map act or this title. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.27.020: REMEDIES:
   A.   Any deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell real property which
has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the
provisions of the subdivision map act or this title, is voidable at the sole
option of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, any heirs,
personal representative, or trustee in insolvency or bankruptcy thereof within
one year after the date of discovery of such violation. The deed of conveyance,
sale or contract to sell is binding upon any successor in interest of the
grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, other than those above
enumerated, and upon the grantor, vendor or person contracting to sell, or his
or her assignee, heir or devisee.
   B.   Any grantee, or successor in interest thereof, of real property which
has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the
provisions of this title or the subdivision map act may, within one year of the
date of discovery of such violation, bring an action in the superior court to
recover any damages suffered by reason of such division of property. The action
may be brought against the person who so divided the property and against any
successors in interest who have actual or constructive knowledge of such
division of property.
   C.   The provisions of this section shall not apply to the conveyance of any
parcel of real property identified in a certificate of compliance filed
pursuant to section
17.27.030 of this chapter or identified in a recorded final map or parcel map,
from and after the date of recording.
The provisions of this section shall not limit or affect in any way the rights
of a grantee or successor in interest under any other provision of law.
   D.   This section does not bar any legal, equitable or summary remedy to
which the city or other public agency, or any person, firm or corporation may
otherwise be entitled, and the city or other public agency, or such person,
firm or corporation may file a suit in the superior court to restrain or enjoin
any attempted or proposed subdivision or sale, lease, or financing in violation
of the subdivision map act or this title.
   E.   The city shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to
develop any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a
division, in violation of the provisions of the subdivision map act or this
title if it finds that development of such real property is contrary to the
public health or the public safety. The authority to deny such a permit or
approval shall apply whether the applicant therefor was the owner of record at
the time of such violation or whether the applicant therefor is either the
current owner of record or a vendee thereof with, or without, actual or
constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of an
interest in such real property.
If the city issues a permit or grants approval for the development of any real
property illegally subdivided, the city may impose those additional conditions
which would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time
the current owner of record acquired the property. If the property has the same
owner of record as at the time of the initial violation, the city may impose
conditions applicable to a current division of the property. If a conditional
certificate of compliance has been filed for record in accordance with the
provisions of section
17.27.030 of this chapter, only those conditions stipulated in that certificate
shall be applicable. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.27.030: CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE:
   A.   Any person owning real property or a vendee of such person pursuant to
a contract of sale of such real property may request the planning commission to
determine whether the real property complies with the provisions of the
subdivision map act and this title.
   B.   If the planning commission determines that the real property complies
with the provisions of the subdivision map act and this title, the city
engineer shall file a certificate of compliance for record with the county
recorder. The certificate of compliance shall identify the real property and
shall state that the division thereof complies with the provisions of the
subdivision map act and this title.
   C.   If the planning commission determines that the real property does not
comply with the provisions of the subdivision map act or this title, the
planning commission may, as a condition to granting a certificate of
compliance, impose conditions in accordance with subsection
 17.27.020E of this chapter. Upon the planning commission's making such a
determination and establishing such conditions, the department shall file a
conditional certificate of compliance for record with the county recorder. Such
certificate shall serve as notice to the property owner or vendee who has
applied for the certificate, a grantee of the property owner or any subsequent
transferee or assignee of the property, that the fulfillment and implementation
of such conditions shall be required prior to subsequent issuance of a permit
or other grant of approval for development of the property. Compliance with
such conditions shall not be required until such time as a permit or other
grant of approval for development of such property is issued by the city.
   D.   A recorded final map or parcel map shall constitute a certificate of
compliance with respect to the parcels of property described within.
   E.   Subject to the provisions of section 66499.35(e) of the subdivision map
act, an official map prepared pursuant to section 66499.52(b) of the
subdivision map act shall constitute a certificate of compliance with respect
to the parcels of real property described therein.
   F.   A fee and/or deposit shall be charged to the applicant for making the
determination and processing the certificate of compliance in accordance with
section
17.01.060 of this title. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)
17.27.040: NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
If the department has knowledge that real property has been divided in
violation of the provisions of the subdivision map act or this title, a notice
of intention to record a notice of violation shall be mailed by the department
by certified mail to the current owner of record. The notice shall describe the
property in detail, name the owners, describe the violation and state that the
owner will be given the opportunity to present evidence. The notice shall also
contain an explanation as to why the subject parcel is not lawful under
sections 66412.6(a) and (b) of the subdivision map act. The notice shall
specify the date, time and place for a meeting at which the owner may present
evidence to the planning commission why a notice of violation should not be
recorded.
The meeting shall be held no sooner than thirty (30) days and no later than
sixty (60) days from the date of mailing of the notice of intention to record a
notice of violation. If, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the notice, the
owner fails to file with the department a written objection to recording the
notice of violation, the department shall file the notice of violation for
record with the county recorder. If, after the owner has presented evidence,
the planning commission determines that there has been no violation, the
department shall mail a clearance letter to the then current owner of record.
If, however, after the owner has presented evidence, the planning commission
determines that the property has in fact been illegally divided, the department
shall record the notice of violation for record with the county recorder. The
notice of violation, when recorded, shall be deemed to be constructive notice
of the violation to all successors in interest in such property. (Ord. 2481 §
1, 2002)
17.27.050: VIOLATION AS A MISDEMEANOR:
In addition to the remedies and procedures provided in this title, any person
violating any of the provisions, or failing to comply with any of the
regulatory requirements, of this title shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Any
person convicted of a misdemeanor under the provisions of this title shall be
punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding six (6) months or
by fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or by both. Except as
otherwise provided in this title, each person shall be guilty of a separate
offense for each and every day during any portion of which any violation of any
provision of this title is committed, continued or permitted by such person and
shall be punishable accordingly. (Ord. 2481 § 1, 2002)

desirability of the community, and consequently affects property values and the
taxable value of property in the city.
   B.   Many neighborhoods in other communities have deteriorated as a result
of poor planning, neglect of proper design standards, and the erection of
buildings and structures incompatible with the character of the neighborhood,
resulting in the reduction of property values and the impairment of the public
health, safety and welfare. The city wishes to avoid and prevent such
deterioration, to recognize the interdependence of land values and aesthetics,
and to provide appropriate guidelines to preserve and enhance the property
values, visual character of the community, and the public health, safety and

standards and devices, and the plan for any grading.
   B.   The planning commission shall either approve, conditionally approve, or
deny the architectural plans.
   C.   The approval, with or without conditions, or denial by the planning
commission of an application for architectural approval shall be final unless,
within ten (10) days from the date of action by the planning commission, the
applicant or any other person shall appeal therefrom in writing to the city
council. Such appeal shall be filed in writing with the city clerk on a form
provided by the planning department, and shall indicate the grounds of the

18.12.170: ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW; CRITERIA:
   A.   The planning commission shall review the material submitted with the
application, and specific aspects of design shall be examined to determine
whether the proposed development is in conformity with the provisions of this

minimum size that would allow construction may be increased through property
aggregation to meet minimum building requirements for a dwelling unit. (Ord.
2687 § 1, 2008)
18.138.040: DEFINITIONS:
Certain terms used in this chapter shall be defined for purposes of this
chapter only, as follows:
   AVERAGE CROSS SLOPE: The method of determining natural cross slope of land
by using the following equation:

development.
   BUILDING SITE SLOPE: The average natural slope of the area designated as the
building envelope measured at right angles to the natural contours along a line
passing through the center of the building envelope; such line shall terminate
at the opposite edges of the proposed building, or at the opposite edges of the
proposed cut or fill, whichever distance is greater.
   DEVELOPMENT: Any alteration of the natural or existing configuration of the
earth's surface or vegetative cover creating residential and accessory
facilities, including any and all utility services and circulation areas, such
as streets, private roads, parking areas or driveways. An alteration of or any
addition to a structure or circulation area which existed prior to December 11,
1987, and does not exceed either one thousand (1,000) square feet or twenty
five percent (25%) of the area covered by the existing structure, whichever is
greater, shall not be considered "development".
   DIVIDE: To separate into two (2) or more land parcels.
   EXPOSED SLOPE: All the face of a cut or fill, from the toe to the top,
whether the surface is retaining walls, riprap, natural vegetation or other
materials.
   LAND PARCEL: An area of land with boundaries recorded in the San Bernardino
County recorder's office.
   PROJECT SITE: An area consisting of one or more land parcels that is
planned, reviewed and developed as a unified project.
   SLOPE PLAN: A plan for development, clearly depicting all proposed grading

§ 1, 2008)
18.138.050: SLOPE DENSITY REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Maximum dwelling unit density on portions of land parcels with a cross
slope of fifteen (15) to thirty percent (30%) shall not exceed one dwelling
unit per two and one-half (21/2) acres. Note: In the A-1 zone these densities
shall be used for the purpose of combining under subsection D of this section,
however, the total number of lots shall not exceed the number permitted by the
A-1 zoning standards.
   B.   Maximum dwelling unit density on portions of land parcels with a cross
slope exceeding thirty percent (30%) shall not exceed one dwelling unit per ten
(10) acres unless the following conditions are met:

40 and greater      10.0
 
   C.   Maximum dwelling unit density on portions of land parcels with a cross
slope of less than fifteen percent (15%) shall be as determined by the general
plan and zoning standards. In the A-1 zone, a density of one dwelling unit per
two and one-half (21/2) acres shall apply. Note: In the A-1 zone these
densities shall be used for the purpose of combining under subsection D of this
section; however, the total number of lots shall not exceed the number
permitted by the A-1 zoning standards.
   D.   Permitted densities may be combined within any land parcel, so long as
the number of dwelling units to be placed on a parcel does not exceed the sum

18.144.010: PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS:
The purpose of the planned residential development provisions is to provide for
greater flexibility in the design of residential developments and the promotion
of a more efficient, aesthetically pleasing and desirable use of land. It is
intended that developments proposed under the provisions of this chapter shall
be planned and designed in a manner that will retain the general configuration
of the natural terrain and existing plantings in order to maintain and enhance
the locally recognized values of community appearance. (Ord. 1000 § 52.50,
1955)
18.144.020: PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT DEFINED:
"Planned residential development" means a development located on a site
approved as a subdivision, to be constructed by a person or corporate body,
involving a variety of residential structure types, planned as a total entity
and, therefore, subject to approval, development and regulation as one land use
complex. (Ord. 1000 § 52.51(A), 1955)
18.144.030: ESTABLISHMENT CONDITIONS AND PROCEDURES:
A planned residential development may be permitted in any residential or
agricultural district. Such a development shall have sufficient land area to
meet the objectives and standards set forth in this section and sections
18.144.020 and
18.144.040 through
18.144.060 of this chapter. The requirements and procedures established herein
shall prevail over any conflicting requirements of this title, or those in the
laws and ordinances governing the subdivision of land. (Ord. 2136 § 2, 1990:
Ord. 1000 § 52.51(B), 1955)
18.144.040: PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT; REVIEW CRITERIA:
The planning commission shall review the site plan and elevations for the
proposed development to determine its conformity with the standards set forth
in the city's general plan, the regulations of sections
18.144.020 through
18.144.060 of this chapter, and recognized principles of urban design, land use
planning, circulation, and landscape architecture. The commission may approve
the proposed plan, impose essential conditions regarding the layout,
circulation and methods of operation and maintenance of the proposed
development and, in addition, the commission may require that appropriate and
enforceable deed restrictions acceptable by the city be filed with the county
recorder. The commission may disapprove the plan if, in their opinion, the
application does not comply with any of these criteria. (Ord. 1000 § 52.51(C),
1955)
18.144.050: DWELLING UNITS PER ACRE:
   A.   The maximum number of dwelling units per acre of net development area
for sites under fifteen percent (15%) slope shall be as follows:
 
Zone Number
R-1  6.5
R-S  4.5
R-E  3.0
R-A  2.0
 
Densities within the R-R, A-1 and A-2 are established by the zone
classification.
   B.   The maximum number of dwelling units per area for sites with an average
slope of fifteen percent (15%) or over shall be in accordance with the HD
hillside development district, chapter 18.138 of this title.
   C.   "Net development area" is defined as the gross area of the site less
land area required for completion of perimeter streets and/or streets required
by the circulation element of the general plan and less land area within the
project set aside for schools, churches, flood control improvements, and other
nonresidential uses. Common open space shall be considered in calculating the
gross area of the site. Public parks if included as part of the open space
shall also be considered in calculating the gross area of the site. (Ord. 2136
§ 3, 1990: Ord. 1000 § 52.51(D), 1955)
18.144.060: ARRANGEMENT OF BUILDING TYPES:
The location and distribution of the various permitted dwelling unit types
shall be approved by the commission. Particular attention will be given to
those units to be located on the perimeter of the site, taking into
consideration the relationship and compatibility of such dwelling to the
character and future development of surrounding properties. The commission may
require that only single-family detached dwellings be located in those areas of
the site where other types of permitted dwelling units are determined to be not
in conformity with the character of the adjacent area. (Ord. 1000 § 52.51(E),
1955)
18.144.070: PERMITTED USES AND ACCESSORY USES:

      2.   For the purposes of this title, all permitted dwelling types are
considered to be single-family in nature. Each unit shall be a separate and
complete entity extending from the lowest floor level to the highest point of
the building. There shall be no placement of separate dwelling units above one
another in order that each unit will be directly accessible to private, ground
level open spaces;
      3.   Where dwelling units and/or accessory structures abut on adjacent
lots, such dwellings or structures shall be structurally independent, with not
less than one inch (1") of separation between them;
      4.   Citrus and avocado groves and other agricultural uses as permitted
by the underlying zone.
   B.   Accessory Uses: In addition to the accessory uses permitted in the
district, the following uses are permitted only where they are an integral part

yard(s) in a planned residential development may be reduced below that required
by the underlying zone district, subject to approval by the planning commission
pursuant to the conditional use permit. Where the side yard(s) does not permit
the parking of recreational vehicles, then the CC&Rs for the project shall
prohibit the parking of such vehicles on separate lots within the development.
No window or door openings are permitted on the zero setback line.
      2.   For attached single-family residences or patio houses and
townhouses, both interior side yards between structures in a series or group

erected or located on a lot unless such building, structure or enlargement
conforms with the area regulations of the district in which it is located:
   A.   No parcel of land held under separate ownership at the time of the
effective date hereof may be reduced in any manner below the minimum standards
established by such ordinance for the district within which the lot is located.
   B.   No lot area may be so reduced or diminished that the yards or other
open spaces will be smaller than prescribed by this title, nor may the
occupancy be increased in any manner except in conformity with the regulations
herein established.
   C.   No required yard or other open space around an existing building, or
which is hereafter provided around any building for the purpose of complying
with the provisions of this title, may be considered as providing a yard or
open space for any other building, nor may any yard or other required open
space on an adjoining lot be considered as providing a yard or open space on a
lot whereon a building is to be erected.
   D.   No parking area, parking space or loading space which is provided for

relinquished or reduced in any manner below the requirements established in
this title, unless equivalent facilities are provided elsewhere, the location
of which is approved by the commission. (Ord. 1000 § 35.00, 1955)
18.148.020: INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES:
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district, as shown on the
land use zoning map, the following shall apply:
   A.   Street, Alley Or Lot Lines: Where indicated, district boundaries are
approximately street, alley or lot lines, such lines are determined to be the
boundaries of the district. Otherwise, the boundaries shall be determined by
the dimensions shown on the land use zoning map. In the absence of a dimension,
the boundary shall be determined by use of the scale shown on the map.
   B.   Rights Of Way Or Watercourses: A street, alley, railroad or railway
right of way, watercourse, channel or body of water, included on the zoning
map, shall, unless otherwise indicated, be included within the zone of
adjoining property on either side thereof, and where such street, alley, right
of way, watercourse, channel or body of water serves as a boundary between two
(2) or more different zoning districts, a line midway in such street, alley,
right of way, etc., extending in the general direction of the long dimension
thereof shall be considered the boundary between zoning districts.
   C.   Uncertainties: Where uncertainties exist, the commission shall, by
written decision, determine the location of the district boundary or building
setback line.
   D.   Vacations: In the event that a vacated street, alley, right of way or
easement was the boundary between two (2) districts, the new zoning district
boundaries shall be at the new property line. (Ord. 1000 § 36.00, 1955)
18.148.030: SETBACK AND YARD SPECIFICATIONS:
   A.   The front yard requirements for the various districts shall determine
the minimum and maximum building setback from the front property lines.
   B.   In each block in the R-A, R-E, R-S, R-1, R-1-D, R-2 and R-3 residential
districts, where fifty percent (50%) or more of the frontage on a side of a
given street is already built up, the average distance from the main building
front to the property line of existing buildings shall be determined to be the
setback line, provided, however, that in no case shall this distance be less
than fifteen feet (15').
   C.   In no case shall main buildings in a residential district be set back
further than forty feet (40') from any front property line, unless provision is
made for a future street or street widening, alleys, or alley widening; in
which case, the distance shall be not more than forty feet (40') from the
future property line as determined by the commission. Deed restrictions
existing on the effective date, if requiring a greater setback than forty feet
(40'), shall take precedence over this section. This maximum forty foot (40')
building setback line is waived for properties located in zones A-1, A-2, R-
A and R-E.
   D.   On key lots, the minimum front yard shall be the average of the front
yard for the adjoining interior lot and the side yard required for the reversed
corner lot. When buildings on the adjoining interior lot may be closer to the
property line than the distance prescribed for such front yard by this title,
the location of the existing building shall determine the front yard on such
interior lot, but in no case may the key lot front yard be less than fifteen
feet (15').
   E.   On corner lots, in residential districts, side yards abutting the
street shall be not less than the required front yard for lots in the district
in which the lot is located, and in no case, not less than fifteen feet (15').
Private garages located in the side yard on the side street shall be located at
least twenty feet (20') from the property line on the side street.
   F.   On a reversed corner lot, the side yard abutting the side street shall
be not less than the distance required for a front yard on the interior lots on
the side street, provided, however, that the yard shall be not less than
fifteen feet (15'). Private garages located in the side yard within fifty feet
(50') of the key lot shall be set back the same distance from the side lot line
of the reversed corner lot as the front yard for the key lot to its rear.
   G.   Where property has a slope of more than ten percent (10%), the maximum
front yard requirement of this title is waived. (Ord. 1000 § 37.00, 1955)
18.148.040: YARDS; MEASUREMENT PROCEDURES:
   A.   In measuring a front yard or side yard adjoining a street, it shall be
the perpendicular distance between the street and a line through the corner or
face of the building closest to and drawn parallel with the street, excluding
any architectural features permitted in section
18.152.070 of this title.
   B.   If any future right of way line has been established by provisions of a
specific ordinance, or by the general plan, then the measurement of the yard
shall be made from the future right of way line, or future property line so
defined. (Ord. 1000 § 38.00(A), 1955)
18.148.050: SIDE YARDS IN HILLSIDE AREAS:
Where building sites are graded into generally horizontal planes, and where the
difference in elevation between contiguous building sites is greater than three
feet (3'), the required side yard at the toe of the slope shall be increased by
one foot (1') for each foot, or portion thereof, over three feet (3') of
elevation differential. In no case may any building or structure be closer than
three feet (3') from the toe of the slope in such side yard, so as to provide
for drainage away from the building. (Ord. 1000 § 38.00(B), 1955)
18.148.060: YARDS; NEW SINGLE-FAMILY SUBDIVISIONS IN R-1 AND R-S ZONES:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of these provisions is to provide for flexibility
in the location and arrangement of homes in smaller lot subdivisions in order
to permit a greater variety in the design of such homes. The "buildable area",
within the context of this section is defined as the lot area within the
standard setbacks of the zone.
   B.   Variation: The side and rear yard requirements may be varied in
accordance with the following provisions:
      1.   Side Yards: Structures may be placed along one side property line
for up to sixty five percent (65%) of the lot depth, provided that the opposite
side yard is not less in width than the combined side yard requirement for the
zone. For corner lots, one side yard shall be considered a rear yard; however,
the combined side and rear yard for corner lots need not exceed twenty five
feet (25'). The distance from structures on adjacent lots shall be not less
than ten feet (10'). Where structures have zero side yards, appropriate
easements for painting and maintenance shall be provided on the adjacent lot.
No zero side yards may be located along property lines abutting land not a part
of the subdivision. No window or door openings are permitted on the zero
setback line.
      2.   Rear Yards: A portion of the main building or attached garage up to
thirty feet (30') in width may project into the required rear yard area to
within ten feet (10') of the rear property line, provided that there is a
corresponding reduction in the buildable area which is equal to the area of the
projection.
   C.   Recording Of Setback Lines And Easements Required:
      1.   All setback lines shall be approved by the director of planning, and
designated on the final recorded tract map.
      2.   All required easements and covenants necessary to provide
appropriate access for adjacent properties shall be filed with the final tract
map and be recorded as a part thereof. (Ord. 1000 § 38.00(C), 1955)
18.148.070: AGRICULTURAL GROVES:
   A.   The planting, cultivating and maintenance of agricultural groves is a
permitted use in any zone district; however, such groves shall be maintained in
a healthy, live condition in accordance with customary agricultural practices.
Failure to maintain any agricultural grove in such manner that the trees are
kept alive shall be cause for the city to require abatement of the condition by
the removal of any and all dead trees, and to enforce such requirement, as
provided in this title.
   B.   For the purpose of this section, ten (10) or more trees shall be
considered an "agricultural grove". (Ord. 1000 § 46.30, 1955)

control operator. The developer shall repair or replace any damaged or infested
areas in need of repair or replacement, as shown in the structural pest report;
      3.   A report on any known soil and geological conditions regarding soil
deposits, rock formations, faults, ground water and landslides in the vicinity

amendments thereto, prior to the time of filing an application under this
article;
      5.   The developer shall provide moving expenses of two (2) times the

after approval of the condominium conversion by the city, except where the
tenant has given notice of his intent to move prior to receipt of notification
from the developer of his intent to convert;

residences. (Ord. 2985, 2025)
18.156.1310: DEFINITIONS:
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT: A residential dwelling unit that is accessory and
subordinate to a primary dwelling unit located on the same parcel, and such
accessory unit meets the criteria or requirements for an Accessory Dwelling
Unit pursuant to Redlands Municipal Code
Chapter 18.156, Article VII (Accessory Dwelling Units) or current State law.
PRIMARY DWELLING UNIT: For purposes of this article, means a single-family
residence that does not meet the criteria or requirements for an Accessory
Dwelling Unit pursuant to Redlands Municipal Code

a two-unit project. "Individual property owner" means a natural person holding
fee title individually or jointly in the person's own name or a beneficiary of
a trust that holds fee title. Corporations, including but not limited to LLCs,

18.156.1330: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
A two-unit project must satisfy each of the following development standards and
requirements:
   A.   Map Act Compliance: The existing lot must have been legally subdivided.
   B.   Zone: The lot is in a single-family residential zone of the City of
Redlands (R-1, R-1-D, R-S, R-A, R-A-A, R-E, R-R, or R-R-A zoning districts) or
a single-family district within an adopted Specific Plan of the City.
   C.   Lot Location: The lot is not located on a site that meets any of the
location criteria as listed in Government Code § 66411.7(a)(3)(C) (and
incorporating Government Code section 65913.4(a)(6)(B) - (K) by reference).
   D.   Not Historic: The lot shall not be within a site that is designated or
listed as a city landmark or historic property or historic/scenic district, and
the lot shall not be a historic property or within a historic district that is
listed on the State Historic Resources Inventory (as defined in Section 5020.1
of the Public Resources Code).
   E.   No Impact On Protected Housing: The two-unit project must not require
or include the demolition or alteration of any of the types of housing
identified in Government Code § 65852.21(a)(3)-(4), inclusive.
      1.   Housing that is income-restricted for households of moderate, low,
or very low income.
      2.   Housing that is subject to any form of rent or price control through
a public entity's valid exercise of its policy power.
      3.   Housing that has been occupied by a tenant in the last three (3)
years. The applicant and the owner of a property for which a two-unit
development is sought must provide a sworn statement as to this fact with the
application for the parcel map. The City may conduct its own inquiries and
investigation to ascertain the veracity of the sworn statement, including but
not limited to, surveying owners of nearby properties; and the City may require
additional evidence of the applicant and owner as necessary to determine
compliance with this requirement.
   F.   Dwelling Unit Standards:
      1.   Quantity: For purposes of this section, "unit" means any dwelling
unit, including, but not limited to, a primary dwelling unit, a unit created
under this section of this code, an ADU, or a Junior ADU.
         a.   No more than two (2) dwelling units of any kind may be built on a
lot that results from an urban lot split
         b.   A lot that is not created by an urban lot split may have a two-
unit project under this section, plus any ADU or Junior ADU that must be
allowed under State law and the City's ADU ordinance, not to exceed two (2)
primary dwelling units per lot and a combined total of four (4) dwelling units
within the development.
      2.   Height Restriction: All dwelling units shall be subject to the same
height limitations applicable to the underlying zone.
      3.   Lot Coverage: The lot coverage limit shall be applicable within the
zoning district where the subject property is located. This lot coverage
standard is only enforced to the extent that it does not prevent the
construction of two (2) primary dwelling units on the lot at eight hundred
(800) square feet each.
      4.   Open Space: The new development shall be subject to the open space
requirement, if any, imposed within the zoning district where the subject
property is located. This open space standard is only enforced to the extent
that it does not prevent the construction of two (2) primary dwelling units on
the lot at eight hundred (800) square feet each.
      5.   Setbacks:
         a.   Generally: All setbacks must conform to those objective setbacks
that are applicable to the underlying zone.
         b.   Exceptions: Notwithstanding subsection F1a above:
            (1)   Existing Structures: No setback is required for an existing
legally established structure or for a new structure that is constructed in the
same location and to the same dimensions as an existing legally established
structure.
            (2)   Eight hundred (800) square-feet; four-foot (4') side and rear
setbacks. Exceptions to the setbacks imposed by the underlying zone may be
applied to the degree necessary to avoid physically precluding up to two (2)
units on the lot or either of the two (2) units from being of at least eight
hundred (800) square feet in floor area on the subject property; but in no
event may any structure be less than four feet (4') from a side or rear
property line.
            (3)   New Structures: Shared interior lot line; zero foot (0')
interior side setback. Setback requirements for an interior side lot line,
where the interior lot line is shared between the two (2) new parcels (and the
lot line is perpendicular to the primary street frontage of both lots), may be
modified to permit a zero foot (0') side setback. The intent of this provision
is to permit a shared wall between two (2) new dwelling units on separate lots,
so that the combined structure has the appearance from the street as one
single-family residence. Designs with a shared common wall shall comply with
all applicable California Building Code regulations, and the Director may
require a Homeowners' Association as well as CC&Rs for the subject properties.
If this provision for a zero foot (0') interior side setback is not utilized,
then the standard setback requirement shall apply, and in no case shall be less
than four feet (4').
      6.   Parking: Each new primary dwelling unit shall have one (1) off-
street parking space per unit on a paved surface, which may be covered or
uncovered, placed outside of all required setbacks, and constructed in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Article I of
Chapter 18.164 of this title. Off-street parking shall not be required if one
of the following applies:
         a.   The lot is located within one-half mile walking distance of
either:
            (1)   A corridor with fixed route bus service with service
intervals no longer than fifteen (15) minutes during peak commute hours; or
            (2)   A site that contains one of the following: an existing rail
or bus rapid transit station; or the intersection of two (2) or more major bus
routes with a frequency of service interval of fifteen (15) minutes or less
during the morning and afternoon peak commute periods.
         b.   The site is located within one block of a car-share vehicle
location that is permanently installed and permanently marked for car-share
pickup or dropoff service.
      7.   Nonconforming Conditions: A two (2) unit project may be approved
without requiring a legal nonconforming zoning condition or standard to be
corrected. This provision shall supersede
Chapter 18.184 of Title 18 of the Redlands Municipal Code for the duration that
applicable State law remains in effect.
      8.   Utilities: Each primary dwelling unit on the lot that is or that is
proposed shall comply with the development regulations applicable to the
underlying zone.
      9.   Building And Safety: All structures built on the lot shall comply
with all building code regulations applicable to the underlying zone.
   G.   Fire Hazard Mitigation Measures: For a development project on a lot
that is located in a fire hazard severity zone (as defined by the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection), the proposal shall comply with all
applicable fire-hazard mitigation measures:
      1.   The proposed development complies with the applicable provisions of
the California Fire Code, and any amendments thereto adopted in the Redlands
Municipal Code, that apply uniformly to development within the underlying zone.
      2.   The proposed development complies with the applicable provisions of
the California Building Code (including Chapter 7A), and any amendments or
additions thereto adopted in the Redlands Municipal Code (including RMC Chapter
15.30 Wildland-Urban Interface Code), that apply uniformly to development
within the underlying zone.
      3.   The subject property will comply with all applicable landscape
design, materials, fuel modification, and vegetation management requirements of
applicable State law (including but not limited to Calif. Gov. Code § 51182,
Public Resources Code § 4291, Calif. Fire Code § 4906, and Calif. Building Code
Chapter 7A) for requirements pertaining to landscape fuel modification zones
and vegetation management that apply uniformly to development within the
underlying zone.
   H.   Regulation Of Uses:
      1.   Residential-Only: No non-residential use is permitted on the lot.
         a.   Home occupations may be permitted with a Home Occupation Permit
issued pursuant to
Chapter 18.160 of this title.
         b.   Small family daycare homes may be permitted pursuant to
Chapter 18.156, Article VIII, of this title.
         c.   Single-room occupancy residential facilities may be permitted
pursuant to
Chapter 18.156, Article XV, of this title.
      2.   No Short-Term Rentals: No dwelling unit on the lot may be rented for
a period of less than thirty (30) days.
   I.   Deed Restriction: The owner must record a deed restriction, acceptable
to the city, that does each of the following:

period of less than thirty (30) days.
      2.   Expressly prohibits any non-residential use of the lot.
      3.   States that the property was developed pursuant to SB 9 and shall
not be further developed with additional primary dwelling units, or further
subdivided subsequent to a prior SB 9 lot split.
   J.   Undergrounding Of Utilities: For construction of new SB 9 dwelling
units, utility laterals and connections shall be installed underground for the
new unit(s). (Ord. 2985, 2025)
18.156.1340:   SPECIFIC ADVERSE IMPACTS:
   A.   Notwithstanding anything else in this section, the city may deny an
application for a two-unit project if the building official makes a written
finding, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the project would have
a "specific, adverse impact" on public health and safety and for which there is
no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse
impact.
   B.   "Specific adverse impact" has the same meaning as in Gov. Code §
65589.5(d)(2): "a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact,
based on objective, identified written public health or safety standards,
policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed
complete" and does not include (1) inconsistency with the zoning ordinance or
general plan land use designation or (2) the eligibility to claim a welfare
exemption under Revenue & Taxation Code section 214(g).
   C.   The building official may consult with and be assisted by Planning
staff, Engineering staff, and others as necessary in making a finding of
specific, adverse impact. (Ord. 2985, 2025)

   G.   A legally parked motor home and/or one commercial licensed vehicle with
a load capacity of one ton or less, owned by the resident occupant, is exempt
from these regulations. For purposes of this section, a "motor home" means a
motorized vehicle that is built on a single truck or motor van chassis
primarily designed to provide temporary living quarters for travel, camping,
recreation and vacation use. Under no circumstances shall any part of the
parked motor home or commercially licensed vehicle overhang into the public
right of way.
   H.   No parking is permitted in required landscaped front yard areas.
   I.   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection B of this section, a
resident of a residential zoned parcel may park a detached camper, trailer, or

surfaced area in the front yard, of said parcel provided that the resident has
obtained a minor exception permit in accordance with sections
18.168.040 through
18.168.100 of this title. Approval of said permit is contingent upon the
following:
      1.   Compliance with this section is not possible or practical, because
there is no other more suitable location in the side or rear yard of the
property for the parking of the vehicle. This finding may be made if such other
location would require significant physical remodeling of structures or
improvements, the removal of significant landscaping, or otherwise be a
hardship to the applicant;
      2.   The proposed location of the vehicle will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety or welfare or be injurious to surrounding properties;
      3.   The vehicle will not overhang into the public right of way;
      4.   The parked vehicle will not interfere with a motorist's line of
sight when approaching an intersection or when exiting a driveway;
      5.   The granting of the minor exception permit is subject to the
following conditions:
         a.   Only one permit shall be issued per residential parcel;
         b.   The permit must identify the vehicle by license number;
         c.   The permit must include an approved site plan that identifies
where on the parcel the vehicle may be parked;
         d.   The vehicle may be partially screened from view of surrounding
properties to the degree possible as determined by the committee reviewing the
permit. Such screening material may consist of fencing, walls or landscaping;
         e.   The vehicle must be maintained in a clean and usable appearance;
         f.   The permit shall expire upon the applicant's termination of their
residency upon the parcel;
         g.   The permit shall expire two (2) years after the date of approval.
An application for a new permit may be requested in accordance with this
section. (Ord. 2567 § 1, 2004: Ord. 2333 § 42, 1997: Ord. 1000 § 39.40(1),
1955)
ARTICLE II. NONRESIDENTIAL PARKING
18.164.140: AMOUNT OF FACILITIES REQUIRED:
Any building or structure constructed or located, and any use of land
established after the effective date hereof, or any subsequent amendment
thereto, shall be required to provide off street parking facilities in
accordance with the provisions of this title. (Ord. 1000 § 40.10(A), 1955)
18.164.150: NONCONFORMING USES:
Any use of property, which on the effective date hereof or of any subsequent
amendment thereto, is nonconforming only as to the regulations relating to off
street parking facilities, may be continued in the same manner as if the
parking facilities were conforming. However, such parking facilities as do
exist shall not be reduced. (Ord. 1000 § 40.10(B), 1955)
18.164.160: VOLUNTARY ESTABLISHMENT:
Nothing in this title shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of
off street parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this
title, provided that all regulations herein governing the location, design and
operation of such facilities are adhered to. (Ord. 1000 § 40.10(C), 1955)
18.164.170: PLOT PLAN APPROVAL REQUIRED:
At the time a building permit is requested for any building or structure, or at
the time a new use of land which would require off street parking is
established, a plot plan shall be submitted to the planning department for
approval or reference to the planning commission for approval whenever
required. (Ord. 1000 § 40.10(D), 1955)
18.164.180: PERMIT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Before any parcel of land is paved with asphaltic concrete or other
surfacing material, a permit shall be obtained from the building and safety
department.
   B.   No building shall be occupied and no final inspection shall be given by
the building and safety department until off street parking spaces are provided
in accordance with the provisions of this section. (Ord. 1000 § 40.10(E), 1955)
18.164.190: USE LIMITATIONS FOR REQUIRED AREA:
Required parking area shall be used exclusively for vehicle parking in
conjunction with a permitted use, and shall not be reduced or encroached upon
in any manner. (Ord. 1000 § 40.10(F), 1955)
18.164.200: PROVISION IS A CONTINUING OBLIGATION:
The required off street parking facilities shall be a continuing obligation of
the property owner so long as the use requiring vehicle parking facilities
continues. It shall be unlawful for an owner of any building or use to
discontinue or dispense with the required vehicle parking facilities without
providing other vehicle parking facilities which meet the requirements of this
title. (Ord. 1000 § 40.10(G), 1955)
18.164.210: APPLICABILITY; PARKING DISTRICT EXEMPTIONS:
The provisions of this title shall apply uniformly throughout the city, except
that property located within the territorial limits of any completed
proceedings for the formation of an off street parking district shall be deemed
to have complied with the provisions of this title. (Ord. 1000 § 40.10(H),
1955)
18.164.215: IN LIEU FEE TO MEET PARKING REQUIREMENTS:
To comply with the parking requirements as outlined in this chapter, an in lieu
parking fee may be paid instead of providing the required parking. This
provision shall apply to changes of use, additions to existing buildings and
new construction. The reduction in the number of required parking spaces and
the payment of the in lieu parking fee shall be allowed, if the commission can
make all of the following findings:
   A.   The proposed new construction is infill construction in an already
densely developed area;
   B.   The size or configuration of the property precludes providing the
required parking; or that providing the required parking would result in the
demolition of qualified historic buildings, either on site or on adjacent
properties;
   C.   The proposed project is compatible in size, scale, massing, bulk,
character, quality and rhythm with the existing streetscape and neighborhood;
   D.   The proposed building and use make a desirable contribution to the
neighborhood;
   E.   Approval of the reduced parking requirement and payment of the in lieu
fee will have no adverse impact on the existing parking district.
The in lieu fees and the in lieu parking fee area map shall be established by
resolution of the city council. Only properties within the defined boundaries
of a designated in lieu parking fee area shall be permitted to use this
provision. Parking facilities funded by the in lieu fee program shall be
located within the boundaries of the in lieu parking fee area. (Ord. 2159 § 1,
1991)
18.164.220: NUMBER OF SPACES; FOR UNSPECIFIED USES:
The required off street parking for any building, structure or use of land
which is not specifically listed in this article shall be determined by the
director of planning. Such determination shall be based upon the requirements
for the most comparable use specified herein. (Ord. 1000 § 40.10(I), 1955)
18.164.230: CLASSIFICATION OF USES; CLARIFICATION PROCEDURE:
If ambiguity or an omission arises concerning the appropriate classification of
a particular use within the meaning and intent of this chapter, the matter
shall be referred to the planning commission for decision. The commission shall
forward its findings to the city council by resolution of record for approval.
(Ord. 1000 § 40.10(J), 1955)
18.164.240: NUMBER OF SPACES; SPECIFIC USES DESIGNATED:
The number of off street parking spaces or amount of parking area required for
each listed use shall be not less than that set forth in this section. Whenever
more than one method of calculating the required number of spaces or area is
indicated, the method which provides the greatest number of spaces shall apply.

chapter for a use considered to be primarily a daytime use may be provided by a
use considered to be primarily a nighttime use; up to fifty percent (50%) of
the parking facilities required by this chapter for a use considered to be
primarily a nighttime use may be provided by a use considered to be primarily a
daytime use, provided that such reciprocal parking area shall be subject to
conditions as set forth in subsection C of this section.
   B.   1. The following uses are typical daytime uses: banks, business and
professional offices, retail stores, personal service shops, clothing or shoe
repair or service shops, and similar uses.
      2.   The following uses are typical of nighttime and/or Sunday uses:
auditoriums, fraternal lodges, churches and theaters.
   C.   Conditions required for joint use:
      1.   A building or use for which application is being made for authority
to utilize the existing off street parking facilities provided by another
building or use, shall be located within one hundred fifty feet (150') of such
parking facilities.
      2.   The applicant shall show that there is no substantial conflict in
the principal operating hours for the buildings or uses for which the joint use
of off street parking facilities is proposed.
      3.   Parties concerned in the joint use of off street parking facilities
shall evidence agreement for such joint use by a proper legal instrument
approved by the city attorney as to form and content. (Ord. 1000 § 40.40, 1955)
18.164.325: ADJUSTMENTS TO OFF STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR MIXED USE
PROJECTS WITHIN SPECIFIC PLAN 45, THE C-3 AND C-4 DISTRICTS:
The purpose of this section is to permit a reduction in the number of required
off street spaces for certain specified uses within a mixed use project through
the sharing of parking resources. This section allows for shared parking for
two (2) or more different land uses listed in this section that are located
adjacent to or near one another on the same mixed use project site.
   A.   Shared parking is based on the hourly variations during the day in the
number of parking spaces needed for each of the different identified uses. The
minimum number of required off street parking spaces is determined by the hour
in which the highest number of spaces is needed for the combined uses. Table
18.164.325(A) of this section shows the percentage of peak parking demand that
occurs for each use for each hour of the weekday. The period during which a use
is expected to generate its peak parking need is indicated as one hundred
percent (100%). Table 18.164.325(B) of this section shows the percentage of
peak parking demand that occurs for each use for each hour of the weekend day.
   B.   For a mixed use project, the total number of required off street
parking spaces for shared parking shall be calculated by using the following
methodology:
 
        Calculate the number of required parking spaces for each independent
Step 1: land use according to the parking standards in section
        18.164.240 of this chapter (nonresidential uses) for a weekday.
        For each different land use, and for each hour of the day, multiply the
        number of required spaces for that use in step 1 of this subsection by
Step 2: the hourly percentage of peak parking demand for that use as identified
        in table
        18.164.325(A) of this section, to determine the number of spaces needed
        for each hour for a weekday.
        For each hour of the day for a weekday, calculate the total number of
Step 3: spaces required for all uses by adding together the number of spaces
        calculated for each individual use in step 2 of this subsection.
        The minimum number of total off street parking spaces required by the
Step 4: overall mixed use development project for a weekday, is then
        represented by the hour for which the total number of spaces is the
        highest, as calculated in step 3 of this subsection.
Step 5: Repeat the above four (4) steps for a weekend day.
        The minimum number of total off street parking spaces required by the
Step 6: overall mixed use development project, is represented by the hour
        (weekday or weekend) for which the total number of spaces is the
        highest, as calculated in step 3 and step 5 of this subsection.
 
   C.   Residential uses shall not be included in the determination of shared
parking requirements, except for visitor parking required for a mixed use
project by article I of this chapter.
   D.   Prior to any substantial change in the tenant mix of a mixed use
project, as determined by the community development director, for which this
section was utilized for compliance with the parking requirements of this code,
an amendment to the entitlement approving the mixed use project shall be
submitted to the reviewing body to demonstrate compliance with the provisions
of this section.
   E.   In allowing a reduction in the number of off street parking spaces
required by a mixed use project under this section, the reviewing body must
determine that:
      1.   The requirements of all other applicable provisions of this chapter
are met; and
      2.   The reduction allowed under this section provides sufficient parking
to serve the intended and potential use of the proposed mixed use project.

ARTICLE IV. LOADING
18.164.330: LOADING SPACE; GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Every hospital, institution, hotel, commercial or industrial building
hereafter erected or established shall have and maintain loading space as
provided in section
18.164.340 of this article.
   B.   When the lot upon which the loading space is located abuts upon an
alley, such loading space shall adjoin and have access from the alley. The
length of the loading space may be measured perpendicular to or parallel with
the centerline of the alley. Where the loading space is parallel with the
alley, the loading space shall extend across the full width of the lot, except
that if only two (2) spaces are required, the length of the loading area need
not exceed fifty feet (50').
   C.   Where the loading area abuts a street, the front yard required in the
district may be used in calculating the area required for loading, providing
that there is not more than one entry or exit to a sixty foot (60') lot, or
fraction thereof.
   D.   Loading space being maintained in connection with any existing main
building on the effective date hereof shall thereafter be maintained so long as
the building remains, unless an equivalent number of such spaces are provided
on a contiguous lot in conformity with the requirements of this chapter;
provided, however, that this regulation shall not require the maintenance of
more loading space than is hereby required for a new building, nor the
maintenance of such space for any type of main building other than those
specified above.
   E.   Loading space required by this title may occupy a required rear yard,
but in no case shall any part of an alley or street be used for loading. (Ord.
1000 § 41.00, 1955)
18.164.340: NUMBER OF SPACES; SPECIFIC USES DESIGNATED:
All hospitals, institutions, hotels, commercial and industrial uses shall
provide loading spaces not less than ten feet (10') in width, twenty feet (20')
in length and fourteen feet (14') in height, as set forth in table 18.164.340
of this section.

ARTICLE V. PARKING MODIFICATIONS FOR HISTORIC STRUCTURES
18.164.410: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this article is to establish a process for the consideration and
approval of a permit for modified parking requirements for historic structures.
The permit allows certain specified citywide parking requirements to be
modified as an incentive to preserve and maintain designated historic
structures. The planning commission shall have the authority to approve a
request for a parking modification permit, subject to the provisions of this
article. (Ord. 2128 § 1, 1990)
18.164.420: DEFINITIONS:
For purposes of this article the following words shall have the meanings
ascribed to them:
   A.   "Historic structure" means a structure included on the city's Register
of Historic and Scenic Properties, list of individually designated historic
resources, or a state or national listing of historical significance. (Ord.
2128 § 1, 1990)
18.164.430: PERMITTED MODIFICATIONS:
   A.   For historic structures located in nonresidential zoning districts, and
for land in residential districts located adjacent to park lands, the off
street parking requirements of section
18.164.240 of this chapter may be modified in one of the following ways:
      1.   A reduction of the required number of parking spaces by twenty
percent (20%); or
      2.   The crediting of on street parking spaces which are adjacent to
frontage of the designated historic structure site towards the total number of
required off street parking spaces required for the use, provided that the
planning commission determines that such on street parking spaces will remain
available for public parking during all business hours in the future. No on
street parking spaces located within fifteen feet (15') of a "stop" sign or
corner radius shall be counted. No on street parking spaces located in front of
a bus stop shall be counted.
   B.   For historic structures located in all zones within the city:
      1.   A reduction of the width of driveway aisles by four feet (4') from
the requirements of section
18.164.280 of this chapter (e.g., from 26 feet to 22 feet for 90 degree
parking).
      2.   Allow the use of off site parking in parking lots that are located
up to four hundred feet (400') away from the historic structure, rather than
two hundred feet (200') as provided in section
18.164.250 of this chapter, where the planning commission determines that the
applicant has provided adequate incentives for the use of such parking lots.
      3.   Allow vehicles to back out into alleys where the planning commission
determines that visibility is good and such backing out of vehicles can be done
safely, notwithstanding the provisions of section
18.164.270 of this chapter.
      4.   Allow twenty five percent (25%) of the parking lot located on the
site of the historic structure to be compact spaces, without requiring the
first twenty five (25) spaces to be full size as required by subsection
18.164.260B2 of this chapter.
      5.   Allow tandem parking where the planning commission determines that
such parking would be effectively used.
      6.   Allow the reduction of the two-way aisle widths specified in table
18.164.280(A) of this chapter from twenty feet (20') to ten feet (10') where
the location of the historic structure on the site prohibits construction of a
full width driveway, and allow the reduction of driveway approaches to fourteen
feet (14'), as opposed to twenty six feet (26') as required in subsection
18.164.270D of this chapter. Such reductions shall only be approved for
driveways to parking areas having less than twenty (20) parking spaces.
      7.   Allow for the use of three foot (3') wide planters for required
landscape areas, notwithstanding the five foot (5') requirement of section
18.168.180 of this title.
      8.   Allow for the deletion of the loading space requirements prescribed
by section
18.164.340 of this chapter for historic structures having less than six
thousand (6,000) square feet of gross floor area.
   C.   The planning commission may approve the parking modification permit
with such conditions as are necessary to adjust the permitted parking
modification to the proposed use and effectuate the purposes of this article.
(Ord. 2128 § 1, 1990)
18.164.440: EFFECT OF ADDITIONS TO HISTORIC STRUCTURES:
Parking modification permits may be approved by the planning commission or city
council for historic structures for which additions are proposed to be
constructed; provided, however, the modification shall not be applicable to any
parking requirements necessary for any portion of the proposed addition which
exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of the gross floor area of the structure. (Ord.
2128 § 1, 1990)
18.164.450: HISTORIC AND SCENIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION AND ENGINEERING REVIEW:
Prior to rendering a decision on an application for a parking modification
permit, the planning commission shall submit the application to the city's
historic and scenic preservation commission and the city's engineering
department for their review and recommendation, and the commission's and
department's recommendations shall be considered by the planning commission in
imposing any conditions on the project. (Ord. 2128 § 1, 1990)
18.164.460: NOTICE:
Notice of an application for a parking modification permit shall be published
in a newspaper of general circulation not less than ten (10) days prior to the
date set for the planning commission hearing. Notices shall also be mailed not
less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the meeting to owners of property
within a radius of three hundred feet (300') of the external boundaries of the
property described on the application, using for this purpose the name and
address of such owners as shown on the latest official tax role of the county.
(Ord. 2128 § 1, 1990)
18.164.470: FINDINGS FOR APPROVAL:
The planning commission, in approving a parking modification permit, shall find
as follows:
   A.   The proposed parking modification and use of the historic structure is
necessary or desirable for the development of the community, is in harmony with
the various elements and objectives of the general plan, and is not detrimental
to existing uses or to uses specifically permitted in the zone;
   B.   That approving the proposed parking modification and use will
significantly improve the possibility that the structure will be preserved and
maintained as a historic structure;
   C.   That the required parking cannot be provided without the approval of
the requested modification;
   D.   That all on site parking lots will function safely;
   E.   That approval of the parking modification will not harm the integrity
of the historic structure or the surrounding neighborhood. (Ord. 2128 § 1,
1990)
18.164.480: MAINTENANCE OF LOG:
The planning department shall maintain a log of all parking modifications
approved pursuant to this article and shall make the log available to the
planning commission for its review in determining the cumulative impacts of
approving an application for a parking modification permit within the community
surrounding the historic structure. (Ord. 2128 § 1, 1990)
18.164.490: APPEAL FROM PLANNING COMMISSION DECISION:
   A.   Within ten (10) days of transmittal of the planning commission's
finding and decision to the applicant, any aggrieved party may appeal such
decision to the city council. Such appeal shall be made on forms provided by
the city, and upon payment of an appeal fee as set by council resolution.
   B.   The city council shall forthwith hold a public hearing on an appeal
after such hearing is noticed as set forth in section
18.164.460 of this article.
   C.   After such public hearing, the city council shall either approve,
modify or disapprove the appealed application. If the planning commission has
not made the findings required by section
18.164.470 of this article, the council must do so before it can approve the
application for a parking modification permit. (Ord. 2128 § 1, 1990)

The following regulations shall apply to the intersections of streets, streets
and alleys, and private driveways with streets and/or alleys:
   A.   1. There shall be a corner cutoff on the side of each corner and
reversed corner lot abutting the intersecting streets. This corner cutoff shall
be defined by a line in a horizontal plane, taken at a forty five degree (45°)
angle with the side or front property line, which line passes through the
intersection of the required front and side yard setback lines of the side of
the lot closest to the street intersection.
      2.   There shall be no visual obstruction within this corner cutoff area.
   B.   1. There shall be a corner cutoff on the side of each corner and
reversed corner lot abutting an alley, where the alley intersects or intercepts
a street. This corner cutoff shall be defined by a line in a horizontal plane,
taken at a forty five degree (45°) angle with the side or rear property line,
which line passes through:
         a.   For corner lots, the intersection of the required side yard
setback lines and the rear property line along the alley;
         b.   For reversed corner lots, the intersection of the extension of
the required front yard setback line for the key lot on the opposite side of
the alley with the rear property line along the alley.
      2.   There shall be no visual obstruction within this corner cutoff area.
   C.   1. There shall be a corner cutoff on all lots where a private driveway
enters a street or alley. Such corner cutoff shall be defined by a line in a
horizontal plane, which line, taken at a forty five degree (45°) angle with the
side or rear property lines, passes through a point on the side or rear line
not less than ten feet (10') from the intersection of the driveway and the
street or alley.
      2.   There shall be no visual obstruction within this corner cutoff area.
   D.   1. There shall be a corner cutoff on a reversed corner lot where the
rear property line of the reversed corner lot becomes the side property line in
the required front yard of the key lot. Such cutoff shall be defined by a line
in a horizontal plane, which line, taken at a forty five degree (45°) angle
with the side or rear property line of the reversed corner lot, shall pass
through the point of intersection of the required front yard setback for the
key lot and the rear property line of the reversed corner lot.
      2.   There shall be no visual obstruction within the corner cutoff area.
   E.   There shall be no entry or exit to a parking lot from a street in any
nonresidential district, which entry is closer than twenty feet (20') from the
boundary of any residential district. (Ord. 1000 § 43.10, 1955)
18.168.020: FENCES AND WALLS; PERMITTED WHEN:
   A.   Open fences not to exceed four feet (4') in height shall be permitted
within a required front yard area. For purposes of this section, an "open
fence" means those types that are composed of wire mesh capable of admitting at
least ninety percent (90%) of light.

   A.   Goals: The goals of this chapter are to: 1) encourage the location of
towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the number of towers throughout the
city; 2) encourage the collocation of towers and antennas at new and existing
tower sites; 3) encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them in areas
where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; 4) encourage users of
towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes their adverse
visual impact by utilizing multiple use facilities and stealth treatment to
camouflage and conceal multiple use facilities; and 5) enhance the ability of
the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the
community quickly, effectively and efficiently.
   B.   Principal Or Accessory Use: Antennas and towers are considered either
principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure
on a property shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on
such property. A tower or antenna shall comply with all applicable zoning
standards except for height restrictions. Towers and antennas that are
constructed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be
deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.

18.184.040: Nonconforming Lots
18.184.050: Appeals
18.184.010: APPLICABILITY OF REGULATIONS:
The following regulations, set out in this chapter, shall apply to all
nonconforming buildings and nonconforming uses of land.
   A.   This chapter provides for the orderly termination of nonconforming
rights for lots, structures and uses that were established but, due to
revisions to the provisions of this title, no longer comply. The orderly
termination of legally established nonconforming lots, structures and uses is
necessary to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to
bring such lots, structures and uses into conformity with the goals, objectives
and policies of this title and the City's General Plan. Where a lot, structure
or use is referred to as nonconforming it shall mean that it is legally
nonconforming.
   B.   This chapter limits the expansion of nonconforming lots, structures and
uses and establishes the circumstances under which they may be continued, and
provides for the correction, maintenance, and removal of such lots, structures
and uses.
   C.   The City finds that nonconforming lots, structures and uses within the
City, both those that are legally established and those that are illegal, are
detrimental to the orderly development of the City and are detrimental to the
health, safety, peace, comfort and general welfare of persons and property
within the City.
   D.   Nonconforming lots, structures, and uses shall be eliminated as set
forth in this chapter and without infringing upon the constitutional rights of
the owners of legally-established nonconforming properties.
   E.   Lots, structures, and uses not having previously acquired proper
permits are illegal and subject to immediate abatement. This chapter does not
grant any right to continue occupancy of property containing an illegal use or
structure.
   F.   It shall be the property owner's responsibility to provide evidence or
information to justify the establishment of nonconforming rights.
   G.   A change in ownership or tenancy without any change in use, occupancy,
or development shall not affect any of the legal nonconforming rights,
privileges, and responsibilities provided under this chapter.
   H.   A use that does not conform with the loading, parking, planting area,
or screening standards of the zoning district in which it is located shall not
be deemed a nonconforming use solely for these reasons. (Ord. 2859, 2017)
18.184.020: NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS; CONTINUATION CONDITIONS:
Any uses on the land existing at the time of adoption of City of Redlands
ordinance no. 1000 (August 1955), whether housed in structures or outside the
structures, not in conformity with the uses permitted in this title, are hereby
declared to be nonconforming uses. Such uses shall be permitted to continue,
except as provided below.
   A.   Any nonconforming building in a residential district may be continued
and maintained for the following period, representing the useful life of the
class of building, as defined in the California Building Code:
      1.   Class 1 or 2 masonry: Forty (40) years;
      2.   Class 3 or 4 construction, fire resistant: Thirty (30) years;
      3.   Class 5 construction, frame: Twenty (20) years.
   B.   Ordinary repair and maintenance may be performed on a nonconforming
structure or site.
   C.   Except as otherwise provided for nonconforming single-family or multi-
family residential uses, or for historical buildings or contributing buildings
in a historic district, nonconforming buildings may be continued if such
buildings are not added to or structurally altered, other than as required by
law, or as provided for in subsection B of this section.
   D.   Except as otherwise provided for nonconforming single-family or multi-
family residential uses, or for historical buildings or contributing buildings
in a historic district, any part of a building occupied by a nonconforming use,
which use is discontinued for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
days or more, shall thereafter only be used in conformity with the provisions
of the zoning district in which it is located. Discontinuation shall mean any
termination of a use, regardless of intent to resume the use. Payment of a
valid business license or business tax certificate shall in and of itself not
be considered to be a continuation of the use.
   E.   The provisions of this title shall not prevent the reconstruction,
repairing or rebuilding, and the continuing use of any nonconforming building,
or buildings, damaged by fire, explosion or act of God or the public enemy
subsequent to the adoption of Redlands ordinance no. 1000, wherein the cost of
such reconstruction, repairing or rebuilding does not exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the reasonable replacement value. The damaged use or structure may be
rebuilt and resumed provided that a building permit for the reconstruction or
repair is issued within twenty four (24) months after the date of destruction,
and the reconstruction or repair is diligently pursued to completion.
   F.   The extent of damage or partial destruction shall be determined by
comparing the estimated cost of restoring the structure to its condition before
the damage or partial destruction, to the estimated cost of duplicating the
entire structure as it existed before the damage or destruction occurred.
Estimates for this purpose shall be reviewed and approved by the building
official and the Development Services Director, or their respective designees,
and shall be based on the minimum cost of construction in compliance with the
California Building Code. For the purpose of this section, "assessed value"
shall mean the assessed value of the structure as shown on the County of San
Bernardino property assessment roll in effect at the time of the occurrence of
the casualty, or at the time the repair and maintenance is first conducted.
   G.   Except as otherwise provided for nonconforming single-family or multi-
family residential uses, or for historical buildings or contributing buildings
in a historic district, when the destruction exceeds fifty percent (50%) or the
nonconforming structure is voluntarily demolished or is required by law to be
demolished, the structure shall not be restored except in full conformity with
the regulations of the zone in which it is located.
   H.   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the construction,
enlargement, expansion, extension, or reconstruction (hereafter referred to as
"work") of a nonconforming structure in the following manner:
      1.   Elimination Of Nonconformity: The work shall be allowed in order to
render the use or structure in conformity with this title.
      2.   Compliance With Laws: The work shall be allowed in order to comply
with law.
      3.   Seismic Retrofitting/Building Code Compliance: Repairs or
alterations otherwise required by law shall be allowed in the following
circumstances:
         a.   Reconstruction required to reinforce unreinforced masonry
structures shall be allowed without cost limitations, provided the retrofitting
is limited exclusively to compliance with earthquake safety standards in
compliance with title 15, "Buildings And Construction", of this Code; and,
         b.   Reconstruction required to comply with the City's adopted
Building Code requirements shall be allowed without cost limitations, provided
the retrofitting/Code compliance is limited exclusively to compliance with
earthquake safety standards and/or other applicable Building Code requirements,
including State law (e.g., title 24, California Code of Regulations; California
Historical Building Code; etc.).
      4.   Alteration Or Enlargement Of A Nonconforming Structure:
         a.   A nonconforming structure shall not be altered or enlarged so as
to further increase the difference between existing conditions and the current
development standards identified for the subject zoning district, unless a
variance is obtained in compliance with this Code. Alteration and enlargement
may occur, but only in compliance with the current applicable development
standards.
         b.   A nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged or moved unless
the enlargement of new location conforms to the current development standards
identified for the subject zoning district.
      5.   Permit Required: Alteration or enlargement of a nonconforming use
shall require a permit.
         a.   A nonconforming use may not be altered or enlarged unless a
building permit is first obtained, in compliance with the applicable title of
this Code.
         b.   The use shall comply with the performance standards and
applicable development standards for the subject zoning district.
         c.   There shall be no expansion of a nonconforming use onto an
additional lot, adjacent or otherwise.
   I.   Nonconforming single-family residential uses that have been
discontinued for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or more,
or involuntarily damaged or destroyed by more than fifty percent (50%) by a
catastrophic event (e.g., fire or other calamity, by act of God, or by the
public enemy), may be reconstructed or replaced with a new structure using the
same development standards applied to the damaged or destroyed structure (e.g.,
setbacks, square footage, building height, and density standards), if the
Development Services Director, or his or her designee makes affirmative
determination of all of the following findings:
      1.   The applicant provides documentation satisfactory to the Development
Services Director or his/her designee supporting the claim that the damage or
destruction occurred involuntarily;
      2.   The replacement structure is in compliance with current Building
Code; and,
      3.   A building permit is issued within twenty four (24) months after the
date of destruction and the construction is diligently pursued to completion.
If the preceding requirements are not met, the replacement structure shall
comply with all requirements of this Code.
   J.   A nonconforming single-family residential use located in a non-
residential zone may be expanded or enlarged by no more than twenty five
percent (25%) of its legal floor area that was existing at the time of adoption
of this chapter, whether by single or multiple addition(s). Any existing
dwelling that is enlarged by the addition of one or more bedrooms shall be
required to provide off-street parking facilities in accordance with the
provisions of this title.
   K.   Nonconforming multi-family dwelling units (including the residential
component of a mixed-use project) that have been involuntarily damaged or
destroyed by more than fifty percent (50%) by a catastrophic event (e.g., fire
or other calamity, by act of God, or by the public enemy) may be reconstructed
or replaced with a new structure using the same development standards applied
to the damaged or destroyed structures (e.g., setbacks, square footage,
building height, and density standards) in compliance with State law 1 , if the
Development Services Director or his/her designee makes affirmative
determination of all of the following findings:
      1.   The applicant provides documentation satisfactory to the Development
Services Director or his/her designee supporting the claim that the damage or
destruction occurred involuntarily;
      2.   The reconstruction, restoration, or rebuilding of the nonconforming
multi-family residential use will not adversely affect or be detrimental to the
health, safety, and general welfare of persons residing or working in the
neighborhood, and will not be detrimental or injurious to property or
improvements in the neighborhood;
      3.   No expansion of the gross floor area occurs;
      4.   The replacement structure is in compliance with current Building
Code; and,
      5.   A building permit is issued within twenty four (24) months after the
date of destruction and the construction is diligently pursued to completion.
If the preceding requirements are not met, the replacement structure shall
comply with all current requirements of this title in effect on the date a
building permit is issued.
   L.   Where parking facilities are insufficient to meet the standards set in
this title, or where no such parking facilities have been provided for
buildings constructed prior to the effective date hereof, such buildings may
not be altered, nor may additional facilities or square-footage be provided
within such buildings until after the requirements for off street parking shall
have been satisfied for those facilities or square-footage added or enlarged.
   M.   Any portion of a nonconforming building or use, which is altered or
changed to a conforming use, may not thereafter be used for a nonconforming
use. (Ord. 2859, 2017)

This chapter shall be known as the city's ALCOHOL BEVERAGE SALES ESTABLISHMENT
REGULATIONS. This chapter requires conditional use permits for newly
established alcohol beverage sales activities, confers deemed approved status
for existing alcohol beverage sales activities that constitute legal
nonconforming uses, and establishes standards and an administrative hearing
process to review violations of those standards in order to protect the general
health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city and to prevent
nuisance activities where alcohol beverage sales activities occur. The city has
adopted the regulations described in this chapter for the following purposes:
   A.   To protect residential, commercial, industrial, civic and institutional
areas and minimize the adverse impacts of nonconforming and incompatible uses;
   B.   To provide mechanisms to address problems often associated with the
public consumption of alcohol beverages such as litter, loitering, graffiti,
unruly behavior and escalated noise levels, and ensure that alcohol beverage
sales establishments are not the source of public nuisances in the community;
   C.   To provide for properly maintained alcohol beverage sales
establishments so that the negative impacts generated by these activities are
not harmful to the surrounding environment in any way;
   D.   To monitor deemed approved establishments to ensure they do not
substantially change in mode or character of operation;
   E.   To provide opportunities for alcohol beverage sales establishments to
operate in a mutually beneficial relationship to each other and to other
surrounding uses. (Ord. 2791, 2015)

18.190.120: INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURES OF POTENTIAL VIOLATION OF CONDITIONS OF
APPROVAL:
The city shall appoint a hearing officer to conduct hearings, make findings and
determine whether violations of this chapter, including the operational
standards, conditions of approval as well as whether undue negative impacts or
public nuisance activities have occurred, are occurring, or are likely to occur
in the future. The hearing officer shall exercise all powers relating to the
conduct of the administrative hearing as set forth in title 1, chapter 1.22 of
this code.
Upon the city's receipt of a complaint from the public, city official, or any
other interested person, that a conditional use permit activity is in violation
of the operational standards and/or conditions of approval set forth in this
chapter, the following procedure shall be followed:
   A.   The city code enforcement officer (or other designated city
representative) shall assess the nature of the complaint and its validity by
conducting an on site observation and inspection of the premises to assess the
activity's compliance with operational standards and/or conditions of approval.
The enforcement officer shall provide the business owner and any manager on the
premises during the on site inspection with a copy of any complaint made in
writing or with information about the details of any oral complaint.
   B.   If violations are observed during the observation and inspection, the
enforcement officer shall record the violations and send via both U.S. first
class mail and certified mail return receipt requested a "notice to abate" to
the owner of the activity and the property owner, if not the same person or
entity. Such "notice to abate" shall notify the owner and property owner of the
violations recorded by the officer and that continued noncompliance may result
in the penalties and shall set forth a reasonable period of not less than
thirty (30) calendar days within which to abate any violations.
   C.   At the end of the abatement period prescribed in the "notice to abate",
the code enforcement officer shall conduct a reinspection visit. If the
violations have not been abated within the prescribed abatement period and the
officer determines that it is reasonably unlikely that further efforts to
compel compliance with operational standards and/or conditions of approval by
the owner of the activity is likely, the officer shall determine that the
activity is in persistent violation of the operational standards and/or
conditions of approval and shall refer the matter and all material evidence to
the hearing officer for adjudication. A copy of the officer's determination of
continued noncompliance shall be sent via both U.S. first class mail and
certified mail return receipt requested to the owner of the deemed approved
activity and the property owner, if not the same person or entity.
   D.   Upon referral from the code enforcement officer that an activity is in
persistent violation of the operational standards and/or conditions of approval
of this chapter, the operating status of the activity in question shall be
reviewed by the hearing officer at a public hearing. The purpose of the
administrative hearing is to receive information as to whether the activity is
in compliance with the operational standards and/or conditions of approval.
   E.   The hearing officer shall determine whether the activity is in
compliance with the operational standards and/or conditions of approval. Based
on this determination, the officer may continue the conditional use status for
the use in question, may impose administrative penalties for violations of the
operational standards and/or conditions of approval or may make a
recommendation to the planning commission to revoke the activity's conditional
use permit. If the officer determines instead to impose further, new conditions
on the activity, such conditions shall be based upon the information then
before the officer. In reaching a determination as to whether a use has
violated the operational standards, or as to the appropriateness of imposing
conditions on a use, assessing administrative penalties, or the amount of
administrative penalties to assess, the hearing officer may consider:
      1.   The length of time the activity has been out of compliance with the
performance standards.
      2.   The impact of the violation of the operational standards and/or
conditions of approval on the community.
      3.   Any information regarding the owner of the activity's efforts to
remedy the violation of the operational standards and/or conditions of
approval.
   F.   "Efforts to remedy" shall include, but are not limited to:
      1.   Timely calls to the police department that are placed by the owner
of the deemed approved activity, his or her employees, or agents.
      2.   Requesting that those persons engaging in activities causing
violations of the operational standards and/or conditions of approval cease
those activities, unless the owner of the activity, or his or her employees or
agents feels that their personal safety would be threatened in making that
request.
      3.   Making improvements to the establishment's property or operations,
including, but not limited to, the installation of lighting sufficient to
illuminate the area within the use's property line, the installation of
security cameras, clear unobstructed windows, clean sidewalks and graffiti
abated within three (3) days.
   G.   The decision of the hearing officer shall be final unless appealed to
the planning commission, by written form approved by the city, within ten (10)
days after the date of the decision.
   H.   The decision of the planning commission shall be final unless appealed
to the city council, by written form approved by the city, within ten (10) days
after the date of the decision. (Ord. 2791, 2015)
18.190.130: APPEAL FROM SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT:

the hours of operation.
      5.   The alcohol beverage sales establishment proposes to reinstate

      6.   The alcohol beverage sales establishment voluntarily discontinues

beverage sales establishment on the same premises after the premises have been
rendered totally or partially inaccessible by a riot, insurrection, toxic
accident or act of God, provided that the reestablishment, restoration or
repair does not increase the sales or service of any alcohol beverage, extend
the hours of operation of any establishment or add to the capacity, floor or
land area or shelf space devoted to alcohol beverages of any establishment that
sells or serves any alcohol beverages.
      2.   Temporary closure for not more than ninety (90) days in cases of
vacation or illness or for purposes of repair, renovation, or remodeling if

premises and does not increase the sales or service of any alcohol beverage,
extend the hours of operation of any establishment, or add to the capacity,
floor or land area, or shelf space devoted to alcohol beverages of any
establishment that sells or serves any alcohol beverages.
   E.   If it is determined by the city that there has been a discontinuance of
active operation for ninety (90) consecutive days or a cessation of ABC
licensing, it may be resumed only upon the granting of a conditional use permit
as provided in this chapter. The property owner shall be notified by the city
of the termination of the deemed approved status and shall be informed of the
property owner's right to appeal the city's decision to the hearing officer.

18.192.010: PURPOSE:
   A.   The purpose of a conditional use permit (CUP) is to establish a review
process for the development of a use that may be desirable under appropriate
circumstances but is not permitted by right in the applicable zone. The intent
of this chapter is to permit review of such proposed uses on a case by case
basis to determine whether, and under what conditions, the use may be approved
at a given site. Further, the intent of this chapter is that each use be
developed so as to fully protect the public health, safety and welfare of the
city. To provide this protection, conditions may be imposed on a use to address
potential adverse effects. The privileges and conditions of a CUP are a
covenant that runs with the land and, in addition to binding the permittee,
bind each successor in interest. A CUP is granted at the discretion of the
city, and is not an automatic right of any applicant. (Ord. 2503 § 1, 2003)
18.192.020: SPECIFIC USES PERMITTED SUBJECT TO CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT:
   A.   Uses listed in the city's zones as "uses permitted subject to a

prohibited, when such uses are determined by the city to be essential or
desirable for the public health, safety and welfare in accordance with the

chapter 18.144 of this title.
      Problem Areas: In those areas that are so located that their relationship
to other uses of land or to topographical features, or where existing land
subdivision patterns make use for the zoned purposes impractical, and where one
particular use would be reasonable and desirable, the commission may determine
such a use, if otherwise permitted by ordinance, to be reasonable.
      Public utility structures and service facilities.
      Religious places of worship.
      Transitional Uses: A use, or combination of uses that will provide an
orderly bridge between more intensive and less intensive uses:

conditions applicable to the property or to the intended use that do not apply
generally to other properties or uses in the same vicinity and zone;
      2.   That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of a substantial property right possessed by other properties in the same
vicinity and zone district, but which is denied to the property in question;
      3.   That the granting of such variance will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements of others in the

roads, schools, or other essential facilities or services to the project whose
ability to provide those facilities and services may be significantly affected,
to any person who has filed a written request for notice with either the city
clerk, and to all persons shown on the last equalized assessment roll as owning
real property within three hundred feet (300') of the property which is the
subject of the proposed development agreement; provided, the director of
community development may direct that notice be given over a wider area to
adequately inform interested persons. If the number of owners to whom notice is

agreement.
   D.   The notice requirements referred to in this chapter are declaratory of
existing law (Government Code sections 65867, 65090 and 65091). If and when
state law prescribes any different notice requirement, notice shall be given in

invalidate, any development agreement. (Ord. 2073 § 1, 1989)
18.220.170: IRREGULARITY IN PROCEEDING:
Formal rules of evidence or procedure which must be followed in a court of law
shall not apply to the consideration of a proposed development agreement. No
action, inaction or recommendation regarding a development agreement shall be
held void or invalid on the ground of the improper admission or rejection of
evidence or by reason of any error or informality, as to any matter procedure
whatsoever unless, after an examination of the entire case, including the
evidence, a court of law finds that the error complained of was prejudicial and
that by reason of the error the complaining party sustained and suffered
substantial injury, and that a different result would have been probable if the
error had not occurred or existed. There is no presumption that error is
prejudicial or that injury resulted if error is shown. (Ord. 2073 § 1, 1989)
18.220.180: PERIODIC REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS:
   A.   Annual Review: The city shall review development agreements at least
once every twelve (12) months from the date of their approval. Pursuant to

shall have the duty to demonstrate its good faith compliance with the terms of
the development agreement at the time of such periodic review. The city's cost
for such periodic review shall be paid by the applicant to the city prior to
the time of such review.
   B.   Applicant's Submission: Not less than thirty (30), nor more than sixty
(60), days prior to the anniversary date of a development agreement, and each
anniversary date thereafter, the applicant shall submit to the community
development department a letter setting forth the applicant's good faith
compliance with the terms and conditions of the development agreement. Such
letter shall be accompanied by documents and other information as may be
necessary and available to enable the city to undertake its annual review of
applicant's good faith compliance under the terms of the development agreement,
and shall also state that such letter is submitted to the city pursuant to the

thirty (30), nor more than sixty (60), days prior to the anniversary date of a
development agreement, the city's community development department shall
provide notice to the city council, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the
city council, that a development agreement will be subject to annual review in
accordance with this chapter.
   C.   Finding Of Compliance: The community development department shall

complied in good faith with the terms of the development agreement. Upon
request of the community development department, the applicant shall furnish
such additional documents or information as may be reasonably required and
available to the applicant to enable the community development department to
make and complete its review hereunder. If the community development department
finds good faith compliance by the applicant with the terms of the development
agreement, it shall issue a certificate of compliance, certifying the
applicant's good faith compliance with the terms of the agreement through the
period of the applicable annual review. Such certificate of compliance shall be
in recordable form and shall contain such information as may be necessary in
order to impart constructive record notice of the finding of good faith
compliance hereunder. The applicant shall have the right to record the
certificate of compliance, at the applicant's sole cost, in the official
records of the county of San Bernardino. At least ten (10) days prior to making
its determination, the community development department shall provide to the
applicant copies of all staff reports and other information concerning the
applicant's compliance with the terms of the development agreement and the
determination made by the community development department.
   D.   Finding Of Noncompliance: If the community development department finds
that the applicant has not complied in good faith with the terms of the
development agreement, it shall specify to the applicant in writing the
respects in which the applicant has failed to comply. The community development
department shall also specify a reasonable time for the applicant to comply
with such terms for compliance, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days,
and shall be reasonably related to the time necessary to adequately bring the
applicant's performance into good faith compliance with the development
agreement. If the areas of noncompliance specified by the community development
department are not perfected within such reasonable time limits prescribed by
the department, then the development agreement shall be subject to modification
or cancellation pursuant to this chapter and the provisions of Government Code
section 65865.1.
   E.   Referral To City Council: The community development department may
refer any review to be conducted hereunder to the city council. Such referral
shall be made by the community development department director, together with a
staff report on the department's preliminary findings. Upon such referral, the
city council shall conduct a noticed public hearing on the applicant's
compliance with the terms of the development agreement in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and Government Code section 65865.1. If, after
considering all the evidence at such public hearing, the city council finds and
determines on the basis of substantial evidence that the applicant has not
complied in good faith to the terms and conditions of the development
agreement, then the city council shall specify to the applicant the respects in
which the applicant has failed to comply and shall also specify a reasonable
time for the applicant to comply with such terms which shall not be less than
thirty (30) days, and shall be reasonably related to the time necessary to
adequately bring the applicant's performance into good faith compliance with
the terms of the development agreement. If the areas of noncompliance specified
by the city council are not perfected within such reasonable time limits, then
the city council, by noticed hearing, may terminate, modify or take such other
action with regard to the development agreement.
   F.   Miscellaneous Requirements In Connection With Annual Review: The
community development department's determination shall be made within thirty
(30) days after the submission by the applicant of the required material
hereunder, and, if the community development department refers the matter to
the city council, then the determination by the city council shall be made
within fifteen (15) days after such referral. The applicant shall be permitted
an opportunity to be heard orally, or in writing, before the community
development department regarding such performance and before the community
development department makes its determination or referral. The issuance of the
certificate of compliance by the community development department (or the city
council on referral) shall conclude the review for the applicable period, and
such determination shall be final and conclusive up to and including the date
of the annual review hereunder. All costs incurred by city for the annual
review conducted under this chapter shall be borne by the applicant, including,
but not limited to, the city's retention of professionals. (Ord. 2385 § 2,
1998: Ord. 2385 § 2, 1998)
18.220.190: CANCELLATION OR MODIFICATION BY MUTUAL CONSENT:
Any development agreement may be cancelled or modified by mutual consent of the
parties, but only in the manner provided for by California Government Code
section 65868. Any proposal to cancel or modify a development agreement shall
be heard and determined in accordance with the same procedures specified by
this chapter for approval of a development agreement. (Ord. 2385 § 3, 1998:
Ord. 2073 § 1, 1989)
18.220.200: CANCELLATION BY THE CITY:
   A.   If, at any time during the term of a development agreement the director
of community development determines that the applicant has not complied in good
faith with the terms and conditions of the development agreement, the director
of community development shall, pursuant to the notice provisions of this
chapter, request that the planning commission conduct a public hearing at which
the applicant must demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms of the
development agreement. The burden of proof by substantial evidence of
compliance by the applicant is upon the applicant. If such compliance cannot be
shown, the planning commission shall recommend to the city council that the
city council either commence proceedings to cancel the development agreement or
recommend new terms and conditions intended to remedy the noncompliance.
   B.   The city council shall conduct a noticed hearing on the recommendations
of the planning commission at which the applicant and any other interested
person shall be entitled to submit such evidence and testimony as may be
germane to the issue of the applicants good faith compliance with the terms of
the development agreement. If the city council finds, based on substantial
evidence, noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the development
agreement, it may either cancel the development agreement upon giving sixty
(60) days' notice to the applicant, or in its discretion, may allow the
development agreement to be continued by imposition of new terms and conditions
intended to remedy such noncompliance. The city council may impose such

In the event a development agreement is cancelled, unless otherwise agreed, all
rights of the applicant, or his successor in interest under the development
agreement, shall terminate. Any and all benefits, including money or land,
received by the city shall be retained by the city. Notwithstanding the above
provision, the termination of a development agreement shall not prevent an
applicant from completing a building or other improvements authorized pursuant

permitted by law to prevent, stop, or correct any violation of law occurring
during and after construction, and the applicant or any tenant shall not occupy
any portion of the project or any building not authorized by a previously
issued building permit. As used herein, "construction" shall mean work
performed in good faith in reliance upon a valid building permit, and
"completing" shall mean completion for beneficial occupancy for an applicant's
use, or if a portion of the project is intended for use by a lessee or tenant,
then for such portion "completing" shall mean completion except for interior
improvements such as partitions, duct and electrical run outs, floor covering,
wall coverings, lighting, furniture, trade fixtures, finished ceilings and

and any codes, statutes and any court decisions, state or federal. In the event
that any law, code, statute or decision made or enacted after a development
agreement has been entered into prevents or precludes compliance with one or
more provisions of the development agreement, then such provisions of the
development agreement shall be modified or suspended in the manner and pursuant
to the procedures specified in the development agreement, as may be necessary

2073 § 1, 1989)
18.220.230: SEPARATE PROCEDURE:
Development agreements shall not take the place of zoning ordinances, the
general plan, conditional use permits, subdivision approvals, building permits
or any other city planning functions. To the extent practicable, public
hearings on a proposed development agreement may be held concurrently with the
public hearings on all related land use approvals and all such approvals shall
be made concurrently with the approval of the development agreement. (Ord. 2385
§ 3, 1998: Ord. 2073 § 1, 1989)
18.220.240: EFFECT OF DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT:
When approved, a development agreement and any development control maps and all
notations, references and regulations which are a part of the development
agreement shall be considered part of this code. Development control maps
include, but are not limited to, regulations intended to carry out any plan
respecting location or type of activities; height, bulk, siding or design of
structures; location or design of open areas; and landscaping and other
comparable regulations. In the case of any conflict with any other provisions
of this code, such development agreement provisions shall take precedence.
Unless otherwise provided by the development agreement, the city's rules,
regulations and official policies governing permitted uses of the land, density
and design, improvement and construction standards and specifications
applicable to development of the property subject to a development agreement
shall be those city rules, regulations and official policies in force at the
time of the approval of the development agreement by the city council. (Ord.
2385 § 3, 1998: Ord. 2073 § 1, 1989)
18.220.250: CONSTRUCTION:
This chapter and any subsequent development agreement shall be read together.
With respect to any development agreement enacted under this chapter, any
provision of a development agreement which is in conflict with this chapter

records of the county of San Bernardino.

interest, amend or cancel the development agreement as provided for in
Government Code section 65868 and this chapter, or if the city council
terminates or modifies a development agreement as provided for in Government
Code section 65865.1 and this chapter for failure of the applicant to comply in
good faith with the terms or conditions of the development agreement, the city
clerk shall, after such action takes effect, have notice of such action
recorded in the official records of the county of San Bernardino. (Ord. 2385 §
3, 1998: Ord. 2073 § 1, 1989)
18.220.270: SEVERABILITY:
Should any provision of this chapter be held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be either invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remaining
provisions of this chapter shall remain in full force and effect, unimpaired by

CHAPTER 18.226
ADULT ORIENTED BUSINESSES
SECTION:
18.226.010: Legislative Purpose
18.226.020: Definitions
18.226.030: Minimum Proximity Requirements
18.226.040: Amortization Of Nonconforming Adult Oriented Business Uses
18.226.050: Extension Of Time For Termination Of Nonconforming Use
18.226.010: LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate adult oriented businesses in
order to promote the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Redlands and
to prevent communitywide adverse economic impacts, increased crime, decreased
property values and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought
about by the concentration of adult oriented businesses in close proximity to
each other or proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools for minors,
churches and residentially zoned districts or uses. The city council of the
city of Redlands finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities
that the concentration of adult oriented businesses causes an increase in the
number of transients in the area and an increase in crime, and in addition to
the effects described above, can cause other businesses and residents to move
elsewhere. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect
of imposing a limitation or prohibition on the content of any communicative
materials, including adult oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent
nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to adult
oriented materials protected by the first amendment, or to deny access by the
distributors and exhibitors of adult oriented entertainment to their intended
market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or
legitimize the distribution of obscene material. It is, therefore, the purpose
of this chapter to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
concentration of adult oriented businesses or their close proximity to
incompatible uses, while permitting the location of adult oriented businesses
in certain areas. (Ord. 2345 § 1, 1997)

To be eligible for a density bonus and other incentives or concessions as
provided by this chapter, a proposed residential development project shall:
   A.   Consist of five (5) or more dwelling units; and
   B.   Provide for the construction of one or more of the following within the
development:
      1.   Ten percent (10%) of the total units of a housing development for
lower income households, as defined in Health And Safety Code section 50079.5;
or
      2.   Five percent (5%) of the total units of a housing development for
very low income households, as defined in Health And Safety Code section 50105;
or
      3.   A senior citizen housing development as defined in Civil Code

      4.   Ten percent (10%) of the total dwelling units in a condominium
project or in a planned development as defined in Civil Code subsection 1351(f)
and (k), respectively, for persons and families of moderate income, as defined
in Health And Safety Code section 50093. (Ord. 2762, 2012)
18.228.030: TYPES OF BONUSES AND INCENTIVES OR CONCESSIONS ALLOWED:
A residential development project that satisfies all relevant provisions of
this chapter shall be entitled to a density bonus and one or more incentives or
concessions described below. If the density bonus incentives or concessions
cannot be accommodated on a parcel due to strict compliance with the provisions
of this title, the city shall waive or modify development standards to
accommodate the bonus units or incentives or concessions to which the
development would be entitled, unless such waiver or modification would have a
specific, adverse impact, as defined in Government Code section 65589.5(d)(2),
upon health, safety or the physical environment, or any real property that is
listed in the California register of historical resources, and for which there
is no feasible method to mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.
   A.   Minimum Density Bonus: The density bonus granted to a residential
development project shall consist of an increase over the otherwise maximum
allowable residential density under the applicable zoning ordinance and land
use element of the city's general plan as of the date of application. Such
increase shall be equal to at least:
      1.   A twenty percent (20%) increase in density when the development
meets the requirements of subsection
18.228.020B1, B2 or B3 of this chapter; or
      2.   A five percent (5%) increase in density, when the development meets
the requirements of subsection
18.228.020B4 of this chapter.
      3.   A fifteen percent (15%) increase in density, when an applicant for a
residential development donates land to the city in accordance with the
requirements of Government Code section 65915(g)(1). Nothing in this subsection
shall be construed to enlarge or diminish the authority of the city to require
a developer to donate land as a condition of development.
      4.   The city may, at its discretion, grant a density bonus that is
greater than that described in subsections
18.228.020B1, B2 and B3 of this chapter for a development that meets the
requirements therein or proportionately lower than that described in
subsections
18.228.020B1, B2 and B3 of this chapter for a development that does not meet
the requirements therein.
   B.   Additional Density Bonus: The amount of density bonus to which the
applicant is entitled shall vary according to the amount by which the
percentage of affordable housing units exceeds the base percentage established
in subsection
18.228.020B of this chapter. The amount of density bonus for a donation of land
shall vary according to the amount by which the donation exceeds the base
donation established by Government Code section 65915(h)(2).
      1.   Lower Income Households: For each one percent (1%) increase above
ten percent (10%) in the percentage of units affordable to lower income
households, the density bonus shall be increased by one and one-half percent
(1.5%).
      2.   Very Low Income Households: For each one percent (1%) increase above
five percent (5%) in the percentage of units affordable to very low income
households, the density bonus shall be increased by two and one-half percent
(2.5%).
      3.   Moderate Income Households: For each one percent (1%) increase above
ten percent (10%) in the percentage of units affordable to moderate income
households, the density bonus shall increase by one percent (1%).
      4.   Donation Of Land: For each one percent (1%) increase above the
minimum ten percent (10%) land donation, the density bonus shall be increased
by one percent (1%). Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to enlarge
or diminish the authority of the city to require a developer to donate land as
a condition of development.
The base density bonus shall not be included when determining the number of
housing units that is greater than five percent (5%) or ten percent (10%) of
the total development. All calculations resulting in fractional units shall be
rounded up to the next whole number. In no event shall the city be required to
grant more than a thirty five percent (35%) increase over the otherwise maximum
allowable residential density under the applicable zoning ordinance and land
use element of the city's general plan.

         a.   One incentive or concession for a project that includes at least
five percent (5%) of the total units for very low income households;
         b.   Two (2) incentives or concessions for a project that includes at
least ten percent (10%) of the total units for very low income households; and
         c.   Three (3) incentives or concessions for a project that includes
at least fifteen percent (15%) of the total units for very low income
households.
      3.   Moderate Income Households: An applicant shall receive:
         a.   One incentive or concession for a project that includes at least
ten percent (10%) of the total units for persons and families of moderate
income in a condominium or planned development;
         b.   Two (2) incentives or concessions for a project that includes at
least twenty percent (20%) of the total units for persons and families of
moderate income in a condominium or planned development; and
         c.   Three (3) incentives or concessions for a project that includes
at least thirty percent (30%) of the total units for persons and families of
moderate income in a condominium or planned development.
   D.   Incentives And Concessions, Description: A project that is eligible to
receive incentives or concessions pursuant to subsection C of this section
shall be entitled to at least one of the following incentives or concessions
identified in Government Code section 65915:
      1.   A reduction in site development standards (e.g., coverage, setback,
zero lot line and/or reduced parcel sizes), or a modification of zoning
requirements or architectural design requirements that exceed the minimum
standards approved by the California building standards commission.
      2.   Approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with the housing project
if nonresidential land uses would reduce the cost of the housing project, and
the nonresidential land uses would be compatible with the housing project and
adjoining development.
      3.   Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the developer
or the city that would result in identifiable, financially sufficient and
actual cost reductions.
      4.   A reduction in the number of required parking spaces, upon request
by the applicant. For a one bedroom unit, one parking space is required; for
two (2) and three (3) bedroom units, two (2) parking spaces are required and
for four (4) or more bedroom units, two and one-half (21/2) parking spaces are
required.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the city to provide, or
limit the city's ability to provide, direct financial incentives for housing
development, including the provision of publicly owned land by the city or the
waiver of fees and dedication requirements.
   E.   Limitations And Exceptions:
      1.   To receive incentives or concessions as described in subsections C
and D of this section, an applicant must submit a proposal to the city
requesting the specific incentives or concessions that the applicant desires.
      2.   The city shall grant the incentives or concessions requested by the
applicant pursuant to subsection E1 of this section and required pursuant to
subsection C of this section, unless the city makes a written finding, based
upon substantial evidence, of either of the following:
         a.   The incentive or concession is not required in order to provide
for affordable housing costs, as defined in Health And Safety Code section
50052.5; or
         b.   The incentive or concession would have a specific adverse impact
as defined in Government Code section 65589.5(d)(2), upon public health and
safety or the physical environment, or on any real property that is listed in
the California register of historical resources, and for which there is no
feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact
without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate income
households.
      3.   The city's granting of an incentive or concession shall not be
interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning
change, or other discretionary approval.
      4.   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the city to
waive or reduce development standards or to grant an incentive or concession
that would have a specific, adverse impact upon health, safety or the physical
environment for which there is no feasible method to mitigate or avoid the
specific adverse impact; nor shall this subsection require the city to waive or
reduce development standards or to grant an incentive or concession that would
have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California
register of historical resources. (Ord. 2762, 2012)
18.228.040: CONTINUED AFFORDABILITY; EQUITY SHARING:
   A.   Written Covenant: Before the issuance of a building permit for any
dwelling unit in a development for which density bonus units have been awarded
or incentives or concessions have been received, the developer shall identify
the restricted units and shall enter into a written covenant with the city to
guarantee one or both of the following, as applicable:
      1.   Lower And Very Low Income Households; Continued Affordability: The
continued affordability and availability of the lower and very low income units
shall be for a minimum of thirty (30) years, as required by state law 1 . Those
units targeted for lower income households, as defined in Health And Safety
Code section 50105, shall be affordable at a rent that does not exceed thirty
percent (30%) of fifty percent (50%) of the area median income.
      2.   Moderate Income Households; Equity Sharing: The initial occupant of
any moderate income unit in a condominium or planned development shall be a
person or family of moderate income, as required by state law 2 . Upon resale,
the seller of the unit shall retain the value of any improvements, the down
payment and the seller's proportionate share of appreciation. The city shall
recapture its proportionate share of appreciation, which shall be equal to the
percentage by which the initial sale price to the moderate income person or
family was less than the fair market value of the home at the time of initial
sale. The city shall spend recaptured funds within three (3) years for any
purposes to promote homeownership, as described in Health And Safety Code
section 33334.2(e).
   B.   Recordation Of Agreement: The terms and conditions of the covenant
shall run with the land which is to be developed, shall be binding upon the
successors in interest of the developer, and shall be recorded in the official
records of the county of San Bernardino. In addition to the requirements
described in subsection A of this section, the agreement shall include the
following provisions:
      1.   The developer shall give the city a continuing right of refusal to
purchase or lease any or all of the designated units at the fair market value;
      2.   The deeds to the designated units shall contain a covenant stating
that the developer shall not sell, rent, lease, sublet, assign or otherwise
transfer any interests for the same without the written approval of the city
confirming that the sales or rental price of the units is consistent with the
limits established for lower, very low and moderate income households, which
shall be related to the consumer price index; and
      3.   The city shall have the authority to enter into other agreements
with the developer, or purchasers of the dwelling units, as may be necessary to
ensure that the lower and very low income units are continuously occupied by
eligible households. (Ord. 2762, 2012)

18.228.050: LOCATION OF AFFORDABLE UNITS:
   A.   Location/Dispersal Of Units: The location of affordable units within
the qualifying project shall be at the discretion of the city with the goal to
integrate the units into the overall project. However, the affordable units
shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the development where feasible, shall
contain on average the same number of bedrooms as the nonaffordable units, and
shall be compatible with the design or use of the remaining units in terms of
appearance, materials and finish quality.
   B.   Alternative Development Site: Circumstances may arise in which the
public interest would be served by allowing some or all of the affordable units
associated with one housing development to be produced and operated at an
alternative development site. Where the owner/developer and the city form an
agreement, the resulting linked developments shall be considered a single
housing development for the purposes of this chapter. Under these
circumstances, the owner/developer shall be subject to the same requirements of
this chapter for the affordable units to be provided on the alternative site.
(Ord. 2762, 2012)
18.228.060: CHILDCARE FACILITIES:
   A.   When an applicant proposes to construct an eligible residential
development project as defined in section
18.228.020 of this chapter, and includes a childcare facility that will be
located on the premises of, as part of, or adjacent to, the project, the city
shall grant either of the following:
      1.   An additional density bonus that is an amount of square feet of
residential space that is equal to or greater than the amount of square feet in
the childcare facility.
      2.   An additional incentive or concession that contributes significantly
to the economic feasibility of the construction of the childcare facility.
   B.   The city shall require, as a condition of approving the housing
development, that the following occur:
      1.   The childcare facility shall remain in operation for a period of
time that is as long as or longer than the period of time during which the
density bonus units are required to remain affordable pursuant to section
18.228.040 of this chapter.
      2.   Of the children who attend the childcare facility, the children of
very low, lower and moderate income households shall equal a percentage that is
equal to or greater than the percentage of dwelling units that are required for
very low, lower or moderate income households pursuant to subsection
18.228.020B of this chapter.
   C.   Notwithstanding subsections A and B of this section, the city shall not
be required to provide a density bonus or incentive for a childcare facility if
it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that the community has adequate
childcare facilities. (Ord. 2762, 2012)
18.228.070: PROCESSING OF BONUS REQUEST:
   A.   Permit Required: Requests for affordable units shall require approval
of a planned residential development permit in compliance with chapter 18.144
of this title.
   B.   Initial Review Of Bonus Request: The city shall notify the developer
within ninety (90) days of the filing of the development plan permit
application whether the development project qualifies for the additional
density.
   C.   Criteria To Be Considered: Criteria to be considered in analyzing a
requested density bonus shall include whether the applicant has agreed to
construct a development that meets the requirements of section
18.228.020 of this chapter. Criteria to be considered in analyzing a requested
incentive shall include whether an incentive or concession has a specific
adverse impact upon health, safety or the physical environment, and whether
there is no feasible method to eliminate or mitigate such specific adverse
impact.
   D.   Findings For Approval: The approval of a density bonus shall require
the following findings to be made in a positive manner:
      1.   The development project would not be a hazard or nuisance to the
city at large or establish a use or development inconsistent with the goals and
policies of the city's general plan;
      2.   The number of dwellings can be accommodated by existing and planned
infrastructure capacities;
      3.   Adequate evidence exists to ensure that the development of the
property would result in the provision of affordable housing in a manner
consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter;
      4.   In the event that the city does not grant at least one financial
concession or incentive as defined in state law 1  in addition to the density
bonus, that additional concessions or incentives are not necessary to ensure
affordable housing costs; and
      5.   There are sufficient provisions to guarantee that the lower and very
low income units would remain affordable in the future.
   E.   Development Standards: In no case may the city apply any development
standard that would have the effect of precluding the construction of a
development meeting the criteria of subsection
18.228.020B of this chapter at the densities or with the incentives or
concessions permitted by this chapter. An applicant may submit to the city a
proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards. The applicant
must show that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the affordable
housing units economically feasible. (Ord. 2762, 2012)

18.228.080: APPEALS:
An applicant may initiate judicial proceedings if the city refuses to grant a
requested density bonus, incentive, or concession. If a court finds that the
refusal to grant a requested density bonus, incentive, or concession is in
violation of this chapter or Government Code section 65915, the court shall
award the plaintiff reasonable attorney fees and costs of suit. (Ord. 2762,

requirement may be fulfilled through the payment of an In-lieu Fee pursuant to
an In-lieu Fee schedule adopted by the City pursuant to this title, subject to
the following:
      1.   For-sale Residential Developments of any size may pay an In-lieu Fee
by-right.
      2.   Rental Residential Developments with twenty two (22) or fewer units
may pay an In-lieu Fee by-right.
      3.   Rental Residential Developments with twenty three (23) or greater
units may pay an In-lieu Fee, subject to approval by the City Council, upon a
demonstration that providing the affordable units in the Residential
Development would create an unreasonable economic hardship due to such factors
as project size, site constraints, and/or excessively large affordability gaps.
      4.   Prior to the effective date of this title, and from time to time
thereafter, the City Council shall adopt by resolution a schedule of In-lieu
Fees that shall be levied based on the square footage of the saleable area of
For-sale Residential Developments or leasable area of Rental Residential
Developments, but excluding the affordable units in a project that received a
density bonus in accordance with Government Code section 65915.1. The amount of
In-lieu Fees shall be established by resolution of the City Council. The In-
lieu Fee schedule shall be updated periodically by the City Council.
      5.   The required In-lieu Fees shall be paid at the time that the first
building permit is obtained for the Residential Development, except that, for
phased projects, the developer may pay a pro rata share of the In-lieu Fee,
based on the number and size of phases in the development, concurrently with
the issuance of the first building permit for each phase of the Residential
Development.
      6.   All In-lieu Fees collected under this title shall be deposited in
the Inclusionary Housing fund established by the City pursuant to subsection
18.230.170(B) of this title.
   B.   Off-site Development of Affordable Units: Residential Developments can
fulfill Inclusionary Housing requirements by renting 9% of the total number of
units in the development at the Low-income standard in one of the following
ways:
      1.   Off-site production of affordable rental units; or
      2.   Creation of a parcel within a For-sale Housing Development site on
which affordable rental units are constructed.
   C.   Land Dedication: As an alternative to constructing the required
inclusionary units in accordance with this title, the City Council may, in its
discretion, allow an applicant to dedicate real property to the City for the
purpose of developing affordable housing, provided that the real property
dedicated to the City must satisfy all of the following requirements:

free of any monetary liens. In the event that there are any encumbrances or
easements that adversely impact title to the property, those encumbrances or
easements must be disclosed and factored into the estimated value of the real
property interest to be conveyed to the City.
         b.   The applicant must provide evidence satisfactory to the City that
the property does not contain any hazardous materials at the time of
conveyance; must disclose whether any hazardous materials were previously found
on the property; and if hazardous materials were previously remediated from the
property, the applicant must provide evidence satisfactory to the City that
such hazardous materials were remediated in accordable with all applicable laws
and regulations.

for at least five years prior to the submission of the proposal for dedication
of the property to the City pursuant to this title.
         d.   The property must be located within one mile of the property upon
with the applicant proposes to develop the market rate residential development
that has triggered the requirements of this title.
         e.   The property must have a general plan designation that authorizes
residential uses and is zoned for residential development at a density to
accommodate at least a number of dwelling units equal to at least ten percent
(10%) of the number of dwelling units proposed in the Applicant's residential
development.
         f.   The property must be suitable for development of inclusionary
units equal to at least ten percent (10%) of the number of dwelling units
proposed in the applicant's residential development, in terms of configuration,
physical characteristics, location, access, adjacent uses, and other relevant
planning and development criteria including, but not limited to, factors such
as the cost of construction or development arising from the nature, condition,
or location of the property.
         g.   Infrastructure to serve the property, including but not limited
to streets and public utilities, must be available at the property line and
have adequate capacity to serve the maximum allowable residential development
pursuant to zoning regulations.

to dedicate property pursuant to this title, the applicant shall submit the
following documents:
         a.   A conceptual site plan and narrative description of a residential
development that could be developed on the property.
         b.   An identification of the income and affordability restrictions
proposed to be imposed on the property.

with the identified development scope and describes how this financial gap will
be filled.

pursuant to Government Code Section 65915, the terms of the requested density
bonus; and the incentives, concessions, and development waivers that applicant
anticipates will be requested for the development of the property.
      4.   Prior to scheduling a proposal for dedication of property pursuant
to this title for consideration by the City Council, City staff will
independently evaluate the applicant's proposal and provide the City Council
with an analysis of whether the proposal meets the required standards set forth
in this title.
   D.   The alternative means of compliance set forth herein are intended to

18.266.010: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The city of Redlands recognizes that the extraction of minerals is essential to
the continued economic well being of the city and its surrounding community and
that the reclamation of mined lands is necessary to prevent or minimize adverse
effects on the environment and to protect the public health, safety and
welfare. The city also recognizes that surface mining takes place in diverse
areas where the geologic, topographic, climatic, biological and social
conditions are significantly different and that reclamation operations and the
specifications therefor may vary accordingly. The purpose and intent of this
chapter is to regulate surface mining operations and implement the minimum
requirements of California's surface mining and reclamation act of 1975 1 , as
amended (hereinafter referred to as "SMARA"), Public Resources Code section
2207, and the California Code of Regulations adopted pursuant thereto, to
ensure that:
   A.   Adverse environmental and other effects of surface mining operations
will be prevented or minimized and that the reclamation of mined lands will
provide for the beneficial, sustainable long term productive use of such lands;
and
   B.   The production and conservation of minerals will be encouraged while
potential hazards to public health and safety and adverse effects on the
environment, including, but not limited to, geologic subsidence, air pollution,
water quality degradation, damage to biological resources, flooding, erosion,
degradation of scenic quality and noise pollution shall be reduced or
eliminated. (Ord. 2399 § 2, 1999)

For purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall be defined
as follows:
   AREA OF REGIONAL SIGNIFICANCE: An area designated by the board which is
known to contain a deposit of minerals, the extraction of which is judged to be
of prime importance in meeting future needs for minerals in a particular region
of the state within which the minerals are located and which, if prematurely
developed for alternate incompatible land uses, could result in the premature
loss of minerals that are of more than local significance.
   AREA OF STATEWIDE SIGNIFICANCE: An area designated by the board which is
known to contain a deposit of minerals, the extraction of which is judged to be
of prime importance in meeting future needs for minerals in the state and
which, if prematurely developed for alternate incompatible land uses, could
result in the permanent loss of minerals that are of more than local or
regional significance.
   BOARD: The state mining and geology board.
   BORROW PITS: Excavations created by the surface mining of rock,
unconsolidated geologic deposits or soil to provide material (borrow) for fill
elsewhere.
   CEQA: The California environmental quality act as enacted in sections 21000
et seq., of the Public Resources Code.
   COMPATIBLE LAND USES: Land uses inherently compatible with mining that
require a minimum public or private investment in structures or land
improvements, and which may allow mining because of the relative economic value
of the land and its improvements. Examples of such uses may include, but shall
not be limited to, very low density residential, geographically extensive but
low impact industrial, recreational, agricultural, grazing and open space.
   DIRECTOR: The director of the state of California department of
conservation.
   HAUL ROAD: A road along which minerals and other materials are transported
from an area of excavation to a processing plant or stock pile area of a
surface mining operation.
   IDLE: To curtail, for a period of one year or more, surface mining
operations by more than ninety percent (90%) of the operation's previous
maximum annual mineral production, with the intent to resume those surface
mining operations at a future date.
   INCOMPATIBLE LAND USES: Land uses inherently incompatible with mining and/or
that require public or private investment in structures, land improvements and
landscaping and that may prevent mining because of the greater economic value
of the land and its improvements. Examples of such uses may include, but shall
not be limited to, high density residential, low density residential with high
unit value, public facilities, geographically limited but impact intensive
industrial and commercial.
   MINED LANDS: The surface, subsurface and ground water of an area in which
surface mining operations will be, are being, or have been conducted, including
private ways and roads appurtenant to any such area, land excavations,
workings, mining waste and areas in which structures, facilities, equipment,
machines, tools or other materials or property which result from, or are used
in, surface mining operations are located.
   MINERALS: Any naturally occurring chemical element or compound, or groups of
elements and compounds, formed from inorganic processes and organic substances,
including, but not limited to, coal, peat, and bituminous rock, but excluding
geothermal resources, natural gas and petroleum.
   OPERATOR: Any person who is engaged in surface mining operations, who
permits others to conduct surface mining operations on his property and who
receives a financial benefit therefrom, or who contracts with others to conduct
operations on his behalf, except for a person who is engaged in surface mining
operations as an employee with wages as sole compensation.
   OVERBURDEN: Soil, rock or other material that lies above a mineral deposit
or in between mineral deposits, before or after its removal by surface mining
operations.
   PERSON: Any individual, firm, association, corporation, organization or
partnership, or any city, county or district of the state, or any department or
agency thereof.
   RECLAMATION: The process of land treatment that minimizes water degradation,
air pollution, damage to aquatic or wildlife habitat, flooding, erosion and
other adverse effects from mining operations, including adverse surface effects
incidental to underground mines, so that mined lands are reclaimed to a usable
condition which are readily adaptable for alternative land uses and create no
danger to public health or safety. Reclamation may extend to lands surrounding
mined lands, and may require backfilling, grading, recoiling, revegetation,
soil compaction, stabilization or other measures.
   STATE REGULATIONS: Collectively the California surface mining and
reclamation act of 1975 1  (the "act"), Public Resources Code section 2207 and
the California Code of Regulations implementing the act (14 California Code of
Regulations section 3500 et seq., and article 9, chapter 8, sections 3700 et

this chapter. Where a person with vested rights has continued surface mining in
the same area subsequent to January 1, 1976, he shall obtain city of Redlands
approval of a reclamation plan covering the mined lands disturbed by such
subsequent surface mining. In those cases where an overlap exists (in the
horizontal and/or vertical sense) between pre- and post-act mining, the
reclamation plan shall call for reclamation proportional to that disturbance
caused by the mining after the effective date of the act (January 1, 1976). All
other requirements of state law and this chapter shall apply to vested mining.
(Ord. 2399 § 2, 1999)
18.266.060: PERMIT AND RECLAMATION PLAN:
   A.   An application for a conditional use permit or reclamation plan for
surface mining operations or a land reclamation project shall be made on the
form provided by the community development department. The application shall be
filed in accordance with this chapter and any written procedures established by
the community development director.
   B.   Copies of the reclamation plan application as may be required by the
community development director shall be submitted in conjunction with all
applications for conditional use permits for surface mining operations. For
surface mining operations that are exempt from a conditional use permit
pursuant to this chapter, the reclamation plan application shall include
information concerning the mining operation that is required for processing the
reclamation plan.
   C.   Applications shall include all required environmental review forms and
information prescribed by the community development director.
   D.   Upon completion of the environmental review procedure and filing of all
documents required by the community development director, consideration of the
conditional use permit or reclamation plan for the proposed or existing surface
mine shall be completed pursuant to this code at a noticed public hearing
before the planning commission, and pursuant to section 2774 of the Public
Resources Code. (Ord. 2399 § 2, 1999)
18.266.070: PROCESSING:
   A.   Notification Of Filing Application: Within thirty (30) days of
acceptance of an application for a conditional use permit to conduct surface
mining operations and/or for a reclamation plan as complete, the community
development department shall notify the director of the filing of the
application. Whenever mining operations are proposed in the 100-year floodplain
of any stream, as shown in zone A of the flood insurance rate maps issued by
the federal emergency management agency, and within one mile, upstream or
downstream, of any state highway bridge, the community development department
shall also notify the state department of transportation that the application
has been received.
   B.   Review Of Application:The community development department shall
process the application in accordance with CEQA and the city's CEQA guidelines
and prepare a staff report with recommendations for consideration to the
planning commission. Prior to final approval of a reclamation plan, financial
assurances (as provided in this chapter), or any amendments to the reclamation
plan or existing financial assurances, the planning commission shall certify to
the director that the reclamation plan and/or financial assurance complies with
the applicable requirements of the state regulations and submit the plan,
assurances, or amendments to the director for review. The planning commission
may conditionally approve the reclamation plan and financial assurances before
submittal to the director. If a conditional use permit is being processed
concurrently with the reclamation plan, the planning commission may
simultaneously also conceptually approve the conditional use permit. However,
the planning commission may defer action on the conditional use permit until
taking final action on the reclamation plan and financial assurance. If
necessary to comply with permit processing deadlines, the planning commission
may conditionally approve the conditional use permit with the condition that
the community development department shall not issue the conditional use permit
for the mining operation until financial assurances have been reviewed by the
director and final action has been taken on the reclamation plan and financial
assurances.
The director shall have thirty (30) days to prepare written comments on the
reclamation plan and financial assurances and forty five (45) days to review
and comment, if the director so chooses. The planning commission shall evaluate
written comments received from the director during the forty five (45) day
comment period. The community development department shall prepare a written
response describing the disposition of the major issues raised by the state for
the planning commission's approval. When the planning commissions position is
at variance with the recommendations and objections raised in the director's
comments, the written response shall address in detail, why specific comments
and suggestions were not accepted. Copies of any written comments received and
responses prepared by the planning commission shall be promptly forwarded to
the operator/applicant. The planning commission may approve, conditionally
approve, or deny the reclamation plan pursuant to section 2774 of the Public
Resources Code, and the financial assurances pursuant to section 2770(d) of the

1999)
18.266.090: RECLAMATION PHASING:
Reclamation activities may be phased with respect to the mining operation and
shall be initiated at the earliest possible time on those portions of the mined
lands that will not be subject to further disturbance (see also section
18.266.140, "Interim Management Plans", of this chapter for idle mining
operations). Interim reclamation may also be required for mined lands that have
been disturbed and that may be disturbed again in future operations.
Reclamation may be done on an annual basis, in stages compatible with
continuing operations, or on completion of all excavation, removal, or fill, as
approved by the city. Each phase of reclamation shall be specifically described
in the reclamation plan and shall include: a) the beginning and expected ending
dates for each phase; b) all reclamation activities required; c) criteria for
measuring completion of specific reclamation activities; and d) estimated costs
as provided under financial assurances hereinbelow. (Ord. 2399 § 2, 1999)
18.266.100: STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY:
The person submitting the reclamation plan shall sign a statement accepting
responsibility for reclaiming the mined lands in accordance with the
reclamation plan. Said statement shall be kept by the planning department in
the mining operators permanent record. Upon sale or transfer of the operation,
the new operator shall submit a signed statement of responsibility to the
planning department for placement in the permanent record. (Ord. 2399 § 2,
1999)
18.266.110: FINDINGS FOR APPROVAL:
   A.   Approval Of A Conditional Use Permit: In addition to the findings for
approval of a conditional use permit contained in chapter 18.192 of this title,
conditional use permits for surface mining operations shall include a finding
that the project complies with the provisions of the state regulations.
   B.   Approval Of Reclamation Plans: For reclamation plans, the following
findings shall be required:
      1.   That the reclamation plan complies with sections 2772, 2773 and
2773.1 of the Public Resources Code and any other applicable provisions.
      2.   That the reclamation plan complies with the state regulation.
      3.   That the reclamation plan and potential use of reclaimed land
pursuant to the plan are consistent with this chapter and the city's general
plan.
      4.   That the reclamation plan has been reviewed pursuant to the CEQA and
the city's CEQA guidelines, and all significant adverse impacts from
reclamation of the surface mining operations are mitigated to the maximum
extent feasible.
      5.   That the land and/or resources such as water bodies to be reclaimed
will be restored to a condition that is compatible with the surrounding natural
environment, topography, and other resources, or that suitable off site
development will compensate for related disturbances to resource values.
      6.   That the reclamation plan will restore the mined lands to a usable
condition which is readily adaptable for alternative land uses consistent with
the city's general plan.
      7.   That a written response to the director has been prepared,
describing the disposition of major issues raised by the director. Where the
city's position is at variance with the recommendations and objections raised
by the director, said response shall address, in detail, why specific comments
and suggestions were not accepted. (Ord. 2399 § 2, 1999)
18.266.120: INSPECTIONS:
The community development department shall arrange for inspection of a surface
mining operation within six (6) months of receipt of the annual report required
by this chapter to determine whether the surface mining operation is in
compliance with the approved conditional use permit and/or reclamation plan,
approved financial assurances, and the state regulations. In no event shall
less than one inspection be conducted in any calendar year. Said inspections
may be made by a state registered geologist, state registered civil engineer,
state licensed landscape architect, state registered forester, who is
experienced in land reclamation and who has not been employed by the mining
operation in any capacity during the previous twelve (12) months, or other
qualified specialists, as selected by the community development director and as
retained by the city. All inspections shall be conducted using a form approved
and provided by the state mining and geology board. The community development
department shall notify the director within thirty (30) days of completion of
the inspection that the said inspection has been conducted and shall forward a
copy of said inspection notice and any supporting documentation to the mining
operator. The operator shall be solely responsible for the reasonable cost of
such inspection. (Ord. 2399 § 2, 1999)
18.266.130: FINANCIAL ASSURANCES:
   A.   To ensure that reclamation will proceed in accordance with the approved
reclamation plan, the city shall require as a condition of approval of any
surface mining operation security which will be released upon satisfactory
performance.
   B.   The applicant may post security in an acceptable form of a surety bond,
trust fund, irrevocable letter of credit from an accredited financial
institution, or other method acceptable to the city and the board as specified
in statewide regulations adopted by the board, and which the city reasonably
determines are adequate to perform reclamation in accordance with the surface
mining operations approved reclamation plan. Financial assurances shall be made
payable to the city and the department of conservation. Financial assurances
shall be required to ensure compliance with elements of the reclamation plan,
including, but not limited to, revegetation and landscaping requirements;
restoration or aquatic or wildlife habitat; restoration of water bodies and
water quality; slope stability and erosion and drainage control, disposal of
hazardous materials; and other mitigation measures. Financial assurances for
such elements of the plan shall be monitored by the community development
department.
   C.   The amount of the financial assurances shall be based upon the
estimated costs of reclamation for the years or phases stipulated in pursuant
to the approved reclamation plan, including any maintenance of reclaimed areas
as may be required, subject to adjustment for the actual amount required to
reclaim lands disturbed by surface mining activities since January 1, 1976, and
new lands to be disturbed by surface mining activities in the upcoming year, as
provided in subsection F of this section. Cost estimates shall be prepared by a
licensed engineer and/or other qualified professionals retained by the operator
and approved by the community development director. The estimated amount of the
financial assurance shall be based on an analysis of physical activities
necessary to implement the approved reclamation plan, the unit costs for each
of these activities, the number of units of each of these activities, and the
actual administrative costs. Financial assurances to ensure compliance with
revegetation, restoration of water bodies, restoration of aquatic or wildlife
habitat, and any other applicable element of the approved reclamation plan
shall be based upon cost estimates that include, but may not be limited to,
labor, equipment, materials, mobilization of equipment, administration, and
reasonable profit by a commercial operator other than the permittee.
   D.   In projecting the costs of financial assurances, it shall be assumed
without prejudice or insinuation that the surface mining operation could be
abandoned by the operator and, consequently, the city or state may need to
contract with a third party commercial company for reclamation of the site.
   E.   The financial assurances shall remain in effect for the duration of the
surface mining operation and any additional period until reclamation is
completed including any maintenance required.
   F.   The amount of financial assurances required of a surface mining
operation for any one year shall be adjusted annually to account for new lands
disturbed by operations, inflation, and reclamation of lands accomplished in
accordance with the approved reclamation plan. The financial assurances shall
include estimates to cover reclamation for existing conditions and anticipated
activities during the upcoming year, excepting that the permittee may not claim
credit for reclamation scheduled for completion during the coming year.
   G.   Revisions to financial assurances shall be submitted to the community
development director each year prior to the anniversary date for approval of
the financial assurances. The financial assurance shall cover the cost of
existing disturbance and anticipated activities for the next calendar year,
including any required interim reclamation. If revisions to the financial
assurances are not required, the operator shall explain, in writing, why
revisions are not required. (Ord. 2399 § 2, 1999)
18.266.140: INTERIM MANAGEMENT PLANS:
   A.   Within ninety (90) days of a surface mining operation becoming idle,
the operation shall submit to the community development department a proposed
interim management plan (the "IMP"). The proposed IMP shall fully comply with
the requirements of Public Resources Code, section 2770 (h) and shall provide
measures the operator will implement to maintain the site in compliance with
SMARA, and all conditions of the conditional use permit and/or reclamation
plan. The proposed IMP shall be processed as an amendment to the reclamation
plan and shall not be considered a project for the purposes of environmental
review.
   B.   Financial assurances for idle operations shall be continued as
addressed in the reclamation plan or an otherwise approved through the idle
mine's IMP. Upon receipt of a complete proposed IMP, the community development
department shall forward the IMP to the department of conservation for review.
The IMP shall be submitted to the department of conservation at least forty
five (45) days prior to approval by the planning commission.
   C.   Within sixty (60) days of receipt of the proposed IMP, or a longer
period mutually agreed upon by the community development director and the
operator, the planning commission shall review and approve or deny the IMP in
accordance with this chapter. The operator shall have thirty (30) days or a
longer period mutually agreed upon by the operator and the community
development director to submit a revised IMP. The planning commission shall
approve or deny the revised IMP within sixty (60) days of receipt. If the
planning commission denies the revised IMP, the operator may appeal that action
to the city council.
   D.   The IMP may remain in effect for a period not to exceed five (5) years,
at which time the planning commission may renew the IMP for another period not
to exceed five (5) years or require the surface mining operator to commence
reclamation in accordance with its approved reclamation plan. (Ord. 2399 § 2,
1999)
18.266.150: PERIODIC REVIEW:
As a condition of approval for either the conditional use permit or the
reclamation plan, a periodic review schedule shall be established to evaluate
the compliance with such permit or plan. (Ord. 2399 § 2, 1999)
18.266.160: TIME LIMIT COMMENCEMENT OF USE PERMITS FOR SURFACE MINING
OPERATIONS:
The time limits for commencing surface mining operations that are permitted
pursuant to this chapter shall be as provided in this code. (Ord. 2399 § 2,
1999)
18.266.170: APPEALS:
Any person aggrieved by an act or determination of the planning commission in
the exercise of the authority granted herein shall have the right to appeal to
the city council. An appeal shall be filed on forms provided by the city within
ten (10) calendar days after the date of the decision being appealed. (Ord.
2399 § 2, 1999)
18.266.180: VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES:
If the community development director, based upon an annual inspection or
otherwise confirmed by an inspection of the mining operation, determines that a
surface mining operation is not in compliance with this chapter, the applicable
conditional use permit, any required permit and/or the reclamation plan, the
city shall follow the procedures set forth in Public Resources Code sections
2774.1 and 2774.2 concerning violations and penalties, as well as those
provisions of this code for revocation and/or abandonment of a conditional use
permit which are not preempted by SMARA. (Ord. 2399 § 2, 1999)
18.266.190: FEES:
The city shall establish such fees as it deems necessary to cover the
reasonable costs incurred in implementing this chapter and the state
regulations, including, but not limited to, processing of applications, annual
reports, inspections, monitoring, enforcement and compliance. Such fees shall
be paid by the operator of the surface mining and/or reclamation plan, as
required by the city, at the time of filing of the conditional use permit
application, reclamation plan application, or at such other time as is
determined by the city to be appropriate in order to ensure that all reasonable
costs of implementing this chapter are borne by the operator. (Ord. 2399 § 2,
1999)
18.266.200: MINERAL RESOURCE PROTECTION:
Mine development is encouraged in compatible areas before encroachment of
conflicting uses. Mineral resource areas that have been classified by the state
department of conservation's division of mines and geology or designated by the
state mining and geology board, as well as existing surface mining operations
that remain in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall be
protected from intrusion by incompatible land uses that may impede or preclude
mineral extraction or processing, to the extent possible consistent with the
city's general plan.
In accordance with Public Resources Code section 2762, the city's general plan
and resource maps will be prepared to reflect mineral information
(classification and/or designation report) within twelve (12) months of receipt
from the state mining and geology board of such information. Land use decisions
within the city will be guided by information provided on the location of
identified mineral resources of regional significance. Conservation and
potential development of identified mineral resource areas will be considered
and encouraged. Recordation on property titles of the presence of important
mineral resources within the identified mineral resources areas may be
encouraged as a condition of approval of any development project in the
impacted area. Prior to approving a use that would otherwise be incompatible
with mineral resource protection, conditions of approval may be applied to
encroaching development projects to minimize potential conflicts. (Ord. 2399 §
2, 1999)

11-3-1987: § 13 of proposition R, passed by voters 11-7-1978)
19.04.140: CONFORMANCE OF GENERAL PLAN AND CODE:
The Redlands city general plan and this code shall be amended forthwith to
conform with the requirements of measure N. To the extent that any policy or
provision of measure N is not self- executing the city council shall promptly
enact such regulation and ordinances as may be necessary to carry out the
purposes, intent and directives hereof. The provisions of measure N are
expressly declared to be minimum requirements. (§ 4 of measure N, passed by
voters 11-3-1987: § 14 of proposition R, passed by voters 11-7-1978)
19.04.150: IMPLEMENTATION:
The city council and all city agencies, boards and commissions are directed to
take any and all actions necessary to carry out measure N, including, but not
limited to, adoption and implementation of any amendments to the city general
plan, zoning ordinance and/or this code. This measure shall be implemented
forthwith as a matter of the highest priority of the city. (§ 4 of measure N,
passed by voters 11-3-1987: § 15 of proposition R, passed by voters 11-7-1978)
19.04.160: GUIDELINES:
The city council may adopt guidelines to implement and interpret measure N and

19.04.170: EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN PROJECTS:
   A.   Measure N shall apply to all properties and projects covered by its
terms, except it shall not apply to any development project which has obtained
a vested right as of the effective date of measure N. For purposes of measure
N, a vested right shall have been obtained only if each and all of the
following criteria are met:
      1.   The proposed project has received a building permit or its final
discretionary approval;
      2.   Substantial expenditures have been incurred in good faith reliance
on the permit or final discretionary approval; and
      3.   Substantial construction has been performed in good faith reliance
on the permit or final discretionary approval.

performed and the question of whether or not such expenditures and construction
were in good faith are questions of fact to be determined on a case by case
basis by the city council following application by the developer and notice of
public hearing. Actions taken by a developer to speed up or expedite a
development project with knowledge of the pendency of this measure shall not be
deemed to be good faith and shall not qualify for vested rights. Phased
projects shall be considered for exemption on a phase by phase basis to the
extent permitted by California law. For purposes of section 19.04.060 of this
chapter, with regard to water or sewer connections outside the city, an
applicant shall qualify for a vested right only if the foregoing criteria are
met after the application has obtained a sewer or water, commitment, or both if
both are required, from the city. (§ 4 of measure N, passed by voters 11-3-
1987: § 17 of proposition R, passed by voters 11-7-1978)

19.16.010: PREREQUISITES AND ENTITIES ASSIGNING POINTS:
   A.   Tentative Approval Required: In order to assure that a project is in
final approval form, as required by proposition R, the project shall be
environmentally assessed and tentatively approved by the planning commission
and city council before an application for development allocations can be
filed.
   B.   Point Assignments: The planning commission will assign points in the
following categories:
      1.   Consistency with zone classifications and standards;
      2.   Architectural design variety;
      3.   Site and grading design;
      4.   Circulation;
      5.   Landscaping;
      6.   Open space.
   C.   Point Assignment Categories: The city staff will assign points in the
following categories:

19.16.020: APPLICATION FOR DEVELOPMENT ALLOCATIONS:
   A.   Following environmental review and tentative approval of the project by
the city, the applicant shall submit an application for development allocations
on a form provided by the planning department.
   B.   Applications do not require the preparation of final engineering or
construction plans in order to be considered; however, all required information
must be of sufficient detail to clearly illustrate the development proposal.
   C.   Incomplete or partial applications will not be accepted. Only one
application is allowed per allocation period on the same property. To enable
the city to review projects as fairly as possible, the application must
describe how the proposed project satisfies the criteria of chapter 19.12 of
this title. A detailed description in the application is important because the
applicant, unless there are no other competing projects at the time allocations
are sought pursuant to this chapter, will have no further opportunity to
explain how the development in question satisfies the criteria of this title.
(Ord. 2593 § 1, 2005: Ord. 1843 § 3(B), 1984: prior code art. 940)

is open for public review. (Ord. 2036 § 6, 1988: Ord. 1891 § 4, 1985: Ord. 1843
§ 3(C), 1984: prior code art. 940)
19.16.040: APPLICATION; REVIEW AND EVALUATION PERIOD:
   A.   When an application has been determined to be complete and timely
filed, it shall be reviewed by city staff and representatives of the local
school district for subsequent submission and recommendation to the city's
planning commission. City planning staff shall meet with representatives of the
various city departments and appropriate commissions to review each project
application and assign numerical values based on the criteria contained in
chapter 19.12 of this title. After an application is submitted to the planning
commission for an allocation, the development project that is the subject of
that application shall not be altered by the applicant except as provided in
subsection C of this section.
   B.   Following the review period, the city planning staff shall issue an
evaluation of all projects requesting development allocations, with numerical
values assigned to each. The report assigning numerical values to each project
shall be open to public review prior to the actual allocation awards by the
city council.
   C.   If, after the review by staff and the planning commission, a project
has failed to obtain the required number of points to receive allocations, that
project applicant may revise its development application, based on input from
city staff and the planning commission, in an attempt to enhance the
development project and obtain additional points prior to review by the city
council. This opportunity to revise a project application to obtain additional
points shall only be available to a project if that project applicant is the
sole entity seeking allocations and the allocations are sought during the final
quarter of the year. (Ord. 2593 § 2, 2005: Ord. 1843 § 3(D), 1984: prior code
art. 940)
19.16.050: ALLOCATION; COUNCIL PROCEDURES:
   A.   At a public meeting, the city council shall evaluate all recommended
point assignments, hear from the applicant and the general public if requested,
and award the development allocations pursuant to this title. Projects
receiving ninety (90) points will be considered for awards, with higher
priority being given to projects with higher point values. A maximum of thirty
five (35) development allocations may be awarded to any project in any single
allocation period, unless this limit and the total successful applications
results in less than the scheduled number of development allocations being
awarded. If the latter occurs, the excess allocations may be awarded to
successful projects applying for more than thirty five (35) allocations.
   B.   The decision of the city council on development allocation awards is
final. (Ord. 2036 § 7, 1988: Ord. 2007 § 1, 1987: Ord. 1891 § 5, 1985: Ord.
1843 § 3(E), 1984: prior code art. 940)
19.16.060: ALLOCATION RESOLUTION OF TIE SCORES:

provisions of this title, but insufficient development allocations are
available to provide both projects with their requested totals, each project
will receive an equitably prorated share of the remaining allocations, based on
initial applications. (Ord. 1843 § 3(F), 1984: prior code art. 940)
19.16.070: ALTERATION OF APPROVED PROJECTS:
   A.   The council may set guidelines by resolution to allow the alteration of
a project in any manner which would not have resulted in the assignment of
fewer points if the alteration had been incorporated into the original approved
application.
   B.   Such a review of altered approved projects shall be based upon the
ordinance in effect at the time of the original point allocation for the
project. (Ord. 1843 § 3(G), 1984: prior code art. 940)
19.16.080: TRANSFER OF ALLOCATIONS:
A development allocation is awarded under this title based upon the particular
location and characteristics of a specific development proposal on a specific
site, and may not therefore be transferred to another site or used for another
development proposal. However, a development allocation may be transferred with
city council approval to successors in interest who acquire title to the
specific development proposal on the specified site, upon proof satisfactory to
the city attorney that legal title has so passed. (Ord. 1843 § 3(H), 1984:
prior code art. 940)
19.16.090: EXPIRATION OF ALLOCATIONS:
A development allocation expires and is of no further effect when the
underlying tentative map or use permit expires. This section applies only to
residential development allocations awarded after May 15, 1984. (Ord. 1843 § 3
(I), 1984: prior code art. 940)
19.16.100: WATER AND SEWER CONNECTIONS OUTSIDE CITY:

CHAPTER 19.20
EMERGENCY SITUATIONS OR IMPACTION OF PUBLIC FACILITIES ON SERVICES
SECTION:
19.20.010: Emergency Or Impaction Conditions; Development Approval And Water Or
Sewer Connection Limitations
19.20.010: EMERGENCY OR IMPACTION CONDITIONS; DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL AND WATER OR
SEWER CONNECTION LIMITATIONS:
   A.   No further development approvals of any kind, or sewer or water
connections, shall be approved by the city when an emergency situation or
impaction of public facilities or services has been identified by the
appropriate agency. Such conditions shall be any one or more of the following:
      1.   Notification of a city department, other public agency, or the
district that its ability to meet the public needs is impacted. Such notice
shall be presented to the city council in writing, and be followed with a
presentation by the impacted agency to the city council in public sessions, to
provide detailed, clear and convincing evidence of an emergency or impaction.
In the event of notification by the district, the requirements of chapter 13.84
of this code shall apply in addition to the above;
      2.   Before the close of filing for an allocation period, purveyors of
city and school services shall notify the city manager if their particular
service would be impacted by the award of development allocations to the
applications to be considered that period. If emergency or impaction is
declared and concurred with by the city council, no development allocation
shall be approved without attaching a requirement that no building permit shall
be issued until documentation has been received from the declaring agency that
such impaction has been adequately mitigated. This requirement shall remain in
force until the declaration of emergency or impaction is rescinded by the
declaring agency, or as otherwise determined by the city council by resolution;
      3.   Any other danger to the public safety or welfare which the city
council determines to exist for the purpose of this section.
   B.   If the dwelling unit(s) under consideration is/are outside the city
limits, any and all mitigating measures arising from declaration of emergency
or impaction shall apply if the city supplies water and/or sewer services, and
if a water and/or sewer emergency or impaction exists.
   C.   In the event the city council concurs that such emergency or impaction
exists, no further development approvals of any kind, and/or sewer or water
connection permits, shall be issued, except when approved by a majority of the
city council for each applicant considered individually, after it has
determined that the specific project will not contribute additionally to the
existing emergency or impaction situation, or upon notice by the appropriate
agency that the specific project has adequately mitigated its additional
impact. (Ord. 1843 § 4, 1984)
CHAPTER 19.24
VESTED RIGHTS PROJECTS UNDER MEASURE N
SECTION:
19.24.010: Exemption Of Vested Rights Projects From Restrictions Of Measure N
19.24.020: Yearly Limit On Building Permits
19.24.030: Interim Allocation Of Building Permits
19.24.040: Standard Agreement With Vested Rights Projects
19.24.010: EXEMPTION OF VESTED RIGHTS PROJECTS FROM RESTRICTIONS OF MEASURE N:
Section 17 of measure N as adopted by the voters in 1987 states that the
measure shall not apply to any development project which has obtained a vested
right to develop as of the effective date of the initiative, December 11, 1987.
This is construed by the city council to mean that projects found by the city
council after public hearing to have obtained vested rights by December 11,
1987, are exempt from the revised competitive evaluation, the reduced yearly
limits, and all other new requirements imposed by measure N. These vested
rights projects remain subject to the provisions of proposition R and all other
land use laws and regulations in effect in the city at the time of their
various required approvals. (Ord. 2031 § 1, 1988)
19.24.020: YEARLY LIMIT ON BUILDING PERMITS:
The council finds that based on the expressed will of the citizenry as set
forth in measure N in 1987, it is in the best interests of the city of Redlands
that new dwelling units be limited to as near four hundred (400) per year as
possible. City staff is hereby instructed to take all reasonably necessary
steps to carry out this dwelling unit limit. (Ord. 2031 § 1, 1988)
19.24.030: INTERIM ALLOCATION OF BUILDING PERMITS:
In order to assure full use of vested rights under measure N and California
law, building permits should be available when projects deemed by the city
council to be vested are otherwise legally ready to obtain them. However, it is
not appropriate to hold up all other development projects in case those vested
projects might come forward and use up the full four hundred (400) building
permits available under measure N in any given calendar year. The council finds
that some minimal number of building permits should be made periodically
available for qualified but nonvested development projects to assure a
continuous supply of housing for our citizens and to protect the reasonable
development expectations of landowners filing for land use approvals and
entitlements within the city. Therefore, on an interim basis, a number of
building permits per month to be set by council resolution pursuant to this
section shall be made available to otherwise qualified but nonvested projects.
This number may be changed or deleted entirely by subsequent council resolution
if the pace of development so requires, or if the four hundred (400) unit
yearly cap imposed by measure N shows danger of being exceeded or is actually
exceeded by a combination of vested and nonvested projects. (Ord. 2031 § 1,
1988)
19.24.040: STANDARD AGREEMENT WITH VESTED RIGHTS PROJECTS:
During this interim period the city attorney is instructed to develop a
standard agreement and begin negotiating with those projects deemed by this
council to have vested rights to determine the rate and number of building
permits needed by those projects. Once the total need and pace is known, the
council shall reexamine the monthly limits it has set by resolution and revise
those units as required to meet insofar as is possible the yearly limit of four
hundred (400) new dwelling units within the city. (Ord. 2031 § 1, 1988)
