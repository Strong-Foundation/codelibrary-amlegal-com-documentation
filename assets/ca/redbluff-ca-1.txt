revenues which would be received by it in awarding the quotation to a vendor or
contractor who maintains a place of business located within the limits of the
city.

manner and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The Community
Development Director or designee (authorized officer, official or agent of the
city) shall carry the burden of establishing that a violation existed and that
costs for abatement represented in the special assessment were reasonable under

complete, the several amounts assessed shall be payable, and the assessments
shall be liens against the lots or parcels of land assessed, respectively. The
liens shall be subordinate to all existing special assessment liens previously
imposed upon the same property and shall be paramount to all other liens except
for state, county and property taxes with which it shall be upon a parity. The
lien shall continue until the assessment and all interest due and payable
thereon are paid.

      (1)   Within ten calendar days after the issuance notice of the decision

renewal of a CCBP, the applicant or permittee may appeal such action by filing
a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk setting forth the reason why the
decision was not proper. The grounds for the appeal shall be stated with
specificity. A decision to rank and/or score an application pursuant to §
6B.20 shall not be subject to appeal.
      (2)   The notice of appeal shall be in writing and signed by the person
making the appeal (“appellant”), or their legal representative, and shall

         (b)   Specify the decisions, actions, or a particular part thereof,
made that are the subject of the appeal;

appeal is based in sufficient detail to enable the City Council, or any
appointed hearing officer, to understand the nature of the controversy, the
basis of the appeal, and the relief requested;
         (e)   All available documents or other evidence pertinent to the
appeal that the appellant requests the hearing officer or body to consider at
the hearing; and
         (f)   A non-refundable appeal fee, as established by resolution of the
City Council.
      (3)   Failure of the appellant to timely submit a written appeal
constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal any appealable notice and/or
decision of Director or TAC. In this event, such notice of revocation,
suspension and/or other action is final and binding and shall become effective
upon the expiration of the period for filing a written notice of appeal.
      (4)   In the event a written notice of appeal is timely filed, the non-
renewal, suspension, revocation, or other action shall not become effective
until a final decision has been rendered and issued by the City Council or
appointed hearing officer or body.
   (B)   Appeal hearing and proceedings.
      (1)   All appellants shall, subject to filing a timely written notice of
appeal and payment of fees, be entitled to a hearing before the City Council,

      (2)   Upon receipt by the City Clerk of a timely-filed appeal, the City
Clerk shall place on the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting or
earlier special council meeting the question of whether the City Council itself
shall hear the appeal. The City Council’s decision shall be limited to whether
or not to hear the appeal or delegate that authority and shall not include
consideration or discussion of the merits or facts of the appeal. In the event
that the City Council does not affirmatively choose to hear such appeal or does
not act to appoint another body to serve to hear such appeal, the City Clerk
shall obtain the services of a hearing officer from the state Office of
Administrative Hearings or other agency or organization that provides neutral
hearing officers.
      (3)   The administrative appeal shall be scheduled no later than 45 days,
and no sooner than 30 days, after receipt of a timely-filed notice of appeal,
if such appeal is to be heard by the City Council or other city-appointed body.
If the state Office of Administrative Hearings or other agency or organization
is utilized for such hearing, then the hearing shall be scheduled as
expeditiously as possible pursuant to the availability of a hearing officer.
The appellant(s) listed on the written notice of appeal shall be notified in
writing of the date, time, and location of the hearing at least ten days before
the date of the hearing (“notice of appeal hearing”).
   (C)   At the date, time and location set forth in the notice of appeal
hearing, the City Council, or an appointed hearing officer or body, shall hear
and consider the testimony of the appellant(s), city staff, and/or their
witnesses, as well as any documentary evidence properly submitted for
consideration.
   (D)   The following rules shall apply to the appeal hearing:
      (1)   The hearing shall be a new (i.e., "de novo”) hearing based on a
preponderance of the evidence standard. The formal or technical rules of
evidence shall not apply. However, irrelevant, collateral, undue, and/or
repetitious testimony or other evidence may be excluded. The appellant bears
the burden of proof on appeal.
      (2)   The City Council, or appointed hearing officer or body, may accept
and consider late evidence not submitted initially with the notice of appeal
upon a showing by the appellant of good cause. The City Council, or appointed
hearing officer or body, shall determine whether a particular fact or facts
amount to a good cause on a case-by-case basis.
      (3)   The appellant may bring a language interpreter to the hearing at
their sole expense.
      (4)   All parties may, at their own discretion, record the hearing by
stenographer or court reporter, audio recording, or video recording. If the
appellant requests from the city that said recording take place, the costs of
same shall be deposited with the city at the time the notice of appeal is
submitted to the city.
   (E)   The appellant or their legal representative’s failure to appear at the
appeal hearing shall constitute both the appellant’s waiver of the right to
appeal and a failure to exhaust all administrative remedies. In such instance,
Director or TAC’s notice of decision is final and binding.
   (F)   Decision of the City Council, or appointed hearing officer or body;
final decision.
      (1)   Following the conclusion of the appeal hearing, the City Council,
or appointed hearing officer or body shall determine if any ground exists for
the non-issuance, non-renewal, suspension or revocation of the commercial
cannabis permit or other appealed action and shall issue a written decision
within ten business days thereof.
      (2)   The decision of the City Council, or appointed hearing officer or
body, is final and conclusive and is subject to the time limits set forth in
California Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.6.
   (G)   A copy of the final decision shall include notification of the time
limits of California Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.6 and be served by
certified, first-class U.S. Mail on the appellant. If the appellant is not the
owner of the real property in which the commercial cannabis business is
located, or proposed to be located, a copy of the final decision may also be
served on the property owner by first class mail to the address shown on the
last equalized assessment roll. Failure of a person to receive a properly
addressed final decision shall not invalidate any action or proceeding by the
city pursuant to this chapter.

shall be the duty of the Fire Chief or his or her authorized representatives to
notify the person or persons to remove the same within ten days.

shall mail to the owner, at the address on the last assessment roll, a notice
giving the substance of the decision of the City Council; and then if the owner
does not, at his or her own expense, make the removal within five days
thereafter, the hazard shall be mitigated by city personnel or a weed
contractor, at the expense of the owner whose real property is assessed on the
last equalized assessment roll, and it shall be mailed to the address shown on

in a lien for applicable abatement costs on said property.

Fire Chief or his or her authorized representative shall be "notice to destroy
or remove weeds, debris and rubble", and the notice shall be substantially in

   (A)   As provided in California Government Code § 66427.1(a), a notice of
intent to convert shall be delivered by the subdivider to each tenant at least
60 days prior to filing of the tentative map. The written notices of tenants
required by this section shall be deemed satisfied if the notices comply with
the requirements for service by certified mail. The form of the notice shall be
in the form outlined in California Government Code § 66452.9(b), approved by
the Planning Department and will inform the tenants of all rights provided
under this article and state law.
   (B)   As provided in California Government Code § 66427.1(a), each tenant
shall receive ten days written notice that an application for a public report
will be or has been submitted to the Department of Real Estate and that the
report will be available on request. The written notices to tenants required by
this section shall be deemed satisfied if the notices comply with the
requirements for service by certified mail.
   (C)   As provided in California Government Code § 66427.1(b), each tenant

for the proposed conversion. The written notices to tenants required by this
section shall be deemed satisfied if the notices comply with the requirements

   (D)   As provided in California Government Code § 66427.1(d), any present
tenant shall be given notice of an exclusive right to contract for purchase of
his or her respective unit upon the same terms and conditions that the unit

of issuance of the subdivision public report unless the tenant gives prior
written notice of his or her intention not to exercise the right. Evidence of
receipt by each tenant shall be submitted prior to approval of the final map.
The written notices to tenants required by this section shall be deemed
satisfied if the notices comply with the requirements for service by certified
mail.
   (E)   Each tenant not in default under the obligations of the rental
agreement or lease under which he or she occupies his or her unit, shall be
given 180 days written notice of intention to convert his or her unit prior to
termination of tenancy. The subdivider shall notify each tenant immediately
prior to the time of final map approval of the anticipated date required to
vacate the unit and when the 180-day period will begin. Evidence of receipt by
each tenant shall be submitted prior to approval of the final map. The written

of the application by the Planning Department shall be limited to 5% per year,
as long as the tentative map is valid.
   (G)   Any non-purchasing tenant who is handicapped or has minor children in
school or is age 60 or older and does not accept a lifetime lease, living in
any unit prior to the time a completed tentative map application has been
accepted by the Planning Department shall be given at least an additional six
months in which to find suitable replacement housing.
   (H)   The subdivides shall provide moving expenses of two times the monthly
rent, not to exceed $500, to any tenant household living in any unit prior to
the time a completed tentative map application has been accepted by the
Planning Department, as provided in this section. A tenant moving in after
tentative map application will not be required to be provided with moving
expenses. Eligible tenants will receive moving expenses within 14 days after
they relocate, except when the tenant has given notice of his or her intent to
convert. The subdivides shall also provide each tenant with a list of other
comparable rentals available in the city area beginning from the time of
tentative map application.

pursuant to this section, he or she shall pay to each prospective tenant who
becomes a tenant, and who was entitled to the notice and who does not purchase
his or her unit, an amount equal to two times the monthly rent, not to exceed

shall be offered a lifetime lease. Annual rent increases shall not exceed 5%.
Starting rents shall be the rent at the time of tentative map application.
   (K)   At the time of final map approval, all tenant households resident,
upon acceptance by the city of a completed tentative map application, which
meet the income limits of the Farmers Home Administration, will be considered
low and moderate income households and shall be offered, at minimum, a three-
year lease. Annual rent increases shall not exceed 5%. Starting rents shall be
the rent at the time of tentative map application.
(`61 Code, § 10.4) (Ord. 709, passed 1-18-1983)
§ 10.5 EFFECT OF PROPOSED CONVERSION ON THE CITY’S LOW AND MODERATE INCOME
HOUSING SUPPLY.
   (A)   In order to reduce the effect of conversions on the city’s housing
supply and to minimize the displacement of tenants, the number of conversions
shall be limited to no more than 5% of the city’s potentially convertible
rental stock in any one calendar year. Conversion applications will be
processed in the order that completed applications are submitted. A proposed
project that is larger than the permitted number of units in a given year, if
approved, will be considered to have used the permitted number for as many
future years as necessary.
   (B)   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      POTENTIALLY CONVERTIBLE RENTAL STOCK. The number of rental units in
buildings of four or more units, as determined by the most recent count of
business licenses issued for the units, plus any new rental units constructed
since, minus any units which have received tentative map approval to convert
and demolitions.
   (C)   Once the yearly limit has been reached, a project may be approved for
conversion only if the Planning Commission makes one or more of the following
findings:
      (1)   The development will provide for the construction of new rental
housing; and
      (2)   The need and demand for low cost home ownership to be provided for
by this project will outweigh the detriment caused by further reduction of the
rental stock, when it is proven by the developer that a rental shortage does
not exist.
(`61 Code, § 10.5) (Ord. 709, passed 1-18-1983)
§ 10.6 FINDINGS.
   The Planning Commission shall not approve an application for conversion
unless the Planning Commission finds that:
   (A)   All provisions of this chapter are met;
   (B)   The proposed conversion is consistent with the objectives, policies,
general land uses and programs specified in the general plan, along with the
housing element; and
   (C)   The proposed conversion will conform to the city code in effect at the
time of tentative map approval, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

Constitution or applicable statutes of the United States or of the state from
the payment of the taxes, as are herein prescribed.
   (C)   (1)   None of the license taxes provided for by this chapter shall be
so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce. In any case
where a license tax is believed by a licensee or applicant for license to place
an undue burden upon the commerce, he or she may apply to the Director of
Finance for an adjustment of the tax so that it shall not be discriminatory or
unreasonable as to the commerce. The application may be made before, at or
within six months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant
shall, by affidavit and supporting testimony, show his or her method of
business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and other
information as the Director of Finance may deem necessary in order to determine
the extent, if any, of the undue burden on the commerce.
      (2)   The Director of Finance shall then conduct an investigation and,
after having first obtained the written approval of the City Attorney, shall
fix as the license tax for the applicant, an amount that is reasonable and
nondiscriminatory, or if the license tax has already been paid, shall order a
refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the
license tax to be charged, the Director of Finance shall have the power to base
the license tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which
will assure that the license tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed
on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed
the license tax as prescribed by this chapter.
      (3)   Should the Director of Finance determine the gross receipts measure
of license tax to be the proper basis, he or she may require the applicant to
submit, either at the time of termination of applicant’s business in the city
or at the end of each three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross
receipts and pay the amount of license tax therefor, provided that no
additional license tax during any one calendar year shall be required after the
licensee shall have paid an amount equal to the annual license tax as
prescribed in this chapter.
   (D)   Any person claiming an exemption pursuant to this section shall file a
verified statement with the Director of Finance stating the facts upon which
exemption is claimed.

verified statement, issue a license to the person claiming exemption under this
section without payment to the city of the license tax required by this
chapter.

opportunity for hearing to a licensee, may revoke any license granted pursuant

entitled to the exemption as provided herein.
(`61 Code, § 12.7) (Ord. 397, passed 12-27-1960)
§ 12.7-1 NONPROFIT CORPORATIONS.
   (A)   Nonprofit corporations, exempt under the laws of the state and country
from the payment of corporation franchise taxes or corporation income taxes,
shall not be required to obtain any license to engage in door-to-door
solicitation or to conduct occasional sales in the nature of rummage sales or
sales of other than new merchandise. Nonprofit corporations having a regular
place of business and which dispense on a regular basis, food or beverages or
which sell merchandise on a regular basis at a fixed place of business, shall
obtain a business license for which the annual fee shall be $25. No additional
fee shall be levied for a license nor tax imposed. Evidence of nonprofit status
of the corporation shall be in the form of an exemption letter issued by the
Franchise Tax Board of the state.
   (B)   In the interests of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of
the city, the city may require persons who solicit funds or who sell
merchandise door-to-door, who are members of a nonprofit corporation, to obtain
an identification card or device from the city. The City Council delegates to
the Chief of Police of the city the authority to require the issuance of the
identification card or cards or device to any person or persons engaged in
solicitation in the city on behalf of a nonprofit corporation. The
identification card or device shall identify the solicitor, the organization
for which he or she is soliciting, the duration of the validity of the
identification card or device and any other information which the Chief of
Police deems necessary for proper identification. The card or device shall
specifically state that it is not a license and that the city does not endorse
the organization which is soliciting funds or sales of merchandise.

as it deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purpose of
this article. It may delay the time for removal of the vehicle or part thereof

which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from
the landowner.

(Ord. 1074, passed 7-18-2023)
§ 15.8 ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The City Council has determined the enforcement of
the Red Bluff Municipal Code throughout the city is an important public service
vital to the protection of the public's peace, health, safety and quality of
life. The Council has also determined an administrative citation process is an
appropriate method of enforcing violations of the municipal code. This chapter
provides uniform procedures for issuing administrative citations and conducting
administrative hearings, and is in addition to all other criminal, civil, or
administrative remedies that may be pursued by the city to address any
violation of the municipal code. Use of this chapter as a remedy shall be at
the sole discretion of the city.
   (B)   Violation of the municipal code.
      (1)   Any person violating any provision of the municipal code may be
subject to the issuance of an administrative citation pursuant to the
administrative procedures provided in this chapter.
      (2)   For the purposes of this chapter, each and every day a violation of
any provision of the municipal code constitutes a separate and distinct
violation.
   (C)   Alternative actions. The procedures provided in this chapter shall be
cumulative and in addition to any other procedure or legal remedy provided for
in the municipal code or by state law. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed
to prevent the city from commencing alternative administrative, civil, or
criminal proceedings to penalize or abate a nuisance under applicable civil,
criminal, or municipal code provisions as an alternative to the proceedings set
forth in this chapter.
   (D)   Authority to enter and inspect property. For the purposes of this
chapter, any enforcement officer shall have the power to enter onto any public
or private property within the city of Red Bluff in order to determine the
existence of a violation of any provision of the municipal code and to make any
inspection, examination, or survey as may be necessary to perform enforcement
duties. All entries, inspections, examinations, and surveys shall be done in a
reasonable manner. If an owner, occupant, or agent refuses permission to enter
or inspect, the enforcement officer may seek an administrative inspection
warrant pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §§
1822.50 through
1822.59, as may be amended from time to time.
   (E)   Opportunity to cure non-urgent violations. The administrative citation
process set forth in this chapter may be utilized to enforce continuing
violations of this code; provided, however, that the person responsible for any
such continuing violation shall be allowed a reasonable period of time to
correct or otherwise remedy the violation prior to the city's issuance of an
administrative citation. Nothing in this section, however, shall require the
city to provide any such correction period concerning violations creating an
immediate danger to health or safety, or to any building, plumbing, electrical,
or other similar structural or zoning code violations which are transient and
noncontinuing in nature.
   (F)   Authority to issue administrative citation. Whenever an enforcement
officer determines that a violation of any provision of the municipal code has
occurred, the enforcement officer shall have the authority to issue an
administrative citation to any applicable responsible party. If the enforcement
officer determines that multiple code violations have occurred, the
administrative citation shall address all such violations. Administrative
citations shall be served in accordance with §
15.5 of this chapter.
   (G)   Notice of noncompliance.
      (1)   Whenever an enforcement officer determines that any property is
maintained in violation of the Red Bluff Municipal Code, he or she may record a
notice of noncompliance in a form approved by the City Attorney.
      (2)   Service of the notice of noncompliance shall be made as set forth
in §
15.4.
      (3)   Upon completion of service, the notice of noncompliance shall be
recorded against the property where the violation(s) exist. Such recording
shall be made by the Tehama County Recorder.
      (4)   Any OWNER, as defined by Red Bluff Municipal Code §
15.3, may contest the validity of the notice of noncompliance by making an
application to the Deputy City Clerk within 30 calendar days from the date the
notice of noncompliance is served. The hearing officer shall hear any such
application no later than 30 calendar days after a timely application is made.
      (5)   When all violations noted on a notice of noncompliance have been
abated or when equity may otherwise require, the enforcement officer shall
record a release of the notice of noncompliance. The enforcement officer shall
serve notice of the release of the notice of noncompliance pursuant to §
15.4.

issued pursuant to this chapter shall contain the following information:

later.
      (6)   If the city determines that the person requesting the waiver is
required to deposit only a specified part of the amount of the fine, that
person shall remit the required amount to the city within ten calendar days of
the date of the decision or 30 calendar days from the date of the
administrative citation, whichever is later.

concerning the administrative citation to the hearing officer for consideration
at the hearing, then a copy of this report also shall be served on the person
requesting the hearing at least five calendar days prior to the date of the

hearing upon the cited person. Service shall be made pursuant to §

of the hearing officer and the final decision of the city. Notwithstanding any

§ 15.9 ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES AND ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The City Council has determined that the
enforcement of the Red Bluff Municipal Code throughout the city is an important
public service and is vital to the protection of the public's peace, health,
safety and quality of life. The Council has also determined that the imposition
of an administrative penalty and abatement program is an appropriate method of
enhancing and promoting the maintenance of real property, improving the
livability, appearance, and the social and economic conditions of the
community, and will ensure that the real properties do not reach such a state
of deterioration or disrepair as to cause the depreciation of the value of the
surrounding neighborhood or be materially detrimental to nearby properties and
improvements. This chapter provides uniform procedures for issuing
administrative penalties, ordering abatement proceedings, conducting
administrative hearings, and is in addition to all other administrative, civil,
or criminal remedies that may be pursued by the city to address any violation
of the municipal code. Use of this chapter as a remedy shall be at the sole
discretion of the city.
   (B)   Responsibility for property maintenance. Every responsible party who
owns, controls or is in possession of premises within the city is required to
maintain such premises in a manner so as not to violate the provisions of the
municipal code. Any responsible party who fails to do so shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor each day such violation continues.
   (C)   Alternative actions. The administrative procedures provided in this
chapter shall be cumulative and in addition to any other procedure or legal
remedy provided for in the Red Bluff Municipal Code or by state law for the
abatement of nuisance related activities, premises, conditions or conduct.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the city from commencing
alternative administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings to abate or penalize
a nuisance under applicable civil, criminal, or municipal code provisions as an
alternative to the proceedings set forth in this chapter.
   (D)   Imposition of administrative penalty.
      (1)   Any person violating any provision of the municipal code may be
subject to the assessment of administrative civil penalties pursuant to the
procedures provided in this chapter.
      (2)   Administrative civil penalties may be directly assessed by means of
an administrative abatement and penalties order issued under this chapter.
Administrative civil penalties may be collected as special assessments,
recorded as a lien upon and against real property, or recovered by legal action
brought by the city.
      (3)   Administrative civil penalties for violations of the municipal code
shall be assessed at a daily rate determined by the administrative hearing
officer pursuant to the criteria listed in §
15.5 of this chapter. The maximum rate shall be $500 per violation. The maximum
amount of administrative civil penalties shall not exceed $500 per parcel or
structure for any related series of violations.
      (4)   For the purposes of this chapter, each and every day a violation of
any provision of the municipal code exists constitutes a separate and distinct
violation.
(Ord. 1074, passed 7-18-2023)
§ 15.10 UNLAWFUL CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Unlawful property conditions. It is unlawful for any responsible party
to maintain such property in any condition that violates the provisions of the
Red Bluff Municipal Code including, but not limited to, the conditions
described in §
15.1 and §
15.2 of this code. Any condition meeting the description of an IMMEDIATELY
DANGEROUS BUILDING, IMMEDIATELY DANGEROUS CONDITION, DANGEROUS BUILDING,
SUBSTANDARD BUILDING or PUBLIC NUISANCE as these terms are defined in §
15.3 of this code, is declared to be a public nuisance, and is subject to
administrative enforcement under this chapter. Such procedures shall not be
exclusive and shall not in any manner limit or restrict the city from imposing
fines or penalties or abating public nuisances in any other manner provided by
law.
   (B)   Authority to enter, inspect and abate property. For the purposes of
this chapter, any enforcement officer shall have the power to enter onto any
public or private property within the city of Red Bluff in order to determine
the existence of a violation of any provision of the municipal code, and to
make any inspection, examination, or survey as may be necessary to perform
enforcement duties. Any enforcement officer shall also have the power to abate
any building or premises whenever necessary to secure compliance with or
prevent violation of any provision of this chapter. All entries, inspections,
examinations, surveys and abatements shall be done in a reasonable manner. If
an owner, occupant, or agent refuses permission to enter, inspect or abate, the
enforcement officer may seek an administrative inspection warrant pursuant to
California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1822.50 through 1822.59, as may be
amended from time to time.
   (C)   Compliance order.
      (1)   Whenever an enforcement officer determines that any property is
maintained in violation of the municipal code, he or she may serve on the
responsible party a written compliance order. In addition to any information
required for particular violations pursuant to §§
15.1 or
15.2 the compliance order shall contain:
         (a)   The date and location of the violation;
         (b)   The section of the code violated and a description of the
violation;
         (c)   The actions required to correct the violation(s);
         (d)   The time period after which administrative penalties will begin
to accrue if compliance with the order has not been achieved;
         (e)   An explanation of the consequences of noncompliance with the
compliance order and a description of the hearing procedure and appeal process.
      (2)   Service of the compliance order shall be made as set forth in §
15.4 of this chapter.
   (D)   Notice of pendency of action.
      (1)   Concurrent with service of the compliance order as provided for in
§
15.10 of this chapter, the enforcement officer may record a notice of pendency
of action with the County Recorder. The enforcement officer shall instruct the
County Recorder to record the notice and index it in the property index as well
as in the name of each owner of record as shown in the last equalized
assessment roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is more current, and/or as
known to the enforcement officer. The notice shall be in a form approved by the
City Attorney.
      (2)   Service of the notice of pendency of action shall be made as set
forth in §
15.3 of this chapter.
      (3)   Upon completion of service, the notice of pendency of action shall
be recorded against the property where the violation(s) exist. Such recording
shall be made by the Tehama County Recorder.
      (4)   Any OWNER, as defined by Red Bluff Municipal Code §
15.3, may contest the validity of the notice of pendency of action by making
application to the Secretary of the Administrative Hearings Board within 30
calendar days from the date the notice of pendency of action is served. The
administrative hearing officer shall hear any such application no later than 30
calendar days after a timely application is made.
   (E)   Notice of final disposition. When all violations noted on a notice of
pendency of action have been abated or when equity may otherwise require, the
enforcement officer shall promptly record a release of the notice of pendency
of action. The enforcement officer shall serve notice of the release of the
notice of pendency of action pursuant to §
15.4.
(Ord. 1074, passed 7-18-2023)
§ 15.11 REQUEST FOR HEARING.
   (A)   Request for hearing; failure to appear.
      (1)   The enforcement officer shall request that an administrative
penalties and abatement hearing be set when the responsible party fails to
comply with the terms of the compliance order or has failed to keep the
property which is the subject of an administrative abatement and penalties
order in compliance with said order.
      (2)   The administrative penalties and abatement hearing shall be
conducted by the Administrative Hearings Board or a hearing officer.
      (3)   The administrative hearing officer has continuing jurisdiction over
the subject matter of an administrative appeal hearing for the purposes of
granting a continuance, ensuring compliance with a compliance order, modifying
a compliance order, or where extraordinary circumstances exist, granting a new
hearing.
      (4)   The administrative penalties and abatement hearing shall provide a
full opportunity for the responsible parties subject to a compliance order to
object to the order's determination that a violation has occurred; that the
violation has continued to exist or has recurred; that the person is
responsible for creating, maintaining, or fostering the violation; or that the
condition constituting the violation should be abated in accordance with the
compliance order.
      (5)   The failure of any person subject to a compliance order pursuant to
this chapter to appear at the administrative penalties and abatement hearing
shall constitute an admission of the facts in the compliance order and shall
constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
   (B)   Hearings conducted by hearing officer.
      (1)   The hearing officer shall set the date for the administrative
penalties and abatement hearing, and for any other hearing required by this
chapter. The hearing date shall be not less than 15 calendar days nor more than

officer determines the matter is urgent or good cause exists for an extension
of time.
      (2)   The City Manager or his or her designee shall serve the notice of

testify, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence as to the existence of
the cited violation or as to whether or not the cited person is the responsible

hearing. The alleged violator or his or her representative, if any, and the
officer presenting the city's case before the hearing officer, shall be
permitted to inquire of any witness testifying at the hearing. All parties to
the hearing shall be permitted to present brief opening and closing statements.
         (e)   At the request of either party, for good cause shown, the
hearing officer may continue any hearing and issue a subpoena in accordance
with the provisions of the California Administrative Procedures Act to compel
the production of documents or the attendance of third party witnesses, if the
compelling of such information is relevant, material and deemed necessary for
the hearing officer to reach a decision. However, subpoenas shall not be
requested for or issued as a means to compel testimony or the production of
documents from the city or any of its employees or officers, or from the
responsible party. It is unlawful for any person to refuse to obey a subpoena

§ 15.14 RECOVERY OF PENALTIES AND ABATEMENT COSTS.
   (A)   Recovery of penalties and costs.
      (1)   Administrative penalties and abatement costs shall be a debt to the
city and subject to all remedies for debt collection as allowed by law.
      (2)   When a violation involves privately owned real property and the

in the applicable order, the amount of such costs and penalties may be recorded
as a lien upon and against the real property or collected as special
assessments without further hearing.
      (3)   The city may recover its collection costs pursuant to §
15.14 of this code.
      (4)   In addition to any other means of enforcement, the City Attorney is

jurisdiction.
   (B)   Lien procedure.
      (1)   The city may make any unpaid abatement costs or unpaid
administrative penalties a lien against the real property that was the subject
of proceedings, an administrative abatement and penalties order issued in
accordance with §
15.8 and §
15.10.
      (2)   Upon determination by the enforcement officer that the abatement
costs and penalties contained in an administrative abatement and penalties
order or an abatement costs order have not been satisfied in full within the
time for payment set forth in the administrative penalties order or abatement
costs order, the enforcement officer may prepare a nuisance abatement lien
stating the name of the City of Red Bluff as the agency on whose behalf the
lien is imposed; the total amounts due and owing; the date of the
administrative abatement and penalties order or the abatement costs order; the
street address, legal description, and assessor's parcel number of the subject
property; and the name and address of the recorded owner of the property. A
copy of the administrative abatement and penalties order or the abatement costs
order shall be attached to and made a part of the lien.
      (3)   Prior to recording the nuisance abatement lien, the enforcement
officer shall serve a copy of the lien on the property owner, along with notice
to the property owner that a lien in the amounts stated in the nuisance
abatement lien will be filed against the subject property in the office of the
Tehama County Clerk-Recorder.
      (4)   The nuisance abatement lien shall be served in the same manner as
summons in a civil action in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure
§§ 415.10 et seq. If the owner of record, after diligent search cannot be
found, the lien may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place
upon the property for a period of ten days and publication thereof in a
newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Red Bluff.
      (5)   Following proper notice to the owner of record as provided in
division (B)(4) of this section, the nuisance abatement lien shall be recorded
with the Tehama County Clerk-Recorder. Once recorded, the nuisance abatement
lien shall have the force and effect and priority of a judgment lien governed
by the provisions of § 697.340 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and
may be extended as provided in §§ 683.110 to 683.220, inclusive, of the
California Code of Civil Procedure.
      (6)   Interest at the legal rate per year shall accrue on the principal
amount of the lien until satisfied pursuant to law.
      (7)   A lien pursuant to this section may be foreclosed by an action
brought by the city for a money judgment.
   (C)   Special assessment procedure.
      (1)   As an alternative to the procedure authorized by §
15.14 of this chapter, the city may make any unpaid abatement costs or
penalties a special assessment against the real property that was the subject
of an administrative abatement and penalties order issued in accordance with
Article IV of this chapter or an abatement costs order issued in accordance
with Article V of this chapter.
      (2)   Upon determination by the enforcement officer that the abatement
costs and penalties contained in an administrative abatement and penalties
order or an abatement costs order have not been satisfied in full within the
time for payment set forth in the administrative penalties order or abatement
costs order, the enforcement officer may prepare a notice of assessment lien
stating the name of the city of Red Bluff as the agency on whose behalf the
lien is imposed; the total amounts due and owing; the date of the
administrative abatement and penalties order or the abatement costs order; the
street address, legal description, and assessor's parcel number of the subject
property; and the name and address of the recorded owner of the property. A
copy of the administrative abatement and penalties order or the abatement costs
order shall be attached to and made a part of the assessment lien.
      (3)   Prior to recording the assessment lien, the enforcement officer
shall serve a copy of the notice of assessment lien on the property owner. The
assessment lien shall be served in the same manner as summons in a civil action
in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 415.10 et seq. If the
owner of record, after diligent search cannot be found, the lien may be served
by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period
of ten days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation
published in Tehama County. The tax collector's power of sale shall not be
affected by the failure of the property owner to receive the notice.
      (4)   Upon service of the notice of assessment lien on the property
owner, the enforcement officer shall cause a certified copy of the notice to be
recorded with the Tehama County Assessor-Recorder, which shall add the amount
of the assessment to the next regular tax bill levied against the property in
the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes. The assessment lien shall be
subordinate to all existing special assessment liens previously imposed upon
the same property and paramount to all other liens except state, county, and
municipal taxes with which it shall have parity. The assessment lien shall
continue until the assessment and all interest due and payable thereon has been
paid.
      (5)   The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject to the
same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as
provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy,
collection, and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the
special assessment. However, if any real property to which the assessment
relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or
if a lien of a bona fide encumbrance for value has been created and attaches
thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would
become delinquent, then the assessment shall not result in a lien against the
real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for
collection.
      (6)   Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the assessment
until satisfied pursuant to law.
      (7)   The city may, subject to the requirements applicable to the sale of
property pursuant to § 3691 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code,
conduct a sale of vacant residential developed property for which the payment
of the assessment is delinquent.
   (D)   Satisfaction of lien or special assessment. For any lien or special
assessment imposed under this chapter, once payment in full has been received
by the city, the city of Red Bluff shall either record a notice of
satisfaction/lien release or provide the property owner or applicable financial
institution with a notice of satisfaction so they may record such notice with
the Tehama County Clerk-Recorder. The notice of satisfaction/lien release shall
cancel the city's lien or special assessment.

established pursuant to
§ 17.6, the city shall make all of the findings found in California Government
Code § 66001(d) with respect to that portion of the fund remaining unexpended,

§ 18.9 CONNECTION AND SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   Connection charges to the city wastewater system and charges for sewer
service or discharging sewage into the city sewer system within or without the
corporate limits of the city, and all other charges related to sewer service,
shall be as set forth in an applicable resolution of the City Council. Rates
applicable to commercial users of sewer services shall be subject to the
following:
      (1)   Users that discharge most of their water used into the city sewer
system, as measured by a water meter installed at the subject property, shall
be assessed a sewer fee based on water use as set forth in the applicable
resolution of the City Council.
      (2)   Sewer fees for commercial users that discharge only a portion of
the volume of water used, as measured by a water meter installed at the subject
property, into the city sewer system shall be evaluated at the discretion of
the Public Works Director (or designee) or at the request of the user, and an
equitable charge shall be assessed. Such users may include those that use a
significant volume of water for irrigation or evaporative cooling, or that use
a significant volume of water in product processing, manufacturing or storage
that is not discharged into the city sewer system. The following factors may be
considered:
         (a)   The minimum monthly charge shall be that established for
commercial users as set forth in the applicable resolution of the City Council.
         (b)   A yearly constant charge, based on the average volume of water
used during each of certain months, may be appropriate. For example, sewer
charges based on an average of water used during the months of December,
January and February (i.e., months with normally little landscape watering).
         (c)   Commercial users may, at their option and cost, install separate
water meters for water discharged into the city sewer system and water that is
not discharged into the city sewer system (e.g., water used solely for
landscape irrigation). In this circumstance, sewer charges shall apply only to
the water metered for discharge into the city sewer system.
         (d)   Such other charge that is equitably based on the volume of water
that is reasonably expected to be discharged into the city sewer system.
      (3)   The determination of the Public Works Director (or designee) may be
appealed to the City Council. Such an appeal must be submitted in writing
within 30 days of the Public Works Director’s determination regarding the
equitable sewer fee applicable to a particular parcel, property or use.
   (B)   (1)   The amount payable to the city for any domestic sewer connection
or commercial and industrial sewer connection shall be as follows:
 
Type of Development     Sanitary Sewer
Single-family           $1,817.10
Duplex                  $3,634.20
Triplex                 $4,688.12
Quadruplex              $5,832.89
Apartments (over four)  Number of units x SFU x .69
Mobile home on P.D. lot $1,514.25
 
      (2)   For bakeries and laundries, the cost will be actual flows, using
the following equations:
         (a)   Bakeries: Single-family cost x  3Q, gpd  x 2.63
                         300
         (b)   Laundry: Single-family cost x  Q, gpd  x 2.21
                         300
      (3)   For all other connections, flows will be equated to the equivalent
of single-family usage using the following formula for sanitary sewer loading:
Q, gpd  x  BOD5 mg/l  x  suspended solids mg/l  x SFU Fee
300      80 mg/l         200 mg/l
   (C)   In no event shall the city be required to furnish any meters at any
point between its sewer lines and the place of origin of sewage or processing
wastes, but the city shall have the power to require a water or processing
waste flow meter.
   (D)   Each fee imposed herein shall be adjusted automatically on July 1 of
each fiscal year by a percentage equal to the percentage of increase in the
U.S. Consumer Price Index: U.S. Cities Average plus an amount equal to 3% of
the immediate previous year’s total fee.

§ 18A.34 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   The City of Red Bluff finds and declares:
   (A)   State recycling law, Assembly Bill 939 of 1989, the California
Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (California Public Resources Code
Section 40000, et seq., as amended, supplemented, superseded, and replaced from
time to time), requires cities and counties to reduce, reuse, and recycle
(including composting) solid waste generated in their jurisdictions to the
maximum extent feasible before any incineration or landfill disposal of waste,
to conserve water, energy, and other natural resources, and to protect the
environment.
   (B)   State recycling law, Assembly Bill 341 of 2011 (approved by the
Governor of the State of California on October 5, 2011, which amended Sections
41730, 41731, 41734, 41735, 41736, 41800, 42926, 44004, and 50001 of, and added
Sections 40004, 41734.5, and 41780.01 and Chapter 12.8 (commencing with Section
42649) to Part 3 of Division 30 of, and added and repealed Section 41780.02 of,
the Public Resources Code, as amended, supplemented, superseded and replaced
from time to time), places requirements on businesses and Multi-Family property
owners that generate a specified threshold amount of Solid Waste to arrange for
recycling services and requires jurisdictions to implement a mandatory
commercial recycling program.
   (C)   State organics recycling law, Assembly Bill 1826 of 2014 (approved by
the Governor of the State of California on September 28, 2014, which added
Chapter 12.9 (commencing with Section 42649.8) to Part 3 of Division 30 of the
Public Resources Code, relating to solid waste, as amended, supplemented,
superseded, and replaced from time to time), requires businesses and multi-
family property owners that generate a specified threshold amount of solid
waste, recycling, and organic waste per week to arrange for recycling services
for that waste, requires jurisdictions to implement a recycling program to
divert organic waste from businesses subject to the law, and requires
jurisdictions to implement a mandatory commercial organics recycling program.
   (D)   SB 1383, the Short-lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Act of 2016,
requires CalRecycle to develop regulations to reduce organics in landfills as a
source of methane. The regulations place requirements on multiple entities
including jurisdictions, residential households, commercial businesses and
business owners, commercial edible food generators, haulers, self-haulers, food
recovery organizations, and food recovery services to support achievement of
statewide organic waste disposal reduction targets.
   (E)   SB 1383, the Short-lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Act of 2016,
requires jurisdictions to adopt and enforce an ordinance or enforceable
mechanism to implement relevant provisions of SB 1383 regulations. This article
will also help reduce food insecurity by requiring commercial edible food
generators to arrange to have the maximum amount of their edible food, which
would otherwise be disposed, be recovered for human consumption.

Police Department, that consumption of alcoholic beverages in city parks and
other city-owned property including streets, alleys and sidewalks, and in and
on other publicly owned and/or used property, have created disproportionate
burdens on the responsibilities of the Police Department and other departments
of the city through abnormally high noise levels, traffic control, litter and
public nuisance, all to the detriment of the public health, safety and welfare.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person to consume alcoholic beverages or
possess unsealed alcoholic containers:
      (1)   In or upon any of the streets, sidewalks, alleys, public parks or

owner of the private property.
   (C)   The Chief of Police may, at his or her discretion, designate certain
events and locations on public property where alcoholic beverages may be
possessed and consumed without first having obtained a permit.
   (D)   An application for a permit to possess, serve or consume alcoholic
beverages in or upon any street, sidewalk, alley, city park, or other public
property, or any private property open to the public wherein alcohol may be
served or sold, shall be made no later than three days prior to the date upon
which the activity is to take place.
   (E)   (1)   Before issuing the permit, the Chief of Police shall satisfy
himself or herself that the public peace, safety, health and general welfare
will not be endangered or jeopardized by the issuance of the permit. The Chief
of Police may impose conditions upon the issuance of the permit to insure that
the activity will be compatible with the preservation of the public peace,
safety, health and general welfare.
      (2)   The Chief of Police may consider any relevant factual material in
determining whether to issue the permit. If the Chief of Police finds that the
issuance of the permit will, in his or her opinion, endanger or jeopardize
public peace, safety, health and the general welfare, the issuance shall be
denied.
   (F)   The permit so issued shall be good for the period of time as
prescribed by the Chief of Police.
   (G)   The Chief of Police shall have the authority, and the authority is
hereby given to him or her, to revoke the permit at any time if the activity
being conducted under the permit is conducted in the manner that the Chief of
Police deems it to be detrimental to the public peace, safety, health and
general welfare.
   (H)   The permittee shall have a copy of the permit in his or her possession
and shall produce the permit upon a request made by the Chief of Police or any
of his or her representatives.

§ 21.5 PURPOSE OF ARTICLE.
   The City Council hereby declares that this article is adopted to achieve the
following, among other, purposes and directs that the provisions hereof be
interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:
   (A)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the
requirements and limitations contained in California Revenue and Taxation Code
Part 1.5 of Division 2, §§ 7200 through 7226;
   (B)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates provisions
identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state insofar as those
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained
in California Revenue and Taxation Code Part 1.5 of Division 2, §§ 7200 through
7226;
   (C)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and
provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State
Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable
to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the state sales and use taxes;
   (D)   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a
manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of
California Revenue and Taxation Code Part 1.5 of Division 2, §§ 7200 through
7226, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same
time minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation
under the provisions of this article.
(`61 Code, § 21.5) (Ord. 456, passed 9-28-1965)
§ 21.6 CONTRACT WITH STATE.
   Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the State Board of
Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and
operation of this article. If the city shall not have contracted with the State
Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so
contract and, in such a case, the operative date shall be the first day of the
first calendar quarter following the execution of a contract rather than the
first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of this article.
(`61 Code, § 21.6) (Ord. 456, passed 9-28-1965)
§ 21.7 SALES TAX.
   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is
hereby imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate stated in
§ 21.3 of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of all tangible
personal property sold at retail in the city on and after the operative date.
(`61 Code, § 21.7) (Ord. 456, passed 9-28-1965)
§ 21.8 PLACE OF SALE.
   For the purposes of this article, all retail sales are consummated at the
place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is
delivered by the retailer or his or her agent to an out-of-state destination or
to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross
receipts from the sales shall include delivery charges when the charges are
subject to the state sales and use tax regardless of the place to which
delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in
the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which
the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and
regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.
(`61 Code, § 21.8) (Ord. 456, passed 9-28-1965)

delivery charges when the charges are subject to state sales or use tax

inconsistent with the provisions of California Revenue and Taxation Code Part
1.5 of Division 2, §§ 7200 through 7226, all of the provisions of California
Revenue and Taxation Code Part 1 of Division 2 are hereby adopted and made a
part of this article as though fully set forth herein.

agency, the name of this city shall be substituted therefor.

used as part of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the
State Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, the State Treasury or
the Constitution of the state. The substitution shall not be made when the
result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the
city or any agency thereof rather than by or against the State Board of
Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or
operation of this article. The substitution shall not be made in those
sections, including, but not necessarily limited to sections referring to the
exterior boundaries of the state, where the result of the substitution would be

use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not
otherwise be exempt from this tax while the sales, storage, use or other
consumption remain subject to tax by the state under the provisions of
California Revenue and Taxation Code Part 1 of Division 2, or to impose this
tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of
tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state under
the provisions of that code; the substitution shall not be made in sections
California Revenue and Taxation Code §§ 6701 and 6702, except in the last
sentence thereof, 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828; and the substitution shall

a hotel by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other
agreement for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting
portions of calendar days as full days. Any persons occupying space in a hotel
shall be deemed to be transient until the period of 30 days has expired. In
determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time
extending both prior and subsequent to the effective dates of this article may
be considered.
(Ord. 1014, passed 9-6-2011)
§ 21.21 IMPOSITION; AMOUNT; WHERE PAYABLE.
   (A)   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject
to and shall pay a tax in the amount of 10% of the rent charged by the
operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is
extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city.
   (B)   The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the
time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate
share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be
due upon the transient ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If, for any
reason, the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Director of
Finance of the city shall require that the tax be paid directly to the Director
of Finance of the city.

§ 21.23 COLLECTION; ADVERTISING THAT PAYMENT OF TAX NOT REQUIRED PROHIBITED.
   Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this article to the same
extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The
amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged,
and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No
operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or
indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the
operator or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part
will be refunded, except in the manner hereinafter provided.

the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient
Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Director of Finance of the city
for the purpose of collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and
remitting the tax to the Director of Finance. This certificate does not
authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful
business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly
complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those
requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this
city. This certificate does not constitute a permit.”
(Ord. 1014, passed 9-6-2011)
§ 21.25 REPORTS AND REMITTANCES.
   (A)   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following
the close of each calendar quarter or at the close of any shorter reporting
period which may be established by the Director of Finance of the city, make a
return to the Director of Finance on forms provided by him or her of the total
rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient
occupancies.
   (B)   At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected

require further information on the return. Returns and payments are due

shall pay a second delinquency penalty of 10% of the amount of the tax in
addition to the amount of the tax and the 10% penalty first imposed.
   (C)   If the Director of Finance determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this article is due to fraud, a penalty of 25% of the
amount of the tax shall be added thereto, in addition to the penalties stated
in division (A) and (B) above.
   (D)   In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit
any tax imposed by this article shall pay interest at the rate of .5% per month
or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties from the
date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

Finance of the city shall proceed in a manner as he or she may deem best to
obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax

as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax
imposed by this article and payable by any operator who has failed or refused
to collect the same and to make the report and remittance, he or she shall

penalties provided for by this article.

operator so assessed at his or her last-known place of address.
   (B)   The operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of the
notice make application in writing to the Director of Finance for a hearing on
the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made
within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined
by the Director of Finance shall become final and conclusive and immediately
due and payable. If the application is made, the Director of Finance shall give
not less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the
operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount
specified therein should not be fixed for the tax, interest and penalties.
   (C)   At the hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why the
specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After the
hearing, the Director of Finance shall determine the proper tax to be remitted
and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed
herein of the determination and the amount of the tax, interest and penalties.

received by the city under this article, it may be refunded as provided in
divisions (B) and (C) below; provided a claim, in writing therefor, stating

been collected was not transient. Neither a refund nor a credit shall be
allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to
the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the
operator.
   (C)   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than
once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a
claim in the manner provided in division (A) above, but only when the tax was
paid by the transient directly to the Director of Finance, or when the
transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction
of the Director of Finance that the transient has been unable to obtain a
refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (D)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.

§ 21.51. OPERATIVE DATE.
   Under Ordinance 1030 currently in effect, the operative date is the first
day of the first calendar quarter commencing more than 110 days after November

§ 21.52 PURPOSE.
   This chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes, and
directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those
purposes.
   (A)   To extend the imposition of an existing retail transactions and use
tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with § 7251) of
Division 2 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code and § 7285.9 of Part 1.7
of Division 2 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code, which authorizes the
city to adopt this tax ordinance which shall be operative if a majority of the
electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an
election called for that purpose.
   (B)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates
provisions identical to those of state sales and use tax law insofar as those
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained
in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code.
   (C)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a
tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by
the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as
practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing
statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of
Equalization in administering and collecting state sales and use taxes.
   (D)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the California
Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and
use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon
persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 1030, passed 4-1-2014; Am. Ord. 1050, passed 6-5-2018)
§ 21.53 CONTRACT WITH STATE.
   Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the State Board of
Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and
operation of this chapter; provided, that if the city shall not have contracted
with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall
nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the
first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a
contract.

§ 21.54 TRANSACTIONS TAX RATE.
   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is

place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is
delivered by the retailer, or his or her agent, to an out-of-state destination
or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross
receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are
subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which
delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in
the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which
the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and
regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.
(Ord. 1030, passed 4-1-2014; Am. Ord. 1050, passed 6-5-2018)
§ 21.56 USE TAX RATE.

shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to state sales or
use tax regardless of the place to which delivery is made.

inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the California
Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 (commencing with §
6001) of Division 2 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby
adopted and made a part of this chapter as though fully set forth herein.

Controller, State Treasurer, State Board of Control, State Board of
Equalization, State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State of California;

or against this city, or any agency, officer, or employee thereof, rather than
by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions
incident to the administration or operation of this chapter;
      (3)   In those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to,
sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the State of California, where
the result of the substitution would be to:
         (a)   Provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain
sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property that
would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or
other consumption remain subject to tax by the state under the provisions of
Part 1 of Division 2 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code; or
         (b)   Impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or
other consumption of tangible personal property that would not be subject to
tax by the state under the that provision of that code.
      (4)   In §§ 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715,
6737, 6797 or 6828 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code.

phrase “retailer engaged in business in this State” in California Revenue and
Taxation Code § 6203 and in the definition of that phrase in California Revenue
and Taxation Code § 6203.

   (A)   The purpose of this article is to regulate video service providers
holding state video franchises and operating within the city.
   (B)   On January 2, 2008, the State of California became the sole authority
with the power to grant state video franchises pursuant to the Digital

for public, educational and/or government (PEG) purposes from all state video
franchise holders operating within the city.
      (2)   Additionally, the city acquired the responsibility to establish and
enforce penalties, consistent with state law, against all state video franchise
holders operating within the city, for violations of customer service
standards.
      (3)   DIVCA precludes the city from adopting its own standards, and
grants all authority to adopt customer service standards to the state.

§ 23B.3, the Director of Public Works shall:
      (1)   Post written notice on the property being served and 30 days

benefitted and become a lien upon the property.
      (5)   If upon the expiration of the 30-day or ten-day period, whichever
applies, the required underground facilities have not been provided, the
Director of Public Works shall forthwith proceed to do the work. If the
premises are unoccupied and no electric or communications services are being
furnished thereto, the Director of Public Works shall, in lieu of providing the
required underground facilities, have the authority to order the disconnection
and removal of any and all overhead service wires and associated facilities
supplying utility service to the property. Upon completion of the work by the
Director of Public Works, he or she shall file a written report with the City
Council setting forth the fact that the required underground facilities have
been provided and the cost thereof, together with a legal description of the
property against which the cost is to be assessed. The Council shall thereupon

thereafter.
      (6)   The Director of Public Works shall forthwith, upon the time for
hearing the protests having been fixed, give a notice in writing to the person
in possession of the premises, and a notice in writing thereof to the owner
thereof, in the manner provided in this section for the giving of the notice to
provide the required underground facilities, of the time and place that the
Council will pass upon the report and will hear protests against the
assessment. The notice shall also set forth the amount of the proposed
assessment.
      (7)   Upon the date and hour set for the hearing of protests, the Council
shall hear and consider the report of all protests, if there are any, and then
proceed to affirm, modify or reject the assessment.
      (8)   If any assessment is not paid within five days after its
confirmation by the Council, the amount of the assessment shall become a lien
upon the property against which the assessment is made by the Director of
Public Works and the Director of Public Works is directed to turn over to the
Assessor and Tax Collector a notice of lien on each of the properties on which
the assessment has not been paid. The Assessor and Tax Collector shall add the
amount of the assessment to the next regular bill for taxes levied against the
premises upon which the assessment was not paid. The assessment shall be due
and payable at the same time as property taxes are due and payable; and if not
paid when due and payable, shall bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum.

   (A)   The City Council of the city is vested with the authority to invoke
the various “stages” of action described in this chapter, which serves as the
city’s water shortage contingency plan, based upon the recommendation of the
Director of Public Works.
   (B)   The city has developed a six stage rationing plan to invoke during
declared water shortages. The action stages trigger levels have been developed
to implement the water shortage contingency plan. The rationing plan includes
voluntary and mandatory rationing, depending on the causes, severity, and
anticipated duration of the water supply shortage. Stages will be implemented
when circumstances warrant as determined by the Director of Public Works, City
Manager and the City Council, or as the state mandates water use restrictions.
   (C)   The Director of Public Works will recommend an appropriate action
stage. All restrictions under each applicable action stage will be implemented
immediately upon declaration of such stage. Lifting of an emergency action
stage and resumption to the normal operating stage will be determined by the
City Council, based upon the recommendation of the Director of Public Works and
based on current conditions affecting the water supply. The rationing stages
are described in detail below.
      (1)   Stage I - Conservation measures (up to 10% supply reduction).

§ 24.42 STANDARDS OF OPERATION.
   Before issuing a permit as required herein, the Building Inspector shall
find that the system or cooler complies with the following standards of
operation:
   (A)   Water which has been used as a cooling medium in refrigeration plants,
refrigerator air- conditioning units or similar apparatus in which water is
passed through cooling jackets or heat exchangers for the purpose of removing
heat collected or generated by the apparatus shall be so piped as to permit
circulation through a cooling tower or spray pool or other means of cooling in
order that its heat content may be dissipated and the water sanitary sewers of
the city with only the frequency as to maintain the cleanliness of the water in
the system:
      (1)   There shall be provided in the water supply line to the
refrigeration unit the following valves installed in this sequence: a check
valve and a pressure relief valve set at 45 pounds. In lieu of the above valves
in the water supply line, the refrigeration unit may be connected to the supply
line through an air gap.
      (2)   There shall be installed in the refrigerant line a pressure relief
valve which shall be set to open at 150% of the head pressure of the
refrigerator unit. A pipe line shall be provided to conduct refrigerant
released by this valve to the open air. The provisions of this division shall
not apply to sealed seven and one-half ton units or less.
      (3)   A manually or electrically-operated valve shall be installed in the
drain line from the collector pan of the cooling tower or from the spray pool,
the valve to normally be kept closed, and which permits no leakage. In addition
to the manually or electrically-operated valves, a stand pipe overflow
installed in the drain line of the collector pan or spray pool and which
permits an overflow bypass of the main drain valve, shall meet the requirements
of this section.
      (4)   The drain line from the cooling tower or spray pool shall terminate
above the rim of a properly installed plumbing fixture or shall be arranged to
drain through an air gap into a properly installed and vented trap.
   (B)   In any and all cases where evaporative coolers are supplied with water
from the city water system to be used as a cooling agent, the coolers will be
fitted with a pump by means of which the water may be raised from the drip pan
to the filter pads of the cooler. The pump may be an integral motor- driven
unit or may be driven by the fan motor of the cooler but in any case will be of
sufficient capacity to obviate the necessity of a continual supply of water
from the city water line to the cooler:
      (1)   The water supply line to an evaporative cooler shall be equipped
with a manually or electrically-operated valve or float valve which shall
normally be kept closed and without leakage. It shall be opened only when make
up water is being supplied to the cooler.
      (2)   (a)   The drain line from the drip pan of the cooler may be
conducted to the sewer installation on the premises provided that the drain
line is fitted with a manually or electrically-controlled valve which is
normally kept closed and without leakage.
         (b)   A stand pipe overflow installed in the drain line of the drip
pan and which permits an overflow bypass of the main drain valve shall meet the
requirements of this section.
      (3)   (a)   The drainage water may enter the sewer through a pipe, the
end of which is above the rim of a properly installed plumbing fixture into
which the line is to drain, or drainage water may be conducted into the sewer
through a specially installed and vented trap; provided, that a unable air gap
is, maintained between the end of the pipe and the trap entrance.
         (b)   At the discretion of the owner or the installer, it is not
essential that the drainage water from the cooler be conducted to a sewer.
      (4)   In cases where evaporative coolers are installed on roofs, the
drainage of circulating water to the sewer after passing through the valve
required by division (B)(2) above, may be led directly through a trap into a
plumbing stack.

the city. Other public utilities such as electric power or gas may be served
through a common meter or to individual meters, as the utility company may
elect;
      (6)   Community recreation facilities may be required in any mobile home
combining district. At the time as the tentative subdivision map is presented
to the Planning Commission, the Commission shall consider the need for the
recreational facilities, taking into consideration:
         (a)   The size of the subdivision;
         (b)   The availability of recreation facilities in the immediate

maintain and/or operate the commonly owned areas, the city may assume the
maintenance and/or operation of those facilities, but shall not be obligated to
do so.
      (3)   If the city assumes the obligation of maintenance and/or operation
the cost thereof shall be a lien upon all of the property within the

for any of the uses or purposes for which the permits are required or permitted
by the terms of this chapter.
   (B)   Assurance of compliance with adopted use standards shall be required
prior to permit issuance.

§ 25.129 CONDITIONS TO ASSURE PUBLIC HEALTH, WELFARE AND SAFETY.
   Conditions necessary to assure public health, welfare and safety may be
attached upon approval of an AUP as determined by the Community Development
Director or designee. Uses permitted with administrative use permits shall also
be subject to those development standards applicable to the district for which
the use is intended, except that the Community Development Director or designee
may waive those standards based on the limited duration or scope of the
project.
(`61 Code, § 25.13.5) (Ord. 915, passed 6-20-2000; Am. Ord. 939, passed 5-20-

   Applications for AUP shall be reviewed for compliance with sanitation, noise
attenuation, pedestrian and vehicular safety, light intrusion, aesthetics and
site restoration standards appurtenant to the intended, the surrounding land
uses and the district for which the use is intended. If all identified impacts
to the public health, welfare and safety issues noted above will be adequately
addressed by project design, temporary operation or through applied conditions,
the Community Development Director or designee shall approve and issue the
administrative use permit.

file that is kept at City Hall. Final activation of the administrative use
permit occurs when the construction, setup or other permit is issued and work
commences on the site, or when the other action to commence operation occurs.
If the project has not been activated within 30 days of approval, the
administrative use permit shall be deemed expired.

dwelling. No development impact fees shall be required for accessory dwelling
units of 750 square feet or less in size.
      (17)   For an accessory dwelling unit that is not described in division
(15), a new or separate utility connection directly between the accessory
dwelling unit and the utility shall be required. The connection is subject to a
connection fee or capacity charge which shall be proportionate to the burden of
the proposed accessory dwelling unit, based upon either its size or the number
of its plumbing fixtures, upon the water or sewer system. This fee or charge
shall not exceed the reasonable cost of providing this service.
      (18)   Newly constructed accessory dwelling units are subject to the 2019
California Energy Code (Cal. Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 6, Subchapter
8, § 151.1(14)) requirement, with exceptions, to provide a solar photovoltaic
(PV) system if the unit is a newly constructed, non-manufactured, detached
accessory dwelling unit. The solar panels can be installed on the ADU or on the
primary dwelling unit. ADUs that are constructed within existing space, or as
an addition to existing homes, including detached additions where an existing
detached building is converted from non-residential to residential space, are
not subject to the Energy Code requirement to provide a PV system.

§ 26.1-1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the state has, in California Government Code §§ 65302,
65560 and 65800, conferred upon local government unit’s authority to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council adopts the following floodplain
management regulations.
(`61 Code, § 26.1-1) (Ord. 913, passed 4-18-2000)
§ 26.1-2 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effects of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities also contribute to the flood loss.
(`61 Code, § 26.1-2) (Ord. 913, passed 4-18-2000)
§ 26.1-3 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted
areas caused by flood damage;
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
   (H)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
(`61 Code, § 26.1-3) (Ord. 913, passed 4-18-2000)
§ 26.1-4 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases
in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(`61 Code, § 26.1-4) (Ord. 913, passed 4-18-2000)
ARTICLE II: DEFINITIONS
Section
   
26.2-1   Definitions
§ 26.2-1 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   100-YEAR FLOOD. The BASE FLOOD.
   100-YEAR FLOODPLAIN. The “area of special flood hazard.”
   ACCESSORY USE. A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal

services, including, but not limited to Police Department and Fire Department
facilities; hospitals, emergency shelters, facilities listed in Table 16K of
the California Building Code, and other facilities necessary to maintain or
enhance public health and safety as determined by the Floodplain Administrator.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the initial floodplain management regulations adopted by the city.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads.
   FLOOD, FLOODING or FLOOD WATER. A general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of land areas from the overflow of inland waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides.

both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable
to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY or FIS. The official report provided by the Federal
Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate
map, the flood boundary and floodway map and the water surface elevation of the
base flood.
   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The individual appointed to administer and enforce
the floodplain management regulations is the Community Development Director or
designee.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances, such as grading and erosion control, and other applications of
police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which
provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes or adjustments to nonresidential structures, which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.

   FLOODWAY ENCROACHMENT LINES. The lines marking the limits of floodways on
federal, state and local floodplain maps.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE. The area of the floodplain on either side of the
“regulatory floodway” where encroachment may be permitted.
   FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION. As related to
§§ 26.6-1 et seq. of this chapter, the variance granted must not cause fraud on
or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council
will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government
responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years.
Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation
are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods,
while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to
all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood
damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware
that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very
high flood insurance rates.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   GOVERNING BODY. The City Council.
   HARDSHIP. The exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant
the requested variance. The City Council requires that the variance be
exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. ECONOMIC OR
FINANCIAL HARDSHIP alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences or the disapproval of
one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places, a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior, or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved state program, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or
directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
   LEVEE. A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM. A flood protection system which consists of a levee or levees
and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including
basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area
is not considered a building’s lowest floor, provided that the enclosure is not
built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation
design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. MANUFACTURED HOME
does not include a “recreational vehicle.”
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel or contiguous parcels of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MARKET VALUE. Determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in
new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation
which has occurred since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement
of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by
reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building
construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking
into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional
obsolescence as approved by the Floodplain Administrator, but shall not include
economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or
accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized
building cost estimating guides may be considered only if the factors are
included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and
supported by written explanation of the differences.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood
elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For floodplain management purposes, structures for which
the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of initial
floodplain management regulations adopted by the city, and includes any
subsequent improvements to the structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads, is completed on or after the effective
date of the initial floodplain management regulations adopted by the city.
   OBSTRUCTION. Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building,
wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other
material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter,
impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or
due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the
flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.
   ONE-HUNDRED-YEAR FLOOD or 100-YEAR FLOOD. The base flood.
   PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. The granting of a variance must not result in
anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or
neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs
the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, river,
bay, stream, canal or basin.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle, which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four-hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   REGULATORY FLOODWAY. The floodway.
   REMEDY OF A VIOLATION.  To bring the structure or other development into
compliance with the state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if
this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that
impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected
development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the
ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations or reducing state or
federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damage sustained by a structure on two or
more separate occasions during any ten-year period for which repairs at the
time of each flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of the market
value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by or resembling a river, including
tributaries, stream, brook and the like.
   SHEET FLOW AREA. The area of shallow flooding.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA or SFHA. The area of special flood hazard:
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Substantial improvement and other proposed new
development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the permit.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a  structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, any work beyond the stage
of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
“Permanent construction” does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms. For a substantial improvement,
the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building that is principally aboveground.
This includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
This term includes structures which have incurred “repetitive loss.”
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred “repetitive loss” or “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations or state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE or TAC. The Technical Advisory Committee of the
city established pursuant to §§
2.100 and
2.101.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this
chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, other certifications or other evidence of compliance
required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until the time as that
documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or other datum, where specified, of floods of various
magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

§ 26.4-2 DESIGNATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Community Development Director is appointed to administer, implement and
enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with
its provisions.
(`61 Code, § 26.4-2) (Ord. 913, passed 4-18-2000; Am. Ord. 939, passed 5-20-
2003; Am. Ord. 1018, passed 9-3-2013)
§ 26.4-3 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall
include, but not be limited to the following:
   (A)   Review all development permits to determine that:
      (1)   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
      (2)   The site is reasonably safe from flooding;
      (3)   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;
and
      (4)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, adversely
affects are the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
   (B)   (1)   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in
accordance with
§ 26.3-2, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer Article V. Any
information shall be submitted to the City Council for adoption.
      (2)   If no base flood elevation data is available from a federal or
state agency or other sources, then a base flood elevation shall be obtained
using one of the two methods from the FEMA publication, Managing Floodplain
Development In Approximate Zone A Areas A Guide for Obtaining And Developing
Base (100-year) Flood Elevations, dated July 1995, and any subsequent
revisions, in order to administer Article V of this chapter.
         (a)   The 100-year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the
appropriate regression equation found in a U.S. Geological Survey publication,
or the discharge-drainage area method; and base flood elevation shall be
obtained using the Quick-2 computer program developed by FEMA.
         (b)   The 100-year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ HEC-1 computer program; and base flood elevations
shall be obtained using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ HEC-RAS computer
program.
   (C)   Notification of other agencies:
      (1)   Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:
         (a)   Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of
Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;
         (b)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency; and
         (c)   Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse is maintained.
      (2)   Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations:
         (a)   Within six months of information becoming available or project
completion, whichever comes first, the Floodplain Administrator shall submit or
assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA
for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
         (b)   Assure that all LOMRs for flood control projects are approved
prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued
based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow
construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as
specified in the “start of construction” definition in §
26.2-1.
   Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical
changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain
management requirements are based on current data.
      (3)   Changes in corporate boundaries: Notify FEMA in writing whenever
the city’s corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means
and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new
corporate limits.
   (D)   Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed
the following:
      (1)   Certification required by
§ 26.5-1(C)(1), lowest floor elevations;
      (2)   Certification required by
§ 26.5-11(C)(2), elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures;
      (3)   Certification required by
§ 26.5-1(C)(3), wet floodproofing standard;
      (4)   Certification required by
§ 26.5-2(C), storage standards;
      (5)   Certification of elevation required by
§ 26.5-4(A)(2), land subdivision, use reclassification standards;
      (6)   Certification as required in
§ 26.5-5, manufactured homes elevation and anchoring;
      (7)   Certification as required in
§ 26.5-6, recreational vehicles elevation and anchoring;
      (8)   Certification required by
§ 26.5-7, supplemental provisions;
      (9)   Certification required by
§ 26.5-8(D), floodway encroachments.
   (E)   Make interpretations where needed, as to the location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard. Where there appears to be a
conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base
flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood
hazard area. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
§ 26.4-4 or Article VI of this chapter.
   (F)   Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in
§ 26.3-3.

§ 26.4-4 APPEALS.
   The Planning Commission of the city shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter. The City Council shall hear and decide written appeals to the
decisions of the Planning Commission. Appeals to the City Council must be filed
with the City Clerk within ten working days of the date of the Planning
Commission’s decision. All appeals shall be submitted in writing and shall not
be accepted by the city unless accompanied with the established appeal
processing fee. The Planning Commission and city council may approve a refund
of all or a portion of appeal fees.

§ 26.5-8 FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§ 26.3-2 are areas designated as floodways.
   (B)   Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of flood waters, which carry debris, projectiles and cause erosion, the
following provisions apply.
      (1)   Encroachments within a floodway are prohibited, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements and other new development unless:
         (a)   Certification by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increases in the base
flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge; (This
criterion is also known as “no rise.”)
         (b)   A design by a registered professional engineer is submitted to
the floodplain administrator demonstrating that all structures and development
within the floodway will withstand the forces caused by flood waters;
         (c)   New construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new
development complies with all other applicable flood hazard reduction
provisions of this chapter; and
         (d)   Certification, by a registered professional engineer, is
submitted certifying that the standards of this section are satisfied. The
certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   If a floodway is not identified in maps or documents adopted by the
city then no encroachment is allowed within the flood hazard area without
either approval of the Technical Advisory Committee or submittal of documents,
including a scaled map, from a registered professional engineer defining the
boundaries of the floodway. The purpose of this section is to prohibit
development within the 100-year floodplain until a qualified professional
defines the location of the floodway.
   (C)   The criteria herein do not apply to temporary fare, police and other
public agency facilities providing immediately needed emergency services
including but not limited to rescue, temporarily enhancing flood-control
facilities and making temporary repairs to other public facilities.

Section
   
26.6-1   Nature of variances
   
26.6-2   Appeals Board
   
26.6-3   Conditions for variances
§ 26.6-1 NATURE OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   The variance criteria set forth in this article of the chapter are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
   (B)   It is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding.
This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a
structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood
elevation or from other requirements of this chapter are quite rare. The long
term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if
variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in
this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met
before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen
out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more
appropriate.
   (C)   The cost of processing a variance shall be paid by the applicant. The
Planning Commission and City Council can authorize a partial or full refund of
variance processing fees.
(`61 Code, § 26.6-1) (Ord. 913, passed 4-18-2000)
§ 26.6-2 APPEALS BOARD.
   (A)   (1)   The Planning Commission shall act as the Appeals Board for the
city and shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances for the
requirements of this chapter. Decisions of the Planning Commission may be
appealed to the City Council in writing within ten days of the date the
Planning Commission’s decision notice is transmitted to the applicant.
      (2)   The appeal processing fee must be submitted with the appeal.
   (B)   In passing upon requests for variances, the city shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
articles of this chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of the damage on the existing individual owner and future
owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
      (5)   Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system and streets and bridges.
   (C)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance of
$25 or more for each $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   The construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to
life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the office of the County Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance
Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(`61 Code, § 26.6-2) (Ord. 913, passed 4-18-2000)
§ 26.6-3 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-
half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of Articles IV and V of this chapter have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
   (B)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures” upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic
structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
   (C)   Variances shall not be issued within any regulatory floodway except as
provided in
§ 26.5-8.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the “minimum necessary” considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
“Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an
elevation requirement or to encroachment restrictions, this means the Appeals
Board need not grant permission for the applicant to build at any particular
grade or to encroach to the extent requested, but only to that elevation or
extent which the Appeals Board believes will both provide relief and preserve
the integrity of this chapter.
   (E)   Variances shall only be issued upon a:
      (1)   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary
public expense, create a nuisance, cause fraud or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement,
and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that the provisions of divisions (A) through (E) above
are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by
methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result
in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors of division (B) above and the
purposes of this chapter, the Planning Commission or the City Council may
attach conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this chapter.

         (l)   It is highly recommended that the project applicant or local
agency inquire with the local water purveyor about peak water operating demands
(on the water supply system) or water restrictions that may impact the
effectiveness of the irrigation system.
         (m)   In mulched planting areas, the use of low volume irrigation is
required to maximize water infiltration into the root zone.
         (n)   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall have matched
precipitation rates, unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer’s
recommendations.
         (o)   Head to head coverage is recommended. However, sprinkler spacing
shall be designed to achieve the highest possible distribution uniformity using
the manufacturer’s recommendations.
         (p)   Swing joints or other riser-protection components are required
on all risers subject to damage that are adjacent to high traffic areas.
         (q)   Check valves or anti-drain valves are required for all
irrigation systems.
         (r)   Narrow or irregularly shaped areas, including turf, less than
eight feet in width in any direction shall be irrigated with subsurface
irrigation or low volume irrigation system.
         (s)   Overhead irrigation shall be analyzed with any and all adjacent
non-permeable surface. Allowable irrigation within the setback from non-
permeable surfaces may include drip, drip line, or spray technology. The
setback area may be planted or unplanted. The surfacing of the setback may be
mulch, gravel, or other porous material. These restrictions may be modified if:
            1.   The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no
runoff occurs;
            2.   The adjacent non-permeable surfaces are designed and
constructed to drain entirely to landscaping; or
            3.   The irrigation designer specifies an alternative design or
technology, as part of the Landscape Documentation Package and clearly
demonstrates strict adherence to irrigation system design criteria in §
27.3-7. Prevention of overspray and runoff must be confirmed during the
irrigation audit.
         (t)   Slopes greater than 25% shall not be irrigated with an
irrigation system with a precipitation rate exceeding 0.75 inches per hour.
This restriction may be modified if the landscape designer specifies an
alternative design or technology, as part of the Landscape Documentation
Package, and clearly demonstrates no runoff or erosion will occur. Prevention
of runoff and erosion must be confirmed during the irrigation audit.
      (2)   Hydrozone.
         (a)   Each valve shall be analyzed so as to irrigate a hydrozone with
similar site, slope, sun exposure, soil conditions, and plant materials with
similar water use.
         (b)   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall be selected
based on what is appropriate for the plant type within that hydrozone.
         (c)   Where feasible, trees should be placed on separate valves from
shrubs, groundcovers, and turf.
         (d)   Individual hydrozones that mix plants of moderate and low water
use, or moderate and high water use, may be allowed if:
            1.   Plant factor calculation is based on the proportions of the
respective plant water uses and their plant factor; or
            2.   The plant factor of the higher water using plant is used for
calculations.
         (e)   Individual hydrozones that mix high and low water use plants
shall not be permitted.
         (f)   On the landscape design plan and irrigation design plan,
hydrozone areas shall be designated by number, letter, or other designation. On
the irrigation design plan, designate the areas irrigated by each valve, and
assign a number to each valve. Use this valve number in the Hydrozone
Information Table. This table can also assist with the irrigation audit and
programming the controller.
   (B)   The irrigation design plan may contain, without limitation, the
following:
      (1)   Location and size of separate water meters for landscape;
      (2)   Location, type and size of all components of the irrigation system,
including controllers, main and lateral lines, valves, sprinkler heads,
moisture sensing devices, rain switches, quick couplers, pressure regulators,
and backflow prevention devices;
      (3)   Static water pressure at the point of connection to the public
water supply;
      (4)   Flow rate (gallons per minute), application rate (inches per hour),
and design operating pressure (pressure per square inch) for each station;
      (5)   Recycled water irrigation systems as specified in §
27.3-14;
      (6)   The following statement: “I have complied with the criteria of the
ordinance and applied them accordingly for the efficient use of water in the
irrigation design plan”; and
      (7)   The signature of a licensed landscape architect, certified
irrigation designer, licensed landscape contractor, or any other person
authorized to design an irrigation system. (See §§ 5500.1, 5615, 5641, 5641.1,
5641.2, 5641.3, 5641.4, 5641.5, 5641.6, 6701, 7027.5 of the California Business
and Professions Code, § 832.27 of Title 16 of the California Code of
Regulations, and § 6721 of the California Food and Agricultural Code.)
(Ord. 1005, passed 8-3-2010)
§ 27.3-8 GRADING DESIGN PLAN.
   For the efficient use of water, a grading design plan may be submitted for
