ORDINANCE NO. 1675
 
AN ORDINANCE AMENDING THE SMOKY HOLLOW SPECIFIC PLAN PERMITTED USES AND
DEFINITIONS RELATED TO INCUBATOR AND INNOVATIVE START-UP USES.
(Environmental Assessment No. EA-1374 and Specific Plan Amendment No. SPA 24-
03).
 
   The City Council of the city of El Segundo does ordain as follows:
 
SECTION 1:   The City Council finds and declares as follows:
 
A.   On September 12, 2024, the City initiated an application for Environmental
Assessment No. EA 1374 and Specific Plan Amendment No. SPA 24-03 to amend the
Smoky Hollow Specific Plan updating the permitted uses, definitions, and
development standards related to incubator and innovative start-up uses;
 
B.   On September 12, 2024, and May 22, 2025, the Planning Commission held
study sessions to receive public testimony and provide direction to staff on
the scope of the specific plan amendment;
 
C.   The City reviewed the project’s environmental impacts under the California
Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code §§ 21000, et seq., “CEQA”) and
the regulations promulgated thereunder (14 Cal. Code of Regulations §§15000, et
seq., the “CEQA Guidelines”);
 
D.   On July 24, 2025, the Planning Commission held a public hearing to receive
public testimony and other evidence regarding the Ordinance and adopted
Resolution No. 2965 recommending that the City Council introduce and adopt the
Ordinance.
 
E.   On August 19, 2025, the City Council held a duly noticed public hearing
and considered the information provided by City staff and public testimony
regarding the Ordinance; and
 
F.   This Ordinance and its findings are made based upon the entire
administrative record including, without limitation, testimony and evidence
presented to the City Council at its August 19, 2025, hearing and the staff
report submitted by the Community Development Department.
 
SECTION 2: Factual Findings and Conclusions. The City Council finds that
introducing and adopting the Ordinance will amend the City’s Smoky Hollow
Specific Plan to establish the following:
 
A.   Amend the Allowed Land Uses (Table 2-1) to add Incubator and Innovative
Start-up uses to the uses permitted by-right and those permitted subject to an
administrative use permit (AUP) in the Smoky Hollow West and Smoky Hollow East
Zoning Districts; and
 
B.   Amend Appendix A (Glossary) to add a definition for Incubator and
Innovative Start-up uses.
 
SECTION 3: Specific Plan Amendment Findings. As required under Government Code
§ 65854 and ESMC § 15-27-3 and based on the findings set forth in Section 2,
the City Council finds as follows:
A.   That the amendment is consistent with the General Plan.
 
The Smoky Hollow Specific Plan serves as the General Plan document for the
Smoky Hollow area. Therefore, if the proposed specific plan amendment is
consistent with the Specific Plan’s vision, goal and objectives, it is also
consistent with the General Plan. The specific plan amendment is consistent
with and implements the primary Smoky Hollow Specific Plan goal to facilitate
the transformation of the Smoky Hollow district from an aging industrial area
to a vigorous incubator district and major economic force in the City.
Specifically, the amendments facilitate the establishment and growth of
innovative start-up businesses in creative and advanced technology industries
by:
1.   Establishing a broad and flexible definition of innovative start-up uses;
and
2.   Establishing an efficient administrative process to permit these uses in
the Specific Plan.
Thus, the amendments are consistent with the Specific Plan vision of making
Smoky Hollow an incubator hub and creative center in El Segundo and throughout
the region.  
 
B.   The amendment is necessary to serve the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
 
The specific plan amendments will help achieve the primary Smoky Hollow
Specific Plan goal of transforming Smoky Hollow from an aging industrial area
to a vigorous incubator district and major economic force in the City. The
amendments allow new innovative start-up uses and reduce barriers to these uses
that are complementary to the creative office and advanced technology incubator
character of the district. Thus, the amendments will help transform Smoky
Hollow into an economic force, which is consistent with and necessary to serve
the public health, safety, and general welfare. In addition, there is no
evidence indicating that any of the proposed amendments will have a detrimental
impact on public health, safety, and general welfare.
 
SECTION 4: Environmental Assessment. Based on the facts set forth in Section 2,
the City Council finds that the zone text amendment is exempt from further
review under the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) pursuant to CEQA
Guidelines § 15061(b)(3)), because it consists only of minor revisions to
existing zoning regulations and related procedures and does not have the
potential for causing a significant effect on the environment.
 
SECTION 5: Action. The City Council hereby approves and adopts the updated
Smoky Hollow Specific Plan as set forth in attached Exhibit “A,” which
is incorporated into this Ordinance by reference.
 
SECTION 6:  Electronic Signatures. This Ordinance may be executed with
electronic signatures in accordance with Government Code § 16.5. Such
electronic signatures will be treated in all respects as having the same effect
as an original signature.
 
SECTION 7: Construction. This Ordinance must be broadly construed to achieve
the purposes stated in this Ordinance. It is the City Council’s intent that the
provisions of this Ordinance be interpreted or implemented by the City and
others in a manner that facilitates the purposes set forth in this Ordinance.
 
SECTION 8:  Enforceability. Repeal of any provision of the ESMC does not affect
any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred before, or preclude prosecution
and imposition of penalties for any violation occurring before this Ordinance’s
effective date. Any such repealed part will remain in full force and effect for
sustaining action or prosecuting violations occurring before the effective date
of this Ordinance.
 
SECTION 9:  Validity of Previous Code Sections. If this entire Ordinance or its
application is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, any repeal
or amendment of the ESMC or other city ordinance by this Ordinance will be
rendered void and cause such previous ESMC provision or other the city
ordinance to remain in full force and effect for all purposes.
 
SECTION 10: Severability. If any part of this Ordinance or its application is
deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the City Council intends
that such invalidity will not affect the effectiveness of the remaining
provisions or applications and, to this end, the provisions of this Ordinance
are severable.
 
SECTION 11: Recordation. The City Clerk, or designee, is directed to certify
the passage and adoption of this Ordinance; cause it to be entered into the
City of El Segundo’s book of original ordinances; make a note of the passage
and adoption in the records of this meeting; and, within 15 days after the
passage and adoption of this Ordinance, cause it to be published or posted in
accordance with California law.
 
SECTION 12: Effective Date. This Ordinance will go into effect and be in full
force and effect 30 days after its passage and adoption.
 
PASSED AND ADOPTED this 2 nd day of September, 2025.

uses may be subject to special conditions regarding the location, operation,
design, or special permitting requirements. Following an application submittal,
the Planning and Building SafetyCommunity Development Director (Director) or
his or her designee shall make a determination as to whether the proposed use
is permitted, conditionally permitted, prohibited, or allowed as a temporary or

Ø   A Permitted Use (P) is allowed without discretionary approval and subject
to all applicable provisions of this Specific Plan.
Ø   An Administrative Use Permit (AUP) requires discretionary approval
authorized by the Director and subject to the requirements outlined in ESMC

Smoky Hollow Specific Plan Appendix A – Glossary is amended as follows:
*   *   *
Incidental: See “Accessory.”
Incubator and Innovative Start-up uses:
General definition
A facility specifically designed to facilitate the development and growth of
innovative, early-stage (start-up) businesses. These facilities provide
flexible space to support small visionary start-ups with large aspirations,
fostering an environment where innovation thrives and supporting growth during
their initial stages. These establishments facilitate a variety of activities
aimed at generating new and improved products and services.
Permitted activities/functions
Activities/functions of incubator and innovative start-up uses include design,
research, development, testing, prototyping and/or scaling up, and light
industrial/manufacturing; and the outcomes can range from products, inventions,
patents, and/or knowledge. The facilities and/or functions involved may include
labs, offices, research and development, warehousing, and manufacturing as part
of the overall use.
Permitted Industry Types
Incubator and innovative start-up uses may encompass businesses in sectors such
as aerospace and defense, energy, national security-related, software and
hardware technology, and other fields focused on research, development, and
innovation, such as life sciences (biotechnology, pharmaceutical, food,
agriculture, and environmental).
Operational characteristics
These uses initially have low employee counts and workspace needs but have the
potential to expand quickly and affect the availability of on-street parking.
These uses generally do not contribute significantly to nuisance factors, such
as noise, vibration, glare, heat, dust, humidity, odor or any type of potential
air or waste pollution that may potentially be hazardous beyond the site's
property lines.
Incubator and innovative start-up uses are not intended to:
a)   manufacture mass quantities of physical products, or
b)   use large quantities of raw and/or hazardous materials.

the loose-leaf type of binding together with the continuous supplement service,

(Ord. 1564, 12-19-2017; amd. Ord. 1667, 2-4-2025)
1-7-7: INFORMAL BIDDING REQUIREMENTS:
As used in this chapter, the term "informal bidding" refers to the following
process and requirements:
   A.   Purchases must, whenever possible, be based upon at least three (3)
informal bids or quotes and be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder.
   B.   Bids must be written.
   C.   The Purchasing Officer or Department Directors may solicit such bids.
   D.   Bids may be evaluated based upon bid amount, compliance with bid
specifications, responsibility of the bidder, and any other reasonable matter
identified in the notice soliciting bids, this Code, or any other rule or
regulation promulgated to implement this chapter.
   E.   If the City does not receive any bids or quotes, the Purchasing Officer
may act as follows, provided the requesting department concurs:
      1.   Abandon the purchase;
      2.   Rebid the purchase on an informal basis; or
      3.   Purchase the supplies or procure the services on a direct negotiated
contract.
   F.   If the Purchasing Officer determines bids are unacceptably high, or
specifications were misleading, the Purchasing Officer may reject any bids
presented and the item may be rebid.
   G.   The Purchasing Officer may reject all bids or award the purchase
contract to the best qualified bidder whose bid or proposal fulfills the
purpose intended according to criteria designated in the solicitation, provided
that the contract award amount is within the unencumbered appropriation for
that item. The Purchasing Officer may waive any minor bid irregularities.
   H.   If a successful bidder refuses to comply with, or fails to execute, a
contract issued by the City within ten (10) calendar days after being awarded
the contract, the Purchasing Officer may cancel the award and retain any bid
security. Compliance with contract requirements includes, without limitation,
submission of adequate and complete insurance documentation. Should this occur,
the Purchasing Officer may award the contract to the next lowest responsible
bidder. (Ord. 1564, 12-19-2017)
1-7-8: FORMAL BIDDING (SEALED BIDS) REQUIREMENTS:
As used in this chapter, the term "formal bidding" refers to the following
process and requirements:
   A.   A notice inviting formal bids must be posted at City Hall and
electronically mailed or faxed at least ten (10) calendar days before the
deadline for submitting bids to all vendors on the City's list for the category
of supplies or services being sought and to such other vendors as the
Purchasing Officer deems appropriate.
   B.   The notice inviting bids must describe the supplies or services needed
in general and generic terms, identify security required for the bid, how bid
specifications can be obtained, and designate the deadline and place for
submitting formal bids.
   C.   The Purchasing Officer may require bidders to secure bids and
performance in a manner approved by the Purchasing Officer and in a form
approved by the City Attorney. Unsuccessful bidders are entitled to the return
of bid security within sixty (60) calendar days after the date of the award.
   D.   Bids must be submitted to the City Clerk's Office in a sealed envelope
and be clearly marked as a bid along with the bidder's name and project or bid
number written on the outside of the envelope. The City Clerk's Office will
open properly submitted bids at the time and place stated in the notice
inviting bids. A written record must be made at the time all bids are received
and then opened.
   E.   Bids may be evaluated based upon bid amount, compliance with bid
specifications, responsibility of the bidder, and any other reasonable matter
identified in the notice soliciting bids, this Code, or any other rule or
regulation promulgated to implement this chapter.
   F.   The department seeking the supplies or services will make a
recommendation to the City Council regarding the award of a contract based upon
the department's and Purchasing Officer's evaluation.
   G.   If the City does not receive any bids, the City Council may:
      1.   Abandon the purchase;
      2.   Authorize rebidding the purchase on either a formal or an informal
basis; or
      3.   Authorize purchasing the supplies or procurement of services on a
direct negotiated contract.
   H.   The successful bidder is selected by the City Council acting within its
sole discretion. The City Council is under no obligation to contract with any
bidder. If the City Council determines bids are unacceptably high, or
specifications were misleading, it may direct the Purchasing Officer to reject
all bids presented and the item may be rebid.
   I.   The City Council may waive any minor bid irregularities.
   J.   If a successful bidder refuses to comply with, or fails to execute, a
contract issued by the City within ten (10) calendar days after being awarded
the contract, the Purchasing Officer may cancel the award and retain any bid
security. Compliance with contract requirements includes, without limitation,
submission of adequate and complete insurance documentation. Should this occur,
the City Council may award the contract to the next lowest responsible bidder
and the amount of the lowest bidder's security shall be applied by the City to
the difference between the lowest and second lowest bid, and the surplus, if
any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder. (Ord. 1564, 12-19-2017)
1-7-9: EXCEPTIONS TO THE BIDDING REQUIREMENTS:

1-7-7 and
1-7-8 of this chapter need not be followed in the following situations:

supported by appropriate documentation.
   C.   When the Purchasing Officer identifies a cooperative competitive
bidding procedure, being prepared by and processed through another local,
State, or Federal governmental agency. Under such circumstances, the Purchasing
Officer may join into an existing written purchase contract obtained within the

supplies is fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) or more for a single item or
bulk purchase of a single item.

immediate or imminent emergency or other exigent circumstance that threatens
the City or the City's interests, and such purchases are required for the

interests. A declaration of emergency as set forth in this Code is conclusive
evidence of such an event. In such an event, the City Manager or acting City
Manager may bind the City, with or without a written contract, for the
acquisition of equipment, materials, supplies, labor, services or other items.

1-7-13: RECYCLED PRODUCTS:
Whenever practicable, the City will purchase and use recycled products and
recyclable goods. The City will place special emphasis on the purchase of
products manufactured with at least twenty percent (20%) post-consumer recycled
materials. When faced with a choice of two (2) or more recycled content
products, and the price between the products is within ten percent (10%) and
the products are of comparable quality and availability, the City will purchase
the product with the greatest recycled content. (Ord. 1564, 12-19-2017)
1-7-14: COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS:

competitive proposal procedures, whereby competitors' qualifications are

   B.   All evaluation factors, along with their relative importance, must be
identified and included in the RFP;

The California political reform act 1  imposes a number of requirements upon

and 85703 the city may impose more restrictive regulations for local elections.
Accordingly, this chapter is added to this code to further the public's
compelling interest for full disclosure in local elections in order to better
inform the electorate and prevent political corruption. Nothing contained in
this chapter is intended, nor should it be construed, to supplant the political
reform act's requirements, or its regulations; this chapter is intended only to
supplement the political reform act as to local elections. (Ord. 1341, 11-7-
2001)

from this tax with respect to certain storage, use or other consumption of

This chapter shall be known as the UNIFORM TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX REGULATIONS
OF THE CITY. (Ord. 621, 7-13-1964)
3-4-2: DEFINITIONS:
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this
section govern the construction of this chapter.
   HOTEL: Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or
intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel,
studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house,
dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed
location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.
   OCCUPANCY: The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of
any room or rooms or portion thereof in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes.
   OPERATOR: The person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity
of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other
capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of
any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be
deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same
duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this
chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both.
   PERSON: Any firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club,
fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust,
business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination
acting as a unit.
   RENT: The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy
of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods,
labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and
services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.
   TAX ADMINISTRATOR: The Chief Financial Officer.
   TRANSIENT:
   A.   Any "person" as defined in this section, who exercises occupancy or is
entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license
or other agreement, for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or
less.
   B.   Any individual who personally exercises occupancy or is entitled to
occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other
agreement, for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less.
Any such person or individual so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to
be a transient.
In determining whether an individual is a transient, uninterrupted periods of
time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date hereof may be
considered. (Ord. 1252, 4-9-1996; amd. Ord. 1620, 11-17-2020)
3-4-3: IMPOSITION; RATE:
   A.   Tax Imposed: For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each
transient is subject to and must pay a tax of twelve percent (12%) of the rent
charged by the operator. (Ord. 1519, 5-3-2016)
   B.   Payment To Operator: The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient
to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator of the hotel
at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If
for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax
administrator may require that the tax shall be paid directly to the tax
administrator. (Ord. 1252, 4-9-1996)
3-4-4: EXEMPTIONS:
   A.   No tax shall be imposed upon:
      1.   Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond
the power of the city to impose the tax herein provided;
      2.   Any federal or state of California officer or employee while on
official business only and when payment for such occupancy is made by duly
authorized voucher payment from the governing agency;
      3.   Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by
reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.
   B.   No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the
time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by
the tax administrator. (Ord. 1121, 9-20-1988)
3-4-5: COLLECTION:
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent
and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount
of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each
transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of
a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly,
that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator,
or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be
refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. (Ord. 621, 7-13-1964)
3-4-6: REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE:
Within thirty (30) days after the effective date hereof, or within thirty (30)
days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel
renting occupancy to transients shall register the hotel with the Tax
Administrator and obtain from him a transient occupancy registration
certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.
The certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
   A.   The name of the operator;
   B.   The address of the hotel;
   C.   The date upon which the certificate was issued;
   D.   This transient occupancy registration certificate signifies that the
person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the uniform
transient occupancy tax regulations by registering with the Tax Administrator
for the purpose of collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and
remitting such tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not
authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful
business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly
complying with all local applicable laws, including, but not limited to, those
requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this
City. This certificate does not constitute a permit.
(Ord. 621, 7-13-1964)
3-4-7: RENT REPORT; TAX REMITTANCE:
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close
of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which
may be established by the Tax Administrator, make a return to the Tax
Administrator, on forms provided by him of the total rents charged and received
and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the
return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the
Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator may establish shorter reporting
periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to ensure
collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return.
Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any
reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this Chapter shall be held
in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Tax
Administrator. (Ord. 621, 7-13-1964)
3-4-8: FAILURE TO REMIT; PENALTY:
   A.   Original Delinquency: Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this Chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent
(10%) of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.
   B.   Continued Delinquency: Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on
which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency
penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount
of the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed.
   C.   Fraud: If the Tax Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this Chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty five
percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to
the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this Section.
   D.   Interest: In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails
to remit any tax imposed by this Chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-
half of one percent (0.5%) per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the
tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became
delinquent until paid.
   E.   Penalties Merged With Tax: Every penalty imposed and such interest as
accrues under the provisions of this Section shall become a part of the tax
herein required to be paid. (Ord. 621, 7-13-1964)
3-4-9: OPERATOR VIOLATION:
If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the
time provided in this Chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any
portion thereof required by this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed
in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to
base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator procures
such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the
assessment of any tax imposed by this Chapter and payable by any operator who
has failed or refused to collect the same and to make the report and
remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against the operator the
tax, interest and penalties provided for by this Chapter. In case the
determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount
so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known
place of address. The operator may within ten (10) days after the serving or
mailing of the notice make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for
a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing
is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if
any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable. If the application is made, the Tax Administrator
shall give not less than five (5) days' written notice in the manner prescribed
herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice
why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for the tax, interest and
penalties. At the hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why the
specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After the hearing
the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall
thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of
the determination and the amount of the tax, interest and penalties. The amount
determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal
is taken as provided in Section
3-4-10 of this Chapter. (Ord. 621, 7-13-1964)
3-4-10: OPERATOR APPEAL:
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Administrator with respect to
the amount of the tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within fifteen (15)
days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Council
shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal, and the City Clerk shall
give notice in writing to the operator at his last known place of address. The
findings of the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon
the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing.
Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the
service of notice. (Ord. 621, 7-13-1964)
3-4-11: RECORD RETENTION:
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to
the City of any tax imposed by this Chapter to keep and preserve, for a period
of three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of
such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the
City, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at
all reasonable times. (Ord. 621, 7-13-1964)
3-4-12: REFUNDS:
   A.   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this Chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections B and C of this Section, provided: 1) the tax was paid under
protest, and 2) a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury
the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the Tax
Administrator within one year of the date of payment. The claim shall be on
forms furnished by the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 1252, 4-9-1996)
   B.   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a
credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the
transient to the operator.
   C.   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than
once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by filing a
claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this Section, but only when the
tax was paid by the transient directly to the Tax Administrator, or when the
transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction
of the Tax Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund
from the operator who collected the tax.
   D.   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this Section unless the
claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement
thereto. (Ord. 621, 7-13-1964)
3-4-13: TAX DEEMED DEBT TO CITY:
Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this
Chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the City. Any such tax
collected by an operator which has not been paid to the City shall be deemed a
debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing money to the City under
the provisions of this Chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name
of the City for the recovery of the amount. (Ord. 621, 7-13-1964)

register as required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or
who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by
the Tax Administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is
guilty of a misdemeanor, and is punishable as aforesaid. Any person required to
make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes any false or
fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of

battery owned or possessed by him for use in an automobile or other machinery
or device apart from the premises upon which the energy was received; provided,

be remitted to the tax administrator on or before the last day of the following

industrial utility user in the city other than a gas corporation, using in the

section shall be at the rate of three percent (3%) of the charges made for such
gas and shall be paid by the commercial or industrial utility user paying for
such gas. "Charges", as used in this section, shall include: 1) gas which is
delivered through mains of pipes; and 2) minimum charges for services,
including customer charges, service charges, and annual and monthly charges.
   B.   Exclusions: There shall be excluded from the base on which the tax
imposed in this section is computed: 1) charges made for gas which is to be
resold and delivered through mains or pipes; 2) charges made for gas sold for
use in production or distribution of water by a public utility or governmental

industrial utility user in the city using water which is delivered though mains
or pipes. The tax imposed by this section shall be at the rate of three percent
(3%) of the charges made for such water and shall be paid by the commercial or
industrial utility user paying for such water.

   C.   Collection: The tax imposed by this section shall be collected from the
service user by the person selling the water. The amount collected in one month

3-7-7: COMMUNICATION SERVICES USER TAX:
   A.   Tax Imposed: A tax is imposed upon every service user in the city using
communication services. The maximum tax imposed by this section is two percent
(2%) of the charges made for such services and must be collected from the
service user by the communication services supplier or its billing agent. There
is a rebuttable presumption that communication services billed to a billing or
service address in the city are used, in whole or in part, within the city's
boundaries and such services are taxable under this chapter. If the billing
address of the service user is different from the service address, the service
address of the service user must be used for purposes of imposing the tax. As
used in this section, the term "charges" include the value of any other
services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other consideration
provided by the service user in exchange for the communication services.
   B.   Mobile Service Sourced: Mobile telecommunications service is sourced in
accordance with the sourcing rules set forth in the mobile telecommunications
sourcing act (4 USC section 124), regulations promulgated thereto, and any
successor statute or regulation. The tax administrator may issue and
disseminate to communication service suppliers, which are subject to the tax
collection requirements of this chapter, sourcing rules for the taxation of
other communication services including, without limitation, postpaid
communication services, prepaid communication services, and private
communication services, provided that such rules are based upon industry custom
and common practice that further administrative efficiency and minimize
multijurisdictional taxation.
   C.   Tax Credit: To prevent actual multijurisdictional taxation of
communication services subject to tax under this section, any service user,
upon proof to the tax administrator that the service user previously paid the
same tax in another state or city on such communication services, is allowed a
credit against the tax imposed to the extent of the amount of such tax legally
imposed in such other state or city; provided, however, the amount of credit
cannot exceed the tax owed to the city under this section.
   D.   Combined Charge Subject To Tax: Except as otherwise provided by
applicable federal or state law, if any nontaxable charges are combined with
and not separately stated from taxable service charges on the customer bill or
invoice of a service supplier, the combined charge is subject to tax unless the
service supplier identifies, by reasonable and verifiable standards, the
portions of the combined charge that are nontaxable and taxable through the
service supplier's books and records kept in the regular course of business and
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not created
and maintained for tax purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving
the proper apportionment of taxable and nontaxable charges.
   E.   Collection Of Tax: For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a
duty to collect and remit a tax under this section, "substantial nexus" and
"minimum contacts" are construed broadly in favor of the imposition, collection
or remittance of the tax to the fullest extent permitted by state and federal
law and as it may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or by
statutory enactment. Any communication service (including VoIP) used by a
person with a service address in the city, which service is capable of
terminating a call to another person on the general telephone network, is
subject to a rebuttable presumption that "substantial nexus/minimum contacts"
exists for purposes of imposing a tax, or establishing a duty to collect and
remit a tax, under this chapter. A service supplier is deemed to have
sufficient activity in the city for tax collection and remittance purposes if
its activities include, without limitation, any of the following: maintains or
has within the city, directly or through an agent or subsidiary, a place of
business of any nature; solicits business in the city by employees, independent
contractors, resellers, agents or other representatives; solicits business in
the city on a continuous, regular, seasonal or systematic basis by means of
advertising that is broadcast or relayed from a transmitter with the city or
distributed from a location within the city; or advertises in newspapers or
other periodicals printed and published within the city or through materials
distributed in the city by means other than the United States mail. Upon
request, the city must make available an accurate description of its
jurisdictional boundaries based on street addresses or ZIP plus four, in an
electronic format. If a service supplier relies upon such information provided
by city, it is not responsible for any errors in taxation that may result.
   F.   Satisfaction Of Tax Obligation By Service Users: Any person who pays
the tax levied pursuant to this section with respect to any charge for a
communication service is deemed to have satisfied that person's obligation to
pay the tax levied pursuant to former section
3-7-7 as codified immediately before adoption of this regulation with respect
to that charge. Likewise, before October 1, 2010, any person who pays the tax
levied pursuant to former section
3-7-7 as codified immediately before adoption of this regulation is deemed to
have satisfied the person's obligation to pay the tax levied pursuant to this
section with respect to that charge. The intent of this subsection is to
prevent the imposition of multiple taxes upon a single utility charge during
the transition period from the previous telephone tax to the new tax (which
transition period ends October 1, 2010) and to permit communication service
providers during that transition period to satisfy their collection obligations
by collecting either tax.
   G.   Collection Of Tax By Service Supplier: Service suppliers must begin to
collect the tax imposed by this section as soon as feasible after the effective
date of the section, but in no event later than permitted by Public Utilities
Code section 799. (Ord. 1438, 4-13-2010)
3-7-8: REPORTING AND REMITTING:
Each service supplier shall, on or before the last day of each month, make a
return to the Tax Administrator on forms provided by him, stating the amount of
taxes billed by the service supplier during the preceding month, except as
provided in subsection
3-7-5C of this Chapter. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the
tax collected shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator
is authorized to require such further information as he deems necessary to
determine if the tax imposed hereby is being levied and collected in accordance
with this Chapter. (Ord. 1252, 4-9-1996)
3-7-9: INTEREST AND PENALTY:
   A.   Delinquency: Taxes collected from a service user which are not remitted
to the Tax Administrator on or before the due dates provided in this Chapter
are delinquent. Should the due date occur on a weekend or legal holiday, the
return may be postmarked the first regular working day following a Saturday,
Sunday, or legal holiday.
   B.   Penalty Rate: Penalties for delinquency in remittance of any tax
collected or any deficiency determination pursuant to this Chapter shall attach
to, and be paid by, the person required to collect and remit at the rate of
fifteen percent (15%) of the total tax collected or imposed by this Chapter.
   C.   Additional Penalty For Fraud: The Tax Administrator is hereby empowered
to impose additional penalties upon persons required to collect and remit taxes
under the provisions of this Chapter for fraud or negligence in reporting or
remitting at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the tax
collected or as recomputed by the Tax Administrator.
   D.   Penalty Part Of Tax: Every penalty imposed under the provisions of this
Section shall become a part of the tax required to be remitted. (Ord. 1252, 4-
9-1996)
3-7-10: ACTIONS TO COLLECT:
Any such tax received from a service user which has wilfully been withheld from
the Tax Administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the City by the person
required to collect and remit. Any person holding such money contrary to the
provisions of this Chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of
the City for the recovery of such amount. (Ord. 1252, 4-9-1996)
3-7-11: DUTY TO COLLECT; PROCEDURES:
The duty to collect and remit the taxes imposed by this Chapter shall be
performed as follows:
   A.   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
3-7-5C of this Chapter, the tax shall be collected insofar as practicable at
the same time as and along with the charges made in accordance with the regular
billing practices of the service supplier. Where the amount paid by a service
user to a service supplier is less than the full amount of the energy charge
and tax which has accrued for the billing period, such amount and any
subsequent payments by a service user shall be applied to the utility charge
first until such charge has been fully satisfied. Any remaining balance shall
be applied to taxes due. In those cases where a service user has notified the
service supplier of his refusal to pay the tax imposed on said energy charges,
subsection
3-7-13C of this Chapter will apply.
   B.   The duty to collect tax from a service user shall commence with the
beginning of the first full regular billing period applicable to the service
user where all charges normally included in such regular billing are subject to
the provisions of this Chapter. Where a person receives more than one billing,
one or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall
arise separately for each billing. (Ord. 1252, 4-9-1996)
3-7-12: ADDITIONAL POWERS AND DUTIES OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR:
   A.   The Tax Administrator shall have the power and duty, and is hereby
directed to enforce each and all of the provisions of this Chapter.
   B.   The Tax Administrator shall have the power to adopt rules and
regulations not inconsistent with provisions of this Chapter for the purpose of
carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes
herein imposed. A copy of such rules and regulations shall be on file in the
Tax Administrator's office.
   C.   The Tax Administrator may make administrative agreements to vary the
strict requirements of this Chapter so that collection of any tax imposed here
may be made in conformance with the billing procedures of particular service
supplier so long as said agreements result in collection of the tax in
conformance with the general purpose and scope of this Chapter. A copy of each
such agreement shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office.
   D.   The Tax Administrator shall determine the eligibility of any commercial
or industrial utility user who asserts a right to exemption from the tax
imposed by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator shall provide the service
supplier with the name of any commercial or industrial utility user who the Tax
Administrator determines is exempt from the tax imposed hereby, together with
the address and account number to which service is supplied to any such exempt
commercial or industrial utility user. The Tax Administrator shall notify the
service supplier of the termination of any commercial or industrial utility
user's right to exemption hereunder, or the change of any address to which
service is supplied to any exempt commercial or industrial utility user. (Ord.
1252, 4-9-1996)
3-7-13: ASSESSMENT; ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY:
   A.   The Tax Administrator may make an assessment for taxes not remitted by
a person required to remit.
   B.   Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has
deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by him from the amounts
remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or that a service user has
refused to pay the amount of tax to such person, or whenever the Tax
Administrator deems it in the best interest of the city, he may relieve such
person of the obligation to collect taxes due under this chapter from certain
named service users for specified billing periods.
   C.   The service supplier shall provide the city with amounts refused and/or
unpaid along with the names and addresses of the service users neglecting to
pay the tax imposed under provisions of this chapter. Whenever the service user
has failed to pay the amount of tax for a period of two (2) or more billing
periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation to collect
taxes due.
   D.   The tax administrator shall notify the service user that he has assumed
responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand
payment of such taxes. The notice shall be served on the service user by
handing it to him personally or by deposit of the notice in the United States
mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the service user at the address to
which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should
the service user have changed his address, to his last known address. If a
service user fails to remit the tax to the tax administrator within fifteen
(15) days from the date of the service of the notice upon him, which shall be
the date of mailing if service is not accomplished in person, a penalty of
twenty five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax set forth in the notice
shall be imposed, but not less than five dollars ($5.00). The penalty shall
become part of the tax herein required to be paid. (Ord. 1252, 4-9-1996)
3-7-14: RECORDS:
It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and remit to the city
any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three (3)
years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as
he may have been liable for the collection of a remittance to the tax
administrator, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to
inspect at all reasonable times. (Ord. 1252, 4-9-1996)
3-7-14-1: VIOLATION OF RECORDS REQUIREMENT; PENALTY:
If any person subject to record keeping under this chapter unreasonably denies
the tax administrator, or the tax administrator's designated representative,
access to such records, the person unreasonably denying access shall be subject
to a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each violation. The person
shall be guilty of a separate offense for each and every day during any portion
of which denial of access is committed, continued or permitted by such person.
This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed under this code.
(Ord. 1325, 9-19-2000)
3-7-15: REFUNDS:
   A.   Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more than once
or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the tax
administrator under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsections
B and C of this section, provided: 1) the tax was paid under protest; and 2) a
claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific
grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator
within one year of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished
by the tax administrator.
   B.   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of this section, a
service supplier may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected
and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or
illegally collected or received when it is established that the service user
from whom the tax has been collected did not owe the tax; provided, however,
that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the
tax so collected has either been refunded to the service user or credited to
charges subsequently payable by the service user to the person required to
collect and remit. A service supplier that has collected any amount of tax in
excess of the amount of tax imposed by this chapter and actually due from a
service user, may refund such amount to the service user and claim credit for
such overpayment against the amount of tax which is due upon any other monthly
returns, provided such credit is claimed in a return dated no later than one
year from the date of overpayment.
   C.   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the
claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement
thereto.
   D.   Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, whenever a service
supplier, pursuant to an order of the California public utilities commission or
a court of competent jurisdiction, makes a refund to service users of charges
for past utility services, the taxes paid pursuant to this chapter on the
amount of such refunded charges shall also be refunded to service users, and
the service supplier shall be entitled to claim a credit for such refunded
taxes against the amount of tax which is due upon the next monthly returns. In
the event this chapter is repealed, the amounts of any refundable taxes will be
borne by the city.
   E.   A service supplier may refund the taxes collected to the service user
in accordance with this section or by the service supplier's customary
practice. (Ord. 1252, 4-9-1996)
   F.   Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a claim on behalf of a class
or group of taxpayers. (Ord. 1325, 9-19-2000)
3-7-16: REDUCTION OF TAX BASED ON SALES TAX RECEIPTS:
Whenever in this title a utility users tax is imposed on any person subject to
the utility users tax, the amount of the utility users tax shall be reduced
proportionately whenever the preceding fiscal year exceeds the limit determined
by the formula in subsection A of this section.
   A.   The sales tax limit which will trigger a reduction in the utility users
tax shall be equal to eighty percent (80%) of the sales tax revenue received in
the 1979-1980 fiscal year multiplied by the appropriations limit established
annually since 1980-1981 under the provisions of article XIIIB of the
California constitution.
   B.   In any year in which sales tax revenue exceeds the limit established in
subsection A of this section, the utility users tax imposed the following July
1 shall be reduced by the percentage that revenue exceeds the limit. (Ord.
1252, 4-9-1996)
3-7-17: UTILITY USERS ACCOUNT:
The tax administrator shall establish a utility users tax account within the
general fund and shall place therein any and all taxes collected under this
chapter which are in excess of the amounts needed to balance the adopted
general fund budget during any one fiscal year. (Ord. 1252, 4-9-1996)
3-7-18: ANNUAL REVIEW:
   A.   Each year in conjunction with the annual budget deliberations and prior
to September 30, the city council shall reconsider the provisions and rate of
the utility users tax as well as any taxes that may have been placed in the
utility users tax account as provided in section
3-7-17 of this chapter during the preceding and current fiscal years.
Notwithstanding the provisions of section
3-7-16 of this chapter, the council may reduce or suspend all or a part of the
tax rate for the current fiscal year; or may provide no tax on one or more
utilities for the current fiscal year.
   B.   The city will give the service supplier at least one month's
notification prior to any requested change in the utility users tax percentage.
(Ord. 1252, 4-9-1996)
3-7-19: APPEALS:
   A.   If the service user or service supplier is aggrieved by any decision or
administrative ruling of the tax administrator, or with the failure to grant a
refund or exemption as provided for under this chapter, he may appeal to the
city manager, or his or her duly authorized designee, by filing a notice of
appeal with the city clerk within fourteen (14) days of the decision or
administrative ruling which aggrieved the service user or service supplier. The
city clerk shall thereupon fix a time and place for a hearing of such appeal.
The city clerk shall give notice to such person of the time and place of
hearing as herein provided.
   B.   The decision of the city manager, or his or her duly authorized
designee, shall be final unless appealed to the city council, in the manner

date of the decision.
      1.   The notice of appeal shall contain the name and address of the
person appealing the action, the decision appealed from and the grounds for the
appeal. A defect in the form of the notice does not affect the validity or
right to an appeal. The notice of appeal shall be accompanied by the fee fixed
by resolution of the city council.
      2.   A city council member may appeal a decision of the city manager. The
appeal shall be processed in the same manner as an appeal by any other person
but need not be accompanied by the fee prescribed for an appeal. The city
council member appealing the decision is not disqualified by that action from
participating in the appeal hearing and the deliberations nor from voting as a
member of the city council.
      3.   The city clerk shall set the matter for hearing before the city
council and shall give notice of the hearing on the appeal.
      4.   The city council shall hear the appeal as a new matter. The original
applicant has the burden of proof. The city council may reverse or affirm the
city manager's decision in whole or in part, or may modify the decision that is
being appealed, irrespective of the precise grounds or scope of the appeal. In
addition to considering the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing on
the appeal, the city council shall consider all pertinent information from the
file as a result of the previous actions from which the appeal is taken.
   C.   No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process
shall issue in any suit, action, or proceeding in any court against this city
or against any officer of the city to prevent or enjoin the collection under
this chapter of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected and/or
remitted. (Ord. 1325, 9-19-2000)

provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 of the

   D.   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes,
and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons
subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1566, 4-10-
2018)
3-8-4: CONTRACT WITH STATE:
Before the operative date, the City must contract with the State Board of

For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a
transaction tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the incorporated

enterprise, game or activity, or upon the number of rooms or units in any

information is true, with the licensing authority for guidance in ascertaining
the amount the person is required to pay or deposit, and provide the following
information: the number of employees employed by the person, or upon the number
of square feet of floor space, or upon square acre of space owned, leased, or
rented, or the number of vehicles used, or the number of machines or other
devices used for any business, enterprise, game or activity by the person, or

quarters in the calendar year during which the person was, or will actually be,
doing business in the City.
   C.   Initial Application: If a business is seeking its initial El Segundo

valid City business license, said records shall include records of the
taxpayer's subcontractors and the taxpayer shall be held responsible for the
failure of any of its subcontractors to maintain records necessary to calculate
any tax under this Title. Said records shall be kept for three (3) years from

held responsible for the failure of any of the subcontractors to maintain
records necessary to calculate any tax under this Title. Said records shall be
kept for three (3) years from the date upon which the tax to which the records
relate is due. Where no records are available or those available are
insufficient to calculate the tax due hereunder, the City shall have the
authority to determine the tax due. Upon five (5) working days' notice, a
taxpayer or any business which the City contends should pay tax, must make
available to the City at City Hall in El Segundo all records requested by the
City relating to said tax. Failure to do so may result in a fine of two hundred

4-2-1: FEES PAID TO CITY:
   A.   The amount of license fee to be paid to the city by persons commencing
or conducting any business subject to this chapter are set forth in this
chapter.
   B.   Beginning on January 1, 2025, license fees imposed in this title will
be increased annually each January 1 on a percentage basis using the percentage
increase in the consumer price index ("CPI") for all urban consumers as
calculated by the United States department of labor, bureau of labor
statistics, for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim area, all items, calculated
as follows:
      1.   The five (5) most recent annual CPI percentages are added together
and then divided by five (5) to derive the five-year average CPI percentage
(“ACPI”); and
      2.   The ACPI is multiplied by the amount of existing license fees. The
product of that multiplication is added to the amount of the license fees
imposed by the city for the previous calendar year.
      3.   For purposes of this section, an “annual CPI percentage” is the
percentage change in CPI based upon comparing a twelve-month period ending on
March 31 with the subsequent twelve-month period ending on March 31. For
example, and without limitation, on January 1, 2025, the ACPI will be
calculated using the five (5) years of CPI percentages that include the
following time periods: March 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020; March 31, 2020 to
March 31, 2021; and calculated in the same manner for the subsequent years with
the final and fifth year CPI percentage measured from March 31, 2023 to March
31, 2024.
   C.   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this code, license fees imposed
in this chapter will be increased by a minimum of one cent ($0.01) every two
(2) calendar years. (Ord. 1439, 4-13-2010; amd. Ord. 1643, 12-13-2022)

      4.   Tax Credit: Notwithstanding the foregoing, a credit shall be granted
against the tax imposed by this section whenever a business subject to the tax

preceding the year in which the tax is due. The credit shall be applied to the
business registration tax due for the following year. The credit shall be equal
to fifty percent (50%) of the portion of the sales and/or use tax generated

a business which increases the amount of sales and use tax revenue received by

subject to approval by the city manager. Said credit shall be applied to the
business license tax owed in the next fiscal year only; provided, that, in no
event, shall the credit exceed the amount of business license tax owed.
         a.   Calculation Of Baseline: For the purposes of this subsection, the
"baseline" for a business shall be calculated as follows:
            (1)   For the first fiscal year in which a credit is granted, the
"baseline" shall equal the sum of sales and use tax received by the city from
the business and its activities and the business license tax imposed by the
city in the prior fiscal year.
            (2)   For each subsequent fiscal year, the baseline amount
established under subsection A5a(1) of this section shall be recalculated as
follows: the sales and use tax component of the baseline shall be adjusted to
reflect any increase from the prior fiscal year in the consumer price index as
established in the report of consumer prices for all urban consumers for the
Los Angeles-Anaheim- Riverside standard metropolitan statistical area. Said
adjustment shall be based on the most recent month for which such price index
figure is available on the date the adjustment is calculated. The business
license tax component of the baseline shall be recalculated to equal the amount
of business license tax imposed on the business under the fee schedule in
effect at the time the recalculation is made, including any automatic increase
established under this code; provided, that, in no event, shall the amount of
business license tax be less than the amount under subsection A5a(1) of this
section.
         b.   Eligibility: A business is not eligible to receive any business
license tax credits under this subsection A5 while the business is receiving a
business license tax credit under section
3-2-4 of this code.
         c.   Business Relation Program: The business license tax credit
established under this subsection A5 shall be known as the business relation
program of the city.

contractor and persons employed by the independent contractor, unless the

has a valid city business license as prescribed in chapter 1 of this title and
this chapter.
   C.   Number Of Employees Determined: The total number of employees for each
business for purposes of this section shall be determined by averaging the
total number of employees employed by each business during each of the four (4)
calendar quarters preceding the date the tax is paid.
   D.   Floor Area Defined: For the purpose of this section, "floor area" means
the total floor space in terms of square footage occupied by an owner, lessee
or renter in a building except:
      1.   Elevator shafts;
      2.   Stairwells;

4-2-5: NEW BUSINESSES:
   A.   Initial Tax: Any business not specifically mentioned or classified in
this chapter which is locating, or doing business in the city for the first
time shall, before receiving a business license from the city, pay the tax
imposed by section
4-2-4 of this chapter. The amount of said tax shall be calculated based upon
the taxpayer's best estimate of the average quarterly number of employees,
square feet, and business locations which the business will have within the
city the remainder of that calendar year.
   B.   Adjustment: Each new business shall, upon renewal of its business
license in the first full year following the year it began doing business in

actual figures and, if the resulting amount is greater than the actual tax paid

FORTUNETELLING
SECTION:
4-9-1: Purpose And Findings
4-9-2: Definitions
4-9-3: Permit Required
4-9-4: Permit Application
4-9-5: Investigation
4-9-6: Hearing And Decision By Licensing Authority
4-9-7: Approval Of Permit

4-9-10: Posting Of Information And Fees
4-9-11: Receipts
4-9-12: Client's Record Of Consultation
4-9-13: Exceptions
4-9-1: PURPOSE AND FINDINGS:
   A.   The practice of "fortunetelling", as defined in this Chapter, has
historically been subject to abuse by certain unscrupulous practitioners using
the practice to commit fraud and larceny upon clients.
   B.   It is the purpose of this Chapter to regulate the practice of
fortunetelling in such a manner as to reduce the risk of fraud and larceny to
clients while allowing fortunetellers to provide their services to clients with
only minimal restrictions.
   C.   The provisions of this Chapter requiring a permit, posting of fees,
providing receipts and allowing client recordation of the consultation, will
make it more difficult for an unscrupulous fortuneteller to commit fraud or
larceny, and yet, as informational regulations, will not affect the nature of
the information conveyed by the fortuneteller nor the manner in which it is
conveyed. These regulations require only minimal expense and effort on the part
of the fortuneteller and will not, therefore, impose any undue burden on their
practices.
   D.   "Fortunetelling" for entertainment purposes, as defined in this
Chapter, does not create the same risk of fraud and larceny by an unscrupulous
practitioner as would the practice with an individual client because it is done
with a group at a public place for the purpose of entertaining and not to deal
with the private concerns of an individual.
   E.   For these and other reasons, the provisions of this Chapter are
necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community. (Ord.
1080, 2-4-1986)

This Chapter shall be known as the Cannabis Business Tax Ordinance. This
Chapter shall be applicable in the City of El Segundo, California which shall
be referred to herein as "City." (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-2: AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE:
The purpose of this Chapter is to adopt a tax, for revenue purposes, pursuant
to Sections 37101, and 37100.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, upon cannabis
and hemp businesses that engage in business in the City. The Cannabis Business
Tax is levied based upon business gross receipts except for commercial cannabis
cultivation or commercial industrial hemp cultivation which shall be taxed on
square footage. It is not a sales and use tax, a tax upon income, or a tax upon
real property and shall not be calculated or assessed as such. The Cannabis
Business Tax shall not be separately identified or otherwise specifically
assessed or charged to any member, customer, patient, or caretaker. The
Cannabis Business Tax is a general tax enacted solely for general, governmental
purposes of the City and not for specific purposes. All of the proceeds from
the tax imposed by this Chapter shall be placed in the City's general fund and
be available for any lawful City purpose. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-3: INTENT:
The intent of this Chapter is to levy a tax on all cannabis or industrial hemp
businesses that operate in the City, regardless of whether such business would
have been legal at the time this chapter was adopted. Nothing in this Chapter
shall be interpreted to authorize or permit any business activity that would
not otherwise be legal or permissible under laws applicable to the activity at
the time the activity is undertaken. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)

using a methodology approved by the Tax Administrator. However, the following
shall be excluded from Gross Receipts:
   1.   Cash discounts were allowed and taken on sales;
   2.   Any tax required by law to be included in or added to the purchase
price and collected from the consumer or purchaser;

portion of such amounts excluded as uncollectible are subsequently collected,

are recovered;

forfeited and taken into income of the business shall not be excluded;
   8.   Amounts collected for others where the business is acting as an agent
or trustee and to the extent that such amounts are paid to those for whom
collected. These agents or trustees must provide the Tax Administrator with the

   10.   Payments made by the tax-reporting cannabis business (Seller) to a
cannabis business (Buyer) for the difference in the original acquisition price
and subsequent renegotiated or finalized selling price of products or services
sold to a specific end customer. This type of transaction is referred to as a
"Billback". The tax-reporting cannabis business must provide supporting
documentation to substantiate the transaction in order to be eligible for an
exemption.
   11.   Any business which sells industrial hemp and/or hemp products or
offers services or activities related to industrial hemp or hemp products and /
or which is not required to obtain a cannabis or industrial hemp permit or
license from the City or the State for the purpose of cultivating, growing,
drying, curing, manufacturing, processing, packaging, transporting,
distributing, testing or selling of industrial hemp either wholesale or retail
shall be exempt from the cannabis tax provided that such business does not
generate more than 50% of their total gross receipts in the reporting period
from the business from industrial hemp activities. However, the exemption may
be amended by the City Council by resolution or ordinance pursuant to Section
4-17-5 (B) to increase or decrease the percentage of the business's hemp and/or
hemp products gross receipts reporting from zero to 100%. To the extent the
gross receipts from the hemp activities do not meet the relevant percentage to
be included, this exclusion shall reduce the gross receipts to zero for the
sole purpose of calculating the cannabis tax.

L. having no more than three-tenths of 1% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contained

manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds
or resin produced therefrom. However, should the federal or state legislative

ordinance of the City Council pursuant to Section

product, intended to be sold or sold for use pursuant to the Compassionate Use

NURSERY: A facility or part of a facility that is used only for producing
clones, immature plants, seeds, and other agricultural products used
specifically for the planting, propagation, and cultivation of cannabis or
industrial hemp.
NON-ARM’S LENGTH TRANSACTION: A transaction that does not meet the definition
of an "arm's length transaction." In other words, the transaction is not a sale
entered into in good faith and that reflects fair market value in the open
market. One example of a non-arm's length transaction would be when a
cultivator sells cannabis goods to a cannabis distributor at a sales price that
is lower than what the same cultivator would to other cannabis distributors, or
which does not reflect the fair market value in the open market.

cannabis, cannabis products, industrial hemp and/or industrial hemp products

business license, permit, or certificate to operate lawfully in the City or is
operating unlawfully. The City's acceptance of a cannabis business tax payment
from a cannabis business operating illegally shall not constitute the City's

the rate of the cannabis business tax, including the initial rate of cannabis
business tax. The City Council may, by resolution or ordinance, increase or

rate of the medicinal cannabis business tax, independent of other cannabis
business tax activities. In addition, the City Council may, by resolution or
ordinance, increase or decrease the rate of the cannabis business tax on hemp
or hemp products, including the initial rate of the tax on hemp or hemp
products independent of other cannabis activities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the City Council repeal this tax or set any
adjusted rate that exceeds the maximum rates calculated pursuant to this
chapter.

a facility that uses a combination of natural and supplemental lighting as
defined in Section

nursery.
         b.   On January 1, 2026 and on each January 1, thereafter, the maximum

the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI") for consumers in
the Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County area as published by the United States
Government Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, no CPI adjustment resulting in
a decrease of any tax imposed by this subsection shall be made.

ten percent (10%) of gross receipts.
   D.   Persons subject to the cannabis business tax shall register with the

Council.
   C.   The cannabis business tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid, in
arrears, on a monthly basis. Each person owing a cannabis business tax shall on
or before the last day of the month following the close of each month file with
the Tax Administrator a statement ("tax statement") of the tax owed for that
calendar month and the basis for calculating that tax. The Tax Administrator
may require that the tax statement be submitted on a form prescribed by the Tax
Administrator. The tax for each calendar month shall be due and payable on the
same date that the tax statement is due.
   D.   Upon cessation of a cannabis business, tax statements and payments
shall be immediately due for all calendar months up through the calendar month

taken pursuant to Section
4-17-16 of this chapter against both the seller and/or buyer in an amount to be
determined by the Tax Administrator.
   F.   The Tax Administrator may, at his or her discretion, establish
alternative reporting and payment periods for any taxpayer as the Tax
Administrator deems necessary to ensure effective collection of the cannabis
business tax. The Tax Administrator may also require that a deposit, to be
applied against the taxes for a calendar month, be made by a taxpayer at the
beginning of that calendar month. In no event shall the deposit required by the
Tax Administrator exceed the tax amount he or she projects will be owed by the
taxpayer for the calendar month. The Tax Administrator may require that a
taxpayer make payments via a cashier's check, money order, wire transfer, or
similar instrument. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)

the next regular business day on which the City is open to the public. (Ord.
1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-8: PAYMENT -- WHEN TAXES DEEMED DELINQUENT:

the taxes required to be paid pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed
delinquent if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before the due date

4-17-6 and
4-17-7. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-9: NOTICE NOT REQUIRED BY CITY:
The City may as a courtesy send a tax notice to the cannabis business which
owes the City a cannabis business tax. However, the Tax Administrator is not
required to send a delinquency or other notice or bill to any person subject to
the provisions of this chapter. Failure to send such notice or bill shall not
affect the validity of any tax or penalty due under the provisions of this
chapter. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-10: PENALTIES AND INTEREST:
   A.   Any person who fails or refuses to pay any cannabis business tax
required to be paid pursuant to this chapter on or before the due date shall
pay penalties and interest as follows:
      1.   A penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax, in
addition to the amount of the tax, plus interest on the unpaid tax calculated
from the due date of the tax at the rate of one percent (1%) per month.
      2.   If the tax remains unpaid for a period exceeding one calendar month

any fees, penalties, and interest as provided for in this chapter, and any
other amount allowed under state law.
   C.   The Tax Administrator may waive the penalties imposed upon any person
under this Section 4-17-10 if:
      1.   The person requests a waiver of penalties by submitting a written
request for waiver to the Tax Administrator no later than June 30 of the second
fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the tax became delinquent; and
      2.   The person provides evidence satisfactory to the Tax Administrator
that the failure to pay timely was due to circumstances beyond the control of
the person and occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care and in
the absence of willful neglect; and the person paid the delinquent taxes,
penalties, accrued interest, and fees owed prior to applying to the Tax
Administrator for a waiver.
   D.   The waiver provisions specified in Section 4-17-10 (C) shall not apply
to interest accrued on the delinquent taxes and a waiver shall be granted only
once during any twenty-four (24) month period. The Tax Administrator's decision
on a request for a waiver of penalties is final and conclusive and not subject
to appeal under Section
4-17-15. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-11: REFUNDS AND CREDITS:
   A.   No refund shall be made of any tax collected pursuant to this chapter,
except as provided in Section
4-17-12.
   B.   No refund of any tax collected pursuant to this chapter shall be made
because of the discontinuation, dissolution, or other termination of a
business. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-12: REFUNDS AND PROCEDURES:
   A.   Whenever the amount of any cannabis business tax, penalty or interest
has been overpaid, paid more than once, or has been erroneously collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded to the claimant who
paid the tax provided that a written claim for refund signed under the penalty
of perjury is filed with the Tax Administrator within one (1) year of the date
the tax was originally due or paid, whichever came first. A person may only
file a claim for refund if the person paid the tax. No person shall be entitled
to a refund unless the person can support the claim by written records
sufficient to show entitlement thereto. The Tax Administrator's decision on a
claim for refund is final and conclusive and not subject to appeal under
Section
4-17-15.
   B.   The Tax Administrator, his or her designee which may include a third
party, or any other City officer charged with the administration of this
chapter shall have the right to examine and audit all the books and business
records of the claimant in order to determine the eligibility of the claimant
to the claimed refund. No claim for refund shall be allowed if the claimant
refuses to allow such examination of claimant's books and business records
after requested by the Tax Administrator to do so. The Tax Administrator may
collect a fee adopted by resolution by the City Council to pay for the cost of
examination and audit should the books and records be provided in a form
insufficient to allow the Tax Administrator to make a determination on the
claim for refund.
   C.   In the event that the cannabis business tax was erroneously paid in an
amount in excess of the tax due, and the error is attributable to the City, the
City shall refund the amount of tax erroneously paid; provided that (i) a claim
for refund has been timely filed with the Tax Administrator; and (ii) the
refund cannot exceed, under any circumstance, the amount of tax overpaid during
the twelve (12) months preceding the last month for which the claim states the
tax was overpaid. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-13: PERSONAL CULTIVATION NOT TAXED:
The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to personal cannabis cultivation
or personal use of cannabis, to the extent those activities are authorized in
the "Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act," as may be
amended. This chapter shall not apply to personal use of cannabis that is
specifically exempted from state licensing requirements, that meets the
definition of personal use or equivalent terminology under state law, and
provided that the individual receives no compensation whatsoever related to
that personal cultivation or use. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-14: ADMINISTRATION OF THE TAX:
   A.   It shall be the duty of the Tax Administrator to collect the taxes,
interest, penalties, fees, and perform the duties required by this chapter.
   B.   For purposes of administration and enforcement of this chapter
generally, the Tax Administrator may from time to time promulgate such
administrative interpretations, rules, and procedures consistent with the
purpose, intent, and express terms of this chapter as he or she deems necessary
to implement or clarify such provisions or aid in enforcement.
   C.   The Tax Administrator may take such administrative actions as needed to

      2.   Provide information to any taxpayer concerning the provisions of

      5.   Assess penalties and interest to taxpayers pursuant to this chapter;
      6.   Determine amounts owed under and enforce collection pursuant to this

4-17-15: APPEAL PROCEDURE:
A taxpayer aggrieved by a decision of the Tax Administrator with respect to the
amount of tax, interest, penalties, and fees, if any, due under this chapter
may appeal only if a hearing was requested and attended pursuant to Section
4-17-25. An appeal may be made by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk
within thirty (30) calendar days of the serving or mailing of the Tax
Administrator's decision of the amount due. Upon receipt of a timely notice of
appeal, the City Clerk, or his or her designee, shall fix a time and place for
hearing such appeal with a hearing officer or other appointed body by the City
Council. The City Clerk, or his or her designee, shall give at least ten (10)
calendar days' notice of the appeal hearing in writing to such taxpayer at the
last known place of address. The hearing officer shall render a written
decision that shall be served on the taxpayer at the last known place of
address. The decision of the hearing officer shall be final and conclusive. Any
amount found to be due by the hearing officer shall be immediately due and
payable upon the service of the decision. If no notice of appeal is filed
within the time prescribed in this Section, the Tax Administrator's decision
with respect to the amount of tax, interest, penalties, and fees due is final
and conclusive. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-16: ENFORCEMENT -- ACTION TO COLLECT:
   A.    Any taxes, interest, penalties, and/or fees required to be paid under
the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed to the City. Any
person owing money to the City under the provisions of this chapter shall be
liable in an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such
debt. The provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed a limitation upon the
right of the City to bring any other action including criminal, civil and
equitable actions, based upon the failure to pay the tax, interest, penalties,
and/or fees imposed by this chapter or the failure to comply with any of the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-17: APPORTIONMENT:
If a person subject to the tax is operating both within the City and outside
the City, it is the intent of the City to apply the cannabis business tax so
that the measure of the tax fairly reflects the proportion of the taxed
activity actually carried on in the City. To the extent federal or state law
requires that any tax due from any taxpayer be apportioned, the taxpayer may
indicate said apportionment on his or her tax return. The Tax Administrator may
promulgate administrative procedures for apportionment as he or she finds
useful or necessary. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-18: CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY:
This tax is intended to be applied in a manner consistent with the United
States and California Constitutions and state law. None of the tax provided for
by this chapter shall be applied in a manner that causes an undue burden upon
interstate commerce, a violation of the equal protection or due process clauses
of the Constitutions of the United States or the State of California or a
violation of any other provision of the California Constitution or state law.
If a person believes that the tax, as applied to him or her, is impermissible
under applicable law, he or she may request that the Tax Administrator release
him or her from the obligation to pay the impermissible portion of the tax.
(Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-19: AUDIT AND EXAMINATION OF PREMISES AND RECORDS:
   A.   For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of cannabis business tax
owed or verifying any representations made by any taxpayer to the City in
support of his or her tax calculation, the Tax Administrator or his/her
designees which may include a third party shall have the power to inspect any
location where commercial cannabis activity occurs and to audit and examine all
books and records (including, but not limited to bookkeeping records, access to
space utilized for cannabis related activities, METRC data, and/or point-of-
sale data, state and/or federal income tax returns, excise tax returns, and
other records relating to the gross receipts of the business) of persons
engaged in cannabis businesses. In conducting such investigation, the Tax
Administrator, or his/her designees which may include a third party shall have
the power to inspect space utilized for cannabis related activities, any
equipment or software, such as computers, software systems, platforms, and
databases (including METRC), and/or point of sale systems, to include any keys
or access codes for access to and use of the equipment and/or software, that
may contain such records.
   B.   It shall be the duty of every person liable for the collection and
payment to the City of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve,
for a period of at least three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to
determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the
collection of and payment to the City, which records the Tax Administrator or
his/her designee, which may include a third party, shall have the right to
inspect at all reasonable times. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-20: OTHER LICENSES, PERMITS, TAXES, FEES, OR CHARGES:
   A.   Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to repeal, amend, be
in lieu of, replace or in any way affect any requirements for any commercial
cannabis permit, City license, permit, or other certificate required by, under
or by virtue of any provision of any other Chapter of this code or any other
ordinance or resolution of the City, nor be deemed to repeal, amend, be in lieu
of, replace or in any way affect any tax, fee or other charge imposed, assessed
or required under any other Chapter of this code or any other ordinance or
resolution of the City. Any references made or contained in any other Chapter
of this code to any licenses, permits, certificates, taxes, fees, or charges,
or to any schedule of license, permit, certificate, or fees, shall be deemed to
refer to the licenses, permits or certificates, and their respective taxes,
fees or charges, or schedule of fees, provided for in other Chapters of this
code.
   B.   A commercial cannabis permit issued under the El Segundo Municipal Code
may be revoked, suspended or not renewed in the event that the business holding
that permit has failed to (i) make a deposit required by the Tax Administrator
pursuant to Section
4-17-6 or (ii) timely pay all taxes, interest and penalties owed by that
business under this chapter. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-21: PAYMENT OF TAX DOES NOT AUTHORIZE UNLAWFUL BUSINESS:
   A.   The payment of a cannabis business tax required by this chapter, and
its acceptance by the City, shall not entitle any person to carry on any
cannabis business unless the person has complied with all of the requirements
of this code and all other applicable state laws.
   B.   No tax paid under the provisions of this chapter shall be construed as
authorizing the conduct or continuance of any illegal or unlawful business, or
any business in violation of any local or state law. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-22: DEFICIENCY DETERMINATIONS:
If the Tax Administrator is not satisfied that any statement filed as required
under the provisions of this chapter is correct, or that the amount of tax is
correctly computed, he or she may compute and determine the amount to be paid
and make a deficiency determination upon the basis of the facts contained in
the statement or upon the basis of any information in his or her possession or
that may come into his or her possession within three (3) years of the date the
tax was originally due and payable. One or more deficiency determinations of
the amount of tax due for a period or periods may be made. When a person
discontinues engaging in a cannabis business, a deficiency determination may be
made at any time within three (3) years thereafter as to any liability arising
from engaging in such cannabis business whether or not a deficiency
determination is issued prior to the date the tax would otherwise be due.
Whenever a deficiency determination is made, a notice shall be given to the
person concerned in the same manner as notices of assessment are given under
Sections
4-17-24 and
4-17-25. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-23: FAILURE TO REPORT -- NONPAYMENT, FRAUD:
   A.   Under any of the following circumstances, the Tax Administrator may
make and give notice of an assessment of the amount of tax owed by a person
under this chapter at any time:
      1.   If the person has not filed a complete statement required under the
provisions of this chapter;
      2.   If the person has not paid the tax due under the provisions of this
chapter;
      3.   If the person has not, after demand by the Tax Administrator, filed
a corrected statement, or furnished to the Tax Administrator adequate
substantiation of the information contained in a statement already filed, or
paid any additional amount of tax due under the provisions of this chapter; or
      4.   If the Tax Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any
cannabis business tax due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of
twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in
addition to penalties and interest otherwise payable under this chapter and any
other penalties allowed by law.
   B.   The notice of assessment shall separately set forth the amount of any
tax known by the Tax Administrator to be due or estimated by the Tax
Administrator, after consideration of all information within the Tax
Administrator's knowledge concerning the business and activities of the person
assessed, to be due under each applicable provision of this chapter and shall
include the amount of any penalties or interest accrued on each amount to the
date of the notice of assessment. The notice shall state that the person has
thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the notice to make a written request
for an informal hearing before the Tax Administrator. The notice shall also
state that if the person fails to timely request an informal hearing within the
time allowed, the amount determined by the Tax Administrator is final and
conclusive and is immediately due and payable. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-24: TAX ASSESSMENT -- NOTICE REQUIREMENTS:
The notice of assessment shall be served upon the person either by personal
delivery, by overnight delivery by a nationally-recognized courier service, or
by a deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon,
addressed to the person at the address of the location of the business or to
such other address as he or she shall register with the Tax Administrator for
the purpose of receiving notices provided under this chapter; or, should the
person have no address registered with the Tax Administrator for such purpose,
then to such person's last known address. For the purpose of Section 4-17-24, a
service by overnight delivery shall be deemed to have occurred one (1) calendar
day following deposit with a courier and service by mail shall be deemed to
have occurred three (3) days following deposit in the United States mail. (Ord.
1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-25: TAX ASSESSMENT -- HEARING, APPLICATION, AND DETERMINATION:
Within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of service of the notice of
assessment the person may apply in writing to the Tax Administrator for an
informal hearing on the assessment. If application for an informal hearing is
not made within the time herein prescribed, the tax assessed by the Tax
Administrator shall become final and conclusive. Within thirty (30) calendar
days of the receipt of any such application for an informal hearing, the Tax
Administrator shall cause the matter to be set for an informal hearing before
him or her, or his/her designee, no later than thirty (30) calendar days after
the receipt of the application, unless a later date is agreed to by the Tax
Administrator and the person requesting the informal hearing. Notice of such
informal hearing shall be given by the Tax Administrator to the person
requesting such informal hearing no later than five (5) calendar days prior to
such informal hearing. A hearing under this section shall be informal and need
not follow any formal rules of evidence. At such hearing said applicant may
appear and offer evidence why the assessment as made by the Tax Administrator
should not be confirmed and fixed as the tax due. After such hearing the Tax
Administrator shall determine and reassess (if necessary) the proper amount of
tax, interest, penalties, and fees to be charged and shall give written notice
of the decision to the person in the manner prescribed in Section
4-17-24 for giving notice of assessment. No appeal of a notice of assessment
may be made under Section
4-17-15 unless an informal hearing is timely requested and the person attends
the hearing. If the person fails to appear at the informal hearing, the amount
due determined by the Tax Administrator in the notice of assessment is final
and conclusive. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-26: RELIEF FROM TAXES -- DISASTER RELIEF:
   A.   If a person is unable to comply with any tax requirement imposed under
this chapter due to a disaster impacting its cannabis business, the person may
notify the Tax Administrator of its inability to comply and request relief from
the tax requirement. For purposes of this chapter, "disaster" means fire,
flood, storm, tidal wave, earthquake, or similar public calamity resulting in
physical damage to real property, whether or not resulting from natural causes.
   B.   The person shall provide any information required by the Tax
Administrator including, without limitation, why relief is requested, the time
period for which the relief is requested, and the reason relief is needed for
the specific amount of time. The person agrees to grant the Tax Administrator
or his/her designee access to the location where the cannabis business has been
impacted due to a disaster.
   C.   The Tax Administrator, in his/her sole discretion, may provide relief
from the cannabis business tax requirement for businesses whose operations have
been impacted by a disaster if such tax relief does not exceed ten thousand
($10,000.00) dollars. Such temporary relief may be granted for a reasonable
amount of time, in the Tax Administrator's sole discretion, and the amount and
duration of relief should be based upon how long it would reasonably take for
the cannabis business to recover from the disaster. The Tax Administrator may
require that the cannabis business follow certain conditions to receive
temporary relief from the cannabis business tax requirement. The Tax
Administrator's decision on a request for relief and the conditions that may be
imposed for relief under this section are final and conclusive and not subject
to appeal under Section
4-17-15. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-27: CONVICTION FOR VIOLATION -- TAXES NOT WAIVED:
The conviction and punishment of any person for failure to pay the required tax
shall not excuse or exempt such person from any civil action for the tax debt
unpaid at the time of such conviction. No civil action shall prevent a criminal
prosecution for any violation of the provisions of this chapter or of any state
law requiring the payment of all taxes. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-28: VIOLATION DEEMED MISDEMEANOR:
Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-29: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision of this chapter, or its application to any person or
circumstance, is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unlawful, unenforceable, or otherwise void, that determination shall have no
effect on any other provision of this chapter or the application of this
chapter to any other person or circumstance and, to that end, the provisions
hereof are severable. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-30: REMEDIES CUMULATIVE:
All remedies and penalties prescribed by this Chapter, or which are available
under any other provision of this code and any other provision of law or equity
are cumulative. The use of one or more remedies by the City shall not bar the
use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this
Chapter. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)
4-17-31: AMENDMENT OR MODIFICATION:
Except as set forth in this section, this chapter may be amended or modified
but not repealed by the City Council without a vote of the people. However, as
required by Article XIIIC of the California Constitution, voter approval is
required for any amendment that would expand, extend, or increase the rate of
any tax levied pursuant to this chapter beyond the maximums set forth in this
chapter. The people of the City of El Segundo affirm that the following actions
shall not constitute an increase of the rate of a tax:
   A.   The restoration or adjustment of the rate of the tax to a rate that is
no higher than that allowed by this Chapter, in those circumstances where,
among others, the City Council has previously acted to reduce the rate of the
tax or is incrementally implementing an increase authorized by this Chapter;
   B.   An action that interprets or clarifies (i) the methodology of applying
or calculating the tax or (ii) any definition applicable to the tax, so long as
the interpretation or clarification (even if contrary to some prior
interpretation or clarification) is not inconsistent with the provisions of
this Chapter; or
   C.   The collection of the tax imposed by this Chapter even if the City had,
for some period of time, failed to collect the tax. (Ord. 1644, 12-13-2022)

7-1-5: ABATEMENT AUTHORITY:
The city manager, or designee, is authorized to abate public nuisances
summarily or otherwise in the manner provided by this chapter. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-
2007)
7-1-6: GRAFFITI:
7-1-6-1: FINDINGS:
The city council finds as follows:
   A.   Graffiti on either public or private property, results in blight,
decreases property values and deprives surrounding residents and owners of the
right to comfortable enjoyment of life and property.
   B.   Graffiti is obnoxious, constitutes a public nuisance, and is a threat
to public safety which must be abated to prevent its proliferation.
   C.   Graffiti must be removed as quickly as possible to minimize harm to
persons and property in the community.
   D.   This section is intended to be complementary to, and not in conflict
with, Penal Code section 594, which provides that any person who maliciously
defaces property is guilty of vandalism, and Penal Code section 594.1, which
provides that certain activities involving the possession, sale and use of
aerosol paint containers are misdemeanors. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-6-2: POSSESSION PROHIBITED:
It is unlawful for any person to mark, apply, or etch graffiti on any structure
located on public or private real property within the city. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-
2007)
7-1-6-3: POSSESSION BY MINORS:
It is unlawful for any minor to possess any graffiti implement while on public
or private property without the consent of the property owner, or the person in
lawful possession or control of the property. Any law enforcement officer who
observes a violation of this section may take immediate possession of the
graffiti implements. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-6-4: POSSESSION IN DESIGNATED PUBLIC PLACES:
Except as may be authorized by the city manager, or designee, no person may
possess any graffiti implement while on any property owned or operated by the
city. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-6-5: POSSESSION WITH INTENT TO DEFACE, MARK OR DAMAGE PROPERTY:
It is unlawful for any person to possess any graffiti implement for the purpose
of defacing, marking, or damaging any public or private property without the
express consent of the property owner or the person in lawful possession or
control of the property. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-6-6: PARENTAL LIABILITY:
Any parent or other legal guardian of a minor is personally liable for any and
all graffiti removal costs associated with graffiti caused by the minor. This
section does not limit the amount of recovery against the parent or other legal
guardian for their own common law negligence. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-6-7: ACCESSIBILITY TO GRAFFITI IMPLEMENTS:
   A.   It is unlawful for any person to sell, give, or otherwise furnish any
graffiti implement to any minor without the consent of the minor's parent or
legal guardian. Evidence that a person, his or her employee, or agent, demanded
and was shown bona fide evidence of majority and acted upon such evidence of
majority in a transaction or sale is a defense to any criminal prosecution.
   B.   It is unlawful for any person to sell, permit to be sold, offer for
sale, or display for sale any graffiti implement by means of self-service
merchandising or by means other than vendor assisted sales. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-
2007)
7-1-6-8: AUTHORIZATION TO REMOVE:
Graffiti may be removed by any of the following methods:
   A.   Wherever the city manager, or designee, determines that graffiti, as
defined in this chapter, is located on public or privately owned property
within the city so as to be capable of being viewed by a person utilizing any
public right of way in the city, the city manager is authorized to provide for
the removal of the graffiti upon the following conditions:
      1.   If the graffiti is located on property owned by the city, the city
manager, or designee, may immediately remove the graffiti by any practicable
means.
      2.   Except as provided below, where a structure is privately owned, the
removal of graffiti may be authorized only after securing the consent of the
owner and the owner having executed a release and waiver approved as to form by
the city attorney.
   B.   Graffiti located on privately owned structures or privately owned real
property in the city and which can be viewed by a person utilizing any public
right of way within the city may be removed by the city at the owner's expense
as a public nuisance. This section applies under the following circumstances:
      1.   The private property owner persuaded, allowed or encouraged the
graffiti problem;
      2.   The private property owner's consent cannot be obtained; or
      3.   The city manager determines that the removal of graffiti or other
inscribed material from a privately owned property exceeded three (3)
occurrences per privately owned real property during one calendar year. (Ord.
1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-6-9: NOTICE TO ABATE GRAFFITI:
Whenever the city manager, or designee, determines that graffiti is located on
privately owned structures or privately owned real property in the city in
violation of this chapter, the city manager, or designee, may abate such public
nuisance in the manner set forth in section
7-1-7 of this chapter. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-6-10: RECOVERY OF COSTS FROM LANDOWNER:
The costs of graffiti abatement may be recovered as set forth in section
7-1-7 of this chapter. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-6-11: FAILURE TO REMOVE GRAFFITI UPON NOTICE:
In addition to any graffiti removal costs incurred by the city for the
abatement of graffiti from private property, failure to voluntarily abate
graffiti after notification will result in the penalties set out in this
chapter. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-6-12: RECOVERY OF COSTS FROM MINOR OR PARENT OR GUARDIAN:
   A.   If the city manager, or designee, abates graffiti in accord with this
chapter, the city may recover the graffiti removal costs by making such costs a
lien against the property of the minor creating, causing, or committing the
nuisance. Further, such costs may be recovered against the property of the
parent or guardian having custody or control of the minor up to and including
the sum of twenty five thousand dollars ($25,000.00).
   B.   For the purposes of this section, the terms "expense of abatement",
"graffiti" and "minor" have the same meaning set forth in Government Code
section 38772.
   C.   The cost recovery procedures against the property of a minor or a
parent or guardian of the minor are the same as set forth in section
7-1-7 of this chapter.
   D.   The graffiti removal costs are also a personal obligation of the minor
and his or her parent or legal guardian. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-6-13: COMMUNITY SERVICE:
   A.   After the conviction of any person for violation of this section, or
any state law pertaining to vandalism of property with a graffiti implement,
the city may petition the sentencing court to impose community service time,
pursuant to Penal Code section 640.6. The sentencing court may require the
performance of community service within the city in addition to any monetary
penalties imposed. In the event the sentencing court approves community
service, the city will request any adult or emancipated minor convicted of
vandalism, as defined by Penal Code section 594(a)(1), to:
      1.   Complete a minimum of twenty four (24) hours, but not more than
forty eight (48) hours, of community services cleaning up, removing and
repairing property damaged by graffiti for the first conviction; and
      2.   Complete forty eight (48) hours, but not more than ninety six (96)
hours of community services cleaning up, removing, and repairing property
damaged by graffiti for each subsequent conviction.
   B.   Any minor violating any provision of this chapter or any state law
pertaining to vandalism of property with a graffiti implement who is found to
be a person described in Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 by reason of
the commission of vandalism, may be required to perform community service time
pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 742.16. For any minor
adjudicated guilty of vandalism, the city will petition the juvenile court and
the court may, in addition to any other penalties imposed by the city, require
the unemancipated minor to provide the necessary labor to clean up, repair, or
replace defaced, damaged or destroyed property, or otherwise make restitution
to the property owner.
   C.   If a minor is personally unable to pay any fine levied for violating
any provision of this section or is otherwise unable to make restitution for
damages, the minor's parent or legal guardian is liable for payment of the fine
or restitution. If the parent or legal guardian cannot make restitution, the
sentencing court may waive payment of the fine or community service time by the
parent or legal guardian upon finding good cause. If the sentencing court
waives payment of the fine by the parent or legal guardian, the city will
petition the sentencing court, and the court, at the court's option, may order
the parent or legal guardian to provide the necessary labor, equal to the
number of hours assigned to the minor adjudicated guilty of violating any
provision of this chapter, to clean up, repair, or replace property damaged by
the unemancipated minor. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-6-14: SUSPENSION OR DELAY OF DRIVING PRIVILEGES:

violating this chapter, or any state law pertaining to vandalism of property
with a graffiti implement, the city may petition the sentencing court to
suspend driving privileges or delay the issuance of driving privileges in
accordance with Vehicle Code section 13202.6. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-6-15: PENALTY:
   A.   Any person who violates any provision of this chapter for which no
other penalty is otherwise provided is guilty of a misdemeanor.
   B.   Any person failing to remove graffiti within the prescribed time period
is guilty of an infraction and may be punished with a fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) for a first conviction, three hundred dollars ($300.00) for
the second conviction, and five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each subsequent
violation. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-7: NUISANCE ABATEMENT PROCEDURES:
7-1-7-1: ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE:
All or any part of a use or the condition of any property, including, without
limitation, any use, or improvement, found to constitute a public nuisance,
will be abated by rehabilitation, demolition, repair, cessation of use or a
combination thereof, or in such other manner as designated in a nuisance

nuisance. If this property is found to constitute a public nuisance as defined
by the El Segundo Municipal Code ("ESMC"), and if the public nuisance is not

then the City will abate the nuisance. If the City abates the nuisance, the
cost of these proceedings, all previous code enforcement efforts concerning
this condition of the property, and the cleaning, clearing, rehabilitation,

subject property and by registered or certified mail (postage fully prepaid)
addressed to the owner of the property at the address appearing on the last
equalized assessment roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is more current
before the hearing notice is mailed. The notice will be posted on the property
and mailed at least ten (10) days before the hearing date. Proof of posting and
mailing will be by declaration. Failure of any person to receive the notice
will not affect the validity of any provision set forth in this chapter. (Ord.
1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-7-4: HEARING PROCEDURE:
   A.   The hearing must be conducted by a hearing officer selected by the city
manager. At the time set for such hearing, the hearing officer will conduct a
hearing to determine, based upon the evidence presented, whether a public
nuisance exists on the subject property. At the hearing, the hearing officer
will accept reliable evidence from any person if such evidence bears on the
issue of whether a public nuisance exists on the subject property. The hearing
officer is authorized to take testimony and is authorized to administer oaths
or affirmations under the Code of Civil Procedure section 2093(a). Based upon
the evidence submitted including, without limitation, any written staff reports
regarding the alleged nuisance, the hearing officer will determine whether or
not a public nuisance exists on the subject property.
   B.   As soon as is practicable following the close of such hearing, the
hearing officer will render a decision on the matter. If a public nuisance is
found to exist, the hearing officer will issue an order requiring the abatement
of the public nuisance in a reasonable time and manner as set forth in the
order. The hearing officer will promptly give written notice to the responsible
person and any other interested person who requests, in writing, notice of such
decision, including, a copy of the order. The order issued by the hearing
officer will be deemed a final order and may be judicially reviewed pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.6. There is no right to a city council
appeal. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)

provisions of an abatement order. If the responsible person fails, for any
reason, to comply with an abatement order within the time required in the
order, the city manager, or designee, will cause the nuisance described in the
abatement order to be abated by city forces or by private contractor. The city
attorney is authorized to take such action as needed to gain entry upon the
property where the public nuisance exists for purposes of abating a public
nuisance. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-7-6: CITY EXPENSES; RECORD OF COSTS:
The department director or designee will keep an account of the costs,

   A.   The department director or designee will give notice of the cost of
abatement by registered or certified mail (postage fully prepaid) addressed to
the owner of the property at the address appearing on the last equalized
assessment roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is more current before
mailing of the cost notice. The cost notice will include a statement of the
hearing rights of the property owner concerning the cost of abatement. Upon
written request for a hearing by the property owner received by the city
manager within ten (10) days after mailing the cost notice, a hearing will be
held by the city manager, or designee, on the question of the cost of the
abatement.
   B.   Notice of the hearing will be mailed at least ten (10) days before the
hearing by registered or certified mail, to the owner of the land. The city
manager or designee will either confirm the cost of abatement or modify such
amount. The decision of the city manager or designee is final. The city manager
or designee will give notice of the decision on the cost of abatement by
registered or certified mail to the property owner. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-7-8: NUISANCE ABATEMENT LIEN AND SPECIAL ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES:
   A.   Lien: Pursuant to Government Code sections 38773, 38773.1, and 38773.5,
and any successor statutes, persons failing to abate a public nuisance as
ordered pursuant to this chapter, will be obligated to pay all city expenses of
abating the nuisance and all administrative costs associated therewith. A
nuisance abatement lien in favor of the city for such expenses of the city will
be created and recorded, pursuant to this section, against the property on
which the nuisance is maintained. The lien will specify the amount of the lien,
the name of the city, the date of the abatement order, the street address,
legal description and assessor's parcel number of the parcel on which the lien
is imposed, and the name and address of the recorded owner of the parcel.
   B.   Notice Of Proposed Recordings: Notice will be sent by certified mail at
least ten (10) days before recording the lien, an itemized notice of the lien
amount and proposed recording will be sent by certified mail to the property
owner of record of the parcel of land on which the nuisance was abated by the
city, based on the last equalized assessment roll or the supplemental roll,
whichever is more current before recordation of the lien. The notice will be
served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action in accordance with
Code of Civil Procedure section 415.10, et seq. If the owner of record, after
diligent search, cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy
thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten (10) days,
and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in the
county in which the property is located.
   C.   Recording: The city's nuisance abatement lien will then be recorded in
the Los Angeles County recorder's office, and from the date of recording, will
have the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien.
   D.   Special Assessment: The city's total costs described in this section
may also be collected as a special assessment against the lot or parcel on
which the nuisance existed. After recordation of the nuisance abatement lien
the city may provide a copy of the notice of proposed recordation, proof of
service, and the recorded lien to the tax collector and the tax collector will
add the described special assessment payments to the next regular tax bill
levied against the respective lots or parcels and the amounts will be collected
and subject to the same penalties and the same procedure under foreclosure and
sale as in the case of tax delinquencies. However, if any real property to
which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona
fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrance for value has
been created and attached thereon, before the date on which the first
installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement
will not result in a lien against the real property but instead will be
transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.
   E.   Satisfaction: In the event that the lien or special assessment is
discharged, released, or satisfied, either through payment or foreclosure, a
notice of the discharge containing the information specified in the lien will
be recorded by the city.
   F.   Fees: Any fees incurred by the city for processing, recording of the
lien and providing notice to the property owner may be recovered by the city as
part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-7-9: ORDER FOR TREBLE COSTS OF ABATEMENT:
Upon entry of a second or subsequent civil or criminal judgment within a two
(2) year period finding that an owner of property is responsible for a
condition that may be abated in accordance with this chapter, except conditions
abated pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 17980, the court may order
the owner to pay treble the costs of the abatement. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-7-10: JUDICIAL REMEDIES:
   A.   Nothing in this chapter will be deemed to prevent the city attorney
from:
      1.   Commencing a civil action in the superior court to enforce all or
any of the provisions of any abatement order;
      2.   Commencing a civil action to abate a public nuisance as an
alternative to or in conjunction with an administrative proceeding pursuant to
this chapter;
      3.   Filing a civil action to recover the amount of a confirmed
accounting from an owner or occupant of the lot to which it relates; or
      4.   Filing a criminal action to enforce this code.
   B.   Where a civil action is filed, if the court issues an order or a
judgment which finds a public nuisance to exist, and orders or approves the
abatement of the public nuisance, or where the court validates an accounting,
the court will also award the city its actual costs of abatement, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorney fees incurred by the city in such
judicial proceeding. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)
7-1-7-11: EMERGENCY ABATEMENT:
Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, whenever the city manager, or
designee, determines that a public nuisance, as defined in this chapter, or in
any other applicable law, exists upon a lot, and that such public nuisance
constitutes an immediate threat or hazard or danger to persons or property, the
city manager, without observing procedures set forth in this chapter with
reference to public nuisance abatement, will forthwith immediately cause the
abatement of such public nuisance in such manner as the city manager, or
designee, determines is reasonably required. If the city manager, or designee,
deems it feasible, the city manager, or designee, will attempt to give the
owner and occupant, verbal notice of the existence of the public nuisance, and
the proposed timing and method of abatement thereof. The city manager will,
forthwith, report such circumstances to the city council. Where such abatement
is ordered by the city manager, person abating such nuisance will, after
completing the abatement of the public nuisance, comply with the provisions of
this chapter. (Ord. 1407, 8-7-2007)

threaten public safety. All such activities detrimentally affect the neighbors
that surround these nuisances.

crimes against persons, public peace and property. The City has, both now and

actions.

that occur as a consequence of unruly gatherings (for example, driving while
intoxicated, increased social violence, and incidents of sexual assault) are
also disproportionately greater than what is required within the City's
jurisdiction.
   D.   It is in the public interest to establish procedures for recovering
costs incurred by the City when enforcing any provision of this Code through
inspections, nuisance abatement, or other similar, administrative or judicial
means.
   E.   Nothing contained in this chapter is intended to, nor will it,
interfere with any California law provision that regulates activities
identified by this chapter; it is intended only to enact measures that are
different from, or supplement, California law to further restrict acts
associated with loud or unruly gatherings. (Ord. 1568, 6-19-2018)

approval of the Police Chief or designee to perform community service, the
responsible person/adult must complete the required hours within one year of
approval and must submit proof of completion to the Police Chief or designee.
Failure to receive approval to perform community service or failure to complete
the required hours of service will result in the imposition of the applicable
civil penalty, which is immediately payable. No reduction in the penalty is

unless approved by the City Manager or designee. Community service will only be

lacks significant literary, artistic, political, educational, or scientific
value for minors. When it appears from the nature of the matter or the
circumstances of its dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it is

9-4-16: UNIFORM NEWSRACKS:

requesting notice, or whose name and address appears on an existing newsrack in
the subject location, and after such hearing must find that the location
carries a substantial volume of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, that uniform
newsracks are feasible at the location, and that it is in the public interest
for such newsracks.
   B.   The resolution must describe the location; designate the particular
point(s) at that location where uniform newsracks may be installed; specify the
maximum number of uniform newsracks to be allowed at the location; and specify
the style, size, color or other attributes required of uniform newsracks at the
location. Such specification should not require uniform newsracks made by any
particular manufacturer. The resolution may direct the administrator to install
a kiosk(s), pedestal(s), or other support structure to accommodate a stated
number of newsracks.
   C.   No person may install a uniform newsrack at a uniform newsrack location
without first obtaining a uniform newsrack permit from the administrator.

adjudicated to be newspapers of general circulation in the city of El Segundo
in accordance with Government Code section 6020 et seq., when applicable law
requires the city to publish its legal notices in such newspapers.
      2.   The administrator will give second priority to all other newspapers
that are not adjudicated to be newspapers of general circulation within the
city of El Segundo.
   B.   Should there be a conflict between newspapers within the same priority
seeking the same uniform newsrack location, and there are insufficient uniform
newsrack locations to accommodate the competing newspapers after first filling
as many uniform newsrack locations as possible by utilizing the criteria set
forth above, then the administrator will assign uniform newsrack locations at
random by placing the names of all applicants for the remaining spaces at a
uniform newsrack location into a container from which the names will be drawn
one at a time until the remaining uniform newsrack locations are assigned. Such
drawing is open to the public at a time and date designated by the
administrator.
   C.   Applications remaining after assignment of all uniform newsrack
locations must be denied. Where fewer applications are received than the
maximum number of spaces allowed by the resolution, permits for the remaining
spaces may be allotted on a first come, first served basis.
   D.   Annually, during December, the administrator must use the above
criteria for assigning uniform newsrack locations if the priorities of
newspapers change; newsracks are abandoned; or permittees fail to renew a
permit. (Ord. 1375, 4-6-2004)

not limited to, by forced or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation,
receivership, or other means without the prior written consent of the grantor,
and then only under such reasonable conditions as the grantor may establish.
Such consent as required by the grantor shall be given or denied no later than
ninety (90) days following any request, and shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   B.   Ownership Or Control: The grantee shall promptly notify in writing the
grantor of any proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other
party of, control of the grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not
limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever
manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has
occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or transfer by any person or group of
persons of ten percent (10%) or more of the beneficial ownership interest of
the grantee. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the grantee
shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the grantor
shall have consented in writing thereto, which consent shall be given or denied
no later than ninety (90) days following any request, and shall not be
unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent
to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the grantor may inquire
into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee
shall assist the grantor in any such inquiry.
In seeking the grantor's consent to any change in ownership or control, the
grantee shall have the responsibility:
      1.   To show to the satisfaction of the grantor whether the proposed
purchaser, transferee, or assignee (the "proposed transferee"), which in the
case of a corporation, shall include all directors and all persons having a
legal or equitable interest in five percent (5%) or more of its voting stock:
         a.   Has ever been convicted of any felonious acts including, but not
limited to, any violation of Federal, State or local law or regulations, or is
presently under an indictment, investigation or complaint charging such acts;
         b.   Has ever had a judgment in an action for fraud, deceit or
misrepresentation entered against it, her, him, or them by any court of
competent jurisdiction; or
         c.   Has pending any legal claim, lawsuit or administrative proceeding
arising out of or involving a cable system.
      2.   To establish, to the satisfaction of the grantor, the financial
solvency of the proposed transferee by submitting all current financial data
for the proposed transferee which the grantee was required to submit in its
franchise application and such other data as the grantor may request. Financial
statements shall be audited, certified and qualified by a certified public
accountant or a financial officer of the proposed transferee.
      3.   To establish to the satisfaction of the grantor that the financial
and technical capability of the proposed transferee is such as shall enable it
to maintain and operate the cable system for the remaining term of the
franchise under the existing franchise terms.
   C.   Financial Institution: The grantor agrees that any financial
institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement
of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the
right to notify the grantor that it or its designee satisfactory to the grantor
shall take control and operate the cable communications system, in the event of
a grantee default in its financial obligations. Further, said financial
institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will ensure
continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the
term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial
institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding
one year unless extended by the grantor in its discretion and during said
period of time it shall have the right to petition the grantor to transfer the
franchise to another grantee. If the grantor finds that such transfer after
considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other public
interest qualities of the applicant are satisfactory, the grantor shall
transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the
public interest. The consent of the grantor to such transfer shall be given or
denied no less than ninety (90) days after any request, and shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
   D.   Grantor Rights To Streets: The consent or approval of the grantor to
any transfer by the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the
rights of the grantor in and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its
terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of any franchise.
   E.   Completion Of Construction: In the absence of extraordinary
circumstances, the grantor shall not approve any transfer or assignment of the
franchise prior to completion of initial construction of the cable system.
   F.   Successor Signature: In no event shall a transfer of ownership or
control be approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to
the franchise agreement. (Ord. 1165, 6-4-1991)
9-6-6: FRANCHISE RENEWAL:
Franchise renewal shall be as prescribed by applicable law. (Ord. 1165, 6-4-

grantor to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and
welfare of the public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws
and ordinances enacted by the grantor pursuant to such power.
   B.   Conflicting Provisions: Any conflict between the provisions of this
Chapter and any other present or future lawful exercise of the grantor's police
powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise
that is not of general application in the jurisdiction or applies exclusively
to any cable communications system franchise which contains provisions
inconsistent with this Chapter shall prevail only if upon such exercise the
grantor finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to health, safety,
property or general welfare or such exercise is mandated by law. (Ord. 1165, 6-
4-1991)
9-6-8: FRANCHISE FEE:
   A.   Annual Franchise Payment: A grantee of a franchise hereunder shall pay
to the grantor an annual fee in an amount as designated in the franchise
agreement. Such payment shall commence as of the effective date of the

either audited and certified by an independent certified public accountant or
certified by a financial officer of the grantee, reflecting the total amounts
of gross receipts and all payments, deductions and computations for the period
covered by the payment. Upon ten (10) days' prior written notice, grantor shall
have the right to conduct an independent audit of grantee's records, in
accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures, and if such audit
indicates a franchise fee underpayment of two percent (2%) or more, the grantee
shall assume all reasonable costs of such an audit.
   B.   Acceptance By Grantor: No acceptance of any payment by the grantor
shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim
the grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee
under this Chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of the
grantee.
   C.   Failure To Make Required Payment: In the event that any franchise
payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified
herein, grantee shall pay as additional compensation:

equal to the average rate of return on invested funds of the City during the
period for which payment was due.

money equal to five percent (5%) of the amount due in order to defray those
additional expenses and costs incurred by the grantor by reason of delinquent
payment.
   D.   Fee Payments: Franchise fee payments shall be made in accordance with
the schedule indicated in the franchise agreement.
   E.   Itemization Of Costs: Any grantee itemization of franchise fee costs on
subscribes' bills shall be in accordance with Federal law. If grantee elects to

costs to grantee. (Ord. 1165, 6-4-1991)
9-6-9: FORFEITURE OR REVOCATION:

reasonable opportunity to cure, the grantor reserves the right to revoke any
franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges associated
with the franchise in the following circumstances, each of which shall
represent a default under this Chapter and a material breach of the franchise:
      1.   If the grantee shall default in the performance of any of its
material obligations under this Chapter or under such documents, agreements and
other terms and provisions entered into by and between the grantor and the
grantee, subject to the provisions of subsection

regulatory body by rules, decisions or other action determines that any
material provision of the franchise documents, including this Chapter, the
franchise agreement and grantee's proposal is invalid or unenforceable prior to
the commencement of initial system construction.

any action deemed cause for revocation. In the event the stated violation is
not reasonably curable within ninety (90) days, the franchise shall not be
terminated or revoked, or damages assessed, if the grantee provides within the
said ninety (90) days a plan, satisfactory to the grantor, to remedy the
violation. If the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee continues for a
period exceeding ninety (90) days following receipt of such written demand by
the grantor, the grantor may place its request for termination of the franchise
upon a regular Council meeting agenda. The grantor shall cause notice to be
served upon such grantee, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of such
meeting, a written notice of this intent to request such termination, and the
time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published at least
once, ten (10) days before such meeting in a newspaper of general circulation
within the franchise area.
      2.   The grantor shall hear any persons interested therein, and shall
determine, within ninety (90) days, based upon the preponderance of the
evidence, whether the grantee has committed a material breach of this Chapter
or the franchise agreement, and, if so, whether such breach was wilful.
      3.   If the grantor determines that the grantee has wilfully committed a
material breach, then the grantor may, by resolution, declare that the
franchise of such grantee shall be terminated and security fund and bonds
forfeited, or the grantor may, at its option and if the material breach is
capable of being cured by the grantee, direct the grantee to take appropriate
remedial action within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions
as the grantor shall determine are reasonable under the circumstances. (Ord.

as trustee for its successor in interest, continue to operate the cable
communications system under the terms and conditions of this Chapter and the
franchise agreement and to provide the regular cable service and any of the
other services that may be provided at that time. The grantor shall be
permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this
Section.

9-6-20: FRANCHISE VIOLATIONS:
   A.   Remedies For Franchise Violations: If the grantee fails to perform any
material obligation under the franchise, or fails to do so in a timely manner,
the grantor may at its option, and in its sole discretion:
      1.   Assess against the grantee monetary damages up to the limits
established in the franchise agreement for material franchise violations, said
assessment to be levied against the security fund, hereinabove provided, and
collected by grantor after completion of the procedures specified in subsection
B of this Section. The amount of such assessment shall be deemed to represent
liquidation of damages actually sustained by grantor by reason of grantee's
failure to perform. Such assessment shall not constitute a waiver by the
grantor of any other right or remedy it may have under the franchise or under
applicable law, including without limitation, its right to recover from grantee
such additional damages, losses, costs and expenses, including actual attorney
fees, as may have been suffered or incurred by grantor by reason of or arising
out of such breach of the franchise. This provision for assessment of damages
is intended by the parties to be separate and apart from grantor's right to
enforce the provisions of the construction and performance bonds provided for
in Section
9-6-14 of this Chapter and is intended to provide compensation to grantor for
actual damages.
      2.   Terminate the franchise, for any of the causes stated in Sections

of the above enumerated measures against grantee, which shall be in addition to
any and all other legal or equitable remedies it has under the franchise or
under any applicable law.
   B.   Procedure For Remedying Franchise Violations: In the event that the
grantor determines that the grantee has violated any material provision of the
franchise, the grantor may make a written demand on the grantee that it remedy
such violation. If the violation is not remedied, or in the process of being
remedied, to the satisfaction of the grantor within thirty (30) days following
such demand, the grantor shall determine whether or not such violation by the
grantee was excusable or inexcusable, in accordance with the following
procedure:
      1.   An administrative hearing shall be held to review the alleged
violation. If this hearing does not result in a satisfactory resolution, and/or
the grantee requests a public hearing, then a public hearing shall be held, and
the grantee shall be provided with an opportunity to be heard upon thirty (30)
days' written notice to the grantee of the time and the place of the hearing
provided and the allegations of franchise violations.
      2.   If, after notice is given and, at the grantee's option, a full
public proceeding is held, the grantor determines that such violation by the
grantee was excusable as provided in subsection C of this Section, the grantor
shall direct the grantee to correct or remedy the same within such additional
time, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the grantor may
reasonably direct.
      3.   If, after notice is given and, at the grantee's option, a full
public proceeding is held, the grantor determines that such violation was
inexcusable, then the grantor may impose a remedy in accordance with subsection
A of this Section.
   C.   Force Majeure; Grantee's Inability To Perform:
      1.   In the event grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions,
obligations, or requirements of the franchise is prevented or impaired due to
any cause beyond its reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable, such
inability to perform shall be deemed to be excused and no penalties or
sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof, provided grantee has notified
grantor in writing within thirty (30) days of its discovery of the occurrence
of such an event. Such causes beyond grantee's reasonable control or not
reasonably foreseeable shall include, but shall not be limited to, acts of God
and civil emergencies.
      2.   Grantor and grantee, in the franchise agreement, may mutually define
those conditions deemed subject to force majeure application. (Ord. 1165, 6-4-
1991)

and Federal Government or any administrative agencies thereof. Provided,
however, if any such State or Federal law or regulation shall require the
grantee to perform any service, or shall permit the grantee to perform any
service, or shall prohibit the grantee from performing any service, in conflict

competent jurisdiction to be invalid as conflicting with any Federal, State or
local law, rule or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is held by such
court or agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the
requirements of any such law, rule or regulation, and if said provision is
considered nonmaterial by the grantor, said provision shall be considered a
separate, distinct and independent part of this Chapter, and such holding shall
not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In
the event that such law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed,
rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision hereof or
thereof which has been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with
the law, rules and regulations then in effect, said provision shall thereupon
return to full force and effect, and shall thereafter be binding on the parties
hereto; provided, that the grantor shall give the grantee thirty (30) days'
written notice of such change before requiring compliance with said provision.
   B.   Material Provisions: If any material section of this Chapter, as
determined by the grantor and the grantee, is held to be invalid or preempted
by Federal, State or County regulations or laws, resulting in a material
adverse consequence to either party, the grantor and grantee shall attempt to
negotiate appropriate modifications to the franchise to provide reasonable
relief to the grantor or grantee from such invalidity or preemption, including
the payment of damages. If the parties are unable to reach agreement on such
modifications, then the dispute shall be submitted to a mutually agreeable
arbitrator, in accordance with state law, who shall determine what
modifications and/or liquidated damages are appropriate. The arbitrator's
decision shall be binding on the parties; provided, that no decision of the
arbitrator shall require the grantor or grantee to be in violation of any
federal or state law or regulation. (Ord. 1165, 6-4-1991)

any person or organization sponsoring or conducting an event to compensate the
general public for all costs incurred in connection with operating and
maintaining the parks or park facilities reasonably attributable to that event.

9-8-9: BASIC RATE:
A condition of issuing a permit is that the permittee pay the city the basic
rate as follows:
   A.   Category 1 permittees do not pay the basic rate. Permittees in this
category are individuals who reside within the city using parks for personal
use (but not for profit) or nonprofit organizations with a primary place of
business within the city's jurisdiction. Nonprofit organizations must provide
evidence of their status to the director's satisfaction. Examples of such
evidence include, without limitation, articles of incorporation, bylaws, or
proof of internal revenue code section 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(6) status. Nonprofit
organizations may use parks for fundraising activities which will not be
considered a for profit event.

are commercial businesses with a primary place of business within the city's
jurisdiction.
   C.   Category 3 permittees pay the basic rate plus ten dollars ($10.00) or
such other amount as may be determined by the director as authorized by council
resolution. Permittees in this category include nonresident individuals and
nonprofit organizations with a primary place of business outside the city's

permittees, whether located inside or outside the city's jurisdiction, using
parks commercially and for financial gain. In determining whether an event is
commercial and for financial gain, the director may rely upon any reasonable
evidence including, without limitation, advertisements, documentation of
entrance fees, or requests to restrict public access to the event. (Ord. 1363,
6-3-2003)
9-8-10: ADDITIONAL USE FEE:

additional park use fees equal to the city's total estimated cost for providing
city personnel and/or equipment, if any, needed to monitor an event or
otherwise provide city services for, or in connection with, the event. These
fees will be determined by the director based on the estimate of the police
chief, fire chief, and/or director as to the number and hours of employment of
city personnel necessary to control the event or otherwise provide city
services for or in connection with such event. (Ord. 1363, 6-3-2003)
9-8-11: TIME FOR DEPOSITING FEES:
A permit is not valid unless, in addition to the other conditions contained in

and all other fees excluding the initial application fee and any fees for
canceled services such as security, police or insurance incurred by the city.

   A.   Except as provided in this chapter, completed applications for a permit
authorizing an event must be filed in the director's office at least:
      1.   Fifty (50) days before the date of such event to ensure
administrative review and city council appeal;
      2.   Twenty (20) business days before the date of such event, in which
case the opportunity for a city council appeal is deemed waived; or
      3.   A lesser time period approved by the director provided that there is
sufficient time to process the application pursuant to this chapter. Any
applicant submitting an application pursuant to this section less than twenty
(20) days before an event is deemed to have waived the administrative review
and city council appeal.
   B.   Except as provided in this chapter, completed applications for a permit
authorizing an event will be denied, approved, or conditionally approved by the
director within seven (7) business days after receiving the completed
application. Following his/her decision, the director must promptly attempt to
notify the applicant orally, and will provide written notification to the
applicant.
   C.   Unless otherwise provided, the director must receive the applicant's
acceptance of the approval or conditional approval within five (5) business

conditioning, a permit for a free speech event.
   C.   The director must receive applicant's acceptance of the approval or
conditional approval at least forty eight (48) hours before the event. Failure

participants from the conduct of others;

of persons not conducting such event. (Ord. 1363, 6-3-2003)
9-8-20: ALTERNATIVE TIME, PLACE, OR MANNER:
If the director denies a permit for an event that would be acceptable by

must provide "occurrence" coverage against liabilities for death, personal
injury or property damage arising out of or in any way connected with such
event. The amount of such insurance will be based upon the city's insurance
guidelines and reflect the size and nature of the event and the risks
foreseeably involved. Such insurance will name the city and the city's
officers, employees, and agents as additional insureds under the coverage
afforded. In addition, such insurance must be primary and noncontributing with
respect to any other insurance available to the city and will include a

restriction of events to a particular park;
      2.   Avoiding substantial interference with public safety and/or

successor statute or regulation, if food is distributed to the public more than
three (3) days in any ninety (90) day period;
      13.   Providing electricity, gas, and water for the event;
      14.   Providing signage and barricades that may be necessary to avoid

event;
      15.   Providing monitors and security personnel that may be necessary to

9-9-5: Exceptions
9-9-6: Application Requirements
9-9-7: Design And Development Standards
9-9-8: Findings
9-9-9: Conditions Of Approval
9-9-10: Operation, And Maintenance Standards
9-9-11: Removal And Restoration Upon Revocation Or Abandonment
9-9-1: PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY:
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to provide a uniform and
comprehensive set of regulations and standards for permitting, development,
siting, installation, design, operation and maintenance of wireless
communications facilities in the city’s public right-of-ways (PROW). These
regulations are intended to prescribe clear and reasonable criteria to assess
and process applications in a consistent and expeditious manner, while reducing
the impacts associated with wireless telecommunications facilities. This
chapter provides standards necessary (1) for the preservation of the public
right-of-ways in the city for the maximum benefit and use of the public, (2) to
promote and protect public health and safety, community welfare, visual
resources and the aesthetic quality of the city consistent with the goals,
objectives and policies of the general plan, and (3) to provide
for the orderly, managed and efficient development of wireless communications
facilities in accordance with the state and federal laws, rules and
regulations.
This chapter applies to the siting, construction, collocation, or modification
of all wireless communication facilities in the public right-of-way (PROW).
Siting and construction of wireless communication facilities on all other
property are subject to the provisions in ESMC 15-19.
   A.   All facilities within the PROW permitted by the city after the
effective date of this ordinance will be required to comply with all of the
provisions of this chapter.
   B.   All facilities within the PROW permitted by the city which obtained
encroachment permits prior to the effective date of this ordinance will not be
subject to all of the provisions of this chapter, or required to obtain a new
permit, and will be deemed a nonconforming use subject to the provisions of
Section 9-9-12 (Nonconforming Facilities).
   C.   All PROW facilities, notwithstanding the date approved, shall be
subject immediately to the provisions of this chapter governing operation and
maintenance standards (Section
9-9-10) and removal and restoration upon revocation or abandonment (Section
9-9-11); provided, however, that in the event a condition of approval conflicts
with a provision of this chapter, the condition of approval shall control until
the permit is amended or revoked.
   D.   This chapter does not apply to facilities owned and operated by the
city for its use or to any entity legally entitled to an exemption pursuant to
state or federal law or governing franchise agreement.
   E.   Compliance with the provisions of this chapter does not relieve a
person from compliance with any other applicable provision of this code. In the
event of a conflict between any provision of this chapter and other sections of
this code, this chapter shall control.
   F.   If the City Attorney determines that state or federal law prohibits
discretionary permitting requirements for certain wireless communications
facilities, such requirement is deemed severable and all remaining regulations
shall remain in full force and effect. For such facilities, a ministerial
permit is required prior to the installation or modification of a wireless
communications facility in lieu of a major wireless communications permit (and
exception, if applicable). All otherwise applicable conditions of approval and
requirements regarding the time, place and manner of access and operation shall
apply to the extent permitted by state and federal law. Any determination by
the City Attorney pursuant to this section shall be in writing. (Ord. 1618, 6-

The diameter of the replacement pole may not be more than 20% larger than the
utility pole it replaces at any point along the pole; and
         d.   If the proposed facility is a new facility that includes a new
communications structure and the proposed communications structure is no taller
50 feet or 10% taller than the existing adjacent poles, whichever is greater;
         e.   If the City Attorney determines that state or federal law
prohibits or otherwise limits the height restrictions in this subparagraph, the
director may approve the facility notwithstanding the height restriction,
provided the height of proposed communication tower is restricted to the
maximum extent practicable and to the maximum extent allowed by law, and
further provided the facility meets all other applicable criteria.
      2.   In the event that the director determines that an application for an
administrative wireless communications facilities permit does not meet the
criteria set forth in this subparagraph, the director shall convert the
application to a major wireless communications facilities permit application
and refer it to the planning commission. The applicant must pay any additional
applicable fees associated with a major wireless permit application within 10
business days of the director giving notice of the conversion of the
application.
   D.   Ministerial Permit.
      1.   Eligible Facilities.
         a.   Eligible facilities requests require a ministerial permit issued
by the director in lieu of a discretionary permit, and will be processed
pursuant to the requirements of 47 USC § 1455(a) and 47 CFR § 1.6100, as may be
amended from time to time.
         b.   The applicant bears the burden of asserting rights under 47 USC §
1455(a) and 47 CFR § 1.6100 and any application filed for an eligible
facilities request must prominently state that the application is for an
“Eligible Facilities Request” and must include all facts and information
necessary for the director to ensure that the proposed facility qualifies as an
eligible facility.
         c.   All conditions of approval set forth in section
9-9-9 will apply to eligible facilities unless, in the opinion of the City
Attorney, state or federal law precludes imposition of the condition.
      2.   Specified Collocation Facilities.
         a.   A collocation facility that meets the requirements of Government
Code section 65850.6, as amended from time to time, requires a ministerial
permit issued by the director, in lieu of discretionary permit.
         b.   For purposes of this subsection, “collocation facility” has the
meaning set forth in Government Code section 65850.6, as may be amended from
time to time.
         c.   The applicant bears the burden of establishing that the proposed
facility qualifies as a collocation facility subject to nondiscretionary
approval under Government Code section 65850.6 and any application filed for a
Section 65850.6 collocation facility must prominently state that the
application is for a “Section 65860.6 Collocation Facility” and must include
all facts and information necessary for the director to ensure that the
proposed facility qualifies as a Section 65850.6 collocation facility.
         d.   All conditions of approval set forth in section
9-9-9 will apply to collocation facilities unless, in the opinion of the City
Attorney, state or federal law precludes imposition of the condition.
   E.   Notice; Decisions. The provisions in this subsection describe the
procedures for approval and any required notice and public hearings for an
application.
      1.   Planning Commission Hearings. Any permit application under this
chapter subject to planning commission approval shall require notice and a
public hearing. Notice of such hearing shall be provided in accordance with
Title 15, Chapter 27. The planning commission may approve, or conditionally
approve, an application only after it makes the findings required in Section
9-9-8 (Findings).
      2.   Director’s Decision Notice. The director may approve, or
conditionally approve, an application only after he or she makes the findings
required in Section
9-9-8 (Findings). The director’s determination must be in writing.
      3.   Written Decision Required. All final decisions made pursuant to this
chapter shall be in writing and based on substantial evidence in the written
administrative record. The written decision shall include the reasons for the
decision.
      4.   Appeals. Any aggrieved person or entity may appeal a decision by the
director or the planning commission as provided in accordance with the
provisions in Title 15, Chapter 25. Appeals are reviewed de novo.
      5.   Administrative WCFP Appeals. Any aggrieved person or entity may
appeal the director’s decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny an
Administrative WCFP. The appeal will be considered by the City Council. Appeals
are reviewed de novo and the decision of the City Council will be the final
decision of the City. An appeal by a wireless infrastructure provider must be
taken jointly with the wireless service provider that intends to use the
wireless facility. Because federal law preempts local decisions premised on the
environmental effects of radio frequency (RF) emissions, appeals of the
administrative decision premised on the environmental effects of radio
frequency emissions will not be considered.
         a.    Appeals must be in writing, filed with the director, and must
detail all of the reasons for the appeal. Emailed appeals are not acceptable.
The appeal must be accompanied by payment of the applicable appeal fee as
established by resolution of the City Council.
         b.   An appeal of an Administrative WCFP must be filed within four
business days of notice of the administrative decision. Any appeal must be
conducted so that a timely written decision may be issued in accordance with
applicable law.
   F.   Other Permits Required. In addition to any permit that may be required
under this chapter, the applicant must obtain an encroachment permit and all
other permits or approvals required by other city departments, or state or
federal agencies. Any permit granted under this chapter is subject to the
conditions and/or requirements of other required permits or other approvals
from other city departments, and state or federal agencies.
   G.   Eligible Applicants. Only applicants who have been granted the right to
enter the public right-of-way pursuant to state or federal law, or who have
entered into a franchise or other agreement with the city permitting them to
use the public right-of-way, are eligible for a permit to install or modify a
wireless communications facility or a wireless communications collocation
facility in the public right-of-way.
   H.   Speculative Equipment Prohibited. The city finds that the practice of
“pre-approving” wireless equipment or other improvements that an applicant does
not presently intend to install but may wish to install at some undetermined
future time does not serve the public’s best interest. The city cannot approve
any equipment or other improvements in connection with a wireless
telecommunications facility permit when the applicant does not actually and
presently intend to install such equipment or construct such improvements.
   I.   A COW shall be permitted for the duration of an emergency declared by
the city, county or state, when a wireless facility is being moved due to
redevelopment of an existing site, or at the discretion of the director. (Ord.
1618, 6-16-2020)
9-9-4: LOCATION RESTRICTIONS:
   A.   Facilities in the following locations require a major wireless
communications permit, excepting SWF subject to design standards in the SWF
Regulations:
      1.   Located along the following street segments:
         a.   Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), entire length;
         b.   Imperial Highway, PCH to Aviation Boulevard;
         c.   El Segundo Boulevard, Illinois Street to Aviation Boulevard;
         d.   Rosecrans Avenue, PCH to Aviation;
         e.   Main Street, El Segundo Boulevard to Oak Avenue;
         f.   Richmond Street, El Segundo Boulevard to Holly Avenue;
         g.   Grand Avenue, Richmond Street to Standard Street.
      2.   Adjacent to city parks or designated open space.
      3.   Anywhere within the coastal zone.
      4.   Anywhere within the city when an administrative wireless permit is
not allowed due to not satisfying the design criteria of section
9-9-7 or the conditions set forth in section
9-9-9.
   B.   Facilities requiring an administrative wireless communications permit.
Anywhere within the city, except as described in section A above, when the
criteria in section
9-9-7 are met. (Ord. 1618, 6-16-2020)
9-9-5: EXCEPTIONS:
   A.   The city council recognizes that federal law prohibits a permit denial
when it would effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services
(as defined in 47 USC § 332(c)(7)(C)(i)) and the applicant proposes the least
intrusive means of remedying a service gap. The city council finds that, due to
wide variation among wireless facilities, technical service objectives and
changed circumstances over time, a limited exemption for proposals in which
strict compliance with this chapter would effectively prohibit personal
wireless services serves the public interest. The city council further finds
that circumstances in which an effective prohibition may occur are extremely
difficult to discern, and that specified findings to guide the analysis
promotes clarity and the city’s legitimate interest in well-planned wireless
facilities deployment in the public right-of-way. Therefore, in the event that
any applicant asserts that strict compliance with any provision in this
chapter, as applied to a specific proposed personal wireless services facility,
would effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services, the
planning commission may grant a limited exemption from strict compliance
subject to the provisions in this section.
   B.   SWF exception procedures are pursuant to the SWF Regulations.
   C.   Required Findings. The planning commission cannot grant any exception
unless the applicant demonstrates all the following:
      1.   The proposed wireless facility qualifies as a “personal wireless
services facility” as defined in United States Code, Title 47, section 332(c)
(7)(C)(ii);
      2.   The applicant has provided the city with a clearly defined technical
service objective and a clearly defined potential site search area;
      3.   An applicant may obtain an exception from these design standards if
compliance with the standard: (a) is not technically feasible; (b) impedes the
effective operation of the wireless facility; or (c) otherwise materially
inhibits or limits the provision of wireless service.
      4.   The City may also provide an exception from these standards when it
finds the applicant’s proposed design provides equivalent or superior aesthetic
value when compared to strict compliance with these standards.
      5.   Requests for exceptions must be narrowly tailored to minimize
deviation from the requirements of these design standards.
   D.   Scope. An exemption may be allowed only to the extent necessary for the
applicant to reasonably achieve its technical service objectives. The planning
commission may impose conditions of approval as necessary to promote the
purposes in this chapter and protect the public health, safety and welfare.
   E.   Independent Consultant. The city shall have the right to hire, at the
applicant’s expense, an independent consultant to evaluate issues raised by the
proposed exception and to submit recommendations and evidence in response to
the application. (Ord. 1618, 6-16-2020)
9-9-6: APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   All Applications. In addition to the information required of an
applicant for an encroachment permit or any other permit required by this code,
each applicant requesting approval of the installation or modification of a
wireless communications facility in the public right-of-way shall fully and
completely submit to the city a written application on a form prepared by the
director.
   B.   Application Contents. The director shall develop an application form

      3.   If the facility will be located on or in the property of someone
other than the owner of the facility (such as a street light pole, street
signal pole, utility pole, utility cabinet, vault, or cable conduit), the
applicant must provide a duly executed written authorization from the property
owner(s) authorizing the placement of the facility on or in the property
owner’s property.
      4.   A written description of the proposed facility and its purpose.
      5.   Detailed engineering plans of the proposed facility and related
report prepared by a professional structural engineer registered in California
evidencing the structural integrity of the pole or other supporting structure.
      6.   For applications seeking a new pole, a justification statement of
why existing structures and poles evaluated for potential installation of the
proposed facility are not viable options.
      7.   Site plan to scale, specifying and depicting the exact proposed
location of the pole, pole diameter, antennas, accessory equipment, access or

city that certifies that the proposed facility will comply with applicable
federal RF exposure standards and exposure limits. The RF report must include
the actual frequency and power levels (in watts effective radio power ERP) for
all existing and proposed antennas at the site and exhibits that show the
location and orientation of all transmitting antennas and the boundaries of
areas with RF exposures in excess of the uncontrolled/general population limit
(as that term is defined by the FCC) and also the boundaries of areas with RF
exposures in excess of the controlled/occupational limit (as that term is
defined by the FCC). Each such boundary shall be clearly marked and identified
for every transmitting antenna at the project site. The RF report must also
indicate whether the facility will be categorically excluded, as that term is
used by the FCC, using the radio frequency (RF) emissions exposure guidelines
checklist contained in Appendix A to the Federal Communications Commission’s
(FCC) “A Local Government Official’s Guide to Transmitting Antenna RF Emission
Safety.”
      12.   A traffic control plan when the proposed installation will involve
the placement of equipment within any street.

must detail why the proposed facility meets the definition of a SWF. The
application also must contain all additional information required by the SWF
Regulations.
      16.   Any other information and/or studies determined necessary by the
director may be required.
   C.   Application Contents-Modification of Existing Facility. The content of
the application form for a modification to an existing facility that does not
qualify as an eligible facilities request shall be determined by the director.
   D.   Application Contents-Eligible Facilities Requests. When an applicant
asserts in writing that a request for modification qualifies as an eligible
facilities request for modification of an eligible support structure that does
not substantially change the physical dimensions of such structure, the
applicant need only provide documentation or information reasonably necessary
for the director to determine whether the request is a qualifying eligible
facilities request. The content of the application form for an eligible
facilities request shall be determined by the director.
   E.   SWF applications will be governed by any additional terms set forth in
the SWF Regulations, and in the event of an inconsistency between the
provisions of this section and the terms of the SWF Regulations, the SWF
Regulations will control.
   F.   Effect of State or Federal Law Change. In the event a subsequent state
or federal law prohibits the collection of any information required by 9-9-6,
the director is authorized to omit, modify or add to that request from the
city’s application form after consultation with the City Attorney.
   G.   Independent Expert. The director is authorized to retain on behalf of
the city an independent, qualified consultant to review any application for a
permit for a wireless communications facility. The review is intended to be a
review of technical aspects of the proposed wireless communications facility
and may address any or all of the following:
      1.   Compliance with applicable radio frequency emission standards;
      2.   The applicability of analysis techniques and methodologies;
      3.   Any other specific technical issues identified by the consultant or
designated by the city.
      The cost of this review must be paid by the applicant through a deposit
pursuant to an adopted fee schedule. No permit can be issued to any applicant
that has not fully reimbursed the city for the cost of the consultant.
   H.   A permit or approval granted pursuant to this chapter does not confer
any exclusive right, privilege, license or franchise to occupy or use the
public right-of-way of the city for any purpose whatsoever. Furthermore, no
permit or approval granted pursuant to this chapter shall be construed as a
guarantee or warranty of title. (Ord. 1618, 6-16-2020)
9-9-7: DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
Unless otherwise specified, all wireless communications facilities located
within the public right-of-way must be planned, designed, located, and erected
in accordance with the following:
   A.   All small wireless facilities (SWF) must be designed and built in
accordance with the SWF Regulations adopted by resolution of the City Council.
All other wireless communications facilities are subject to these general
guidelines.
   B.   General Guidelines.
      1.   Within or adjacent to areas zoned R-1 and R-2, and the Downtown
Specific Plan:
         a.   The applicant must employ techniques, such as screening,
undergrounding and camouflage, in the design and placement of wireless
communications facilities in order to ensure that the facility is as visually
screened as possible.
         b.   Screening must be designed to be compatible with surrounding
structures using appropriate techniques to camouflage, disguise, and/or blend
into the environment, including landscaping, color, and other techniques to
minimize the facility’s visual impact in terms of size, proportion, style, and
quality.
      2.   All other areas. The applicant must employ techniques in the design
and placement of wireless communications facilities in order to ensure that the
facility is as visually compatible with surroundings.
   C.   Traffic Safety. All facilities must be designed and located in such a
manner as to avoid adverse impacts on traffic safety.
   D.   Blending Methods. All facilities must have appropriate colors and non-
reflective materials that blend with or complement the materials and colors of
the surrounding area and structures.
   E.   Equipment. The applicant must use the least visible equipment possible.
When practicable, antenna mounts must be designed so as not to preclude
possible future collocation by the same or other operators or carriers.
   F.   Poles.
      1.   Facilities shall be located consistent with Section
9-9-4 (Location Restrictions) unless an exception pursuant to Section
9-9-5 (Exceptions) is granted.
      2.   Only pole-mounted antennas are permitted in the right-of-way; all
other communications towers are prohibited. No new wireless communication poles
are permitted in the public right-of-way unless the pole is replacing an
existing pole or an exception is granted pursuant to the SWF Regulations,
Section
9-9-5 (Exceptions) or Section
9-9-1(F)(State or Federal Restrictions on Discretionary Authority).
      3.   Utility Poles. The maximum height of any antenna must not exceed
four feet above an existing utility pole or the minimum height needed to meet
required clearances above energized lines, nor may any portion of the antenna
or equipment mounted on a pole be less than 21 feet above any drivable road
surface. All installations on utility poles must fully comply with the
California Public Utilities Commission general orders, including, but not
limited to, General Order 95, as may be revised or superseded.
      4.   Light Poles. The maximum height of any antenna must not exceed the
minimum needed to meet the network objective above the existing height of a
light pole. No portion of the antenna or equipment mounted on a pole shall be
less than 16 and 1/2 feet above any drivable road surface.
      5.   Replacement Poles. If an applicant proposes to replace a pole in
order to accommodate a proposed facility, the pole must be designed to resemble
the appearance and dimensions of existing poles near the proposed location,
including size, height, color, materials and style to the maximum extent
practicable. Alternatively, the director may require the pole to be designed to
achieve a look or character specified by the director.
      6.   Pole-mounted equipment, exclusive of antennas, may not exceed eight
cubic feet in dimension.
      7.   Unless otherwise allowed pursuant to this chapter, an exception is
required to place a new pole in the public right-of-way. If an exception is
granted for placement of new poles in the right-of-way:
         a.   New poles must be designed to resemble existing poles in the
right-of-way near that location, including size, height, color, materials and
style, with the exception of any existing pole designs that are scheduled to be
removed and not replaced. Alternatively, the director may require the pole to
be designed to achieve a look or character specified by the director.
         b.   To the extent feasible, new wireless communication poles that are
not replacement poles must be located at least 100 feet from any other wireless
communication pole located along the same side of the public right-of-way. This
minimum spacing requirement will not apply if the applicant demonstrates that
compliance with the requirement would have the effect of materially inhibiting
wireless service.
         c.   A new pole justification analysis shall be submitted to
demonstrate why existing infrastructure cannot be utilized and demonstrating
the new pole is the least intrusive means possible including a demonstration
that the new pole is designed to be the minimum functional height and width
required to support the proposed facility.
      8.   All cables, including, without limitation, electrical and utility
cables, must be run inside the pole and hidden to the fullest extent feasible.
For all wooden poles wherein interior installation is infeasible, conduit and
cables attached to the exterior of the pole must be mounted as close to the
pole as possible while meeting electric safety codes and pole owner
requirements.
   G.   Space. Each facility must be designed to occupy the least amount of
space practicable in the right-of-way.
   H.   Wind Loads. Each facility must be properly engineered to withstand wind
loads as required by this code or any duly adopted or incorporated code. An
evaluation of high wind load capacity must include the impact of modifications
to an existing facility.
   I.   Obstructions. Each component part of a facility shall be located so as
not to (1) cause any physical or visual obstruction to pedestrian or vehicular
traffic, (2) interfere with any ADA accessibility standards, or (3) incommode
the public’s use of the right-of-way.
   J.   Public Facilities. No facility in the public right-of-way may be
located or operated in a manner that interferes with access to a fire hydrant,
fire station, fire escape, water valve, underground vault, valve housing
structure, or any other public health or safety facility.
   K.   Screening. All ground-mounted facilities, pole-mounted equipment, and
any screening must be installed at least 18 inches from the curb and gutter
flow line.
   L.   Accessory Equipment. Not including the electric meter, all accessory
equipment must be located within the pole or underground unless the director
determines that there is no room in the public right-of-way for undergrounding,
or that undergrounding is not feasible. An exception is required to place
accessory equipment above ground in the public right-of-way.
   M.   Landscaping. Unless otherwise expressly authorized in a permit, each
facility must be installed so as to maintain existing landscaping on the site,
including trees, foliage and shrubs. Any landscaping that is removed or damaged
during the construction of the facility must be replaced to the satisfaction of
the director.
   N.   Noise. Backup generators may only be operated during periods of power
outages, and may not be tested on weekends or holidays, or between the hours of
7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
   O.   Security. Each facility shall be designed to be resistant to, and
minimize opportunities for, unauthorized access, climbing, vandalism, graffiti
and other conditions that would result in hazardous situations, visual blight
or attractive nuisances.
   P.   The installation and construction approved by a wireless communications
facility permit must begin within one year after its approval or the permit
will expire without further action by the city. Additional time may be
requested if the delay is related to bringing power or fiber to the pole.
   Q.   SWF Design and Development Standards. SWFs are subject to those design
and development standards and conditions of approval set forth in the SWF
Regulations. (Ord. 1618, 6-16-2020)
9-9-8: FINDINGS:
No permit can be granted for a new wireless communications facility unless all
of the following findings are made by the decision-making authority:
   A.   All notices, if applicable, required for the proposed installation have
been given.
   B.   The proposed facility complies with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   C.   If applicable, the applicant has demonstrated its inability to locate
on existing infrastructure.
   D.   The applicant has provided sufficient evidence supporting the
applicant’s claim that it has the right to enter the public right-of-way
pursuant to state or federal law, or the applicant has entered into a franchise
or other agreement with the city permitting it to use the public right-of-way.
   E.   The proposed installation will not interfere with the use of the public
right-of-way, existing subterranean infrastructure, or the City’s plans for
modification or use of such location and infrastructure. (Ord. 1618, 6-16-2020)
9-9-9: CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL:
In addition to compliance with the design and development standards outlined in
this chapter, all facilities are subject to the following conditions of
approval (even in those cases where approval occurs by operation of law), as
well as any modification of these conditions or additional conditions of
approval deemed necessary by the director at the time of the approval:
   A.   The permittee must submit contact information on a form to be supplied
by the city. The permittee must notify the city of any changes to the contact
information within seven days of any change, including a change of the name or
legal status of the owner or operator. This information must include, but is
not limited to, the following: Identity, including the 24-hour local or toll
free contact phone number of the permittee, the owner, the operator, or the
agent or person responsible for the maintenance of the facility.
   B.   The permittee must notify the city in writing at least 90 days prior to
any transfer or assignment of the permit. The written notice required in this
section must include: (1) the transferee’s legal name; (2) the transferee’s
full contact information, including a primary contact person, mailing address,
telephone number and email address; and (3) a statement signed by the
transferee that the transferee accepts all permit terms and conditions. The
director may require the transferor and/or the transferee to submit any
materials or documentation necessary to determine that the proposed transfer
complies with the existing permit and all its conditions of approval. Such
materials or documentation may include, without limitation: federal, state and/
or local approvals, licenses, certificates or franchise agreements; statements;
photographs; site plans and/or as-built drawings; and/or an analysis by a
qualified radio frequency engineer demonstrating compliance with all applicable
regulations and standards of the Federal Communications Commission.
Noncompliance with the permit and all its conditions of approval, or the
failure to submit the materials required by the director shall be a cause for
the city to revoke the applicable permits pursuant to and following the
procedure set on in Section
9-9-11 (Removal and Restoration Upon Revocation or Abandonment).
   C.   At all times, all required notices and/or signs must be posted on the
site as required by the Federal Communications Commission, California Public
Utilities Commission, any applicable licenses or laws. The location and
dimensions of a sign bearing the emergency contact name and telephone number
must be posted pursuant to the approved plans.
   D.   Permittee must furnish a performance bond or other form of security
approved by the City Attorney’s office, which must be in effect until the
facilities are fully and completely removed and the site returned to its
original condition, to guarantee permittee’s obligations under these conditions
of approval and this code. The security instrument’s coverage must include
removal of the facility. The amount of the security instrument shall be
calculated by the applicant in its submittal documents in an amount sufficient
to guarantee the obligations covered by the bond. The security instrument must
be submitted to the city before issuance of any building permit.
   E.   The wireless communications facility shall be subject to such
conditions, changes or limitations as are from time to time deemed necessary by
the director for the purpose of: (a) protecting the public health, safety, and
welfare; (b) preventing interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic;
and/or (c) preventing damage to the public right-of-way or any adjacent
property. The city may modify the permit to reflect such conditions, changes or
limitations by following the same notice and public hearing procedures as are
applicable to the underlying permit for similarly located facilities, except
the permittee shall be given notice by personal service or by registered or
certified mail at the last address provided to the city by the permittee.
   F.   The permittee shall not transfer the permit to any person prior to the
completion of the construction of the facility covered by the permit, unless
and until the transferee of the permit has submitted the security instrument
required by Section
9-9-9(D).
   G.   The permittee must not move, alter, temporarily relocate, change, or
interfere with any existing structure, improvement or property without the
prior consent of the owner of that structure, improvement or property. No
structure, improvement or property owned by the city shall be moved to
accommodate a wireless communications facility unless the city, in its sole
discretion, determines that such movement will not adversely affect the city or
any surrounding businesses or residents, and the permittee pays all costs and
expenses related to the relocation of the city’s structure, improvement or
property. Prior to commencement of any work pursuant to an encroachment permit
issued for any facility within the public right-of-way, the permittee must
provide the city with documentation establishing to the city’s satisfaction
that the permittee has the legal right to use or interfere with any other
structure, improvement or property within the public right-of-way to be
affected by applicant’s facilities.
   H.   The permittee must assume full liability for damage or injury caused to
any property or person by the facility.
   I.   The permittee must repair, at its sole cost and expense, any damage
including, but not limited to subsidence, cracking, erosion, collapse,
weakening, or loss of lateral support to city streets, sidewalks, walks, curbs,
gutters, trees, parkways, street lights, traffic signals, improvements of any
kind or nature, or utility lines and systems, underground utility line and
systems, or sewer systems and sewer lines that result from any activities
performed in connection with the installation and/or maintenance of a wireless
communications facility in the public right-of-way. The permittee must restore
such areas, structures and systems to the condition in which they existed prior
to the installation or maintenance activity that necessitated the repairs. The
permittee must complete such repair within the number of days stated on a
written notice by the city engineer. The time allotted for corrective action
will be based on the facts and circumstances, danger to the community and
severity of the disrepair, as determined by the city engineer in his/her sole
discretion. Should the permittee not complete the corrective action within the
time period allotted the city engineer, the city may cause such repair to be
completed at permittee’s sole cost and expense.
   J.   No facility can be permitted to be installed in the drip line of any
tree in the public right-of-way.
   K.   Insurance and Indemnity. The permittee must obtain and maintain in full
force and effect, until the facility approved by the permit is removed in its
entirety from the public right-of-way, an insurance policy or policies of
public liability insurance, with minimum limits of $2,000,000 for each
occurrence and $4,000,000 in the aggregate, that fully protects the city from
claims and suits for bodily injury and property damage. The insurance must name
the city and its elected and appointed officials, officers, agents,
consultants, and employees as additional named insureds, be issued by an
insurer admitted in the State of California with a rating of at least a A:VII
in the latest edition of A.M. Best’s Insurance Guide, and include an
endorsement providing that the policies cannot be canceled or reduced except
with thirty (30) days prior written notice to the city. The insurance provided
by permittee must be primary to any coverage available to the city, and any
insurance or self-insurance maintained by the city shall be in excess of
permittee’s insurance and shall not contribute with it. The policies of
insurance required by this permit must include provisions for waiver of
subrogation. In accepting the benefits of this permit, permittee hereby waives
all rights of subrogation against the city and its elected and appointed
officials, officers, agents, consultants, employees and volunteers. The
insurance must afford coverage for the permittee’s and the wireless provider’s
use, operation and activity, vehicles, equipment, facility, representatives,
agents and employees, as determined by the city’s risk manager. Before issuance
of any building permit for the facility, the permittee shall furnish the city’s
risk manager with certificates of insurance and endorsements, in the form
satisfactory to the City Attorney or the risk manager, evidencing the coverage
required by the city or self insurance that provides equivalent protection to
the city.
   L.   Permittee must defend, indemnify, protect and hold harmless city, its
elected and appointed officials, officers, agents, consultants, and employees
from and against any and all claims, actions, or proceeding against the city,
and/or its elected and appointed officials, officers, agents, consultants,
employees, and volunteers to attack, set aside, void or annul, an approval of
the city, planning commission or city council concerning this permit and/or the
project. Such indemnification shall include damages of any type, judgments,
settlements, penalties, fines, defensive costs or expenses, including, without
limitation, interest, attorneys’ fees and expert witness fees, or liability of
any kind related to or arising from such claim, action, or proceeding. The city
shall promptly notify the permittee of any claim, action, or proceeding.
Nothing contained herein shall prohibit city from participating in a defense of
any claim, action or proceeding. The city shall have the option of coordinating
the defense, including, without limitation, choosing its counsel after
consulting with permittee and at permittee’s expense.
   M.   Additionally, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the permittee,
and every permittee and person in a shared permit, jointly and severally, must
defend, indemnify, protect and hold the city and its elected and appointed
officials, officers, agents, consultants, employees and volunteers harmless
from and against all claims, suits, demands, actions, losses, liabilities,
judgments, settlements, costs (including, but not limited to, attorney’s fees,
interest and expert witness fees), or damages claimed by third parties against
the city for any injury claim, and for property damage sustained by any person,
arising out of, resulting from, or are in any way related to the wireless
communications facility, or to any work done by, or use of the public right-of-
way by, the permittee, owner or operator of the wireless communications
facility, or their agents, excepting only liability arising out of the sole
negligence or willful misconduct of the city and its elected and appointed
officials, officers, agents, consultants, and employees. The City Attorney and/
or Rick Manager shall have the authority to agree to alternative terms for
indemnity that provide equivalent protection to the City.
   N.   Should the utility company servicing the facility have the ability to
offer electrical service that does not require the use of an above-ground meter
cabinet, the permittee must, at its sole cost and expense, remove the meter
cabinet and any related foundation within 90 days of such service being offered
and restore the area to its prior condition. An extension may be granted by the
director if he or she finds good cause therefor.
   O.   Relocation. The permittee must modify, remove, or relocate its
facility, or portion thereof, without cost or expense to city, if and when made
necessary by (i) any public improvement project, including, but not limited to,
the construction, maintenance, or operation of any underground or above-ground
facilities including, without limitation, sewers, storm drains, conduits, gas,
water, electric or other utility systems, or pipes owned by city or any other
public agency, (ii) any abandonment of any street, sidewalk or other public
right-of-way, or (iii) any change of grade, alignment or width of any street,
sidewalk or other public right-of-way. Such modification, removal, or
relocation of the facility must be completed within 90 days of notification by
city unless, in the opinion of the director, exigent circumstances dictate a
shorter period for removal or relocation. Modification or relocation of the
facility shall require submittal, review and approval of a modified permit
pursuant to the code including applicable notice and hearing procedures. The
permittee shall be entitled, on permittee’s election, to either a pro-rata
refund of fees paid for the original permit or to a new permit, without
additional fee, at a location as close to the original location as the
standards set forth in the code allow. In the event the facility is not
modified, removed, or relocated within the prescribed period of time, city may
cause the same to be done at the sole cost and expense of permittee. Further,
if exigent circumstances so require, including those of immediate or imminent
threat to the public’s health and safety, the city may modify, remove, or
relocate wireless communications facilities without prior notice to permittee
provided permittee is notified within a reasonable period thereafter.
   P.   Permittee must agree in writing that the permittee is aware of, and
agrees to abide by, all conditions of approval imposed by the wireless
communications facility permit. No building permit for a wireless
communications facility can be issued until a signed affidavit of acceptance of
conditions is filed with the city.
   Q.   Prior to the issuance of any encroachment permit, permittee may be
required to enter into a right-of-way agreement with the city in accordance
with the city’s past practice. (Ord. 1618, 6-16-2020)
9-9-10: OPERATION, AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS:
   A.   All wireless communications facilities must comply with the following
operation and maintenance standards at all times:
   B.   Unless otherwise provided herein, all necessary repairs and restoration
must be completed by the permittee, owner, operator or any designated
maintenance agent within 48 hours:
      1.   After discovery of the need by the permittee, owner, operator or any
designated maintenance agent; or
      2.   After permittee, owner, operator or any designated maintenance agent
receives notification from the city.
   C.   All facilities, including, but not limited to, communication towers,
poles, accessory equipment, cabinets and the facility site must be maintained
in good condition, including ensuring the facilities are reasonably free of:
      1.   General dirt and grease;
      2.   Chipped, faded, peeling, and cracked paint;
      3.   Rust and corrosion;
      4.   Cracks, dents, and discoloration;
      5.   Graffiti, bills, stickers, advertisements, litter and debris;
      6.   Broken and misshapen structural parts; and
      7.   Any visible damage from any cause.
   D.   Each facility must be operated and maintained in compliance with all
conditions of approval.
   E.   No person shall install, operate or maintain any facility which in
whole or in part rests upon, in or over any public right-of-way when such
installation, operation or maintenance endangers or is reasonably likely to
endanger the safety of persons or property. No facility located in or over the
public right-of-way may be installed, operated, or maintained in a manner that
interferes with a public utility, public transportation, a governmental use,
ingress/egress to any residence or place of business, or any traffic sign or
signal, fire hydrant, mailbox, permitted sidewalk use (e.g., outdoor dining),
or permitted street furniture. (Ord. 1618, 6-16-2020)
9-9-11: REMOVAL AND RESTORATION UPON REVOCATION OR ABANDONMENT:
   A.   Cessation of use or Abandonment: A permittee must notify the director
of the intent to vacate a site at least 30 days prior to the vacation. The
permit for any facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 180
days shall be deemed lapsed and the facility considered abandoned unless (1)
the city has received a notice of the intent to transfer the permit to another
service provider; and (2) the transferee has resumed operation of the facility
within 90 days of the city’s receipt of the transfer notice.
   B.   Upon revocation of a permit or abandonment of a facility, the
permittee, owner or operator must remove its wireless communications facility
and restore the site to its original condition, except for retaining the
landscaping and any other improvements at the discretion of the city. Removal
must be completed in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. The
facility must be removed at no cost or expense to the city.
   C.   Failure of the permittee, owner or operator to promptly remove its
facility and restore the property within 180 days after expiration, earlier
termination or revocation of the permit, or abandonment of the facility, is a
violation of this code. Upon a showing of good cause, an extension may be
granted by the director where circumstances are beyond the control of the
permittee after expiration. The unexcused failure to abide by the timeline
provided in this section shall be grounds for:
      1.   Prosecution;
      2.   Acting on any security instrument required by this chapter or
conditions of approval of permit;
      3.   Removal of the facilities by the city in accordance with the
procedures established under this code for abatement of a public nuisance at
the owner’s expense; and/or
      4.   Any other remedies provided by law.
   D.   Summary Removal. In the event the director or city engineer determines
that the condition or placement of a wireless communications facility located
in the public right-of-way constitutes a dangerous condition, obstruction of
the public right-of-way, or an imminent threat to public safety, or determines
other exigent circumstances require immediate corrective action (collectively,
“exigent circumstances”), the director or city engineer may cause the facility
to be removed summarily and immediately without advance notice or a hearing.
Written notice of the removal shall include the basis for the removal and shall
be served upon the permittee and person who owns the facility within five
business days of removal and the property removed shall be preserved for the
owner’s pick-up if it is feasible for the city to do so. If the owner cannot be
identified following reasonable effort or if the owner fails to pick-up the
property within 30 days, the facility will be considered abandoned property and
the city may dispose of it as it sees fit.
   E.   Removal of Facilities by city. In the event the city removes a facility
in accordance with nuisance abatement procedures or summary removal, any such
removal shall be without any liability to the city for any damage to such
facility that may result from removal. In addition to the procedures for
recovering costs of nuisance abatement, the city may collect such costs from
the performance bond posted and to the extent such costs exceed the amount of
the performance bond, collect those excess costs in accordance with this code
or other applicable law. Unless otherwise provided herein, the city has no
obligation to store any portion of a removed facility. Neither the permittee,
owner nor operator shall have any claim if the city destroys any portion of the
facility not timely removed by the permittee, owner or operator after notice,
or removed by the city due to exigent circumstances. (Ord. 1618, 6-16-2020)

of all liquid-carried wastes to the sewer system of the City. This Title shall
also apply to discharges of all liquid wastes into the City's storm drainage
system and all waters of the State. (Ord. 1093, 1-20-1987)
12-1-4: SCOPE:
This Title provides for the regulation of discharges into the City sewer system
through the issuance of permits for industrial wastewater discharge containing
specific discharge requirements, as well as other permits, and through
enforcement of general discharge prohibitions; imposes regulations for waste
pretreatment and for sewer construction within the City; authorizes monitoring
and enforcement activities; imposes reporting requirements on specific permits;
sets the quantity and quality of discharged wastes; establishes penalties for
violation of provisions of this Title; and sets fees for the recovery of
program costs. This Title is applicable to all discharges within the City and

12-1-6: LIQUID WASTE DISPOSAL POLICY:
   A.   General: Generally, liquid wastes originating within the City will be
removed by the City sewer system, unless the wastes cause damage to structures,
create nuisances such as odors, menace public health, impose unreasonable
collection, treatment or disposal costs on the City, violate quantity and
quality requirements prescribed by State and Federal laws, interfere with
wastewater treatment processes, violate applicable State and Federal laws, or
detrimentally affect the environment.
   B.   Cesspools And Septic Tanks: The disposal of sewage by means of septic
tanks and cesspools or leach fields is a nonconforming sewer facility in the
City and their use is to be discontinued pursuant to subsection
12-1-3A of this Chapter. If it can be demonstrated to the Public Works Director
that the continued use of such facilities is necessary because of geographical
or other conditions, then such use shall be permitted until public sewers are
installed making it unnecessary to use cesspools and septic tanks.
   C.   Highest And Best Use: The highest and best use of the City sewer system
is the conveyance, treatment and disposal of domestic wastewater. The use of
the City sewer system for the discharge of industrial wastewater is subject to
further regulation by the City.
   D.   Water Reclamation: In compliance with requirements of Federal and State
agencies, the City is or may be committed to a policy of wastewater and reuse
in order to provide an alternate source of water for nondomestic use and to
reduce costs of wastewater treatment and disposal.
   E.   Industrial Wastewater: In conformance with policies of Federal and
State agencies which establish higher standards of treatment plant effluent
quality, provisions are made in this Title for the regulation of industrial
wastewater discharges. This Title establishes quantity and quality limitations
on industrial wastewater discharges which may adversely affect the City sewer
system or effluent quality. Fees to recover costs from industrial wastewater
dischargers are also established where the dischargers impose inequitable
collection, treatment or disposal costs on the City. Optimum use of the City
facilities may require the Public Works Director to limit certain industrial
wastewater discharges to periods of low flow in the sewer system. (Ord. 1093,
1-20-1987)
12-1-7: MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SEWAGE PLANTS:
Sewage and industrial waste treatment plants and facilities shall only
discharge effluents to the City sewer system that meet the requirements of the
Public Works Director as described in an industrial wastewater discharge
permit. If the discharge is to a storm drain system, the requirements of the
California Regional Water Quality Control Board must be met. (Ord. 1093, 1-20-
1987)
12-1-8: MAINTENANCE OF SEWERS AND APPURTENANCES:
All house connection sewers, house sewers, industrial connection sewers,
clarifiers, sewage and industrial waste treatment facilities, private
pretreatment plants, sewage pumping plants, and their appurtenances shall be
maintained in good operating condition and in conformity with applicable law by
the owner of the property which such facilities serve. (Ord. 1093, 1-20-1987)

12-4-9: ANNUAL QUALITY SURCHARGE FEE:
   A.   Formula: Every person granted an industrial waste permit under this
Title shall pay an annual quality surcharge fee for wastes discharged into the
sanitary sewer system pursuant to the following formula:
      C = V [a(SS-250) + b(BOD - 180)] k
      where "C" is the quality surcharge fee;
      "V" is the average daily volume of waste discharged in gallons, based on:
         1.   The volume of water supplied to the premises less an amount
determined by the Public Works Director to account for water not discharged
into the sanitary sewer system; or
         2.   The metered volume of waste discharged into the sanitary sewer
system according to a measuring device approved by the Public Works Director;
or
         3.   A figure determined by the Public Works Director based on any
other equitable method;
      "SS" is the suspended solids in the waste discharged, expressed in
milligrams per liter;
      "BOD" is the five (5) day biochemical oxygen demand of the waste
discharged, expressed in milligrams per liter;
      "a" is the cost assessed for each pound of suspended solids, and such
cost shall be fixed and established from time to time by the City Council by
resolution; presently $ 0.29/lb.
      "b" is the cost assessed for each pound of biochemical oxygen demand, and
such cost shall be fixed and established from time to time by the City Council
by resolution; presently $0.11/lb.
      "k" 365 x 8.34/1,000,000, a dimensional constant to convert C to dollars.
If the term containing SS or BOD is negative, a value of zero shall be used for
that term.
SS and BOD analyses shall be made in accordance with "Standard Methods". In
determining the annual quality surcharge fee, the Public Works Director may use
industrial averages for SS and BOD values. The Public Works Director may group
permit holders into discharge volume ranges. Where volume measurement at the
premises of a permit holder is impractical for physical, economic or other
reasons, these volume ranges may be used in establishing the quality surcharge
fee. (Ord. 1237, 4-4-1995)
   B.   Appeal From Annual Quality Surcharge Fee: Any permit holder whose
annual quality surcharge fee has been determined in the manner provided and who
believes the discharge volume range applied to his premises is incorrect, may
submit engineering data to the Public Works Director. If the Public Works
Director finds the discharge of the permit holder differs significantly from
the volume range which was applied, he may adjust the fee.
   C.   Review Of Annual Surcharge Fee: The Public Works Director shall
annually review the rates assessed in subsection A of this Section for SS and
BOD and make a written recommendation to the City Council concerning rate
adjustments necessary to recover revenue from industrial waste dischargers to
pay the cost to the City of treating sewer discharge in excess of domestic
quality. (Ord. 1093, 1-20-1987)
12-4-10: ANNUAL COST OF TREATMENT FEE:
An annual cost of treatment fee of from twenty five dollars ($25.00) to one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for a fee per unit of offending constituent as set
by the Public Works Director shall be paid by permit holders who discharge
wastes that impose unusual monitoring, maintenance, or capital costs on the
City which are unrelated to total flow volume, SS or BOD, or peak flow rates.
Such fees shall be calculated to defray costs attributable to such wastes.
(Ord. 1093, 1-20-1987)
12-4-11: DUE DATES:
The annual inspection fee, quality surcharge fee, and the cost of treatment fee
shall be paid annually in advance of one of four (4) dates as follows:
If The Permit Is Granted Between      The Due Date Of The Annual Fee Shall Be
Jan. 1 and Mar. 31, inclusive      April 1
April 1 and June 30, inclusive      July 1

fees, but not less than ten dollars ($10.00), shall be imposed and become
payable as part of the annual fees. If said fees and additional charges are not
paid on or before thirty (30) days after the last day of the month in which
said fees were due, the permit shall be revoked pursuant to Section
12-4-13 of this Chapter. (Ord. 1093, 1-20-1987)

   A.   Authority: The Public Works Director shall suspend the permit of any
permit holder who fails to comply with the conditions of his permit or any
provision, rule, or regulation of this Title. Any person whose permit has been
suspended shall immediately discontinue the discharge of industrial waste, and
shall not resume such discharge or deposit until the permit has been
reinstated. The Public Works Director shall revoke any permit suspended
pursuant to this Section which is not reinstated within one year from the date
of suspension.
   B.   Reinstatement Of Permit: The Public Works Director shall reinstate a
suspended permit when all violations have been corrected and all new conditions
have been met. Before any revoked permit is reissued, all delinquent fees and
additional charges due and owing to the City shall be paid. (Ord. 1093, 1-20-
1987)

wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop a
discharge which presents an imminent hazard to the public health, safety or
welfare, to the local environment, or which either singly or by interaction
with other discharges, is an imminent hazard to the sewer system, the storm
drain system, or the waters of the State, or places the City in violation of
its NPDES permit.
   B.   Cease Discharge Upon Notice: Any discharger notified of a suspension of
that discharger's industrial wastewater permit shall immediately cease and
desist the discharge of all industrial wastewater to the sewer system.
   C.   Failure Of Discharge To Comply: In the event of a failure of the
discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Public Works
Director may take such steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure compliance.
These include, but are not limited to, immediate blockage or disconnection of
the discharger's connection to the sewer system.
   D.   Notice Of Intended Order Of Suspension: In addition, the Public Works
Director, in the event of violation of this Chapter, may serve the discharger
with a notice of an intended order of suspension, stating the reasons therefor,
the opportunity for a hearing with respect thereto, and the proposed effective
date of the intended order.
   E.   Request For Hearing; Council Determination: Any discharger suspended or
served with a notice of an intended order of suspension may file with the City
Clerk a request for a City Council hearing with respect thereto. Filing of such
a request shall not stay a suspension. In the event of a suspension of a permit
due to imminent hazard related to continued discharge, the discharger may
request a hearing, and the City Council or a hearing examiner designated by the
City Council for that purpose shall conduct a hearing within three (3) days of
receipt of the request. In the event of hearing requests, for other than an
imminent hazard suspension, the City Council shall hold a hearing on the
suspension within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the request. At the close of

shall reinstate the industrial wastewater permit upon proof of compliance which
ends the emergency nature of the hazard created by the discharge that had been
cause for the Public Works Director to initiate the suspension; provided, that
the Public Works Director is satisfied that all discharge requirements of this
Chapter, City Council rules and regulations, and any City Council order will be
implemented. (Ord. 1093, 1-20-1987)

condition that is likely to result in a discharge which presents an imminent
hazard to the public health, safety or welfare; or which either singly or by
interaction with other discharges, is an imminent hazard to the sewer system;
or which places the City in violation of its NPDES permit. In the pursuit of
such an operation, City personnel, any party contracting with the City, or duly
authorized representative of another government agency shall have immediate
access to the premises. The Public Works Director may prohibit approach to the
scene of such emergency by any person, vehicle, vessel or thing, and all

Pursuant to California Government Code section 50022.2, the California Building
Code, 2022 Edition, published at title 24, part 2, of the California Code of
Regulations, including Appendices F, H, I, and J ("CBC") is adopted by
reference, subject to the amendments, additions and deletions set forth below.
One true copy of the CBC is on file in the office of the Building Official and

amd. Ord. 1596, 11-19-2019; Ord. 1641, 11-15-2022)
13-1-2: AMENDMENTS TO CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE:
The California Building Code adopted pursuant to Section 13-1-1 is hereby
amended as follows:
Section 105.1 of Chapter 1 of the CBC is amended to read as follows:
   105.1 Permit Required.
   Any owner or authorized agent who intends to construct, enlarge, alter,
repair, move, demolish, or change the occupancy of a building or structure, or
to erect, install, enlarge, alter, repair, remove, convert, or replace any
electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, the installation of which is
regulated by this code, or to cause any such work to be done, shall first make
application to the building official and obtain the required permit. Parking
lots shall not be paved, improved, striped, or restriped unless a separate
permit for each parking lot has first been obtained from the building official.
      Exception: A separate permit shall not be required to pave, improve,
stripe, or restripe a parking lot when such work is included in the scope of
another project for which a building permit has been issued and when the design
of such parking lot was included in the plan check review of such project.
Subsection 14 is added to § 105.2 of Chapter 1 of the CBC as follows:
   105.2 Work exempt from permit.
   Building:
      14. Block wall and concrete fences not over 3 feet 6 inches high.

   105.3.2 Expiration of Plan Check.
      An application for a permit for any proposed work is deemed abandoned 12
months after the application date. Unless otherwise provided, after expiration
of the application, the City will not issue a permit until the plans are
rechecked and approved and a new fee is paid.
         Exception: The Building Official may grant extensions of time for
additional periods not exceeding 90 days each if a permit applicant submits in
writing sufficient evidence that unusual conditions or circumstances precluded
the securing of the permit within the allocated time.
Section 105.8 Chapter 1 of the CBC is added to read as follows:
   105.8 Responsibility of permittee.
   Building permits shall be presumed by the city to incorporate all of the
work that the applicant, the applicant's agent, employees and/or contractors
shall carry out. Said proposed work shall be in accordance with the approved
plans and with all requirements of this code and any other laws or regulations
applicable thereto. No city approval shall relieve or exonerate any person from
the responsibility of complying with the provisions of this code nor shall any
vested rights be created for any work performed in violation of this code.
Section 109.4 of Chapter 1 of the CBC is amended to read as follows:
   109.4 Work commencing before permit issuance.
   Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas,
mechanical or plumbing system before obtaining the necessary permits shall be
subject to a fee in addition to the normally established permit fee, equal to
100% of such normally established permit fee, or as otherwise determined by the
building official.
Section 109.6.1 of Chapter 1 of the CBC is added to read as follows:
   109.6.1 Plan check fees refund.
   No portion of the plan check fee shall be refunded unless plan review has
not been performed, in which case 80 percent of the plan check fee shall be
refunded upon written application for refund submitted by the person who made
original payment of such fee and with the written consent of the owner of the
real property on which the work was proposed to be done. The Building Official
shall determine, in such official's discretion, whether an applicant is
qualified to receive a refund. After 180 days have elapsed from the date of the
submittal for plan check, no plan check fees shall be refunded. In the event
subsequent application for plan check is made by a person who has received a
refund, the full amount of all required fees shall be paid as elsewhere
provided in this chapter.
Section 109.6.2 of Chapter 1 of the CBC is added to read as follows:
   109.6.2 Permit fees refund.
   In the event any person shall have obtained a building permit and no portion
of the work or construction covered by such permit shall have commenced, nor
any inspection performed by any City employee, and notice of abandonment has
been received from the owner of the real property on which such work would have
been performed, the permittee, upon presentation to the Building Official of a
written request for refund, shall be entitled to a refund in an amount equal to
80 percent of the building permit fee actually paid for such permit. The
Building Official shall determine, in such official's discretion, whether an
applicant is qualified to receive a refund. After 12 months have elapsed from
the date of the issuance of the permit, no permit fees shall be refunded. In
the event subsequent application for a permit is made by a person who has
received a refund, the full amount of all required fees shall be paid as
elsewhere provided in this chapter.
      Exception:
      1. If a permit has been issued for a project located in an area outside
the jurisdiction of the City, 100 percent of the permit and plan checking fee
may be refunded.
      2. If a duplicate permit has been erroneously issued, 100 percent of the
duplicated permit and plan checking fee may be refunded.
Section 109.7 of Chapter 1 of the CBC is added to read as follows:
   109.7 Re-inspections.
   A re-inspection fee in the amount set by City Council resolution may be
assessed for each inspection or re-inspection when such portion of work for
which inspection is called is incomplete or when required corrections are not
made. This section is not to be interpreted as requiring re-inspection fees the
first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of
this code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before
the job is ready for such inspection or re-inspection. Re-inspection fees may
be assessed when the inspection record card is not posted or otherwise
available on the work site, the approved plans are not readily available to the
inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is
requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the building
official. In instances where re-inspection fees have been assessed, no
additional inspection of the work will be performed until required fees have
been paid.
Section 110.1.1 of Chapter 1 of the CBC is added to read as follows:
   110.1.1 Setback Certification required.
   A California State licensed surveyor is required to certify the location and
setbacks of all new construction prior to the first foundation inspection. A
copy of the certification shall be available to the Building Division inspector
for the job file prior to the first inspection.
      Exception: Wherever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying
out the provisions of this section, the Building Official shall have the
authority to grant modifications for individual cases.
Section 113.3 of Chapter 1 of the CBC is amended to read as follows:
   113.3 Board of Appeals.
   The board of appeals consists of members of the Planning Commission. The
term of a board of appeals member will coincide with the term of service as a
Planning Commissioner and will terminate should the member cease serving as a
Planning Commissioner. The building official is the secretary to the board. The
board may adopt reasonable rules and regulations for conducting its
investigations and will render all its decisions and findings on contested
matters, in writing to the building official, with a duplicate copy for any
appellant or contestant affected by such decision or finding, and may recommend
to the city council appropriate new legislation.
   Three members of the board constitute a quorum. The Planning Chairperson is
the board's chairperson and in the chairperson's absence the board will select
a temporary chairperson.
   The city will assess a filing fee set by City Council resolution, or a
higher amount set by resolution, at the time that an appellant file appeal of
any order, decisions, or determination made by the building official relative
to the application and interpretation of this code. The filing fee is
refundable should the appellant prevail in a decision by the board. The appeal
must be taken by filing a written notice of appeal, in letterform, to the board
of appeals. The board's decision constitutes the city's final decision.
Section 113.4 of Chapter 1 of the CBC is added to read as follows:
   113.4 Access Board of Appeals.
      A.   There shall be a Disability Access Board of Appeals ("Access Board
of Appeals") to consist of five members. Each member shall be appointed and
hold office in accordance with procedures established by resolution of the City
Council. Three of the five members shall be members of the Building Board of
Appeals, and shall be co-appointed by the City Council to be a member of the
Building Board of Appeals and the Access Board of Appeals. Two of the five
members shall be "physically handicapped persons" (as defined by California
Health and Safety Code Section 19957.5).
      B.   The Access Board of Appeals shall be considered a "standing
committee" with a continuing subject matter jurisdiction. Thus, the Access
Board of Appeals shall be subject to the requirements of the Brown Act
(California Government Code Section 54950 et seq.); however, the Access Board
of Appeals shall have no regular meetings, and all meetings shall be special
meetings noticed pursuant to California Government Code Section 54956. The
Access Board of Appeals shall conduct its meetings in accordance with
procedures established by resolution of the City Council. The Access Board of

units and additions of habitable rooms to existing residential dwelling units
to protect public health, safety, and welfare from the effects of excessive
noise, including without limitation, indoor quality of life, speech
interference, and sleep disruption.
   1206.6.03 Applicability. This section applies to all newly constructed
residences and habitable room additions to existing residences.
   1206.6.04 Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following words
must have the following meaning:
   "Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL)" means the noise measure defined in
21 Code of California Regulations § 5001(d), and any successor regulation or
amendment.
   "Habitable Room" means a room that is a space in a structure for living,
sleeping, eating, or cooking. Bathrooms, toilet compartments, closets, halls,
storage or utility space, garages, and similar areas are not considered
habitable space.

13 of the El Segundo municipal code.
   1206.6.05: Standards.
   Any new residence or addition of one or more habitable rooms to an existing
residence that is within the noise impact boundary for LAX must be designed to
ensure that internal noise levels due to LAX do not exceed 45 dB CNEL. This
standard may be satisfied in two ways: (1) by performing the acoustical
analysis described in section 1206.6.06, below, or (2) by employing the
prescribed construction methods described in section 1206.6.07, below.
   1206.6.06: Acoustical Analysis.
   A building permit application for a new residence or addition of one or more
habitable rooms to an existing residence must comply with the minimum noise
insulation performance standards established in this section if it includes an
acoustical analysis demonstrating that the proposed design will ensure that
internal noise levels due to LAX aircraft noise will not exceed 45 dB CNEL. The
acoustical analysis shall be proven to meet the standard by providing post-
construction/pre-occupancy acoustic measurement to verify compliance with the
45 dB CNEL standard. The Building Official has the discretion to implement
policies that meet the intent of this code section.
      A.   The acoustical analysis must be prepared by a person experienced in
the field of acoustical engineering. The analysis must consider and include:
the topographical relationship between LAX aircraft noise sources and the
dwelling site, the characteristics of those noise sources, predicted noise
spectra and levels at the exterior of the dwelling site, the basis for this
prediction (measured or obtained from published data), the noise insulation
measures to be employed, and the effectiveness of the proposed noise insulation
measures.
      B.   If the interior allowable noise levels are to be met by requiring
that windows be unopenable or closed, the design for the structure must also
specify a ventilation or air-conditioning system to provide a habitable
interior environment, having at least 2 air exchanges per hour for the affected
rooms. The ventilation system must not compromise the interior room noise
reduction.

official. The building official shall, with the approval of the city manager,
recommend changes to the council when the costs to provide grading plan check
and grading inspection services make it appropriate.
      2.   The applicant shall pay a plan check fee prior to acceptance of
grading plans and specifications for checking by the city. The plan check fee
shall be based on the total volume of the excavation and fill, on the site. The
grading plan check fee shall be recalculated each time the grading plan volume
of excavation and fill exceeds the volume used to determine the original plan
check fee, and the applicant shall pay the difference between the revised and
original fee before the revised grading plans are accepted for review by the
city. The original grading plan check fee includes the cost to the applicant
for the original submittal plus two additional submittals of corrected grading
plans and specifications. When required by the building official, the applicant
shall pay a supplemental grading plan check fee in accordance with the fee
resolution established by the city council.
      3.   Whenever the applicant submits a grading plan for plan check that is
substantially different in design of the earthwork as compared to previously
submitted grading plans, the submittal shall be considered an original and a
new grading plan check fee shall be determined and paid to the city as provided
in this section.
      4.   The applicant shall pay a grading permit fee prior to the issuance
of a grading permit by the city. The fee shall be based on the total volume of
excavation and fill, on the site. If, during grading operations, the plans and
specifications for the grading project are revised increasing the volume of
excavation, fill, or a combination thereof above the volume that was used to
determine the grading permit fee, the applicant shall pay to the city the
difference between the original grading permit fee and the recalculated fee
before work may resume under the grading permit.
      5.   Whenever grading operations are commenced without an approved
grading permit, a penalty shall be added to all unpaid fees for grading plan
check and grading permits. The penalty shall be three hundred percent of all
fees due the city.

performance standards for new residential dwelling units and additions of
habitable rooms to existing residential dwelling units to protect public
health, safety, and welfare from the effects of excessive noise, including
without limitation, indoor quality of life, speech interference, and sleep
disruption.
   R341.3 Applicability.
   This section applies to all newly constructed residences and habitable room
additions to existing residences.
   R341.4 Definitions.
   For purposes of this section, the following words must have the following
meaning:
   "Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL)" means the noise measure defined in
21 Code of California Regulations § 5001(d), and any successor regulation or
amendment.
   "Habitable Room" means a room that is a space in a structure for living,
sleeping, eating, or cooking. Bathrooms, toilet compartments, closets, halls,
storage or utility space, garages, and similar areas are not considered
habitable space.
   "LAX" means Los Angeles International Airport.
   "Noise Impact Boundary for LAX" means the area around LAX as defined in 21
California code of regulations § 5001(1), and any successor regulation or
amendment. The city's building safety department must at all times maintain a
current map of the noise impact boundary. The latest published map by LAWA
located at the Building Safety Counter shall be used as the basis for
determination.
   "Residence" means any occupancy group R building as used in El Segundo Title
13 of the El Segundo municipal code.
   R341.5 Standards.
   Any new residence or addition of one or more habitable rooms to an existing
residence that is within the noise impact boundary for LAX must be designed to
ensure that internal noise levels due to LAX do not exceed 45 dB CNEL. This
standard may be satisfied in two ways: (1) by performing the acoustical
analysis described in section R341.1207.6.06, below, or (2) by employing the
prescribed construction methods described in section R341.1207.6.07, below.
   R341.6 Acoustical Analysis.
   A building permit application for a new residence or addition of one or more
habitable rooms to an existing residence must comply with the minimum noise
insulation performance standards established in this section if it includes an
acoustical analysis demonstrating that the proposed design will ensure that
internal noise levels due to LAX aircraft noise will not exceed 45 dB CNEL. The
acoustical analysis shall be proven to meet the standard by providing post-
construction/pre-occupancy acoustic measurement to verify compliance with the
45 dB CNEL standard. The Building Official has the discretion to implement
policies that meet the intent of this code section.
      A.   The acoustical analysis must be prepared by a person experienced in
the field of acoustical engineering. The analysis must consider and include:
the topographical relationship between LAX aircraft noise sources and the
dwelling site, the characteristics of those noise sources, predicted noise
spectra and levels at the exterior of the dwelling site, the basis for this
prediction (measured or obtained from published data), the noise insulation
measures to be employed, and the effectiveness of the proposed noise insulation
measures.
      B.   If the interior allowable noise levels are to be met by requiring
that windows be unopenable or closed, the design for the structure must also
specify a ventilation or air-conditioning system to provide a habitable
interior environment, having at least 2 air exchanges per hour for the affected
rooms. The ventilation system must not compromise the interior room noise
reduction.

13-12-3: BOND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Bond Required:
      1.   Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no house moving
permit shall be issued unless the applicant therefor shall first post with the
Building Inspector a bond executed by the owner of the premises where the
building or structure is to be located, as principal and by a surety company
authorized to do business in this State, as surety. The bond shall be subject
to the approval of the City Attorney as to form and, in the event of approval,
shall be filed with the Building Inspector.
      2.   The bond, which shall be in form joint and several, shall name the
City as obligee, and shall be in an amount equal to twice the cost of the work
required to be done in order to comply with all of the conditions of the house
moving permit, as estimated by the Building Inspector, and not less than two
thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00). In lieu of a surety bond, the
applicant may post a bond executed by the owner, as principal, which is secured
by a deposit of cash in the amount named above and conditioned as required in
the case of a surety bond; such as so executed is hereinafter called a "cash
bond" for the purpose of this Section.
   B.   Conditions:
      1.   Every bond posted pursuant to this Section shall be conditioned as
follows:
         a.   Each and all of the terms and conditions of this Chapter and of
the house moving permit shall be complied with to the satisfaction of the
Building Inspector;
         b.   All of the work required to be done pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the house moving permit shall be fully performed and completed,
within ninety (90) days after the date of the issuance by the Building
Inspector of the house moving permit. The time limit herein specified or the
time limit specified in any permit, may be extended for good and sufficient
cause by the Building Inspector.
      2.   No such extension of time shall be valid unless written and no such
extension shall release any surety upon any bond.
   C.   Default In Performance:
      1.   Whenever the Building Inspector shall find that a default has
occurred in the performance of any term or condition of any permit, written
notice thereof shall be given to the principal and to the surety on the bond.
The notice shall state the work to be done, the estimated cost thereof and the
period of time deemed by the Building Inspector to be reasonably necessary for
the completion of the work. After receipt of the notice, the surety must,
within the time limit therein specified, either cause the required work to be
performed or, failing therein, must pay to the Building Inspector twice the
estimated cost of doing the work, as set forth in the notice. Upon the receipt
of such money, the City shall proceed by such mode as it deems convenient, to
cause the required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall
be incurred therein other than for the expenditure of said sum of money in hand
therefor.
      2.   If a cash bond has been posted, notice of default as provided above
shall be given to the principal, and if compliance is not had within the time
specified, the City shall proceed without delay and without further notice of
proceedings whatever, to use the cash deposit, or any portion of the deposit,
to cause the required work to be done, by contract or otherwise, in the
discretion of the City. The balance, if any, of such cash deposit shall, upon
the completion of the work, be returned to the depositor, or to his successors
or assigns, after deducting the cost of the work, plus fifteen percent (15%)
thereof, to cover cost of supervision and direction of work of completion.
   D.   Option To Demolish: When any default has occurred, on the part of the
principal under the preceding provisions, the surety shall have the option, in
lieu of completing the work required, to demolish the building or structure,
and to clear, clean and restore the site, within ninety (90) days of said
default. If the surety defaults, the City shall have the same option. (Ord.
671, 10-9-1967)
   E.   Term: The term of each bond posted pursuant to this Chapter shall begin
upon the date of the posting thereof and shall end upon the completion, to the
satisfaction of the Building Inspector, of the performance of all the terms and
conditions of the house moving permit. The completion shall be evidenced by a
statement of completion signed by the Building Inspector, a copy of which shall
be filed with the City Clerk. The City Clerk, upon receipt of a copy of the
statement, shall and is, hereby authorized and directed to exonerate the bond
and furnish a letter of exoneration to any surety or principal upon the bond
upon request. When a cash bond has been posted, the cash shall be returned to
the depositor, or to his successors or assigns, upon the termination of the
bond, except any portion thereof that may have been used or deducted as
elsewhere in this Section provided. (Ord. 687, 3-11-1968)
   F.   Access: The Building Inspector, the surety, and the duly authorized
representatives of either, shall have access to the premises described in the
house moving permit for the purpose of inspecting the progress of the work. In
the event of any default in the performance of any term or condition of the
house moving permit with reference to the relocation of a structure, the
surety, or any person employed or engaged on its behalf, or the Building
Inspector, or any person employed or engaged on his behalf, shall have the
right to go upon the premises to complete the required work or to remove or
demolish the building or structure. It is unlawful for the owner, or his
representatives, successors, or assigns or any other person, to interfere with
or obstruct the ingress to or egress from the premises of any authorized
representative or agent of any surety or of the City engaged in the work of
completing, demolishing or removing any building or structure for which a house
moving permit has been issued, after a default has occurred in the performance
of the terms or conditions thereof. (Ord. 671, 10-9-1967)
13-12-4: EXAMINATION OF BUILDING; POSTING NOTICE:
Upon receiving an application for a permit to move a building, the Building
Inspector shall make an examination of the building described in the
application and shall examine the proposed location. If it is found that no
ordinance or law will be violated and that the public welfare, safety or peace
will not be endangered, he shall cause a notice to be posted on the front of
the building which is desired to be moved. The notice shall also state the
location of the house by street and number, and the location of the lot or land
to which it is proposed to move said building, together with the name of the
applicant. (Ord. 671, 10-9-1967)
13-12-5: APPEAL:
The applicant, or any person who may feel aggrieved by any ruling or action of
the Building Inspector, may appeal to the City Council within ten (10) days for
hearing thereon, whereupon the City Council shall hear the same and make its
final determination of the matter in accordance with the information presented.

per year, plus two cents ($0.02) per barrel. The fee shall be payable annually
in advance and shall be based on an estimate of the number of barrels
anticipated to be produced during the license period. Upon renewal of the
license, the estimate of the number of barrels upon which the previous license
fee was calculated shall be adjusted to reflect the actual number of barrels
produced; and a new estimate for the renewal license period shall be submitted,
but in no case shall the estimate be less than the fee paid for the preceding
tax period. If the actual number of barrels exceeds the estimate, the licensee

substance from a flowing well, and as long as the derrick remains standing, and
until the well referred to in the permit has been fully, completely and
satisfactorily abandoned in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
Division of Oil and Gas of the Department of Natural Resources of the State and
of the City, relating to the abandonment of the wells, and until the premises
relating to the well have been cleaned up and restored as nearly as reasonably
possible to the same condition as that in which they existed at the time of the
granting of the permit. (Ord. 1054, 8-16-1983)

due and payable on the date of the granting of the respective permits by the
City Council. The annual fees or charges prescribed in this Chapter shall
thereafter become due and payable to the Chief Financial Officer on the first
day of each and every calendar year. If any license fee or operating charge
prescribed is not paid within fifteen (15) days after the same becomes due and
payable, a penalty shall accrue upon the same, in the sum of twenty five
dollars ($25.00). Unless the license fee and the penalty thereon are paid
within fifteen (15) days after the date upon which the same become delinquent,
then and in that event the City Council may declare the permits forfeited, and
all rights of the permittee therein named thereunder shall cease and terminate.

13-14A-11: Supplemental To Land Use Plan
13-14A-1: PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES:
   A.   It is hereby declared that oil drilling and oil production and related
processes when conducted in "urbanized areas", as the term is herein defined,
may be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare; and that
the extension of oil drilling into such areas in the City in which drilling has
not already been permitted is justified only by reason of recognizing the
material and social value of developing natural resources; that oil and other
hydrocarbon substances constitute property within the meaning of the
constitutional provisions guaranteeing the right of ownership and enjoyment of
such property; by recognizing also the similar constitutional guarantees for
the enjoyment of the surface use of real property and improvements thereon; and
the need for invoking such reasonable controls over both the subsurface and
surface use of property as may be necessary to assure maximum enjoyment of each
with minimum restrictions to either. It is, therefore, declared to be the
object and purpose of this Article to establish reasonable and uniform
limitations, safeguards and controls for the future drilling for and production
of oil or other hydrocarbon substances in the urbanized areas of the City.
   B.   More restrictive limitations, safeguards and controls than those which
have heretofore been imposed in metropolitan and urbanized areas are deemed
necessary in the public interest to effect practices which will not only
provide for a more economic recovery of oil, gas and other hydrocarbon
substances, but which will also take into consideration the surface uses of
land, as such uses are indicated by the value and character of the existing
improvements in or near districts where oil drilling or production are
hereinafter permitted, the desirability of the area for residential or other
uses, or any other factor relating to the public health, comfort, safety and
general welfare. It is contemplated that extensive urbanized areas may be
explored for oil by directional drilling methods by which surface drilling and
production operations are limited to a few small, controlled drilling sites so
located and spaced as to cause the least detriment to the community and to the
public health, safety, comfort and general welfare. (Ord. 312, 5-7-1947)
13-14A-2: DEFINITIONS:
The following words and phrases when used in this Article shall, for the
purposes of this Article, have the meanings respectively ascribed to them in
this Section:
   CONTROLLED DRILLING SITE: That particular location upon which surface
operations incident to oil well drilling or deepening and the production of oil
or gas may be permitted under the terms of this Chapter 15, pursuant to a
permit obtained; and by virtue of a variance granted by the Zoning Ordinance.
   URBANIZED AREAS: Shall refer to any improved or vacant property in
residential, business or light industrial zones, as defined in the Zoning
Ordinance of the City, Title 15 of this Code. (Ord. 312, 5-7-1947)
13-14A-3: CREATION OF DISTRICTS; APPLICATION:
   A.   Governing Provisions:
      1.   The provisions of this Article shall apply to the creation of all
oil drilling districts in urbanized areas. The provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance relating to variances shall govern the procedure relative to the
creation of oil drilling districts in urbanized areas. In addition to the
procedure set forth in the Zoning Ordinance relating to variances, the City
Planning Commission shall, by written resolution, find that the property
involved is in an "urbanized area" as herein defined, and the resolution shall
contain a statement setting forth the physical improvements, amount of land
subdivided, zoning and other pertinent considerations upon which the finding is
based.
      2.   Where uncertainty exists as to whether a particular area shall be
considered urbanized, any person contemplating filing a petition for the
creation of an oil drilling district may, prior to the filing thereof, request
the Planning Commission to determine the status of the area sought to be
included in the district. The Planning Commission shall thereafter, by written
resolution, determine the status of the area, based upon the considerations
mentioned in this Section, and in the resolution shall state the facts upon
which the determination is based.
   B.   Authority Of Applicant; District Boundaries: Each application for the
creation of an oil drilling district under the provisions of this Article shall
contain a statement that the applicant has the proprietary or contractual
authority to drill for and produce oil, gas or other hydrocarbon substances
under the surface of at least fifty one percent (51%) of the property to be
included in the district. The district described in the application shall be
not less than twenty (20) acres in area, including all streets, ways and alleys
within the boundaries thereof, and shall be substantially compact in area, and
the boundaries thereof shall follow public streets, ways or alleys so far as
may be practicable. (Ord. 312, 5-7-1947)
13-14A-4: STANDARD CONDITIONS:
All oil drilling districts established under the provisions of this Article
shall be subject to the conditions in the following subsections:
   A.   Minimum Area; Location: Each district shall not be less than twenty
(20) acres in area, including all streets, ways and alleys within the
boundaries thereof; provided further, that if a proposed district is not
adjacent to an existing district, that the area in between shall be of such
size as to allow a suitable future district to be formed.
   B.   Site Number And Area:
      1.   Not more than one controlled drilling site shall be permitted for
each twenty (20) acres in any district and the site shall not be larger than
two (2) acres when used to develop a district approximating the minimum size;
provided, however, that where the site is to be used for the development of
larger oil drilling districts or where the Planning Commission and City Council
require that more than one oil drilling district be developed from one
controlled drilling site, the site may, at the discretion of the Planning
Commission and City Council, be increased by not more than two (2) acres for
each twenty (20) acres included in the district.
      2.   An alternative standard of locating drilling sites may be employed
in any part of the urbanized areas where permanent building improvements do not
occupy more than one-third (1/3) of the property within a radius of four
hundred feet (400') from any proposed drilling site; provided further, that
drilling sites for individual wells as provided in this subsection shall be
located not closer than four hundred feet (400') to any other well; and,
provided further, that individual wells thus drilled shall not exceed one to
each five (5) acres comprising any drilling area as defined in this subsection.
   C.   Well Number: The number of wells which may be drilled from any
controlled drilling site shall not exceed one well to each five (5) acres in
the district to be exploited from the site.
   D.   Drilling Variance: Each applicant for a variance to drill for and
produce oil, gas or other hydrocarbon substances on a controlled drilling site
must have the proprietary or contractual authority to drill for oil under the
surface of at least fifty one percent (51%) of the property in the district to
be exploited.
   E.   Property Owner Participation:
      1.   Concurrently with the filing of an application for the establishment
of an oil drilling district, the applicant shall execute and file in favor of
each owner of lands within the district for which the application is made and
who is not then a party to the oil and gas lease, operating agreement or other
contract under which the applicant claims the right to conduct oil development
operations, a written offer giving to each owner the right to participate in
the proceeds of the production by exercising either of the following options:
         a.   To join within one year from the date thereof in the execution of
the oil and gas lease, operating agreement or other contract under which
applicant claims the right to conduct oil drilling operations within the
district; or
         b.   At any time prior to the commencement of drilling operations in
connection with the first well to give applicant written notice of owner's
election to participate with applicant in the development and operations in the
district as a tenant in common and agree to advance his pro rata share of the
cost of the drilling and development operations, owner's interest to be

Section 2-4 Demolition Criteria:
   A.   If after the event, and during any state of emergency, the director of
community development determines that any building or structure poses an
imminent threat to public health and safety and that protection of the public
health and safety requires immediate demolition of the building or structure,
or a portion of a building or structure, the director or his designee shall,
without contacting the owner or providing a hearing to the property owner,
order that said building or structure be demolished immediately. Upon the order
of the director or designee, the city shall immediately demolish said building
or structure. Such demolition shall be performed in the interest of public
health and safety without condemnation hearings otherwise required by the El

   A.   Public Safety: The purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety
and welfare by reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the
effects of earthquakes on unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings
constructed before 1934. Such buildings have been widely recognized for their
sustaining of life hazardous damage as a result of partial or complete collapse
during past moderate to strong earthquakes.
   B.   Seismic Resistance: The provisions of this chapter are minimum
standards for structural seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the
risk of life loss or injury and will not necessarily prevent loss of life or
injury or prevent earthquake damage to an existing building which complies with
these standards. This chapter shall not require existing electrical, plumbing,
mechanical or fire safety systems to be altered unless they constitute a hazard
to life or property.
   C.   Identification And Classification: This chapter provides systematic
procedures and standards for identification and classification of unreinforced
masonry bearing wall buildings based on their present use. Priorities, time
periods and standards are also established under which these buildings are
required to be structurally analyzed and anchored. Where the analysis
determines deficiencies, this chapter requires the building to be strengthened
or demolished. (Ord. 1152, 3-6-1990; amd. Ord. 1538, 12-6-2016)

equal or exceed the minimum standards established herein or shall be removed
and replaced by new materials. Alternate methods of testing may be approved by
the division. The quality of mortar in all masonry walls shall be determined by
performing in-place shear tests or by testing eight inch (8") diameter cores.
Nothing shall prevent pointing with mortar of all the masonry wall joints
before the tests are first made. Prior to any pointing, the mortar joints must
be raked and cleaned to remove loose and deteriorated mortar. Mortar for
pointing shall be type S or N except masonry cements shall not be used. All
preparation and mortar pointing shall be done under the continuous inspection
of a registered special inspector. At the conclusion of the inspection, the
inspector shall submit a written report to the licensed engineer or architect
responsible for the seismic analysis of the building setting forth the result
of the work inspected. Such report shall be submitted to the division for
approval as part of the structural analysis. All testing shall be performed in
accordance with the requirements specified in this subsection by a testing
agency approved by the division. An accurate record of all such tests and their
location in the building shall be recorded and these results shall be submitted
to the division for approval as part of the structural analysis.

two (2) per wall or line of wall elements resisting a common force, or one per
one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet of wall surface, with a minimum
of eight (8) tests in any case. The exact test or core location shall be
determined at the building site by the licensed engineer or architect
responsible for the seismic analysis of the subject building.
      3.   In-Place Shear Tests: The bed joints of the outer wythe of the
masonry shall be tested in shear by laterally displacing a single brick
relative to the adjacent bricks in that wythe. The opposite head joint of the
brick to be tested shall be removed and cleaned prior to testing. The minimum
quality mortar in eighty percent (80%) of the shear tests shall not be less
than the total of thirty (30) psi plus the axial stress in the wall at the
point of the test. The shear stress shall be based on the gross area of both
bed joints and shall be that at which movement of the brick is first observed.
      4.   Core Tests: A minimum number of mortar test specimens equal to the
number of required cores shall be prepared from the cores and tested as
specified herein. The mortar joint of the outer wythe of the masonry core shall
be tested in shear by placing the circular core section in a compression
testing machine with the mortar bed joint rotated fifteen degrees (15°) from
the axis of the applied load. The mortar joint tested in shear shall have an
average ultimate stress of twenty (20) psi based on the gross area. The average
shall be obtained from the total number of cores made. If test specimens cannot
be made from cores taken, then the shear value shall be reported as zero.
   F.   Testing Of Shear Bolts:
      1.   One-fourth (1/4) of all new shear bolts and dowels embedded in
unreinforced masonry walls shall be tested by a registered special inspector

tests performed as specified in subsections E3 and E4 of this section.
         b.   Design stresses shall be related to test results obtained in
accordance with section
13-18-10, table 88-J of this chapter. Intermediate values between three (3) and
ten (10) psi may be interpolated.
      2.   Design Compression And Tension Values: Compression stresses for
unreinforced masonry having a minimum design shear value of three (3) psi shall
not exceed one hundred (100) psi. Design tension values for unreinforced
masonry shall not be permitted.
   H.   Rod Anchors; Testing: Five percent (5%) of the existing rod anchors
utilized as all or part of the required wall anchors shall be tested in pullout
by an approved testing laboratory. The minimum number tested shall be four (4)
per floor, with two (2) tests at walls with joists framing into the wall and
two (2) tests at walls with joists parallel to the wall. The test apparatus
shall be supported on the masonry wall at a minimum distance of the wall
thickness from the anchor tested. The rod anchor shall be given a preload of
three hundred (300) pounds prior to establishing a datum for recording
elongation. The tension test load reported shall be recorded at one-eighth inch
(1/8") relative movement of the anchor and the adjacent masonry surface.
Results of all tests shall be reported. The report shall include the test
results as related to the wall thickness and joist orientation. The allowable
resistance value of the existing anchors shall be forty percent (40%) of the
average of those tested anchors having the same wall thickness and joist
orientation.
   I.   Wall Anchorage; Testing: Qualification tests for devices used for wall
anchorage shall be tested with the entire tension load carried on the enlarged
head at the exterior face of the wall. Bond on the part of the device between
the enlarged head and the interior wall face shall be eliminated for the
qualification tests. The resistance value assigned the device shall be twenty
percent (20%) of the average of the ultimate loads. (Ord. 1152, 3-6-1990; amd.

13-18-11: ADOPTION OF APPENDIX V; VOLUNTARY SEISMIC RETROFIT:
§ 13-18-V100: Voluntary Earthquake Hazard Reduction In Existing Reinforced
Concrete And Reinforced Masonry Wall Buildings With Flexible Diaphragms.
§ 13-18-V101: Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety and welfare by reducing
the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of earthquakes on
reinforced concrete and masonry wall buildings with flexible diaphragms
designed under the building codes in effect before January 1, 1995. These
buildings are potentially hazardous and prone to significant damage, including
possible collapse, in a moderate to major earthquake. These structures
typically shelter large numbers of persons and property for retail, food
markets, food distribution centers, warehousing, aerospace, industrial/
manufacturing and general business and office use. Their continued use after an
earthquake is also essential to the local economy and its post- earthquake
recovery.
The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for structural seismic
resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of loss of life or injury
on both subject and adjacent properties and will not necessarily prevent all
earthquake damage to an existing building which complies with these standards.
This chapter cannot require existing electrical, plumbing, mechanical or fire
safety systems to be altered unless they constitute a hazard to life or
property.
This chapter provides voluntary retrofit standards for deficient wall anchorage
systems on structures that are not subject to the mandatory provisions of this
chapter. When fully followed, these standards will strengthen the portion of
the structure that is most vulnerable to earthquake damage.
§ 13-18-V102: Scope.
The voluntary provisions of this chapter apply to existing buildings of the
following types:
      1.   Cast-in-place reinforced concrete or masonry wall buildings with
flexible diaphragms designed under building codes in effect before January 1,
1995.
      2.   Tilt-up concrete wall buildings with flexible diaphragms designed
under the building codes in effect before January 1, 1995, but after January 1,
1976.
All existing reinforced masonry or concrete buildings with flexible diaphragms,
including tilt-up concrete wall buildings, designed under the building code in
effect on or after January 1, 1995, must be designed in conformance with
chapter 16 of the CBC.
§ 13-18-V103: Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, the applicable definitions in chapter 2,
chapter 16, chapter 19 and chapter 23 of this code; chapter 1, chapter 3,
chapter 4, chapter 5, chapter 6 and chapter 11 of ASCE 7, and the following
apply:
Anchorage System is the system of all structural elements and connections,
which support the concrete or masonry wall in the lateral direction, including
diaphragms and subdiaphragms, wall anchorage and continuity or cross tie
connectors in subdiaphragms and main diaphragms.
Commenced Construction is construction pursuant to a valid building permit that
has progressed to the point that one of the called inspections as required by
the department has been made and the work for which the inspection has been
called has been judged by the department to be substantial and has been
approved by the department.
Existing Building is an erected building for which a legal building permit and
a certificate of occupancy have been issued.
Flexible Diaphragm is any diaphragm constructed of wood structural panel,
diagonal or straight wood sheathing, metal decking without a structural
concrete topping, or horizontal rod bracing.
Historical Building is any building designated or currently in the process of
being designated as a historical building by an appropriate federal, state or
city jurisdiction.
Reinforced Concrete Wall is a concrete wall that has 50 percent or more of the
reinforcing steel required for reinforced concrete in chapter 19.
Reinforced Masonry Wall is a masonry wall that has 50 percent or more of the
reinforcing steel required by chapter 21.
Retrofit is strengthening or structurally improving the lateral force resisting
system of an existing building by alteration of existing or addition of new
structural elements.
Tilt-Up Concrete Wall is a form of precast concrete panel construction either
cast in the horizontal position at the site and after curing, lifted and moved
into place in a vertical position, or cast off-site in a fabricator's shop.
§ 13-18-V104: Analysis And Design.
V104.1. Wall Panel Anchorage. Concrete and masonry walls must be anchored to
all floors and roofs which provide lateral support for the wall. The anchorage
must provide a positive direct connection between the wall and floor or roof
construction capable of resisting a horizontal force equal to 30 percent of the
tributary wall weight for all buildings, and 45 percent of the tributary wall
weight for essential buildings, or a minimum force of 250 pounds per linear
foot of wall, whichever is greater. The required anchorage must be based on the
tributary wall panel assuming simple supports at floors and roof.
Exception: An alternate design may be approved by the building official when
justified by well-established principles of mechanics.
V104.2. Special Requirements For Wall Anchors And Continuity Ties. The steel
elements of the wall anchorage systems and continuity ties must be designed by
the allowable stress design method using a load factor of 1.7. The 1/3 stress
increase permitted by chapter 16 cannot be permitted for materials using
allowable stress design methods. The strength design specified in chapter 19
using a load factor of 2.0 in lieu of 1.4 for earthquake loading, must be used
for the design of embedment in concrete. Wall anchors must be provided to
resist out-of-plane forces, independent of existing shear anchors.
Exception: Existing cast-in-place shear anchors may be used as wall anchors if
the tie element can be readily attached to the anchors and if the engineer or
architect can establish tension values for the existing anchors through the use
of approved as-built plans or testing, and through analysis showing that the
bolts are capable of resisting the total shear load while being acted upon by
the maximum tension force due to seismic loading. Criteria for analysis and
testing must be determined by the building official.
Expansion anchors are not allowed without special approval of the building
official. Attaching the edge of plywood sheathing to steel ledgers is not
considered as complying with the positive anchoring requirements of the code;
and attaching the edge of steel decks to steel ledgers is not considered as
providing the positive anchorage of this code unless testing and analysis are
performed, which establish shear values for the attachment perpendicular to the
edge of the deck.
V104.3. Development Of Anchor Loads Into The Diaphragm. Development of anchor
loads into roof and floor diaphragms must comply with chapter 12 of ASCE 7.
Exception: If continuously tied girders are present, then the maximum spacing
of the continuity ties is the greater of the girder spacing or 24 feet (7315
mm). In wood diaphragms, anchorage cannot be accomplished by use of toe nails
or nails subject to withdrawal, nor must wood ledgers, top plates or framing be
used in cross-grain bending or cross- grain tension. The continuous ties
required by chapter 12 of ASCE 7 must be in addition to the diaphragm
sheathing. Lengths of development of anchor loads in wood diaphragms must be
based on existing field nailing of the sheathing unless existing edge nailing
is positively identified on the original construction plans or at the site. At
reentrant corners, continuity collectors may be required for existing return
walls not designed as shear walls, to develop into the diaphragm a force equal
to the lesser of the rocking or shear capacity of the return wall, or the
tributary shear but not exceeding the capacity of the diaphragm. Shear anchors
for the return wall must be commensurate with the collector force. If a truss
or beam other than rafters or purlins is supported by the return wall or by a
column integral with the return wall, an independent secondary column is
required to support the roof or floor members whenever rocking or shear
capacity of the return wall is governing.
V104.4. Anchorage At Pilasters. Anchorage of pilasters must be designed for the
tributary wall anchoring load per section V104.1 of this code, considering the
wall as a two-way slab. The edge of the two-way slab must be considered "fixed"
when there is continuity at pilasters, and considered "pinned" at roof or floor
levels. The pilasters or the walls immediately adjacent to the pilasters must
be anchored directly to the roof framing such that the existing vertical anchor
bolts at the top of the pilasters are by-passed without causing tension or
shear failure at the top of the pilasters.
Exception: If existing vertical anchor bolts at the top of the pilasters are
used for the anchorage, then additional exterior confinement must be provided.
The minimum anchorage at a floor or roof between the pilasters must be that
specified in section V104.1 of this code.
V104.5. Symmetry. Symmetry of connectors in the anchorage system is required.
Eccentricity may be allowed when it can be shown that all components of forces
are positively resisted and justified by calculations or tests.
V104.6. Minimum Roof Member Size. Wood members used to develop anchorage forces
to the diaphragm must be of minimum nominal width for new construction and
replacement. All such members must be designed for gravity and earthquake
forces as part of the wall anchorage system. For existing structural members,
the allowable stresses must be without the 1/3 stress increase per section
V104.2.
V104.7. Combination Of Anchor Types. To repair and retrofit existing buildings,
a combination of different anchor types of different behavior or stiffness is
prohibited. The capacity of the new and existing connectors cannot be added.
V104.8. Prohibited Anchors. Usage of connectors that were bent or stretched
from the intended use is prohibited.
V104.9. Crack And Damage Repairs, Evaluation Of Existing Structural
Alterations. The engineer or architect must report any observed structural
conditions and structural damage that have imminent life safety effects on the
buildings and recommend repairs. This includes alterations such as openings cut
in existing wall panels without a building permit. Evaluations and repairs must
be reviewed and approved by the building official.
V104.10. Miscellaneous. Existing mezzanines relying on the concrete or masonry
walls for vertical or lateral support must be anchored to the walls for the
tributary mezzanine load. Walls depending on the mezzanine for lateral support
must be anchored per sections V104.1, V104.2 and V104.3 of this code.
Exception: Existing mezzanines that have independent lateral and vertical
support need not be anchored to the concrete or masonry walls. Existing
interior masonry or concrete walls not designed as shear walls, which extend to
the floor above or to the roof diaphragm must also be anchored for out-of-
plane forces per section V104.1, V104.2 and V104.3 of this code. In the in-
plane direction, the walls may be isolated or must be developed into the
diaphragm for a lateral force equal to the lesser of the rocking or shear
capacity of the wall, or the tributary shear but not exceeding the diaphragm
capacity.
V104.11. Historical Buildings. Qualified historical buildings must be permitted
to use alternate building standards or deviations from this chapter in order to
preserve their original or restored architectural elements and features.
§ 13-18-V105: Materials Of Construction.
All materials permitted by this code.
§ 13-18-V106: Information Required On Plans.
V106.1. General. In addition to the seismic analysis required elsewhere in this
chapter, the licensed engineer or architect responsible for the seismic
analysis of the building must record the information required by this section
on the approved plans.
V106.2. Information Required. The plans must accurately reflect the results of
the engineering investigation and design and show all pertinent dimensions and
sizes for plan review and construction. The following must be provided:
      1.   Floor plans and roof plans must show the existing framing
construction, diaphragm construction, proposed wall anchors, cross-ties and
collectors. Existing nailing, anchors, ties and collectors must also be shown
on the plans if these are part of the design, and these structural elements
need to be verified in the field.
      2.   At elevations where there is alterations or damage, the details must
show the roof and floor heights, dimensions of openings, location and extent of
existing damage, and proposed repair.
      3.   Typical concrete or masonry wall sections with wall thickness,
height, and location of anchors must be provided.
      4.   Details must include the existing and new anchors and the method of
development of anchor forces into the diaphragm framing; existing and new
cross-ties, existing and new or improved support of the roof and floor girders
at pilasters or walls.
V106.3. Engineer's Or Architect's Statement. The responsible engineer or
architect must state on the approved plans, the following:
      1.   "I am responsible for this building's seismic strengthening design
of the tilt-up concrete wall anchorage system in compliance with the minimum
seismic resistance standards of chapter V1 of the California Building Code, as
adopted by the El Segundo Municipal Code." or when applicable:
      2.   "The Registered Deputy Inspector, required as a condition of the use
of structural design stresses requiring continuous inspection, will be
responsible to me, the California Licensed Engineer or Architect, as required
by Section 1704 of the California Building Code, as adopted by the El Segundo
Municipal Code."
§ 13-18-V107: Required Building Maintenance.
Every building within the scope of this chapter which has been analyzed to
demonstrate compliance or structurally altered to comply with the minimum
earthquake standards in this chapter must be maintained in conformity with the
requirements of this chapter in effect at the time of such analysis or
structural alteration.

application will be made available on the City's website and at City Hall.
   B.   Applicants may submit the required permit application and documents by
submitting them either via electronic mail or the internet or by delivering
them to the Community Development Department. An applicant's electronic
signature will be accepted on all forms, applications, and other documents in
lieu of a wet signature.
   C.   The building official, or designee, will adopt a checklist of all
requirements with which the charging stations must comply to be eligible for
expedited review. The electric vehicle charging station permit process,
standard(s) and checklist(s) must substantially conform to recommendations for
permitting of the "Zero-Emission Vehicles in California: Community Readiness
Guidebook" published by the Office of Planning and Research, including the
checklist and standards contained in the "Plug-In Electric Vehicle

additional information or documentation required to be eligible for expedited
permit issuance must be sent to the applicant within ten (10) days after
submission of the application. (Ord. 1555, 9-5-2017; amd. Ord. 1639, 9-20-2022)
13-21-6: PERMIT REVIEW REQUIREMENTS; APPEALS:
   A.   Review of an electric vehicle charging station permit application is
limited to whether the application meets local, State, and Federal health and
safety requirements, and whether the charging station poses any specific,
adverse impact on public health or safety. If the application meets the
requirements of the approved checklist and standards, and the proposed charging
station does not pose any specific, adverse impact upon public health or
safety, the building official must approve the application and issue any
required, nondiscretionary permits.
   B.   If the building official determines, based on the application, that the
proposed charging station could have a specific, adverse impact upon the public
health and safety, the building official may require an "electric vehicle
charging station use permit". The permit may include conditions designed to
mitigate the specific, adverse impact upon health and safety at the lowest
possible cost.
   C.   The building official must notify an applicant whether the application
has been approved and that a nondiscretionary permit will be issued, or,
alternatively, whether the applicant must obtain an electric vehicle charging
station use permit, within thirty (30) days after the submission of a complete
application.
   D.   An application for an electric vehicle charging station can only be
denied if the building official finds that: 1) the proposed installation would
have a specific, adverse impact upon public health or safety, and 2) there is
no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the adverse impact.
These findings must be presented in writing, must include the basis for the
rejection of the potential feasible alternative for preventing the adverse
impact, and must be based upon substantial evidence in the record.
   E.   A feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific,
adverse impact may include, but is not limited to, any cost-effective method,
condition, or mitigation imposed by the City on a prior successful application
for an electric vehicle charging station use permit, where the proposed
charging station is similarly situated to the charging station in that prior
successful application.
   F.   Any decision by the building official made pursuant to this chapter may
be appealed to the Board of Appeals in accordance with the California Building
Code, as adopted and amended by chapter 1 of this title. (Ord. 1555, 9-5-2017)

14-1-1: AUTHORITY:
The purpose of this title is to regulate and control the design and improvement
of subdivisions in conformance with the California Government Code. State law
allows cities to not only adopt local standards applicable to their
jurisdictions, but also requires adoption of provisions which reflect existing
state law. This title is therefore intended to highlight significant local
provisions which will be useful for the citizens of El Segundo and future
developers. However, all the provisions of this title shall not be construed as
the only requirements for subdivisions, but are intended to be used in
conjunction with the applicable provisions of state law and, as such, shall not
supersede those provisions. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993)
14-1-2: DEFINITIONS:
The following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed
to them:
   ADVISORY AGENCY: A designated official or an official body charged with the
duty of making investigations and reports on the design and improvement of
proposed divisions of real property, the imposing of requirements or conditions
thereon, or having the authority by local ordinance to approve, conditionally
approve or disapprove maps. The city has charged the planning commission with
this role.
   SUBDIVIDER: A person, firm, corporation, partnership or association who
proposes to divide, divides or causes to be divided, real property into a
subdivision for himself or for others, except that employees and consultants of
such persons or entities acting in such capacity are not "subdividers".
   SUBDIVISION: The division, by any subdivider, of any unit or units of
improved or unimproved land or any portion thereof, shown on the latest
equalized county assessment roll as a unit or as contiguous units, for the
purpose of sale, lease or financing, whether immediate or future, except for
leases of agricultural land for agricultural purposes. Property shall be
considered as contiguous units even if it is separated by roads, streets,
utility easement or railroad rights of way. "Subdivision" includes a
"condominium project", as defined in section 1351 of the California Civil Code,
a "community apartment project", as defined in section 11004 of the California
Business and Professions Code, or the conversion of five (5) or more existing
dwelling units to a "stock cooperative", as defined in section 11003.2 of the
California Business and Professions Code. As used in this section "agricultural
purposes" means the cultivation of food or fiber or the grazing or pasturing of
livestock.
   VESTING TENTATIVE MAP: A tentative map which has been filed, processed and
approved in accordance with the vesting tentative map statute, and this
chapter, and which has printed conspicuously on its face the words "Vesting
Tentative Map". (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993; amd. 2000 Code)
14-1-3: PARCEL MAPS REQUIRED:
   A.   Filing And Recording: A parcel map shall be filed and recorded for any
subdivision for which a tentative and final map is not required by the
subdivision map act 1  except for subdivisions created by short term leases
(terminable by either party on not more than 30 days' notice in writing) of a
portion of an operating right of way of a "railroad corporation" defined as
such by section 230 of the California Public Utilities Code; provided, however,
that upon a showing made to the director of community development, based upon
substantial evidence, that public policy necessitates such a map, this
exception shall not apply.
   B.   Requirements: Such maps shall meet all the requirements of the
subdivision map act, and of this title. Each such parcel map shall show all
dedications or offers of dedication thereon and the director of public works
may require in addition or substitution thereof at the director of public
work's option, such dedication or offers of dedication to be made by deed.

a street shall include a waiver of direct access rights to such street from any
property shown on a final map as abutting said street.
   B.   Dedication Of Parcels For Public Ways: The planning commission shall
require the subdivider to dedicate or make an irrevocable offer of dedication
of all parcels of land within the subdivision that are needed for streets,
alleys, including access rights, drainage, public utility easements, and other
public easements. The subdivider shall also improve or agree to improve all
streets, alleys, including access rights, drainage, public utility easements
and other public easements.
   C.   Install Improvements: The subdivider may be required to install
improvements which contain additional size, capacity or number for the benefit

by the city.
   D.   Reimbursement For Facilities: If a local drainage or sanitary sewer
plan or map has been adopted requiring payment of fees or has established an
area of benefit for bridges or major thoroughfares, the city may impose and
collect a reasonable charge on property within the area benefited. The city may
enter into reimbursement agreements with a subdivider to reimburse said
subdivider for the cost of said facilities.
   E.   Soils Report: A preliminary soils report, prepared by a civil engineer
registered in the state in accordance with section
14-1-9 of this chapter and based upon adequate test borings, shall be submitted
to the director of community development for every subdivision. A preliminary
soils report may be waived by the director of community development, provided
the director of community development finds that due to the knowledge the city
has as to qualities of the soils in the subdivision, no preliminary analysis is
necessary.
   F.   Grading And Erosion Control: Every map approved pursuant to this title
shall be conditioned on compliance with the requirements for grading and
erosion control, including the prevention of sedimentation or damage to off-
site property set forth in this code.
   G.   Fees: Development-related fees, intended to offset the cost of
providing both map checking and other required public services, may be applied
as warranted by the type and size of the subdivision.
   H.   Local Transit Facilities:
      1.   A requirement may be imposed for the dedication or irrevocable offer
of dedication of land within the subdivision for local transit facilities such
as bus turnouts, benches, shelters, landing pads and similar items which
directly benefit the residents of a subdivision consistent with section 66475.2
of the California Government Code if:
         a.   The subdivision as shown on the tentative map has the potential
for two hundred (200) dwelling units or more if developed to the maximum

adopted general plan containing policies and standards for those uses, and the
required reservations are in accordance with those policies and standards.
         b.   An ordinance has been in effect for a period of at least thirty
(30) days prior to the filing of the tentative map.
         c.   The reserved area is of such size and shape as to permit the
balance of the property within which the reservation is located to develop in
an orderly and efficient manner.
         d.   The amount of land reserved will not make development of the
remaining land held by the subdivider economically unfeasible.
      2.   In the event the reserved area is not acquired within the prescribed
period, the subdivider shall make those changes as are necessary to permit the
reserved area to be developed for the intended purpose consistent with good
subdividing practices. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993; amd. Ord. 1315, 1-18-2000; Ord.

   A.   Expansive Soils: If the City has knowledge of, or the preliminary soils
report indicates the presence of critically expansive soils or other soils
problems which, if not corrected, would lead to structural defects, a soils
investigation of each lot in the subdivision may be required by the Director of
Community Development prior to approval of the final map or parcel map. The
soils report shall be prepared in accordance with the latest edition of the
Uniform Building Code. Such soils investigation shall be done by a civil
engineer registered in this State, who shall recommend the appropriate
corrective action which is likely to prevent structural damage to each
structure proposed to be constructed in the area where such soils problems
exist consistent with section 66491 of the California Government Code.
   B.   Deleterious Chemicals: If the preliminary soils report indicates the
presence of rocks or liquids containing deleterious chemicals which, if not

concrete, steel, and ductile or cast iron to corrode or deteriorate, a soils
investigation of each potentially affected lot in the subdivision may be
required.
   C.   Recommended Action: The Planning Commission may approve a subdivision
which has soils problems if it determines that the recommended action is likely
to prevent structural damage to each structure to be constructed, and the
recommended action can be incorporated into the construction of each structure.

distinctive reference points or monuments. Such reference points or monuments
may be leads and tacks in sidewalks, or two inch by two inch (2" x 2") stakes
set back of the curb line and below the surface of the ground, or such
substitute as appears to be not more likely to be disturbed.
      4.   Such act shall be of such quality, form and completeness and shall
be on paper of such quality and size as may be necessary to conform to the
standardized office records of the city engineer. All such notes shall be
indexed and filed by the city engineer as a part of the permanent public
records of his office.
      5.   All monuments necessary to establish the exterior boundaries of the
subdivision shall be set or referenced prior to recordation of the final map.

14-2-5: Right To Condition Or Deny Approval
14-2-6: Fees
14-2-7: Expiration Of Vesting Tentative Map Approval
14-2-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a procedure for the approval of a
tentative map that provides certain statutorily vested rights to a subdivider
under the vesting tentative maps statute (California Government Code section
66498.1 et seq.). This chapter implements and supplements that statute. (Ord.
1212, 11-16-1993)
14-2-2: FILING PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION:
   A.   Whenever a tentative map is required, the applicant may file a vesting
tentative map instead.
   B.   A vesting tentative map shall have printed conspicuously on its face
the words "Vesting Tentative Map" before the city may accept it for filing.
   C.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the provisions of this
title shall apply to a vesting tentative map and processed as provided in
section
14-1-4 of this title. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993)
   D.   Such information as is ordinarily required under the provisions of this
title for the filing of a tentative map shall also be required for the filing
of a vesting tentative map. Supplemental information as relates to the vesting
nature of the proposed vesting tentative map may also be required by the
director of community development. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993; amd. Ord. 1315, 1-
18-2000; Ord. 1639, 9-20-2022)
14-2-3: DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS:
   A.   Development Rights Created: The approval of a vesting tentative map
confers a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance
with the city's ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the date the
city determines the application is complete.
   B.   Duration Of Development Rights: The right to proceed with development,
as set forth in subsection A of this section, accrues from the date of approval
of a vesting tentative map by the planning commission and continues for one
year following the timely recordation of a final map or parcel map. If a
project covered by a single vesting tentative map is divided into phases and
more than one final map is recorded, the one year period begins for each phase
when the final map for that phase is recorded.
   C.   Expiration Of Development Rights:
      1.   The right to proceed with development as set forth in subsection A
of this section accrues from the date of approval of the tentative map by the
planning commission or city council; however, it expires on the date the
vesting tentative map expires unless a final map is approved before then.
      2.   The time within which a final map may be recorded is governed by
section
14-1-12 of this title and California Government Code section 66452.6.
      3.   If the subdivider submits a complete application for building and
has satisfied all requirements for the issuance of a building permit during the
one year specified in subsection B of this section, the right to proceed with
development continues until the building permit, or any extension thereof,
expires.
      4.   If a final map is recorded based upon a vesting tentative map and
the development rights expire, the final map remains in effect without the
development rights.
   D.   Extension Of Time For Exercise Of Development Rights:
      1.   The one year specified in subsection B of this section is
automatically extended by the amount of time necessary to complete processing
of a grading permit, or design or architectural review, if the length of time
necessary for city review exceeds thirty (30) days.
      2.   Before the expiration of the one year period specified in subsection
B of this section, a subdivider may apply to the planning commission for a one
year extension. See
title 15, chapter 25 of this code. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993)
14-2-4: AMENDMENT:
A subdivider may apply to the planning commission for an amendment to a vesting
tentative map at any time before the expiration of the vesting tentative map.
(Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993)
14-2-5: RIGHT TO CONDITION OR DENY APPROVAL:
   A.   This chapter does not:
      1.   Enlarge or diminish the types of conditions which the city may
impose on a development; or
      2.   Diminish or alter the city's power to protect against a condition
dangerous to the public health or safety.
   B.   The city may condition or deny a permit, approval, extension, amendment
or entitlement relating to a vesting tentative map if it determines that
either:
      1.   The failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or
the community in a condition dangerous to their health or safety; or
      2.   The condition or denial is required to comply with state or federal
law. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993)
14-2-6: FEES:
Every person submitting a vesting tentative map shall pay a processing fee as
established by resolution. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993)
14-2-7: EXPIRATION OF VESTING TENTATIVE MAP APPROVAL:
The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map and the
conditions under which an extension of time or stay is granted shall be
consistent with section
14-1-12 of this title. (Ord. 1371, 2-3-2004)

15-2-14: LANDSCAPING:
   A.   Requirement; Purpose: The goal of this section is to ensure that
adequate landscape areas and permanent water efficient irrigation systems are
provided for all nonresidential development. The area extending between a
building and property lines must contain both softscape and hardscape landscape
materials, except for those portions devoted to vehicular parking and loading.
All softscape area provided for each project site in nonresidential zoning
districts must be natural plant material, preferably native to the area and not
include artificial turf or synthetic grass except as otherwise provided in this
title. All nonresidential landscape projects must comply with chapter 15A of
this title relating to water conservation in landscaping.
   B.   Components: To achieve these purposes, the landscape criteria is
divided into the following components:
      1.   Vehicular Use Areas: All surface vehicular use areas (VUA) shall
provide landscape areas including shade trees and permanent irrigation systems,
to cover five percent of the VUA. Landscaping shall be distributed uniformly
throughout the VUA, and shall be in addition to the required property perimeter
and building perimeter landscaping. There shall be one tree for every 3,000
square feet of VUA. These trees shall be evenly distributed throughout the
automobile parking area to provide shade and provided around the perimeter of
truck loading/waiting areas to provide screening. Individual tree and planter
areas shall not be less than three feet in width, excluding curbs.
      2.   Building Perimeter: In those instances where setbacks are provided,
all buildings, including parking structures, shall have landscape areas and
permanent irrigation systems around their perimeter. A minimum horizontal depth
of five feet of landscape materials, excluding curbs, shall be provided around
the buildings, except additions to buildings in the rear one-third of a lot,
which do not abut residential property, where landscaping would not be visible
from the public right-of-way need not provide building perimeter landscaping in
the rear. A combination of soft and hard landscape materials may be installed,
provided the use of such materials form a cohesive, attractive and functional
design.
      3.   Property Perimeter: All required setback areas must be landscaped as
required by chapter 15A of this title. In addition, the landscaping must
incorporate the theme utilized for the public rights-of-way and one shade tree
must be provided for every 25 feet of street frontage. The following
encroachments are permitted into the landscaped setback areas:
         a.   Parking spaces, including spaces for automobiles, bicycles, and
shared mobility devices, may encroach into a required street-facing setback up
to a maximum of 50 percent of the required setback area, provided a minimum
landscaped setback of five feet is maintained. These spaces may encroach into a
required interior side and rear setback up to the interior side or rear
property line, provided that the interior side and rear property line does not
abut a public or private street.
         b.   "Architectural landscape features", as defined in section
15-1-6 of this title, may encroach into the landscaped setback area up to a
maximum of 80 percent of the required setback distance, provided a minimum
landscaped setback of five feet is maintained. The features may cover a maximum
of 25 percent of the total setback area, and be a maximum of 20 feet in height.
Encroachments which exceed any of these standards, or which contain an open
roof covering or side walls with greater than 20 percent component solid
portions, requires the approval of an adjustment, as provided in chapter 22 of
this title.
      A combination of soft and hard landscape materials may be installed,
provided the use of such materials will form a cohesive, attractive and
functional design. Such design is to be integrated with and, if appropriate,
physically connected to that provided for the building and VUA areas.
      4.    Minimum sizes for plant material:
         a.    The minimum tree container size for all trees on a site must be
provided as follows:
         (1)   At least 20 percent of the trees must be 36-inch box size or
larger.
         (2)   At least 30 percent of the trees must be 24-inch box size or
larger.
         (3)   The remaining 50 percent must be 15 gallon size or larger.
         (4)   The Director may approve smaller tree container sizes than

ARTICLE E. ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS
SECTION:
15-4E-1: Purpose; Findings
15-4E-2: General Requirements
15-4E-3: Development Standards
15-4E-4: Development Standards For Government Code Section 66323 ADUs
15-4E-5: Application Process; Fees
15-4E-6: Utility Connections
15-4E-1: PURPOSE; FINDINGS:
   This article is adopted pursuant to Government Code section 66314 for the
purpose of implementing the City’s regulation of accessory dwelling units.
   Government Code section 66323(a) requires the City ministerially approve
certain accessory dwelling units in certain residential or mixed use zones
within the City. On the other hand, Government Code section 66314(a), allows
the designation of areas for accessory dwelling units “based on the adequacy of
water and sewer services and the impact of accessory dwelling units on traffic
flow and public safety.”
   The City Council finds that the conditions that were cited in Ordinance No.
1381 that existed in the City at the time (for example, increased traffic,
relatively high density of housing in a small area, and intense on-street
parking) continue to exist within the City. While the City Council recognizes
that accessory dwelling units present a potential solution to the state’s
housing crisis, the Council continues to believe that accessory dwelling units
increase the volume of vehicle traffic within the City, on-street parking, and
noise, and can introduce pollutants into the City’s storm drains.
   By adopting this chapter, the City Council desires to comply with state law
while reserving its right to conduct studies evaluating the adequacy of water
and sewer services.
(Ord. 1550, 7-5-2017; amd. Ord. 1613, 2-4-2020; Ord. 1668, 2-18-2025)
15-4E-2: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Locations: Accessory dwelling units are permitted by right throughout
any zone where residential uses are permitted. Accessory dwelling units may be:
1) contained within the existing or proposed space of a single-family residence
or attached to a single-family residence, 2) within the space of an existing
accessory structure, or 3) detached from the single-family residence, subject
to the requirements and development standards in this Code and State law.
   B.   Conjunction With Single-Family Or Multi-Family Dwelling: An accessory
dwelling unit may only be constructed in conjunction with either an existing or
proposed single-family dwelling, or an existing or proposed multi-family
dwelling.
   C.   Certificates Of Occupancy: The City shall not issue a certificate of
occupancy for an accessory dwelling unit before a certificate of occupancy is
issued for the primary dwelling or dwellings.
   D.   Separate Sale Prohibited: Accessory dwelling units may not be sold
separately from a primary dwelling, except when the ADU or the primary dwelling
was built or developed by a qualified nonprofit corporation and meets all the
requirements of Government Code section 66341, including any amendments or
successor statutes thereto.
   E.   Minimum Rental Term. Rental of the accessory dwelling unit must be for
a term of thirty (30) consecutive days or longer.
   F.   Release Of Covenant: In the event a covenant was previously recorded
for a permitted accessory structure restricting the structure as non-habitable
pursuant to subsection
15-4B-3(H)(5) of this chapter, before the City issues a building permit for an
accessory dwelling unit, the property owner must record a release of such
covenant with the County Recorder, in a form approved by the Director of
Community Development and the City Attorney.
   G.   The City may not condition its approval of the permit application by
requiring the applicant correct a non-conforming zoning condition, as that term
is defined in Government Code section 66313. This protection applies to a
previously unpermitted accessory dwelling unit constructed before January 1,
2020.
(Ord. 1550, 7-5-2017; Ord. 1613, 2-4-2020; Ord. 1620, 11-17-2020; Ord. 1639, 9-
20-2022; Ord. 1668, 2-18-2025)
15-4E-3: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
Unless otherwise preempted by Title 7, Division 1, Chapter 13 (Accessory
Dwelling Units) of the Government Code, accessory dwelling units must meet the
development standards applicable to accessory structures in the zone in which
they are situated, except as follows:
   A.   Height: Same as residential structures in the R-1 Zone.
   B.   Setbacks:
      1.   Attached To And/Or Within A Primary Dwelling: Same as primary
dwellings in the zone in which they are situated. If the primary dwelling has a
non-conforming setback, the accessory dwelling portion may maintain the same
setback.
      2.   Detached From A Primary Dwelling: The detached accessory dwelling
unit must be set back no less than four feet (4') from the interior side and
rear lot lines.
      3.   Exception: No setback shall apply to a portion of an existing

OVERLAY DISTRICTS
ARTICLE A. MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (MDR) OVERLAY ZONE
SECTION:
15-7A-1: Purpose
15-7A-2: Activation
15-7A-3: Development Standards
15-7A-4: Live/Work Development Standards
15-7A-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   To provide for an area within the Smoky Hollow Specific Plan area that
is appropriate for and capable of sustaining residential uses.
   B.   Moreover, it is the intent in identifying the long-term potential for
residential use in the area designated to establish that residential use is
explicitly excluded from the remainder of the Smoky Hollow specific plan area,
except for single caretaker dwelling units provided for elsewhere in the plan.
   C.   The MDR Zone shall be considered a "floating zone" in that once a need
is identified, this zone can be activated. This floating zone for the Smoky
Hollow Specific Plan area attempts to recognize that future residential market
forces are anticipated in certain portions of the specific plan area and
sensible land use planning dictates their exact locations given adjacent land
uses and proximity to arterial streets.
   D.   In effect, this zone is not a true "floating zone" in that it does not
add more regulations over the existing Smoky Hollow East base zone. Rather, it
is a "holding zone" which can be activated and used in place of the base zone.
(Ord. 1580, 2-5-2019; Ord. 1648, 6-21-2023)
15-7A-2: ACTIVATION:
The following processes activate the MDR Zone:
   A.   A General Plan amendment to change the designation for proposed
activated property from Smoky Hollow Specific Plan to Multi-Family Residential;
   B.   A Specific Plan amendment to remove the proposed activated property
from the Smoky Hollow Specific Plan; and
   C.   A Zone Change application to change the zone of the proposed activated
property from Smoky Hollow East with MDR Overlay to Multi-Family Residential
(R-3) without MDR Overlay. (Ord. 1580, 2-5-2019)
15-7A-3: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
The development standards that apply to the underlying base zone shall apply
unless and until the MDR is activated. If the MDR is properly activated, Multi-
Family Residential (R-3) zoning standards shall apply to the activated property
along with the following additional standards:
   A.   The setback along Grand Avenue shall be 30 feet minimum for properties
east of Kansas Street, whether it is for a front or side yard.
   B.   Vehicular access to MDR activated properties may not be taken directly
from Grand Avenue. (Ord. 1580, 2-5-2019; Ord. 1648, 6-21-2023)
15-7A-4: LIVE/WORK DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
Live/work uses are in addition to residential uses and must comply with all the
following:
   A.   Live/work uses cannot be open to walk-in trade or client visits other
than by appointment;
   B.   Only one employee, other than the resident, may be employed on site;
   C.   Work activity must be conducted entirely within the individual unit;
   D.   Outdoor storage is not permitted;
   E.   Live/work uses cannot generate hazardous materials or employ hazardous
processes;
   F.   The live/work use cannot be publicly observed;
   G.   Live/work impacts, such as noise, vibration, dust, odors, fumes, smoke,
heat, electrical interference or other similar nuisances, cannot be perceptible
beyond the individual unit;
   H.   Live/work activities cannot increase pedestrian or vehicle traffic
beyond that ordinarily associated with residential occupancy nor can it reduce
the number of required off street parking spaces available for residential use;
   I.   One wall sign is permitted at the entrance of each individual unit. The
wall sign cannot exceed six square feet and cannot extend above or out from the
wall. Signs cannot emit sounds, odor, or visible matter, such as smoke or

15-13-1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
It is the purpose and intent of this Chapter to provide for the reasonable and
uniform regulation of adult-oriented businesses in the City. It is recognized
that adult-oriented businesses have a serious deleterious effect upon adjacent
areas, as well as the areas in which they are located. It is therefore the
purpose of this Chapter to establish criteria and standards for the
establishment and conduct of adult-oriented businesses which will protect the
public health, safety, and welfare, preserve locally recognized values of
community appearance, minimize the potential for nuisances related to the
operation of adult-oriented businesses, and maintain local property values.
   A.   The special regulation of adult-oriented businesses is necessary to
ensure that their adverse secondary effects will not contribute to an increase
in the crime rates or the blighting or downgrading of the areas in which they
are located or surrounding areas. The need for the special regulation is based
on the recognition that adult-oriented businesses have serious objectionable
operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated
under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity with sensitive uses
such as residential zones and uses, parks, schools, churches, or daycare
centers, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas.
   B.   It is the purpose and intent of these special regulations to prevent
the concentration or location of adult-oriented businesses in a manner that
would create such adverse secondary effects. Thus, in order to protect and
preserve the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry, especially
including minors, the special regulation of the time, place, and manner of the
location and operation of adult-oriented businesses is necessary.
   C.   The need to regulate the proximity of adult-oriented businesses to
sensitive land uses such as residential, religious, educational, recreational,
and other adult-oriented businesses is documented in studies which were the
basis of the time, place, and manner of the restrictions contained in this
Chapter.
   D.   The provisions of this Chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually-oriented materials, that are protected by the
First Amendment of the United States Constitution and the relevant provisions
of the California State Constitution. (Ord. 1260, 9-17-1996)

be no more than one continuance for a period not to exceed 31 days if the
additional time is needed to conduct further study of the cultural resource. If
an EIR or negative declaration is required, the time limits set forth in
California Public Resources Code section 21151.5 shall apply.
      4.   The City Council shall declare designated cultural resources by
resolution, which shall contain a statement as to why the cultural resource is
so designated. Any such resolution shall include a legal description of the
property involved, including lot and block number and the name of the property
owner. The resolution shall be duly recorded by the City Clerk in the County
Recorder's office.

of architecture, or method of construction.
   C.   Temporary Stay On Permits Pending Designation: No construction,
alteration, demolition, relocation, or restoration shall be allowed and no
other entitlement permits shall be issued with regard to any proposed
designated cultural resource from the time an application for designation is
made until the City Council has made a final decision to either approve or deny
the request for designation.
   D.   Removal Of Designation: A cultural resource designation may be removed
subject to the same procedures set forth above. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993; amd.

actions affecting a designated cultural resource may be undertaken:
construction, alteration, restoration, relocation, and demolition.
   B.   No building permit for any work on a designated cultural resource shall
be issued until a certificate of appropriateness is issued in the manner
provided for in this Chapter.
   C.   A certificate of appropriateness is not required for any ordinary
repair and maintenance as described in Section
15-14-9 of this Chapter. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993; amd. Ord. 1629, 11-16-2021)
15-14-6: AUTHORITY TO GRANT CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS:
The Planning Commission may grant a certificate of appropriateness, subject to
the process set forth in Chapter 28 of this title. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993; amd.
Ord. 1315, 1-18-2000; Ord. 1629, 11-16-2021)
15-14-7: CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS CRITERIA AND CRITERIA EXEMPTIONS:
   A.    Alteration, Construction or Restoration: A certificate of
appropriateness for the alteration, construction or restoration of a designated
cultural resource shall not be issued unless the Commission or City Council, on
appeal, find all of the following conditions exist:
      1.   The proposed alteration, construction or restoration will not
adversely affect exterior architectural features of the building or structure
specified in the designation; and
      2.   The proposed alteration, construction or restoration will not
adversely affect the special character; special historical, architectural or
aesthetic interest; nor the relationship and congruity between the subject
structure or feature and its neighboring structures and surroundings, as
specified in the designation.
   B.   Demolition: A certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of a
designated cultural resource shall not be issued unless the Commission or City
Council, on appeal, find one or more of the following conditions exist:
      1.   The structure or building is a hazard to public health or safety;
      2.   The site on which the designated cultural resource is located is
required for a public use which will be of more benefit to the public than its
use as a cultural resource and there is no practical alternative location for
the public use; or
      3.   Denial of the proposed application will result in unreasonable
economic hardship to the owner; it is not feasible to preserve or restore the
designated cultural resource; and the property owner will be denied the
reasonable beneficial use of the property if the application is denied.
   C.   Relocation: A certificate of appropriateness for the relocation of a
designated cultural resource shall not be issued unless the Commission or City
Council, on appeal, finds that:
      1.   One or more of the conditions set forth in subsection B of this
Section exist;
      2.   The relocation will not destroy the historic, cultural or
architectural value of the designated cultural resource; and
      3.   The relocation is part of a definitive series of actions which will
assure the preservation of the designated cultural resource.
   D.   Exemption for Unreasonable Economic Hardship: A property owner may
request an exemption from the provisions of this Chapter on the grounds of
unreasonable economic hardship for any alteration, construction, restoration,
demolition or relocation of a designated cultural resource.
A property owner requesting an exemption on the grounds of unreasonable
economic hardship shall provide the following information; including, but not
limited to:
      1.   Ownership and operation of the property, mortgage and financing
information, market value, structural integrity, rehabilitation costs, assessed
value, real estate taxes, debt service, and potential adaptive re-use.
      2.   For income-producing property:
         a.   Annual gross income from the property for the previous two years;
         b.   Itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two
years; and
         c.   Annual cash flow, if any, for the previous two years.
      3.   For low-income owners: a statement of present household income and
number of persons in the household. Low-income households shall be defined as
meeting the income level established by the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development.
      4.   The staff may require that a property owner furnish additional
information which would assist the Commission in making a determination as to
whether or not the property does yield or may yield a reasonable return to the
owner(s) (i.e., pro forma financial analysis). In the event that any of the
required information is not reasonably available to the property owner and
cannot be obtained by the property owner, the property owner shall file with
his affidavit a statement of the information which cannot be obtained and shall
describe the reasons why such information cannot be obtained.
The property owner shall have the burden of proof to establish unreasonable
economic hardship.
The Commission, or City Council on appeal, may grant an exemption on the
grounds of unreasonable economic hardship if it finds that the application of
the provisions of this Chapter to the proposed alteration, construction,
restoration, demolition or relocation would deny the property owner reasonable
beneficial use of the property and a reasonable rate of return on the owner's
investment in the property. (Ord. 1629, 11-16-2021)
15-14-8: DUTY TO KEEP IN GOOD REPAIR:
The owner, occupant, or other person who exercises control over a cultural
resource shall keep in good repair all of the exterior architectural features
of such improvement, building, or structure, and all of the interior portions
whose maintenance is necessary to prevent deterioration and decay of any
exterior architectural feature. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993)
15-14-9: ORDINARY MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR:
Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance
or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on any designated
cultural resource that does not involve a change in design, material, or
external appearance thereof, nor does this Chapter prevent the construction,
alteration, restoration, demolition, or removal of any such architectural
feature if the Director certifies to the Commission that such action is
required for the public safety due to an unsafe or dangerous condition. (Ord.
1212, 11-16-1993; amd. Ord. 1315, 1-18-2000; Ord. 1629, 11-16-2021)
15-14-10: EMERGENCY WORK ON DESIGNATED CULTURAL RESOURCES:
Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the Building Official
from issuing a building permit if he determines that the demolition, removal or
alteration of a designated cultural resource is immediately necessary to
protect the public health, safety or welfare. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993)
15-14-11: ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES:
   A.   Any person who violates any provision of this Chapter or fails to obey
an order issued by the Commission or comply with a condition of approval of any
certificate of appropriateness issued under this Chapter shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and subject to provisions of Section
15-30-2 of this Title.
   B.   Any person who constructs, alters, removes, relocates, restores or
demolishes a designated cultural resource in violation of any provision of this
Chapter shall be required to restore the building, object, site, or structure

15-15-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for adequate off street parking and
loading standards, to ensure that parking spaces are suitably maintained and
available for the use of the occupants of the site and to mitigate associated
on street parking and traffic circulation problems throughout the City. (Ord.
1444, 8-3-2010)
15-15-2: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   The provisions of this chapter apply in all zones of the City unless
specifically provided otherwise in an adopted specific plan.
   B.   The provisions of this chapter apply at the time a building or
structure is erected, altered, or expanded, or when the use is established,
changed or expanded.
   C.   Parking spaces and loading spaces established by this chapter must be
improved as required by this chapter before new buildings or structures are
occupied or existing buildings or structures are expanded or modified for a new
use.
   D.   The provisions of this chapter apply to parking facilities for
authorized temporary uses or special events, except where specifically exempted
by the Director of Community Development. (Ord. 1444, 8-3-2010; amd. Ord. 1620,
11-17-2020; Ord. 1639, 9-20-2022)
15-15-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Compliance: It is unlawful for any person to violate any part of this
chapter including, without limitation, any discretionary or ministerial permit
issued by the City pursuant to this Code or chapter.
   B.   Availability: It is unlawful for required parking to be utilized in any
manner inconsistent with the lawful uses of property including, without
limitation, rendering it unavailable for property occupants, patrons, or
visitors of a building or use during normal hours of operation. This meaning
shall not be construed to prohibit security devices.
   C.   Maintenance: Parking spaces, driveways, maneuvering aisles, turnaround
areas, and landscaping areas must be maintained free of debris, graffiti, and
litter; and striping, paving, walls light standards, and all other facilities
must be maintained in good condition.
   D.   Location Of Parking: All required parking must be located on the same
lot or building site as the uses for which such spaces are required, unless an
off site parking covenant is approved in compliance with this chapter.
   E.   Mixed Or Multiple Uses And/Or Occupancies: A site with multiple uses or
mixed occupancies must provide the aggregate number of parking spaces required
by this chapter for each separate use. On site parking spaces for one use
cannot be considered as providing required parking spaces for any other use,
except when authorized through an off site parking covenant in accordance with
this chapter.
   F.   Fractional Spaces: Where the application of cumulative parking
requirements results in a fractional space, then the fractions are rounded to
the nearest whole number.
   G.   Expansion Or Remodeling Of Building, Or Change In Use:
      1.   Expansion Of Building Or Use, Generally: Upon change or expansion of
a building, or outdoor use area resulting in additional floor area devoted to a
use, additional outdoor use area, or an increase in the number of dwelling
units on a lot, additional parking and loading spaces must be provided only for
the additional floor area, outdoor use area, or residential units without
diminishing the existing parking, unless such parking exceeds the requirements
of this chapter.
      2.   Addition Of Floor Area To A Dwelling Unit: Notwithstanding any other
provision of this chapter, the cumulative addition of one thousand (1,000)
square feet of floor area to a residential unit upon the effective date hereof
must comply with the minimum parking requirements for residential units as
established in this chapter.
      3.   Change Of Use, Generally: When the use of a building changes to
another use that is required to have the same number of parking spaces, no
additional parking spaces are required for the new use, regardless of the
number of spaces provided by the previous use, if the previous use was legally
established and the number of spaces has not decreased. When a change in use
requires more off street parking than the previous use, additional parking
spaces must be provided equal in number to the difference between the total
number of spaces required by the new use and the number of spaces required for
the immediately previous use. When a change in use requires less off street
parking than the previous use, no additional parking spaces are required.
   H.   Off-Site Parking:
      1.   Applicability/authority: The Director may approve off-site parking
locations within the City for nonresidential uses to meet the parking
requirements of this chapter subject to the process set forth in Chapter 23 of
this Title. Such off-site parking locations must be secured with a covenant,
approved by the City Attorney, and recorded in the County Recorder's Office
before the City issues building permits. The parking covenant may include such
conditions as the Director may lawfully impose. The Director may refer
decisions on off-site parking requests to the Planning Commission at his
discretion.
      2.   Off-Site Parking Findings of Approval: Requests for off-site parking
must meet the following requirements:
         a.   The off-site parking must be located so that it will adequately
serve the use for which it is intended. In making this determination, the
following factors, among other things, must be considered:
            (1)   Proximity of the off-site parking facilities (i.e., 750 feet
is a reasonable maximum walking distance for high turnover uses such as retail
sales, services and restaurants);
            (2)   Ease of pedestrian access to the off-site parking facilities;
            (3)   Provisions for transportation to and from the off-site
parking facility (e.g., shuttle or valet services);
            (4)   The type of use the off-site parking facilities are intended
to serve.
         b.   The off-site parking spaces must be surplus to the required
parking spaces for uses at the off-site location, unless an adjustment is
approved based on an approved parking demand study pursuant to Sections
15-15-3(J) and
15-15-6(C) of this chapter.
   I.   Joint Use/Shared Parking: Uses that share parking facilities on the
same lot may be granted parking space reductions when they have significantly
different peak hours of operation. Joint use/shared parking reductions may be
granted in compliance with this chapter (reductions in the number of required
parking spaces).
   J.   Parking Exceptions:
      1.   Director Review: The Director may review and approve requests for
adjustments from the requirements of this chapter as provided in Chapters 22
and 23, of this title including, the design and layout of parking facilities;
the required number of parking spaces; the dimensions of parking spaces; the
type of loading spaces required; aisles; driveways and curb cuts; paving
materials and colors; and striping. The types and extent of adjustments the
Director is authorized to review are specified in sections
15-15-5,
15-15-6, and
15-15-7 of this chapter.
      2.   Planning Commission Review: The Planning Commission must review
requests for adjustments that are referred to it by the Director at a public
hearing as set forth in Chapter 28 of this title.
   K.   Failure To Maintain Required Parking: In the event on site parking and
loading area facilities required to be provided under this Code are not
maintained for licensed vehicle parking and truck loading area purposes to the
extent required, the Director of Community Development may revoke a certificate
of occupancy for structures that fail to maintain required on site parking and
loading facilities. The Director of Development Services must provide a
property owner at least ninety (90) days to comply with this Code, including
any ministerial or discretionary permits as to parking if it appears that a
violation was reasonably beyond the control of the person required to comply
with this chapter. Should a certificate of occupancy be revoked, the premises
affected cannot be occupied or used for any purpose until a new certificate of
occupancy is issued. (Ord. 1444, 8-3-2010; amd. Ord. 1551, 8-15-2017; Ord.
1620, 11-17-2020; Ord. 1629, 11-16-2021; Ord. 1639, 9-20-2022)

design to a parking and loading area must submit a parking and loading area
plan, in a form approved by the Director of Community Development, to the
Director of Community Development. The plans must clearly indicate the
location, size, shape and design, of all curb cuts, lighting, landscaping, and
parking spaces in full compliance with Code requirements.
   B.   The City cannot issue a building permit until the applicant presents
satisfactory evidence to the Director of Community Development that parking and
loading facilities required by the provisions of this chapter will be provided
and maintained. (Ord. 1444, 8-3-2010; amd. Ord. 1620, 11-17-2020; Ord. 1639, 9-
20-2022)
15-15-5: PARKING AREA DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Access and Circulation:
      1.   Design: Parking facilities must be designed so that a car within a
facility will not have to enter a street to move from one location to any other
location within the same facility.
      2.   Exit: Parking facilities in nonresidential zones must be designed in
such a manner that any vehicle on the property will be able to exit from the
property traveling in a forward direction. However, vehicles may exit onto an
alley traveling in a reverse direction.
      3.   The Director may approve adjustments from the site access and
circulation standards as provided in Chapters 22 and 23 of this title.
   B.   Driveway And Parking Area Paving And Surfacing: All permanent on site
parking, loading, vehicle storage and vehicle sales areas must be paved with
approved concrete or asphaltic concrete. On-site parking areas to be used for
not longer than one year must be surfaced and maintained with an impervious
material acceptable to the Director so as to eliminate dust and mud. All on-
site parking areas must be graded and drained so as to dispose of all surface
water in accordance with the applicable stormwater regulations. Acceptable
alternative paving materials include decorative concrete, permeable concrete,
grasscrete, brick, or similar material of equivalent durability. The Director
may approve adjustments from the driveway and parking area paving standards for
non-standard roadbed construction and alternative roadway surfaces (such as
drivable reinforced turf) as provided in Chapters 22 and 23 of this title.
   C.   Parking Area Striping: All parking spaces must be clearly striped with
white, double four-inch wide stripes, one foot apart. The Director may approve
adjustments from the parking area striping standards as provided in Chapters 22
and 23 of this title. The alternative designs may include the use of colored
concrete and other decorative materials provided that alternative striping
options clearly identify parking spaces and distinguish them from adjoining
walkways and drive aisles.

         a.   Parking spaces may encroach into a required street-facing setback
up to a maximum of 50 percent of the required setback area, provided a minimum
landscaped setback of five feet is maintained. Parking spaces may encroach into
a required interior side and rear setback up to the interior side or rear
property line, provided that the interior side and rear property line does not
abut a public or private street.
         b.   Parking spaces that back up directly into a driveway entrance
must maintain a minimum landscaped setback of 20 feet from any street facing
property line.
         c.   Where vehicular access is provided by an alley, parking may
intrude into the required rear yard; provided, however, the amount of setback
intruded upon must be replaced by increasing the other required yards on site
by an equivalent amount.

15-15A-1: PURPOSE:
This chapter is adopted in accordance with Government Code section 65595(c) for
the purpose of complying with California law and promoting water conservation.
This chapter may be referred to as the WATER CONSERVATION IN LANDSCAPING
STANDARDS. The water conservation in landscaping standards are intended to
promote water conservation while allowing the maximum possible flexibility in
designing healthy, attractive, and cost effective water efficient landscapes.
(Ord. 1515, 12-15-2015)
15-15A-2: DEFINITIONS:
Unless the contrary is stated or clearly appears from the context, the
following definitions govern the construction of the words and phrases used in
this chapter. Words and phrases not defined by this chapter have the meanings
stated in the water conservation in landscaping act 1 ; regulations
promulgating the water conservation in landscaping act; this code; and any
successor statutes or regulations.
   APPLIED WATER: The portion of water supplied by the irrigation system to the
landscape.
   AUTOMATIC IRRIGATION CONTROLLER: A timing device used to remotely control
valves that operate an irrigation system. Automatic irrigation controllers are
able to self-adjust and schedule irrigation events using either
evapotranspiration (weather based) or soil moisture data.
   BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE: A safety device used to prevent pollution or
contamination of the potable water supply due to the reverse flow of water from
the irrigation system.
   CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION: The document that certifies that the landscape
design plan, irrigation scheduling parameters and landscape project has been
installed per the approved landscape documentation package. An irrigation audit
report must also be included to obtain the final certificate of completion for
the project.
   CERTIFIED IRRIGATION DESIGNER: A person certified to design irrigation
systems by an accredited academic institution, a professional trade
organization or other program such as the U.S. environmental protection
agency's WaterSense irrigation designer certification program and Irrigation
Association's certified irrigation designer program.
   CERTIFIED LANDSCAPE IRRIGATION AUDITOR: A person certified to perform
landscape irrigation audits by an accredited academic institution, a
professional trade organization or other program such as the U.S. environmental
protection agency's WaterSense irrigation auditor certification program and
Irrigation Association's certified landscape irrigation auditor program.
   CHECK VALVE OR ANTIDRAIN VALVE: A valve located under a sprinkler head, or
other location in the irrigation system, to hold water in the system to prevent
drainage from sprinkler heads when the sprinkler is off.
   CLIMATE ZONE: A region characterized by long term weather patterns. The
climate is measured by assessing weather patterns, variation in temperature,
air pressure, wind, humidity, precipitation, sunshine, atmospheric particle
count and other meteorological variables in a given region. The climate of a
region is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby
water bodies and their currents. Evapotranspiration along with temperature and
precipitation are used for classifying which animals and plants species would
thrive in a specific climate zone. As such, the garden collection of plant
species described in Sunset Western climate zone no. 24 (with marine influence
along the Southern California coast) would perform best in the city of El
Segundo.
   COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS: Community apartment projects, condominium
projects, planned developments, and stock cooperatives per Civil Code section
4100.
   COMPOST: The safe and stable product of controlled biologic decomposition of
organic materials that is beneficial to plant growth.
   CONVERSION FACTOR (0.62): The number that converts acre-inches per acre per
year to gallons per square foot per year.
   DESIGNER: A person qualified to practice landscape architecture and/or
irrigation design.
   DISTRIBUTION UNIFORMITY: The measure of the uniformity of irrigation water
over a defined area.
   DRIP IRRIGATION: Any nonspray low volume irrigation system utilizing
emission devices with a flow rate measured in gallons per hour. Low volume
irrigation systems are specifically designed to apply small volumes of water
slowly at or near the root zone of plants.
ET ADJUSTMENT FACTOR (ETAF): A factor of 0.55 for residential areas and 0.45
for nonresidential areas, that, when applied to reference evapotranspiration,
adjusts for plant factors and irrigation efficiency, two (2) major influences
upon the amount of water that needs to be applied to the landscape. The ETAF
for new and existing (nonrehabilitated) special landscape areas must not exceed
1.0. The ETAF for existing nonrehabilitated landscapes is 0.8.
   ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION PROJECT: A project where the site is intentionally
altered to establish a defined, indigenous, historic ecosystem.
   EFFECTIVE PRECIPITATION OR USABLE RAINWATER (Eppt): The portion of total
precipitation which becomes available for plant growth.
   EMITTER: A drip irrigation emission device that delivers water slowly from
the system to the soil.
   ESTABLISHED LANDSCAPE: The point at which plants in the landscape have
developed significant root growth into the soil. Typically, most plants are
established after one or two (2) years of growth.
   ESTABLISHMENT PERIOD OF THE PLANTS: The first year after installing the
plant in the landscape or the first two (2) years if irrigation will be
terminated after establishment. Typically, most plants are established after
one or two (2) years of growth. Native habitat mitigation areas and trees may
need three (3) to five (5) years for establishment.
   ESTIMATED TOTAL WATER USE (ETWU): The total water used for the landscape.
The ETWU is calculated based on the plants used and irrigation method selected
for the landscape design. The ETWU must be below the MAWA.
   EVAPOTRANSPIRATION RATE: The quantity of water evaporated from adjacent soil
and other surfaces and transpired by plants during a specified time.
   FLOW RATE: The rate at which water flows through pipes, valves and emission
devices, measured in gallons per minute, gallons per hour, or cubic feet per
second.
   FLOW SENSOR: An in-line device installed at the supply point of the
irrigation system that produces a repeatable signal proportional to flow rate.
Flow sensors must be connected to an automatic irrigation controller, or flow
monitor capable of receiving flow signals and operating master valves. This
combination flow sensor/controller may also function as a landscape water meter
or submeter.
   FRIABLE: A soil condition that is easily crumbled or loosely compacted down
to a minimum depth per planting material requirements, whereby the root
structure of newly planted material will be allowed to spread unimpeded.
   FUEL MODIFICATION PLAN GUIDELINE: Guidelines from a local fire authority to
assist residents and businesses that are developing land or building structures
in a fire hazard severity zone.
   GRAY WATER: Untreated wastewater that has not been contaminated by any
toilet discharge, has not been affected by infectious, contaminated, or
unhealthy bodily wastes, and does not present a threat from contamination by
unhealthful processing, manufacturing, or operating wastes. "Gray water"
includes, but is not limited to, wastewater from bathtubs, showers, bathroom
washbasins, clothes washing machines, and laundry tubs, but does not include
wastewater from kitchen sinks or dishwashers. Health And Safety Code section
17922.12.
   GUIDELINES FOR THE CITY OF EL SEGUNDO LAND DEVELOPMENT PROVISIONS FOR
LANDSCAPING AND THE GUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF WATER EFFICIENT LANDSCAPE:
Regulations separately adopted by city council resolution, and incorporated by
reference into this chapter, providing specific regulations for water
conservation.
   HARDSCAPE: Any durable material (pervious and nonpervious) that is comprised
of solid manmade and natural materials used in the built environment such as:
stone, tile, wood, crushed rock, gravel, granite, brick, metal, glass, bitumen,
concrete, and masonry. Hardscape projects may include paved areas, walkways,

plant lists; and
         f.   Selection of plants from local fuel modification plan guidelines.
      2.   Similar Water Requirements: Plants having similar water use
requirements should be grouped together in distinct hydrozones, with the
exception of hydrozones with plants of mixed water use, as specified in
subsection E2d of this section.
      3.   Plant Adaptability: Plants must be selected and planted
appropriately based upon their adaptability to the climatic, geologic, and
topographical conditions of the project site. Methods to achieve water
efficiency must include one or more of the following:
         a.   Use the Sunset Western climate zone system which takes into
account temperature, humidity, elevation, terrain, latitude, and varying
degrees of continental and marine influence on local climate;
         b.   Recognize the horticultural attributes of plants (i.e., mature
plant size, invasive surface roots) to minimize damage to property or
infrastructure (e.g., buildings, sidewalks, power lines); allow for adequate
soil volume for healthy root growth;
         c.   Consider the solar orientation for plant placement to maximize
summer shade and winter solar gain;
         d.   Where possible, landscaping should be installed in the fall, in
order to establish plant materials when they will benefit most from winter
rains;
         e.   The use of invasive plant species, such as those listed by the
California invasive plant council, is strongly discouraged.
      4.   Turf: Turf is not allowed on slopes greater than twenty five percent
(25%) where the toe of the slope is adjacent to an impermeable hardscape and
where "twenty five percent (25%)" means one foot (1') of vertical elevation
change for every four feet (4') of horizontal length (rise divided by run x 100
= slope percent).
      5.   High Water Use Plants: The planting of high water use plants is
limited to nonturf landscape area. The remaining landscape must be planted with
low and moderate water use plant materials. High water use plants,
characterized by a plant factor of 0.7 to 1.0, are prohibited in street
medians.
      6.   Fire Prone Areas: A landscape design plan for projects in fire prone
areas must address fire safety and prevention. A defensible space or zone
around a building or structure is required per Public Resources Code sections
4291(a) and (b). Avoid fire prone plant materials and highly flammable mulches
(refer to the local fuel modification plan guidelines).
   D.   Soil Preparation, Mulch And Amendments:
      1.   Prior to the planting of any materials, compacted soils must be
transformed to a friable condition. On engineered slopes, only amended planting
holes need meet this requirement.
      2.   Soil amendments must be incorporated according to recommendations of
the soil report and what is appropriate for the plants selected (see section
15-15A-7 of this chapter).
      3.   For landscape installations, compost at a rate of a minimum of four
(4) cubic yards per one thousand (1,000) square feet of permeable area must be
incorporated to a depth of six inches (6") into the soil. Soils with greater
than six percent (6%) organic matter in the top six inches (6") of soil are
exempt from adding compost and tilling.
      4.   A minimum three inch (3") layer of mulch must be applied on all
exposed soil surfaces of planting areas except in turf areas, creeping or
rooting ground covers, or direct seeding applications where mulch is
contraindicated. To provide habitat for beneficial insects and other wildlife,
up to five percent (5%) of the landscape area may be left without mulch.
Designated insect habitat must be included in the landscape design plan as
such.
      5.   Stabilizing mulching products must be used on slopes that meet
current engineering standards.
      6.   The mulching portion of the seed/mulch slurry in hydroseeded
applications must meet the mulching requirement.
      7.   Organic mulch materials made from recycled or postconsumer products
must take precedence over inorganic materials or virgin forest products unless
the recycled postconsumer organic products are not locally available. Organic
mulches are not required where prohibited by local fuel modification plan
guidelines or other applicable local ordinances.
   E.   Irrigation System Design Plan: The irrigation plan must identify all
components of the irrigation system drawn on project base sheets in a clear and
legible fashion in accordance with the policies established to implement the
provisions of this chapter. For the efficient use of water, an irrigation
system must meet all the requirements listed in this section and the
manufacturers' recommendations. The irrigation system and its related

by the local water purveyor; or
            (2)   A privately owned meter or submeter.
         b.   Automatic irrigation controllers utilizing either
evapotranspiration or soil moisture sensor data utilizing nonvolatile memory
must be required for irrigation scheduling in all irrigation systems.
         c.   If the water pressure is below or exceeds the recommended
pressure of the specified irrigation devices, the installation of a pressure
regulating device is required to ensure that the dynamic pressure at each
emission device is within the manufacturer's recommended pressure range for
optimal performance.
         d.   If the static pressure is above or below the required dynamic
pressure of the irrigation system, pressure regulating devices such as in-line
pressure regulators, booster pumps, or other devices must be installed to meet
the required dynamic pressure of the irrigation system.
         e.   Static water pressure, dynamic or operating pressure and flow
reading of the water supply must be measured at the point of connection. These
pressure and flow measurements must be conducted at the design stage. If the
measurements are not available at the design stage, the measurements must be
conducted at installation.
         f.   Sensors (rain, freeze, wind, etc.), either integral or auxiliary,
that suspend or alter irrigation operation during unfavorable weather
conditions must be required on all irrigation systems, as appropriate for local
climatic conditions. Irrigation should be avoided during windy or freezing
weather or during rain.
         g.   Manual shutoff valves (such as a gate valve, ball valve, or
butterfly valve) must be required, as close as possible to the point of
connection of the water supply, to minimize water loss in case of an emergency
(such as a main line break) or routine repair.
         h.   Backflow prevention devices must be required to protect the water
supply from contamination by the irrigation system. A project applicant must
refer to the applicable local agency code (i.e., public health) for additional
backflow prevention requirements.
         i.   Flow sensors that detect high flow conditions created by system
damage or malfunction are required for all on nonresidential landscapes and
residential landscapes of five thousand (5,000) square feet or larger.

head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where irrigation water
flows onto nontargeted areas, such as adjacent property, nonirrigated areas,
hardscapes, roadways, or structures.
         l.   Relevant information from the soil management plan, such as soil
type and infiltration rate, must be utilized when designing irrigation systems.
         m.   The design of the irrigation system must conform to the
hydrozones of the landscape design plan.
         n.   The irrigation system must be designed and installed to meet, at
a minimum, the irrigation efficiency criteria as described in section
15-15A-6 of this chapter regarding the maximum applied water allowance (MAWA).
         o.   All irrigation emission devices must meet the requirements set in
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, American Society Of
Agricultural And Biological Engineers'/International Code Council's (ASABE/ICC)
802-2014 "Landscape Irrigation Sprinkler And Emitter Standard". All sprinkler
heads installed in the landscape must document a distribution uniformity low
quarter of 0.65 or higher using the protocol defined in ASABE/ICC 802-2014.
         p.   It is highly recommended that the project applicant or local
agency inquire with the local water purveyor about peak water operating demands
(on the water supply system) or water restrictions that may impact the
effectiveness of the irrigation system.
         q.   In mulched planting areas, the use of low volume irrigation is
required to maximize water infiltration into the root zone.
         r.   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices must have matched
precipitation rates, unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer's
recommendations.
         s.   Head to head coverage is recommended, however, sprinkler spacing
must be designed to achieve the highest possible distribution uniformity using
the manufacturer's recommendations.
         t.   Swing joints or other riser protection components are required on
all risers subject to damage that are adjacent to hardscapes or in high traffic
areas of turf or grass.
         u.   Check valves or antidrain valves are required on all sprinkler
heads where low point drainage could occur.
         v.   Areas less than ten feet (10') in width in any direction must be
irrigated with subsurface irrigation or other means that produces no runoff or
overspray.
         w.   Overhead irrigation must not be permitted within twenty four
inches (24") of any nonpermeable surface. Allowable irrigation within the
setback from nonpermeable surfaces may include drip, drip line, or other low
flow nonspray technology. The setback area may be planted or unplanted. The
surfacing of the setback may be mulch, gravel, or other porous material. These
restrictions may be modified if:
            (1)   The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no
runoff occurs; or the adjacent nonpermeable surfaces are designed and
constructed to drain entirely to landscaping; or
            (2)   The irrigation designer specifies an alternative design or
technology, as part of the landscape documentation package and clearly
demonstrates strict adherence to irrigation system design criteria in
subsection E1k of this section. Prevention of overspray and runoff must be
confirmed during the irrigation audit.
         x.   Slopes greater than twenty five percent (25%) must not be
irrigated with an irrigation system with an application rate exceeding 0.75
inches per hour. This restriction may be modified if the landscape designer
specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the landscape
documentation package, and clearly demonstrates no runoff or erosion will
occur. Prevention of runoff and erosion must be confirmed during the irrigation
audit.
      2.   Hydrozone Criteria:
         a.   Each valve must irrigate a hydrozone with similar site, slope,
sun exposure, soil conditions, and plant materials with similar water use.
         b.   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices must be selected based
on what is appropriate for the plant type within that hydrozone.
         c.   Where feasible, trees must be placed on separate valves from
shrubs, ground covers, and turf to facilitate the appropriate irrigation of
trees. The mature size and extent of the root zone must be considered when
designing irrigation for the tree.
         d.   Individual hydrozones that mix plants of moderate and low water
use, or moderate and high water use, may be allowed if:
            (1)   Plant factor calculation is based on the proportions of the
respective plant water uses and their plant factor; or
            (2)   The plant factor of the higher water using plant is used for
calculations.
         e.   Individual hydrozones that mix high and low water use plants will
not be permitted.
         f.   On the landscape design plan and irrigation design plan,
hydrozone areas must be designated by number, letter, or other designation. On
the irrigation design plan, designate the areas irrigated by each valve, and
assign a number to each valve. Use this valve number in the hydrozone
information table (see water efficient worksheet) provided by staff. This table
can also assist with the irrigation audit and programming the controller.
      3.   Irrigation Design Plan: The irrigation design plan must contain:
         a.   Location and size of separate water meters for landscape;
         b.   Location, type and size of all components of the irrigation
system, including controllers, main and lateral lines, valves, sprinkler heads,
moisture sensing devices, rain switches, quick couplers, pressure regulators,

   G.   Gray Water Systems: Gray water systems promote the efficient use of
water and are encouraged to assist in on site landscape irrigation. All gray
water systems must conform to the California plumbing code (California code of
regulations title 24, part 5, chapter 16) and any applicable local ordinance
standards. Refer to subsection
15-15A-3A4 of this chapter for the applicability of this chapter to landscape
areas less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet with the
estimated total water use is met entirely by gray water.
   H.   Irrigation Scheduling: For the efficient use of water, all irrigation
schedules must be developed, managed, and evaluated to utilize the minimum

controllers.
      2.   Overhead irrigation must be scheduled between eight o'clock (8:00)
P.M. and nine o'clock (9:00) A.M. unless weather conditions prevent it. If
allowable hours of irrigation differ from the local water purveyor, the
stricter of the two (2) must apply. Operation of the irrigation system outside
the normal watering window is allowed for auditing and system maintenance.
      3.   For implementation of the irrigation schedule, particular attention
must be paid to irrigation run times, emission device, flow rate, and current
reference evapotranspiration, so that applied water meets the estimated total
water use. Total annual applied water must be less than or equal to maximum
applied water allowance (MAWA). Actual irrigation schedules must be regulated
by automatic irrigation controllers using current reference evapotranspiration
data (e.g., CIMIS) or soil moisture sensor data.
      4.   Parameters used to set the automatic controller must be developed
and submitted for each of the following:
         a.   The plant establishment period;
         b.   The established landscape; and
         c.   Temporarily irrigated areas.
      5.   Each irrigation schedule must consider for each station all of the
following that apply:
         a.   Irrigation interval (days between irrigation);

areas, and removing obstructions to emission devices. Operation of the
irrigation system outside the normal watering window is allowed for auditing
and system maintenance.
      3.   Repair of all irrigation equipment must be done with the originally
installed components or their equivalents or with components with greater
efficiency.
      4.   A project applicant is encouraged to implement established landscape
industry sustainable best practices for all landscape maintenance activities.
   J.   Effective Precipitation: A local agency may consider effective
precipitation (25 percent of annual precipitation) in tracking water use and
may use the following equation to calculate maximum applied water allowance:
   MAWA = (ETo - Eppt) (0.62) [(0.55 x LA) + (0.45 x SLA)] for residential
areas. MAWA = (ETo - Eppt) (0.62) [(0.45 x LA) + (0.55 x SLA)] for
nonresidential areas. (Ord. 1515, 12-15-2015)
15-15A-6: WATER EFFICIENT LANDSCAPE WORKSHEET:

   A.   Water Efficient Landscape Worksheet: A project applicant must complete
the "water efficient landscape worksheet" supplied by staff, which contains
information on the plant factor, irrigation method, irrigation efficiency, and
area associated with each hydrozone. Calculations are then made to show that
the evapotranspiration adjustment factor (ETAF) for the landscape project does
not exceed a factor of 0.55 for residential areas and 0.45 for nonresidential
areas, exclusive of special landscape areas. The ETAF for a landscape project
is based on the plant factors and irrigation methods selected. The maximum
applied water allowance is calculated based on the maximum ETAF allowed (0.55
for residential areas and 0.45 for nonresidential areas) and expressed as
annual gallons required. The estimated total water use (ETWU) is calculated
based on the plants used and irrigation method selected for the landscape
design. ETWU must be below the MAWA.
In calculating the maximum applied water allowance and estimated total water
use, a project applicant must use the annual ETo value for El Segundo of 33.0.
The annual ETo is found in the CIMIS reference evapotranspiration zones map,
from department of water resources, published in 1999.

This section will apply to all existing landscapes that were installed before
December 1, 2015, and are over one acre in size:
      1.   For all landscapes that have a dedicated water meter for the
irrigation system, the local agency is required to administer programs that may
include, but not be limited to, irrigation water use analyses, irrigation
surveys, and irrigation audits to evaluate water use and provide
recommendations as necessary to reduce landscape water use to a level that does
not exceed the maximum applied water allowance for existing landscapes. The
maximum applied water allowance for existing landscapes must be calculated as:
   MAWA = (0.8) (ETo)(LA)(0.62).
      2.   For all landscapes that do not have a dedicated meter for the
irrigation system, the local agency must administer programs that may include,
but not be limited to, irrigation surveys and irrigation audits to evaluate
water use and provide recommendations as necessary in order to prevent water
waste.
      3.   All landscape audits must be conducted by a certified landscape
irrigation auditor and must describe the items in subsection
15-15A-14D1 of this chapter.
   C.   Water Waste Prevention: Local agencies must prevent water waste
resulting from inefficient landscape irrigation by prohibiting runoff from
leaving the target landscape due to low head drainage, overspray, or other
similar conditions where water flows onto adjacent property, nonirrigated
areas, walks, roadways, parking lots, or structures. Penalties for violation of
these prohibitions will be established locally.
Restrictions regarding overspray and runoff may be modified if:
      1.   The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no runoff
occurs; or
      2.   The adjacent nonpermeable surfaces are designed and constructed to
drain entirely to landscaping. (Ord. 1515, 12-15-2015)
15-15A-16: PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION AND ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   It is unlawful for any person to violate, to cause, or to maintain a
violation of this chapter.
   B.   It is unlawful for any person to remove or cause removal of water
conserving irrigation valves or equipment contrary to the provisions of this
chapter.
   C.   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter will be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. Each day such violation is committed or
permitted to continue will constitute a separate offense and will be punishable
as such. Before any enforcement action of this section by the city, at least
one warning notice shall be provided to a person responsible for a violation of
this section, provided that the violation does not create an immediate danger
to health or safety. In cases of immediate danger to health and safety, no
warning notice is required before an enforcement action.
   D.   The director of community development will have authority to perform
the following duties:
      1.   To enforce the provisions of this chapter and the landscape
specifications;
      2.   To supervise or inspect all work done under any permit or approval
issued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter;

the Director’s decision is final. The Director may refer any such request to
the Planning Commission for review.
   B.   Compliance With Codes: Signs must comply with applicable provisions of
the latest adopted Building Code, Electrical Code, and Sign Code at the time of
permit issuance.
   C.   Permanent Materials: Except for banners, flags, temporary signs, and
window signs conforming with the provisions of this chapter, signs must be
constructed of permanent materials, and must be permanently attached to the

pursuant to this Code.
   E.   Abatement Of Signs: When the permittee, property owner, or person in
possession of control of the property fails to comply with the Director’s order
requiring compliance with the chapter, the City may declare the sign as a
public nuisance in accordance with title 7 of this Code. Once designated as a
nuisance, the City is authorized to abate the nuisance according to the
provisions of this Code. (Ord. 1559, 10-17-2017; amd. Ord. 1620, 11-17-2020;

not protrude or extend horizontally more than eighteen inches (18") from the
existing utility pole or structure unless such utility mounted facility
receives Planning Commission approval of a conditional use permit. (Ord. 1275,
8-19-1997; amd. Ord. 1315, 1-18-2000; Ord. 1639, 9-20-2022)
15-19-7: MAJOR FACILITIES:
The following requirements shall apply in addition to the requirements of
Section
15-19-5 of this Chapter:
   A.   Requirement For Conditional Use Permit: Each major facility that is not
specifically exempt under Section
15-19-3 of this Chapter must first obtain Planning Commission approval of a
conditional use permit in accordance with Chapter 23 of this Title and any
additional or different requirements made applicable by this Chapter. If the
Planning Commission denies any application for a conditional use permit, it
shall make a written determination supported by findings that the proposed
facility would cause significant negative impacts on the public safety or
welfare.
   B.   Location Requirements:
      1.   Lattice towers shall not be located in: a) any part of Zones C-RS or
C-2; b) any area zoned for residential use; or c) any part of Zone C-3 located
west of Sepulveda Boulevard. Lattice towers may be permitted in all other
zones; provided, however, that they shall not be located within one hundred
feet (100') of any property containing a residential structure.
      2.   No portion or extension of a major facility shall protrude beyond
property lines or extend into any portion of property where such facility is
not itself permitted; provided, however, that the City may approve the location
of guy wires in a required setback if such approval is consistent with the
guidelines and requirements set forth in this Chapter.
      3.   A ground mounted facility shall not be located in a required parking
area, vehicle maneuvering area, vehicle/pedestrian circulation area or area of
landscaping such that it interferes with, or in any way impairs, the utility or
intended function of such area. (Ord. 1275, 8-19-1997)
   C.   Additional Design Requirements:
      1.   A ground mounted facility shall be secured from access by the
general public with a fence of a type and design approved by either the
Director of Community Development or the Planning Commission.
      2.   A ground mounted facility shall be covered with a clear anti-
graffiti material of a type approved by the Director of Community Development.
The City may grant an exception to this requirement if the applicant
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City that there is adequate security
around the facility to prevent graffiti. (Ord. 1275, 8-19-1997; amd. Ord. 1315,
1-18-2000)
   D.   Height Requirements: Notwithstanding any other provision in this Code,
no major facility shall exceed the maximum building height for the applicable
zoning district unless such facility receives Planning Commission approval of a
conditional use permit, which permit shall not be considered for approval
unless:
      1.   The applicant demonstrates to the City's satisfaction that exceeding
the height limitation is reasonably necessary for operation of the facility; or
      2.   The facility is collocated and the height in excess of zoning
requirements is reasonably necessary to the proposed shared use.
   E.   Additional Screening And Site Selection Guidelines: In addition to the
above requirements, the following guidelines shall be considered by the City in
connection with its processing of any facility permit:
      1.   A major facility should not be located within two hundred feet
(200') of any property containing a residential use.
      2.   A major facility should be located at least five hundred feet (500')
from the nearest existing, legally established major facility (except in the
event that such facility is collocated).
      3.   A ground mounted facility should be located in close proximity to
existing aboveground utilities, such as electrical tower or utility poles (not
scheduled for removal or undergrounding in the next 18 months), light poles,
trees of comparable height, water tanks and other areas where the facility will
not detract from the image or appearance of the City.
      4.   A roof mounted facility that extends above the existing parapet of
the building on which it is mounted should be screened by a material and in a
manner that is compatible with the existing design and architecture of the
building.
      5.   A roof mounted facility, and any guy wires, supporting structures
and accessory equipment should be located and designed so as to minimize the
visual impact as viewed from surrounding properties and public streets.
      6.   No part of a ground mounted facility should be located in any
required setback. (Ord. 1275, 8-19-1997; amd. Ord. 1639, 9-20-2022)
15-19-8: PUBLIC PROPERTY FACILITIES:
   A.   Preapproved Locations:
      1.   The City will approve by resolution, following a duly noticed public
hearing, a list of sites which may be located on public property or within the
public right of way and which are approved for major facilities. Each site
shall include a description of permissible development and design
characteristics, including, but not limited to, maximum height requirements.
The City shall make said resolution available to all persons upon request. The
approved list of locations may be subsequently amended by resolution from time
to time.
      2.   All facilities located on a public property site which is
preapproved in accordance with subsection B1 of this Section following the
effective date hereof must obtain administrative approval of a WCFP in
accordance with Chapter 22 of this Title, and any additional or different
requirements made applicable by this Chapter.
      3.   All leases of public property which are preapproved in accordance
with subsection B1 of this Section shall be nonexclusive. The operator of a
facility located on such public property shall make the supporting structure of
the facility available to any other applicant wishing to collocate to the
extent technically feasible.
   B.   Requirement For Separate Lease Agreement: Any lease of City- owned
property for the purpose of erecting a wireless communications facility shall
require a negotiated lease agreement or other written license granted by the
City. The existence of a lease agreement or license shall not relieve applicant
of any obligations to obtain appropriate permits as required by this Code.
(Ord. 1275, 8-19-1997)
15-19-9: COORDINATED ANTENNA PLANS:
   A.   Requirements: Any wireless service provider may apply for Planning
Commission approval of a coordinated antenna plan (CAP) to obtain preapproval
for the use of proposed and potential future locations for facilities, subject
to the following requirements:
      1.   The CAP shall specify permissible development and design
characteristics for identified future locations, including, but not limited to,
maximum height and size, type of supporting structure, and type of antenna.
      2.   The CAP shall identify potential future locations by lot and parcel
number.
      3.   Applications for a CAP may be considered by the Planning Commission
after holding a noticed public hearing thereon in accordance with Chapter 27 of
this Title.
      4.   Following Planning Commission approval of a CAP, each facility that
complies with the specifications of the CAP may be approved subject to an
administrative WCFP in accordance with the requirements set forth and
referenced herein. Except for the type of permit, nothing in this Section shall
relieve the applicant of the obligation to comply with the regulations,
requirements, and guidelines as required by this Chapter, and the Director of
Community Development may deny a WCFP, or place conditions upon its approval,
notwithstanding prior approval of a CAP.
      5.   Any conditions placed on the approval of a WCFP for a facility which
complies with the CAP shall not be inconsistent with the specifications of the
CAP.
      6.   The CAP shall not vest any permanent rights to use the preapproved
locations for facilities beyond the date of expiration. Unless extended, the
CAP shall expire twenty four (24) months following its approval by the Planning
Commission regardless of whether any WCFP has been granted pursuant to the CAP.
The Planning Commission may, at its discretion, after written request therefor,
extend the term of the CAP for up to twenty four (24) additional months; no CAP
shall continue longer than forty eight (48) months.
   B.   Findings: The Planning Commission shall approve a CAP based upon the
following findings:
      1.   The intent and purpose of this Chapter, and all its regulations and
requirements will be preserved.
      2.   Any future facility complying with the specifications imposed by the
CAP will not have a significant adverse impact on the subject site or
surrounding community beyond those impacts considered in the approval of the
CAP.
      3.   Any future facilities within the specifications of the CAP will be
consistent with the General Plan and the uses permitted in this Zoning Title,
subject to subsequent approval of a WCFP.
   C.   Application Procedures: Each applicant for a CAP shall submit the
following information:
      1.   Written application on a form prescribed by the Community, Economic
and Development Services Department.
      2.   A map clearly indicating the following information:
         a.   Lot and parcel dimensions for proposed locations.
         b.   Location, size, height and use of all existing buildings and
structures on the proposed location and abutting properties.
         c.   Location, height, and description of all existing aboveground
utility facilities on the proposed location and abutting properties.
         d.   Location, size, and dimensions of all existing yards, setbacks,
landscape areas, parking, walls, fences, and spaces between structures on the
proposed location and abutting properties.
         e.   Any other information as may be required by the Community,
Economic and Development Services Department.
      3.   Written statement indicating for each location: a) the proposed
maximum height of the facility; b) the anticipated type of antenna structure;
c) any anticipated accessory equipment to be located on the site; d) proposed
screening materials, if any, in general terms; and e) willingness to collocate
on the proposed location.
      4.   All applicable permit processing fees as established by resolution.
An additional permit fee for each proposed facility shall be submitted with
each subsequent application for a WCFP, and with each request for modification
of a permit.
   D.   Modification Procedures: Subsequent approval of a WCFP for a major
facility subject to a CAP requires strict compliance with the specifications of
the CAP (in addition to any additional conditions of the WCFP); provided,
however, that the Director of Community Development may approve a minor
modification of the CAP concurrent with an application for a WCFP. For the
purposes of this Section, a minor modification shall include any adjustment to
the approved specifications of the CAP which: 1) does not increase the height
of the facility by more than five percent (5%) from the approved maximum
height; 2) does not move the location of the facility closer to any approved
location; 3) does not move the location of the facility within two hundred feet
(200') of a residential property or school facility; and 4) does not otherwise
significantly increase the adverse impacts upon the subject site or surrounding
community. (Ord. 1275, 8-19-1997; amd. Ord. 1315, 1-18-2000; Ord. 1639, 9-20-
2022)
15-19-10: APPEAL OR REVIEW AND NOTICES:
Any applicant or the operator and/or owner of a facility may appeal a final
decision of the Director of Community Development or Planning Commission. All
appeals shall be processed as provided by Chapters 25 and 27 of this Title.
(Ord. 1275, 8-19-1997; amd. Ord. 1315, 1-18-2000; Ord. 1639, 9-20-2022)

the Planning Commission. (Ord. 1275, 8-19-1997; amd. Ord. 1315, 1-18-2000; Ord.
1639, 9-20-2022)
15-19-12: FACILITY REMOVAL:
   A.   Discontinued Use: The operator of a lawfully erected facility, and the
owner of the premises upon which it is located, shall promptly notify the
Director of Community Development in writing in the event that use of the
facility is discontinued for any reason. In the event that discontinued use is
permanent, then the owner and/or operator shall promptly remove the facility,
repair any damage to the premises caused by such removal, and restore the
premises as appropriate such as to be in conformance with applicable zoning
codes. All such removal, repair and restoration shall be completed within
ninety (90) days after the use is discontinued, and shall be performed in
accordance with all applicable health and safety requirements. For purposes of
this subsection, a discontinued use shall be permanent unless the facility is
reasonably likely to be operative and used within the immediately following
three (3) month period.
   B.   Abandonment: A facility that is inoperative or unused for a period of
six (6) continuous months shall be deemed abandoned. Written notice of the
City's determination of abandonment shall be provided to the operator of the
facility and the owner of the premises upon which the facility is located. Such
notice may be delivered in person, or mailed to the address stated on the
facility permit application, and shall be deemed given at the time delivered or
placed in the mail. A written notice of the City's determination of abandonment
shall be mailed or delivered to the operator of the facility at the address
stated in the relevant permit application.
   C.   Removal Of Abandoned Facility Or Hearing: The operator of the facility
and the owner of the property on which it is located, shall within thirty (30)
days after notice of abandonment is given either: 1) remove the facility and
restore the premises, or 2) provide the Community, Economic and Development
Services Department with written objection to the City's determination of
abandonment and request for hearing before the Director of Community
Development in accordance with the procedures in Chapter 27 of this Title. If a
written objection is timely received and a hearing is properly requested, the
procedures for hearings, notices and related fees set forth in Chapter 27 of
this Title shall apply. The operator and/or owner shall be given the
opportunity to provide evidence that the facility was in use during the
relevant six (6) month period and that it is presently operational. The
operator and/or owner shall be given the opportunity to cross-examine any
evidence provided by the City to the contrary. The Director of Community
Development shall review all evidence, determine whether or not the facility
was properly deemed abandoned, and provide the operator notice of its
determination.
   D.   Removal By City: The City may remove the abandoned facility, repair any
and all damage to the premises caused by such removal, and otherwise restore
the premises as is appropriate to be in compliance with applicable code at any
time: 1) after thirty (30) days following the notice of abandonment; or 2)
following a notice of decision by the Director of Community Development, if
applicable, subject to the owner/operator's right of appeal under Chapter 25 of
this Title. The City may, but shall not be required to, store the removed
facility (or any part thereof). The owner of the premises upon which the
abandoned facility was located, and all prior operators of the facility, shall
be jointly liable for the entire cost of such removal, repair, restoration and
storage, and shall remit payment to the City promptly after demand therefor is
made. The City may, in lieu of storing the removed facility, convert it to the
City's use, sell it, or dispose of it in any manner deemed by the City to be
appropriate.
   E.   Penalties: The operator of the facility, and the owners of the premises
upon which it is located, shall be in violation of this Chapter for failure to
timely comply with any requirements hereunder. Each such person shall be
subject to penalties for each such violation, pursuant to Section
15-28-2 of this Title.
   F.   City Lien On Property: Until the cost of removal, repair, restoration
and storage is paid in full, a lien shall be placed on the abandoned personal
property and any real property on which the facility was located, for the full
amount of the cost of removal, repair, restoration and storage. The Director of
Community Development shall cause the lien to be recorded in the County of Los
Angeles Recorder's office. (Ord. 1275, 8-19-1997; amd. Ord. 1315, 1-18-2000;

The following terms, whenever used in this Chapter, shall apply only to the
transfer of development rights procedures as provided for in this Chapter:
   DONOR SITE: A parcel located west of Sepulveda Boulevard and located within
the C-3 or CO Zone from which NFA is being transferred pursuant to the
provisions of this Chapter.
   RECEIVING SITE: A parcel located east of the easterly right-of- way line of
Sepulveda Boulevard, which does not abut or take access from Sepulveda
Boulevard, and located within the C-3, CO, MU-N, or M-1 Zone that receives NFA
from a donor site pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter.
   TRAFFIC ANALYSIS ZONE (TAZ): A specific area in the City of El Segundo which
has been identified for traffic study and mitigation purposes.
   TRANSFER: The transfer of the unused allowable NFA of a parcel from a donor
site to a receiving site, which is approved in accordance with the provisions
of this Chapter.
   TRANSFER OF DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS (TDRs): Allowing a property to increase its
building square footage above that permitted by the floor area ratio (FAR)
standards by purchasing allowed building square footage from another site.
   TRANSFER PLAN: A plan that identifies and describes the donor site,
receiving site, amount of the NFA to be transferred, the proposed uses of the
donor site and receiving site, the public benefit of the transfer, and the
proposed conditions of approval. (Ord. 1286, 3-17-1998)
 
15-20-3: PROHIBITIONS:
   A.   Notwithstanding any provision of this Chapter to the contrary, no
building permit shall be issued for any project that is inconsistent with the
zoning restrictions on the lot, except for FAR restrictions.
   B.   Notwithstanding any provision of this Chapter to the contrary, only
properties east of Sepulveda Boulevard, which do not abut or take access from

proposed uses of the donor site and receiving site.
   B.   Review By Planning Commission: The Planning Commission shall approve,
conditionally approve or deny a transfer plan. The Planning Commission shall
use the following criteria in making its determination:
      1.   That the transfer plan is in accord with the objectives of this
Title and the purposes of the zone in which the sites are located.
      2.   That the proposed transfer plan will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or
improvements in the vicinity.
      3.   That the proposed transfer plan complies with each of the applicable
provisions of this Chapter.
      4.   That the donor site and receiving site are located within the same
traffic analysis zone (TAZ) as identified in Exhibit A located at the end of
this Section.
      5.   That the total square footage of the transfer may not exceed ten
percent (10%) of the total buildout square footage for each zone, as specified
in the General Plan summary of buildout (Exhibit LU-3).
      6.   That the proposed transfer plan recognizes and compensates for
potential impacts that could be generated by the proposed transfer, such as
aesthetics, noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vibration, odors, traffic and hazards.

conditions of approval and the following:
      1.   Recorded Covenant: A covenant in a form approved by the City
Attorney shall be recorded against the donor site and receiving site setting
forth the details of the transfer plan and any conditions of approval imposed
by the Planning Commission and/or the City Council. The covenant shall be
executed by all parties that have a legal or equitable interest in the donor
site or the receiving site. The covenant shall reflect that from the date of
recording of the covenant that the donor site and receiving site shall
thereafter in perpetuity be burdened by the covenant and the FAR for the donor
site and receiving site will be set in the covenant pursuant to the FAR allowed
at the time of approval of the transfer plan. The Director of Community
Development may approve the removal of the covenant from the properties if the
transfer has not been utilized by the receiving site and the legal and
equitable owners of the property execute a request for removal in a form
acceptable to the City Attorney. Any modification to an approved transfer plan
must be submitted to the City for review utilizing the procedures set forth in
this Chapter for approval of a transfer plan. Recording, modifying or removing
a covenant shall require a title insurance policy as set forth below. (Ord.
1286, 3-18-1998; amd. Ord. 1315, 1-18-2000)
      2.   Title Insurance: Prior to recording, modifying or removing a
covenant pursuant to subsection E1 of this Section, the applicant shall secure
a title insurance policy benefiting the City in an amount equal to the value of
the NFA being transferred. The applicant shall be responsible for all costs
associated with procuring title insurance, including without limitation the

CHAPTER 21
NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND USES
SECTION:
15-21-1: Purpose
15-21-2: Chapter Application
15-21-3: General Provisions
15-21-4: Nonconforming Lots
15-21-5: Residential Restrictions
15-21-6: Nonresidential Restrictions
15-21-7: Restrictions For The Heavy Industrial (M-2) Zone
15-21-8: Nonconforming Signs
15-21-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   Establish Criteria: The purpose of this chapter is to establish
provisions for the continued use, modification or removal of nonconforming
buildings or uses. A nonconforming building or use is one that was lawfully
established and maintained, but due to changes in this title or other
governmental actions, such building or use no longer complies with the
provisions of this title. A nonconforming building, or portion of a building,
or use shall constitute a nonconforming use of the property.
   B.   Eventual Compliance: It is also the intent of this chapter to permit
nonconformities to continue until they are removed. In addition,
nonconformities shall not be enlarged, expanded, extended, altered, moved,
reestablished after abandonment or restored after destruction, except as
provided by this chapter. It is the goal of this chapter to require
nonconforming uses to be altered to conform to the current requirements of this
title. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993)
15-21-2: CHAPTER APPLICATION:
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to buildings, structures, lands and
uses which hereafter become nonconforming due to any reclassification of zones
which occurred through the adoption of a new General Plan and subsequent
rezoning actions to provide consistency with the General Plan. Any uses which
become nonconforming due to these actions shall be considered legal
nonconforming uses and structures. If a use originally authorized by variance
prior to the effective date hereof is located within a zone in which such use
is not permitted by the terms of this title, the use shall acquire a legal
nonconforming status. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993)
15-21-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
The following conditions apply to nonconforming uses and structures:
   A.   Safety: All nonconforming structures may undergo necessary maintenance
to provide for their safe and habitable use.
   B.   Building Removal; Future Use: If any nonconforming building is
voluntarily removed, every future use of the land on which the building is
located must conform to this Code.
   C.   Reestablish Damaged Or Destroyed Building: Unless otherwise provided by
applicable law, a nonconforming use or structure that is damaged or destroyed
by fire, earthquake, or other calamity beyond the property owner's control may
be reestablished subject to the provisions of this title if a building permit
is issued within twenty four (24) months of the occurrence of the damage or
destruction. All nonconforming rights expire if a building permit is not issued
within twenty four (24) months.
   D.   Building Additions, Alterations, Remodel Or Reconstruction: A
nonconforming building or structure may be altered, restored, remodeled or
reconstructed, or may include an addition, provided that no more than fifty
percent (50%) of the existing original "exterior perimeter wall height" (as
defined) is removed, demolished or replaced. If more than fifty percent (50%)
of the existing perimeter wall height and the original foundation is removed,
demolished, or replaced, the entire building or structure must be brought into
conformity with all current development standards and laws. The foundation must
not be removed and a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the exterior perimeter
walls must remain attached to the foundation at all times. Solely removing
exterior wall coverings, including wall insulation, electrical wiring, plumbing
or interior plaster or drywall finishes does not require that the entire
building be brought into conformity with all current development standards
within the zone in which the property is located.
   E.   Minor Exceptions For Building Additions, Alterations, Remodel, Or
Reconstruction: The Director of Community Development may grant administrative
adjustments for a reduction of retention of a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of
exterior perimeter wall height for life safety repairs or upgrades, regardless
of whether those repairs or upgrades exceed the fifty percent (50%) threshold
for nonconforming buildings set forth in this section. The upgrades must be
incidental and necessary to protect public health and safety. The
administrative adjustment must be granted before any removal of any exterior
perimeter wall in excess of fifty percent (50%) occurs. (Ord. 1460, 4-19-2011;
amd. Ord. 1620, 11-17-2020; Ord. 1639, 9-20-2022)
15-21-4: NONCONFORMING LOTS:
A lot of record existing before the effective date hereof, which does not
conform to the area and dimension standards of this title, may be used in
accordance with other provisions of this title. Even though such a lot fails to
meet the requirements for area or width, or both, for a particular zone, it may
be used; provided, that yard dimensions and requirements other than those
applying to area or width of the lot be observed. (Ord. 1212, 11-16-1993)
15-21-5: RESIDENTIAL RESTRICTIONS:
All legal or legal nonconforming structures within any residential zone, in
existence as of the effective date hereof, which are now legal nonconforming or
become legal nonconforming due to changes in the land use designation or zoning
criteria under this title, are permitted to continue and remodel or expand,
provided all of the following requirements are met:
   A.   Where a side yard setback is nonconforming, the width of the existing
side yard cannot be decreased or made more nonconforming due to remodeling or

specifically listed as either a permitted use or conditional use under a
particular zone, the Director, upon written request or upon his or her own
initiative, shall determine whether said use is sufficiently similar to a
listed use in the particular zone to justify a finding that it should be deemed
either a permitted use, a conditional use or that an administrative use permit
is necessary. The Director or designee may make administrative determinations,
subject to the process outlined in Chapter 23 of this title.
   B.   Administrative determination findings. Before permitting or classifying
an unlisted use, the Director shall first make the following findings:
      1.   The proposed use is consistent with the purpose of this Title;
      2.   The proposed use and its operation are compatible with the uses
allowed in the zone; and

is similar to other uses subject to administrative use permit in a particular
zone, the Director may review and grant administrative use permits, subject to
the process set forth in Chapter 23 of this title.
   B.   Findings. Before granting an administrative use permit, the Director
shall first make the following findings:
      1.   There is compatibility of the particular use on the particular site
in relationship to other existing and potential uses within the general area in
which the use is proposed to be located.
      2.   The proposed use is consistent and compatible with the purpose of
the zone in which the site is located.
      3.   The proposed location and use and the conditions under which the use
would be operated or maintained will not be detrimental to the public health,
safety or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the
vicinity.
      4.   Potential impacts that could be generated by the proposed use, such
as noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vibration, odors, traffic and hazards have been
recognized and compensated for.
   C.   Alcohol-related use findings: In addition to the four findings above,
before an alcohol-related administrative use permit may be granted, it shall
also be found that the State Department of Alcohol Beverage Control has issued
or will issue a license to sell alcohol to the applicant. (Ord. 1629, 11-16-
2021)
15-22-4: ADJUSTMENTS TO DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Authority to grant. Whenever a strict interpretation of the provisions
of this title or its application to any specific case or situation pertaining
to the following items would result in the unreasonable deprivation of the use
or enjoyment of property, the Director or designee may grant an adjustment,
subject to the process set forth in Chapter 23 of this title.
   B.   Applicability. Adjustments may be granted for the following standards:
      1.   Fence or wall height to exceed permitted height by two feet.

area within required open space in the Multi-Family Residential (R-3) Zone as
set forth in section 15-4C-5 of this title.
      9.   Building height to exceed the maximum allowable height by not more
than five feet.
   C.   Findings. Before granting an adjustment, the Director shall make the
following findings:
      1.    That the proposed adjustment would not be detrimental to the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
      2.    That the proposed adjustment is necessary in order that the
applicant may not be deprived unreasonably in the use or enjoyment of his
property; and
      3.    That the proposed adjustment is consistent with the legislative
intent of this title.

15-31-6: Notification
15-31-1: PURPOSE:
This chapter is intended to implement the orderly acquisition and improvement
of public rights of way to benefit public health, safety and welfare. Private
property owners should provide and improve public rights of way to ensure that
private property development does not adversely impact other public and private
facilities and services. (Ord. 1465, 11-1-2011)
15-31-2: DEFINITIONS:
Unless the contrary is stated or clearly appears from the context, the
following definitions govern the construction of the words and phrases used in
this chapter. Words and phrases not defined by this chapter have the meaning
set forth elsewhere in this code, Government Code or the Public Resources Code.
DEVELOPMENT: The meaning set forth in chapter 1 of this title.
DIRECTOR: The public works director or such other director designated by the
city manager.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT: A review of a development in accordance with section
6 of resolution 3805, adopted March 16, 1993.
USE: The meaning set forth in chapter 1 of this title. (Ord. 1465, 11-1-2011)
15-31-3: DEDICATION:
   A.   Dedication: Unless otherwise provided, any development requiring review
and approval of a Site Plan Review application located on a lot abutting public
rights of way, must dedicate a portion of that lot to widen the public rights
of way in accordance with the standards in exhibit C-8 of the general plan
circulation element. Property dedications must be noted on building plans
before the city issues a building permit and the dedications must be made
before the city approves a final inspection for a building permit or issues a
certificate of occupancy for a proposed project. The director is authorized to
substitute an irrevocable offer to dedicate or to substitute a combination of a
dedication and an irrevocable offer to dedicate for public rights of way in
compliance with the standards in exhibit C-8 of the general plan circulation
element and subject to section
15-31-4 of this chapter.
   B.   Width: Table 1 of this section, is based on exhibit C-8 of the general
plan circulation element and establishes the standard right of way widths for
the various classifications for public rights of way. The right of way
dedication on an individual lot is that portion of private property necessary
to provide one-half (1/2) of the required standard width, measured from the
centerline of the street.
TABLE 1
Right Of Way Classification Minimum Width (Feet)
TABLE 1
Right Of Way Classification Minimum Width (Feet)
Major arterial              142 – 150 (varies based on lane configuration)
Secondary arterial          98 – 120 (varies based on lane configuration)
Collector (divided)         80
Collector                   64
Local:                       
 Commercial                60 – 64 (varies based on lane configuration)
 Residential               60
Alley                       20
 
      1.   Greater Widths: Greater widths may be required as by the director of
public works or designee conditions of subdivision maps, site plan review,
conditional use permits or standards variances.
      2.   Reduced Widths: The required standard width may be reduced at
specific locations on specific streets due to unusual conditions, as authorized
by the director of public works or designee.
   C.   Effect on required yard areas and building area ratios: All required
yard areas, lot coverage and floor area ratio calculations must be measured
after the dedication or reservation. If the director of public works requires
an irrevocable offer to dedicate, the required yard areas, lot coverage and
floor area ratio calculations may be measured not including the area of
dedication or reservation.
   D.   Notwithstanding subsection A above, the City will not impose a land
dedication requirement on a housing development pursuant to Section 66001 to
widen a roadway if the land dedication requirement is for the purpose of
mitigating vehicular traffic impacts, achieving an adopted traffic level of
service related to vehicular traffic, or achieving a desired roadway width.
However, the City may do any of the following:
      1.   Impose a land dedication requirement on a housing development if
both of the following conditions are met:
         a.   The housing development is not located in a transit priority
area.
         b.   The housing development has a linear street frontage of five
hundred feet (500') or more.
      2.   Discretionarily impose a land dedication requirement as a condition
of approval of a specific housing development project for traffic safety
features if the City makes a finding, specific to the housing development
project and supported by substantial evidence, that the land dedication
requirement is necessary to preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the
public, including pedestrians, cyclists, and children.
      3.   Impose a land dedication requirement to construct public
improvements, including, but not limited to, sidewalk and sewer improvements.
(Ord. 1465, 11-1-2011; amd. Ord. 1648, 6-21-2023; Ord. 1668, 2-18-2025)

building permit or issues a certificate of occupancy for any development or
change of use, a property owner must make all required improvements and repairs
to abutting public rights of way. The improvements and repairs must extend
along the width and depth of the property and for a reasonable distance beyond
the property as is necessary to complete the improvement or repair. Existing
improvements that are damaged and that may have been damaged during
construction of the building must also be repaired.
   B.   Required improvements; All Development: Development or a change of use
is required to provide the following right of way improvements that the

street width as required in exhibit C-8 of the general plan circulation
element.
   C.   Required improvements; new development requiring an environmental

The director may waive requirements of this chapter if the director determines
that such improvements are unnecessary for a public purpose or that the cost of
the improvement is proportionally excessive when compared to the scale of the
project or the demand generated by the project subject to the findings set
forth below. The determination of the director may be appealed to the planning
commission in accordance with chapter 29 of this title.
   A.   Proposed waiver: To waive the need for improvements and dedications
otherwise required by this chapter, the director must find upon substantial
evidence that:
      1.   The proposed waiver maintains the minimum roadway width necessary
for emergency vehicle access as determined by the fire chief;
      2.   The proposed waiver maintains the minimum roadway width and lane
widths deemed necessary for safe two-directional vehicular passage. The minimum
lane width cannot be less than 10 feet in width for a travel lane and eight
feet (8') in width for a parking lane;
      3.   The proposed waiver will maintain the necessary roadway width for
the traffic volumes projected during the general plan buildout as determined by
the director of planning and building safety unless the director determines
that the dedication or irrevocable offer to dedicate will require the removal
of all or a portion of an existing building;
      4.   The proposed waiver complies with any requirements of state and
federal regulations, including, without limitation, disabled access
requirements for public sidewalks;
      5.   The proposed waiver would not be detrimental to the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located;
      6.   That the proposed waiver is necessary in order that the applicant is
not unreasonably deprived the use or enjoyment of his property; and
      7.   The proposed waiver is consistent with the legislative intent of
this title.
   B.   Conditions: If the director grants a waiver, the director may impose
such conditions necessary to safeguard public health, safety, and welfare. In
all instances the director must impose the following conditions:
      1.   Establish a term during which the irrevocable offer to dedicate is
effective.
      2.   The waiver does not become effective for 10 days from when it is
granted or, if an appeal is filed, there is a final determination.
      3.   The waiver becomes null and void if it is unused for 180 days from
its effective date. (Ord. 1465, 11-1-2011; amd. Ord. 1620, 11-17-2020; Ord.

15-32-1: PURPOSE:
This chapter is adopted pursuant to the city’s police powers and the mitigation
fee act 1 , for the purpose of imposing fees on applicants seeking to construct
development projects. The purpose of such fees is to minimize, to the greatest
extent practicable, the impact that new development has on the city’s public
services and public facilities. Toward that end, the city intends that
applicants for such development projects pay their fair share of the costs of
providing such public services and public facilities. Accordingly, the amount
of each impact fee is calculated based upon the gross square footage of
nonresidential development, number of residential dwelling units, type or
density or intensity of use, vehicle trip generation, or other appropriate
methodology which ensures that the fee is roughly proportional to the impacts
of new development on public facilities. The city assumes responsibility for
and will pay for with general city revenues all public facility needs for
existing development. (Ord. 1389, 12-6-2005)

in-lieu fee, as a condition of project approval.
(Ord. 1594, 11-19-2019)
15-34-2: APPLICATION:
This chapter shall apply to all commercial or industrial development projects
where the project cost exceeds two million dollars ($2,000,000.00).

install new artwork with an appraised value greater than this Chapter’s one
percent (1%) of the project cost threshold, and such additional amount may be
considered a “public benefit.”

income, low- income, moderate-income and senior citizens housing units in
accordance with Government Code Sections 65915 through 65918, as may be amended
from time to time ("State Density Bonus Law"). In enacting this section, it is
also the intent of the City to facilitate the development of affordable housing
and to implement the goals, objectives, and policies of the housing element of
the City's General Plan. A copy of the current State Density Bonus Law shall be
kept on file with the Development Services Department.
(Ord. 1645, 3-7-2023)
15-35-2: APPLICATION:
This Chapter shall apply to any qualifying residential development application
which meets the criteria to receive a density bonus.
(Ord. 1645, 3-7-2023)
15-35-3: DENSITY BONUS APPLICATION:
   A.   In addition to any other review required for a proposed housing
development, applications for density bonus shall be filed on a form approved
by the Development Services Director ("director"). The application for a
density bonus shall be filed concurrently with an application for a
development. At the time the application is submitted, the applicant shall pay
a density bonus application fee, established by City Council resolution.
   B.   An applicant for a density bonus must file an application for a density
bonus with the director concurrently with the application for all other
entitlements necessary for the proposed housing development.
   C.   The application must contain information sufficient to fully evaluate
the request under the requirements of this chapter and Government Code section
65915, including, without limitation, the following:
      1.   A description of the proposed housing development, including an
explanation of how the proposed project will satisfy the eligibility
requirements of Government Code section 65915;
      2.   The total number of housing units proposed in the project, including
unit sizes and the number of bedrooms;
      3.   The total number of units proposed to be granted through the density
increase over and above the otherwise maximum density for the project site;
      4.   The total number of units to be made affordable to or reserved for
sale or rental to very low, low or moderate-income households, or senior
citizens, or other qualifying residents consistent with state law;
       5.   A list of any concessions or incentives being requested to
facilitate the development of the project, together with documentation of
resulting cost reductions necessary to provide for affordable housing costs;
and
      6.   Any other information the director determines necessary to process
and evaluate the proposal consistent with Government Code section 65915.
(Ord. 1645, 3-7-2023)
15-35-4: REVIEW AND DETERMINATION:
   A.   For a housing development qualifying pursuant to the requirements of
Government Code Section 65915, the City shall grant a density bonus in an
amount specified by Government Code Section 65915. Except as otherwise required
by Government Code Section 65915, the density bonus units shall not be included
when calculating the total number of housing units that qualifies the housing
development for a density bonus.
   B.   For the purpose of calculating the density bonus, the "maximum
allowable residential density" shall be the maximum density allowed under the
zoning ordinance and land use element of the general plan, or, if a range of
density is permitted, the maximum allowable density for the specific zoning
range and land use element of the general plan applicable to the project. Where
the density allowed under the zoning ordinance is inconsistent with the density
allowed under the land use element of the general plan, the maximum density
allowed in the general plan shall prevail.
   C.   The City shall grant the applicant the number of incentives and
concessions required by Government Code Section 65915. The City shall grant the
specific concession(s) or incentive(s) requested by the applicant, unless it
makes any of the relevant written findings stated in Government Code Section
65915(d)(1).
   D.   The applicant may request, and the City shall grant, a reduction in
parking requirements in accordance with Government Code Section 65915(p), as
that section may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. 1645, 3-7-2023)
15-35-5: WAIVER OF DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Except as restricted by Government Code Section 65915, the applicant
for a density bonus may submit a proposal for the waiver or reduction of
development standards that have the effect of physically precluding the
construction of a housing development incorporating the density bonus and any
incentives or concessions granted to the applicant. A request for a waiver or
reduction of development standards shall be accompanied by documentation
demonstrating that the waiver or reduction is physically necessary to construct
the housing development with the additional density allowed pursuant to the
density bonus and incorporating any incentives or concessions required to be
granted. The City shall approve a waiver or reduction of a development
standard, unless it finds that:
      1.   The application of the development standard does not have the effect
of physically precluding the construction of a housing development at the
density allowed by the density bonus and with the incentives or concessions
granted to the applicant;
      2.   The waiver or reduction of the development standard would have a
specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of
Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for
which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the
specific adverse impact;
      3.   The waiver or reduction of the development standard would have an
adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register
of Historical Resources; or
      4.   The waiver or reduction of the development standard would be
contrary to state or federal law.
(Ord. 1645, 3-7-2023)
15-35-6: AGREEMENT AND ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   The applicant shall enter into an agreement with the City to ensure the
continued affordability of all affordable units or the continued reservation of
such units for qualifying senior citizens. Prior to receiving a building permit
for any project that receives a density bonus or any incentive, concession,
waiver, or reduction of development standards pursuant to this section, such
agreement shall be recorded as a covenant against the property.
   B.   For any development project that is granted a density bonus or other
benefit pursuant to this section, the affordable units that qualify the project
as eligible for a density bonus, must be constructed concurrently with or prior
to the construction of any market rate units.
   C.   In addition, the affordable units must be integrated with the market
rate units so that there is a mix of affordable and market rate units, if any,
in each building of the development project.
   D.   An applicant shall not receive a density bonus or other incentive or
concession unless the housing development is entitled to such a bonus,
incentive or concession under Government Code Section 65915.
   E.   The provisions of this subdivision shall be interpreted to fulfill the
requirements of Government Code Section 65915. Any changes to that Government
Code Section 65915 shall be deemed to supersede and govern any conflicting
provisions contained herein.
   F.   The director is authorized to adopt administrative regulations and
procedures necessary to implement this chapter consistent with Chapter 4.3
(Density Bonuses and Other Incentives) of Division 1 of Title 7 of the
Government Code.
