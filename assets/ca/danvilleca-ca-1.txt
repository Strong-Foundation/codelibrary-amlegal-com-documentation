ELECTIONS
2-25   GENERAL MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.
   2-25.1   Date of Election.
   The General Municipal Election for the Town of Danville shall be held on the
same day as the statewide general election as defined in Elections Code Section
1200—the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of each even-numbered
year, beginning with the election to be held in November 2000. (Ord. #20, §2-
401; Ord. #98-14, §1)
   2-25.2   Approval Required.
   This section shall take effect and become operative after its approval by
the Town Council. (Ord. #20, §2-402)

committee to a candidate for Town Council. (Ord. 2022-01, § 1)
2-27   CAMPAIGN ADVERTISING DISCLOSURE.
   2-27.1   Purpose.
   Under the California Political Reform Act, independent expenditure
committees may send mass mailings to voters for the purpose of calling for the
election or defeat of candidates for Town Council. These mass mailings are only
required to identify the name of the committee and not the names of those who
contribute to or fund the cost of the mailings. Requiring disclosure of funding
sources for such mass mailings by independent committees will further two
important interests. First, it will help ensure an informed electorate by
providing the Town’s voters with the names and business interests of those
individuals or entities advocating the election or defeat of Town Council
candidates. Second, such disclosures help to avoid corruption in the electoral
process by allowing the public to identify those who spend money to support or
oppose a candidate. (Ord. #2000-04, §1)
   2-27.2   Definitions.
   Unless otherwise specifically provided below or required by the context, the
words and phrases used in this chapter shall have the same meanings as in the
California Elections Code and in the Political Reform Act (Government Code
Section 81000 et seq.) and regulations adopted by the Fair Political Practices
Commission. (Ord. #2000-04, §1)
   2-27.3   Disclosure of Contributors to Independent Expenditure Committees.
   a.   Any committee that makes, during the calendar year in which the
election is held, more than one thousand ($1,000.00) dollars in independent
expenditures for or against a candidate for town office shall list the
following information in a clear and legible manner on the bottom one-third (1/
3) of the front page of any mass mailing by the committee in the election for
which the independent expenditures were made:
      1.   The names and occupations of individuals and the names and business
interests of non-individuals of the five (5) largest contributors to the
committee during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date of
distribution of the mass mailing, listed in order of the amount of
contributions. If two (2) or more of the largest contributors have contributed
the same amount, they shall be listed according to chronological sequence of
contribution. The disclosure shall read: “Major funding by: (name and
occupation or business interest).” In the case of contributions from
committees, the disclosure shall read: “Major funding by: (name of committee);
Expenditures directed by: (name and occupation or business interest of persons
or entities who direct or control the expenditures of the committee); and
      2.   If the committee has received at least one-third (1/3) of its total
contributions during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date of
distribution of the mass mailing from large out of town contributor(s), the
whole top one- third of the disclosure shall state “Major funding from large
out of town contributors.” “Large out of town contributors” means those
contributors (a) who either are not residents of the Town of Danville or do not
have a principal place of business in the Town of Danville, and (b) whose
cumulative contributions to the committee are one hundred ($100.00) dollars or
more for the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date of
distribution of the mass mailing.
   b.   When making the disclosures required in subsection (a)( 1), the
committee must use the same type size for all words in that disclosure. When
making the disclosures required in subsection (a)(2), the committee must use
the same type size for all words in that disclosure. The left and right and top
and bottom margins of the disclosures shall not exceed one-half (1/2) inch. The
space between lines of type shall not be more than one-half (1/2) of the type
size. The committee must list each contributor on a new line. The committee
shall use the bottom one-third (1/3) of the front page of the mass mailing
solely for the purpose of making the disclosure required in subsection (a).
   c.   For purposes of this chapter, “front page” shall mean the envelope,
page or panel where the address is, or in the case of unaddressed items, any
outside panel.
   d.   This chapter does not apply to communications from an organization to
its members.

TAXES
3-1   UNIFORM LOCAL SALES AND USE TAX.
   3-1.1   Short Title.
   This section shall be known as the Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax
Ordinance. (Ord. #14, §1)
   3-1.2   Purpose.
   The Town Council hereby declares that this section is adopted to achieve the
following, among other purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be
interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:
   a.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the
requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code;
   b.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates provisions
identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of California
insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and
limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code;
   c.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and provides
a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of
Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and
requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes;
   d.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a
manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part
1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of
collecting Town sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of
record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this
section.
(Ord. #14, §4)
   3-1.3   State Revenue and Taxation Code.
   a.   Adoption of Provisions. Except as otherwise provided in this section
and except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby adopted and made a part
of this section as though fully set forth herein.
   b.   Limitations on Adoption. In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, wherever the State of California
is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of this Town shall be
substituted therefor. The substitution, however, shall not be made when the
word “State” is used as part of the title of the State Controller, the State
Treasurer, the State Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, the
State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State of California; the
substitution shall not be made when the result of that substitution would
require action to be taken by or against the Town, or any agency thereof rather
than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions
incident to the administration or operation of this section; the substitution
shall not be made in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to,
sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the State of California, where
the result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax
with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible
personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such
sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the State
under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code,
or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other
consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by
the State under the provisions of that Code; the substitution shall not be made
in Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737,
6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; and the substitution shall not
be made for the word “State” in the phrase “retailer engaged in business in
this State” in Section 6203 or in the definition of that phrase in Section
6203.
   c.   Amendments. All subsequent amendments of the Revenue and Taxation Code
which relate to the sales and use tax and which are not inconsistent with Part
1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code shall automatically become a
part of this section.
   (Ord. #14, §§9, 10, 13)
   3-1.4   Contract with State. 1
   The Town shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all
functions incident to the administration and operation of this sales and use
tax ordinance. (Ord. #14, §5)
1   Editor’s Note: A copy of the contract between the Town and the State is on
file in the City Clerk’s Office.
   3-1.5   Tax Imposed.
   a.   Sales Tax. For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at
retail a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the Town at the rate
stated in subsection

personal property sold at retail in this Town.
   b.   Use Tax. An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other
consumption in this Town of tangible personal property purchased from any
retailer for storage, use or other consumption in this Town at the rate stated
in subsection
3-1.6 of the sales price of the property. The sales price shall include
delivery charges when such charges are subject to State sales and use tax
regardless of the place to which delivery is made.
   (Ord. #14, §§6, 8)
   3-1.6   Tax Rate.
   The rate of sales tax and use tax imposed by this section shall be ninety-
seven and one-half of one (.975%) percent. (Ord. #14, §2)
   3-1.7   Place of Sale.
   For the purposes of this section, all retail sales are consummated at the
place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is
delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a
common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts
from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject
to the State sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is
made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the State
or has more than one (1) place of business, the place or places at which the
retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to
be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization. (Ord. #14, §7)
   3-1.8   Permit Not Required.
   If a seller’s permit has been issued to a retailer under Section 6067 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code, an additional seller’s permit shall not be required
by this section. (Ord. #14, §11)
   3-1.9   Exclusions and Exemptions.

3-2   UNIFORM TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX.
   3-2.1   Title.
   This section shall be known as the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance
of the Town of Danville. (Ord, #5, §1; Ord. #12, §5)
   3-2.2   Definitions.
   As used in this section:
   Hotel shall mean any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is
occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling,
lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or
house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house,
apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house
trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.
   Occupancy shall mean the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling,
lodging or sleeping purposes.
   Operator shall mean the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in
the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or
any other capacity. Where the “operator” performs his functions through a
managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing
agent shall also be deemed an “operator” for the purposes of this section and
shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with
the provisions of this section by either the principal or the managing agent
shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   Person shall mean any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or
any other group or combination acting as a unit.
   Rent shall mean the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the
occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money,
goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property
and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.
   Tax Administrator shall mean the City Clerk or such other official as may be
appointed by the Town Council.
   Transient shall mean any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to
occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other
agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less,
counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying
space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a “transient” until the period of thirty
(30) days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the
operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In
determining whether a person is a “transient”, uninterrupted periods of time
extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this section may
be considered.
(Ord. #5, §2; Ord. #12, §5)
   3-2.3   Tax Imposed.
   Pursuant to the authority of Section 7280 and 7281 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, for the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is
subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of six and one-half (6 1/2%)
percent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by
the transient to the Town which is extinguished only by payment to the operator
or to the Town. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at
the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate
share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be
due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any
reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax
Administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to Tax
Administrator. (Ord. #5, §3; Ord. #12, §5)
   3-2.4   Exemptions.
   No tax shall be imposed upon:
   a.   Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the
power of the Town to impose the tax herein provided;
   b.   Any Federal or State of California officer or employee when on official
business;
   c.   Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason
of express provision of Federal law or international treaty.
   No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time
rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator.
(Ord. #5, §4; Ord. #12, §5)
   3-2.5   Operator’s Duties.
   Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this section to the same
extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The
amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged,
and each transient shall receive a receipt from the operator. No operator of a
hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly,
that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator,
or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be
refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. (Ord. #5, §5; Ord. #12, §5)
   3-2.6   Registration.
   Each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register
the hotel with the Tax Administrator and obtain from him a “transient occupancy
registration certificate” to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on
the premises. The certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
   a.   The name of the operator;
   b.   The address of the hotel;
   c.   The date upon which the certificate was issued;
   d.   This transient occupancy registration certificate signifies that the
person named on the face has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform
Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for
the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and
remitting the tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize
any person to conduct any unlawful business or to any lawful business in an
unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all
local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit
from any board, commission, department or office of this Town. This certificate
does not constitute a permit.
   (Ord. #5, §6; Ord. #12, §5)
   3-2.7   Reporting and Remitting.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period
which may be established by the Tax Administrator, make a return to the Tax
Administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and
received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time
the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to
the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator may establish shorter reporting
periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure
collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return.
Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any
reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this section shall be held
in trust for the account of the Town until payment thereof is made to the Tax
Administrator. (Ord. #5, §7; Ord. #12, §5)
   3-2.8   Failure to Collect and Report Tax, Determination of Tax by Tax
Administrator.
   a.   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax and to make,
within the time provided in this section, any report and remittance of the tax
or any portion thereof required by this section, the Tax Administrator shall
proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on
which to base his estimate of the tax due.
   b.   As soon as the Tax Administrator shall procure such facts and
information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any
tax imposed by this section and payable by any operator who has failed or
refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall
proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and
penalties provided for by this section. In case such determination is made, the
Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it
personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such
operator may within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice
make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the
amount assessed.
   c.   If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the
time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax
Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and
payable. If such application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give not less
than five (5) days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the
operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount
specified therein should not be fixed for such tax interest and penalties. At
such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified
tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax
Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall give
written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such
determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties.
   d.   The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15)
days unless an appeal is taken as provided in subsection
3-2.10.
(Ord. #5, §9; Ord. #12, §5)
   3-2.9   Penalties and Interest.
   a.   Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this section within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten (10%)
percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.
   b.   Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on
which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency
penalty of ten (10%) percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount
of the tax and the ten (10%) percent penalty first imposed.
   c.   Fraud. If the Tax Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this section is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five
(25%) percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to
the penalties stated in paragraphs a. and b. of this subsection.
   d.   Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails
to remit any tax imposed by this section shall pay interest at the rate of one-
half of one (.5%) percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the
tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became

   The amount of any license fee, penalty and interest imposed by the
provisions of this section shall be deemed a debt to the Town; and any person

the Town which issues permits for work to be done and/or engages in any
applicable business activity shall require the production of a valid unexpired
license prior to the issuance of such a permit or initiation of work.
   The Collector, in the exercise of the duties imposed upon him/her under this
section, and acting through deputies or duly authorized assistants, may examine
or cause to be examined from time to time all places of business in the Town to
ascertain whether such businesses have complied with the provisions of this
section. Absent consent to enter the premises, the Collector shall request the
City Attorney to obtain the necessary judicial authority for entry and
inspection.
   The Collector, each and all of his/her assistants and any police officer
shall have the power and authority to enter, free of charge and at any
reasonable time, any place of business required to be licensed in this section
and demand an exhibition of its license certificate. Any person, having such
license certificate heretofore issued in his/her possession or under his/her
control, who willfully fails to exhibit the same on demand, shall be guilty of
an infraction. It shall be the duty of the Collector and each of his/her
assistants to cause a complaint to be filed against any and all persons found
to be violating any of said provisions. (Ord. #93-3, §1)
   3-6.18   Remedies Cumulative.
   The conviction and punishment of any person for transacting any business
without obtaining a license shall not excuse or exempt such person from the
payment of any license tax due or unpaid at the time of such conviction, and
nothing in this section shall prevent a criminal prosecution of any violation
of the provisions of this section. All remedies prescribed under this section
are cumulative and the use of one (1) or more remedies by the Town shall not
bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of
this section. (Ord. #93-3, §1)

   Violation of the provisions of this section shall be an infraction. (Ord.

the issuance or refusal to issue a license, or the amount of a license tax, may
appeal to the Town Manager by filing a written notice of appeal setting forth
in full the grounds of the appeal, with the City Clerk of the Town.
   b.   The Town Manager is authorized to issue such regulations as may be
reasonable and necessary to hear and determine such appeals. Such regulations
shall be in writing, approved by the Town Council and available to any person
so requesting them.
   c.   The amount of any license tax finally determined, as provided in this
section, or any other section of this section, shall be due and payable as of
the date the original license fee was due and payable, together with any
penalties and interest that may be due thereon; provided, however, if the
amount of such license tax is fixed in accordance with the original statement
of the applicant, then no penalty or interest shall attach by reason of any
delinquency. (Ord. #93-3, §1)
   3-6.21   Examination of Books, Records, Witnesses—Information
Confidential—Penalty.
   The Collector, or any authorized employee of the collector is authorized to
examine the payroll records of any person subject to this section for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any application or, if no application was
made, to ascertain the license fees due under this section. For persons
claiming exemption based on less than ten thousand ($10,000) dollars annual
gross receipts, Collector or authorized employee is authorized to examine any
appropriate books, papers or records associated with gross receipts. Every
licensee or business operating in the Town of Danville is directed and required
to furnish to the Collector, or his/her duly authorized agent or employee, the
means, facilities and opportunity for making such examination and
investigations as are authorized by this section. The Collector is authorized
to examine any person, under oath, for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any application made, or, if no application was made, to ascertain the license
fees due under this section, and for this purpose may compel the production of
payroll records or, if appropriate, books, papers and records applicable to
gross receipts and the attendance of all persons before him/her, whether as
parties or witnesses, whenever he/she believes such persons have knowledge of
such matters. The refusal of such examination by any employer or person subject
or presumed to be subject to the license fees shall be deemed a violation of
this section.
   It shall be unlawful for the Collector or any person having an
administrative duty under the provisions of this section to be known in any
manner the business affairs, operation, or information obtained by an
investigation of records of any business subject to this section provided
however that nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any
disclosure required by law or the disclosure, of general statistics regarding
Business License Fees collected or business done in the Town of Danville. (Ord.
#93-3, §1)
   3-6.22   Refund of Fee-Penalty or Interest Paid More Than Once or
Erroneously or Illegally Collected.
   Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty or interest has been paid more than
once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Town
under this section, it may be refunded provided a verified claim in writing,
stating the specific grounds upon which said claim is founded, is filed with
the Collector within three years from the date of payment. The claim shall be
audited by the Collector and shall be made in accordance with current Town
refund procedures. If the claim is approved, the refund may be refunded or may
be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the person from whom it
was collected or by whom paid, and the balance may be refunded to such person
or to his/her administrators or executors. (Ord. #93-3, §1)

   The Town shall award contracts for professional services on the basis of
demonstrated competence and professional qualifications necessary to accomplish

forth in this subsection. All purchases of vehicles may be made through
informal bids. In addition, if the Town Council has appropriated funds for the
purchase of the specific vehicle(s) through the Town’s annual financial plan
and the purchase price is within the appropriated amount, the Town Manager
shall be the awarding authority. If funds were not previously appropriated for
the specific vehicle(s) or the price exceeds the appropriated amount, the Town

nature of the supplies;

   In awarding contracts pursuant to subsection
3-8.6, if, after reviewing the specified criteria all factors are relatively
equal between a local and nonlocal business, it shall be the policy of the Town
to award the contract to the local business. (Ord. #99-01, §2)
   3-8.13   Protest Procedure.
   After the award of any contract, any unsuccessful bidder may challenge the
bid procedure by filing a written protest with the awarding authority. The

ten (10) days of the award of the contract. The awarding authority shall review
the protest and provide a written reply in an expeditious manner. The decision
of the awarding authority with respect to the protest shall be final. Failure
to file a timely protest shall be deemed a waiver of any challenge to the
procedure or award of contract. (Ord. #99-01, §2)
   3-8.14   Cooperative Purchasing Agreements With Other Agencies. |
   Notwithstanding any provision of this Section
3-8, the Town may participate in any voluntary cooperative purchasing agreement
or program with the State, County, other cities or public agencies if it would
be advantageous to the Town. The bidding and contract procedures to be used in
such cases shall be those specifically required in the voluntary cooperative
purchasing agreement between the participating agencies. (Ord. #99-01, §2)

orders exceeding the amount appropriated by the Town Council shall be approved
by the Town Council through an additional appropriation. (Ord. #99-01, §2)

designed to be recycled. (Ord. #99-01, §2)

period shall constitute a waiver of any hearing and the nuisance shall be
abated without further notice to the landowner or vehicle owner. (Ord. #2002-

attempt to collect such costs from such landowner.
(Ord. #2002-09, §2)
   4-7.10   Appeals.

revocation of the license seven (7) days after service of the notice upon the
licensee, unless the licensee arranges to appear at a hearing before the Chief
of Police and show cause why such action should not be taken.
   5-1.10   Summary Suspension or Revocation.
   a.   The Danville Police Department may immediately suspend or revoke a
bingo license upon the licensee’s refusal to:
      1.   Permit the entry of any peace officer to investigate the conduct of
a bingo game; or
      2.   Permit the Danville Police Department to review or audit the
charitable organization’s records relating to the conduct of bingo games under
the license and to the special account required by Penal Code Section 326.5(j).
   b.   Upon taking such action, the Danville Police Department shall within
forty-eight (48) hours serve on the licensee a written statement of the reasons
for this action, and schedule a show-cause hearing on reinstatement of the
license within five (5) days of a request to do so by the licensee.
   5-1.11   Decision.
   The Danville Police Department shall issue a written decision within seven
(7) days after the conclusion of a show-cause hearing.
   5-1.12   Appeal.
   Appeals from action taken hereunder shall be governed by Section

   5-1.13   License Not Transferable.
   Each license shall be issued to a specific charitable organization
authorizing not more than twenty (20) named members to conduct a bingo game on
its behalf at one (1) or more named locations. This license is not transferable
from one (1) organization to another, from one (1) member to another, or from
one (1) location to another. The license is only a temporary and
nontransferable permit to act within the provisions of this section and all
other applicable laws and regulations, and always expires no later than one (1)
year from its date. It has no validity when it has been seized, suspended, or
revoked by the Danville Police Department. Any attempt to transfer, assign,
pledge, mortgage or hypothecate the license, or to attach or execute on it,
immediately and permanently voids it.
   5-1.14   License Displayed.
   The license shall be prominently displayed at the authorized location(s)
during the game(s).
   5-1.15   Hours.
   No bingo games shall be conducted between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 9:00
a.m.
   5-1.16   Consent.
   The application for or acceptance of a license constitutes:
   a.   Consent to the entry of any peace officer(s) to investigate the
location(s) identified in the application, before the issuance of a license as
well as during any game(s) thereafter;
   b.   Consent to the Danville Police Department reviewing or auditing the
charitable organization’s record relating to the conduct of bingo games and to
the special account required by Penal Code §326.5(j), for the purpose of
verifying compliance with the financial interest and special fund requirements
of Penal Code §326.5 and with this section and all other applicable laws and
regulations.

1   Editor’s Note: This section was adopted by Ord. No. 15, §1[4].
Part 1
General
   5-2.1   Definition.
   As used in this section:
   Cardroom shall mean any room, enclosure or space with a table used or
available for use by any member(s) of the public for playing cards or similar
games.
   5-2.2   Valid License/Permit.
   As used in this section:
   Valid license, valid cardroom license, valid permit, and valid work permit
shall mean cardroom licenses and cardroom work permits regulated by this
section which are currently and wholly valid, unexpired, unrevoked and
unsuspended, and which have had all applications, and disclosures fully and
truthfully made and kept up to date and all fees paid, and the licensees and
permittees of which are not violating any provisions of this section.
   5-2.3   Prohibited Types of Gambling.
   Except for draw poker, lowball, panguingue, and not more than two (2) other
games if specified by Town Council resolution, played in a cardroom licensed
under this section and otherwise complying with this section, no person shall
deal, play, carry on, open or cause to be opened, conduct or bet at or against
any lottery or game not prohibited by State law, with cards, dice, or any
device, for money, checks, credit, or other representative of value.
   5-2.4   No Violation of Statute.
   This section does not allow the licensing of any cardroom for the playing of
any game prohibited by California statute, and any such play violates any
license or permit issued hereunder.
   5-2.5   Violations.
   a.   Licensee. No person shall, for himself or any other person, own, lease,
operate, or maintain a cardroom unless he has a valid license therefor.
   b.   Worker. No person who has or should have a cardroom license shall allow
any other person to commit acts contrary to paragraph c. or d. of subsection
5-2.23.
   c.   Work Permits. No person without a valid cardroom work permit shall act
as a cardroom employee.
   5-2.6   No Vested Right.
   Even a valid cardroom license or work permit creates no vested property or
personal right for the licensee or permittee, and is entirely subject to this
section and to ordinances affecting the license or permit from time to time,
including new restrictions, conditions, fees, and duration of license or permit
validity. Any change required by this section to be noted on the license,
permit, or application, or noted in required supplementary information,
constitutes a termination of the license or permit except for the purposes of
subsection
5-2.32 and of paying fees.
   5-2.7   Nonprofit Groups Exempt.
   The Town Council may partly or wholly exempt any nonprofit society, club,
fraternal, labor or other nonprofit organization that has members, bylaws, and
duly elected directors and that applies for exemption from compliance with this
section, if the Council finds that the cardroom is for the exclusive use of the
members and that no charge is made therefor.
   5-2.8   Number of Cardroom Licenses.
   The number of cardroom licenses shall not exceed the number by which the
population of the incorporated area of the Town (as determined by the Town
Council) is divisible by twenty thousand (20,000); but no valid license shall
be invalidated by a decrease in that ratio.
Part 2
Cardroom Licenses
   5-2.9   Licensee Defined.
   A cardroom license shall be issued to one (1) or more individual human
beings only, not corporations or fictitious business names for instance; and in
this context “applicant” and “licensee” mean such human beings.
   5-2.10   Application.
   Every applicant for a new or renewed license shall sign and verify the
written application to the Danville Police Department. Any application, not yet
finally acted on by the first anniversary of its filing with the Danville
Police Department expires.
   5-2.11   Contents.
   The application shall contain the following information on the applicant(s)
and all persons financially interested in the business, including those who

   The application shall be accompanied by an application fee of five hundred
($500.00) dollars.

application and report thereon to the Town Council, including a recommendation
for approval or disapproval of the application, with reasons.
   b.   Fee Uses. The Police Department may use as much of the application fee
as required to perform their duties hereunder, accounting therefor in the
report. If the Town Council disapproves the application, the application fee,

the applicant.
   5-2.14   Notice of Hearing.
   a.   Set Hearing. The Police Department shall arrange for a hearing on the
application before the Town Council.

persons to protest the issuance of the license.
   c.   Posting. For ten (10) days before the hearing, the Danville Police
Department shall have a copy of this notice posted conspicuously in front of
the proposed premises, and two (2) additional copies posted conspicuously
within five hundred (500’) feet of the premises.
   5-2.15   Hearing.
   a.   General. At the hearing the Council shall consider the Police
Department’s report and any other evidence presented concerning the proposed
license.
   b.   Applicant’s Burden. The applicant has the burden of overcoming any
adverse recommendations in the Police Department’s report and of presenting all
evidence needed to sustain the Council’s findings in approving the license.
   5-2.16   Findings.
   The Town Council may approve the application, and order the Police
Department to grant the license, only if it finds these facts to be true:
   a.   That the applicant and all persons financially interested in the
cardroom are of good moral character and that none has been convicted of a
felony, or of a misdemeanor involving theft or fraud or other dishonesty;
   b.   That the premises are not near a school or playground, or recreational
facility frequented by minors, and that the cardroom will not be detrimental to
the welfare of minors;
   c.   That the design or location of the proposed cardroom will not hinder
law enforcement officials in surveillance of cardroom activities, or in
enforcement of this section or of State laws regulating gambling;
   d.   That the proposed cardroom will conform with the character of other
land uses in the vicinity and will not be detrimental to the health, safety,
and general welfare of, or create a nuisance or law enforcement problems
within, the neighborhood or community; and
   e.   That all requirements of this section have been satisfied.
   5-2.17   Conditions.
   The Town Council may require that the license be conditioned, as necessary
to effectuate this section, including conditions as to:
   a.   Location, design, and lighting of cardroom, and number of tables;
   b.   Hours of operation;
   c.   Parking location, design and conditions; and
   d.   Related business on the premises.
   5-2.18   License.
   a.   Fee. If the Town Council approves the application and orders the Police
Department to issue the license, the applicant shall pay to the Department an
annual, nonrefundable, license fee of five hundred ($500.00) dollars per table.
The Police Department and applicant may prorate this table fee to cover the
remaining period of the cardroom license.
   b.   Certificate. The Police Department shall then issue the applicant a
certificate of the license, suitable for display. The applicant shall
conspicuously display this in the cardroom at all times.
   c.   Duration. The license is effective until revoked or suspended or until
the licensee fails to have it renewed.
   d.   Disuse Voids. A license becomes void upon a three hundred (300) day
absence or suspension of operations allowed by it, regardless of the reason
therefor; except that the Town Council may, during the three hundred (300) days
or extension(s), extend the time by increments of not more than one hundred
(100) more days for good cause shown.
   5-2.19   Renewal.
   a.   The Police Department shall notify each licensee at least seventy (70)
days before the license expiration date.
   b.   Nevertheless, a licensee desiring to have his license renewed, shall
apply therefor sufficiently (at least sixty (60) days) in advance of its
expiration date (anniversary of issuance) to allow its processing as a new
application before the expiration of the license sought to be renewed. A
renewal application shall otherwise be handled with the same processing, fees,
approval, or disapproval, etc., as if it were a wholly new application.
   c.   Form and Procedure.
      1.   The Police Department shall provide a form of verified application
or designate such information as they require, which can be in the form of a
verified statement that there has been no change (or only specified changes) in
the latest information in the Police Department’s file.
      2.   The renewal application shall be processed as an original
application, but the Police Department may omit or simplify procedures they
deem unnecessary in each case, such as posting notices in the neighborhood. The
Police Department shall recommend renewal or nonrenewal to the Council, and
shall schedule a hearing thereon before the Council only if important evidence
needs to be presented thereat; and the Council shall order the renewal or
nonrenewal.
      3.   Renewal is considered normal in the absence of complaints about
deviations from the provisions of this section involving the cardroom,
licensee, or anyone associated with its business or operation. If the Council
approves the renewal, the Police Department shall note on the license
certificate that it is a renewal. A renewed license is otherwise subject to all
the provisions of this section concerning cardroom licenses, and may itself be
renewed.
   5-2.20   Transfer.
   a.   General. The Town Council may allow a cardroom license that has been
continuously valid since January 1, 1976, to be transferred to another
licensee. This transferability is entirely subject to the Police Department’s
prior approval (as to all the requirements of this section) of the transferee
as though he were a new applicant; it does not create any right in any license
(as either a prospective transferor or prospective transferee) which can be
reached by or transferred or assigned to a creditor, spouse, heir, or
otherwise, but is at most a mere contingent expectancy wholly dependent on
prior official approval and on compliance with all the requirements of this
section (including future amendments).
   b.   Procedure. An application for transfer shall follow the procedure for
other license applications, including the application fee, investigation,
report, notice, hearing, findings and conditions.
   c.   New License; Fee. If the transfer is approved, the new license is for
the remainder of the one (1) year life of the former license, and no license
fee is due but a transfer fee of one thousand ($1,000.00) dollars is payable
before the new license issues.
   d.   Transfer Defined. “Transfer” shall mean any change required by this
section in the information on the application or license or in any other
disclosure, concerning the identity of any licensee (except name changes caused
by marriage or dissolution) or the location, ownership or character of the
premises. It includes the addition of one (1) or more names to the license,
whether or not already named licensee(s) remains(s).
Part 3

   5-2.21   Restrictions; General.
   The restrictions in this part apply to all present and future cardrooms and

   5-2.27   Application.
   a.   An applicant for a cardroom work permit must be an individual human
being who shall submit his verified written application to the Police

processing the application if it is denied.
   5-2.28   Action.

Part 5
Suspension, Revocation, Change and Variance
   5-2.30   Cardroom License.
   a.   Notice. The Town Council may suspend or revoke a cardroom license at
any time, after giving the licensee(s) reasonable notice of opportunity to be
heard in defense against noticed charges.
   b.   Cause. Any violation of requirements in, or pursuant to, this section
is cause for suspension or revocation.
   c.   Effect. Neither suspension nor revocation affects any fee already due
or paid, nor does it extend the life of any license. A revoked license is
voided, and cannot be transferred, reinstated, renewed or reissued; but a
suspended license may be reinstated as a valid license upon such conditions as
the Town Council may impose, in its discretion under this section, including
penalty fees not exceeding ordinary fees for a new license. Such Council
actions are additional to, and not a limitation on, other civil and criminal
proceedings under this Code or State law.
   5-2.31   Work Permits.
   Any cardroom work permit may be suspended or revoked, like a cardroom
license under subsection
5-2.30, except that the action is by the Police Department and the cause must
be a violation related to that work permit.
   5-2.32   Change, Notice, and Variance.
   a.   Change in Conditions. Every licensee and permittee shall promptly
notify the Police Department in writing of any actual or proposed change in the
conditions or restrictions applicable to his license or permit, including any
change in or deviation from the requirements in or pursuant to this section
when the license or permit was issued or since then.
   b.   Variance Allowable. Upon such notice and payment of a fee which the
Police Department estimates to be required to pay for processing the matter
(not exceeding the fee on a new application), the Police Department and/or Town
Council shall process this as though it were an application for a new license
or permit, and shall similarly respectively investigate, report, recommend,
hear, and deny, modify, condition or approve it.
   c.   Enforcement Postponed. During the pendency of such an application,
promptly made and diligently pursued, failures to comply with legal
requirements or prohibitions (as to matters which are within the Police
Department’s or Town Council’s discretion to impose or to grant variances from)
shall not be deemed violations of this Code; but this does not extend the life
of any license or permit or affect preapplication violations.
5-3   ALARM SYSTEMS.
   5-3.1   Purpose and Authority. 
   The purpose of this section is to encourage alarm users and alarm businesses
to maintain the operational reliability and proper use of alarm systems and to
reduce or eliminate false alarm dispatch requests. False alarm dispatches pose
a safety hazard to police officers and the general public and divert police
officers from other useful duties. This section governs systems intended to
summon a police response. It requires permits, establishes fees, provides for
penalties for violations, establishes a system of administration, and sets
conditions for suspension or loss of permits.
   This section is adopted pursuant to the authority provided in California
Business and Professions Code Section 7592.8.
(Ord. #2011-05, § 2)
   5-3.2   Definitions.   
   As used in this section:
   Alarm administrator means a person or persons designated by the Chief of
Police to administer, control and review alarm applications, permits and alarm
dispatch requests.
   Alarm business means any business operated by an individual or business
entity, which engages in selling, leasing, servicing, repairing altering,
replacing, moving, installing or monitoring an alarm system in an alarm site.
   Alarm dispatch request means a notification to the police by the alarm
business that an alarm, either manual or automatic has been activated at a
particular alarm site.
   Alarm site means a single premise or location served by an alarm system.
Each tenancy, if served by a separate alarm system in a multi-tenant building
shall be considered a separate alarm site.
   Alarm system means any assembly of equipment and devices designed to signal
the presence of a potential hazard relayed by an alarm answering service to any
other audible or silent alarm device to which the police are expected to
respond. Fire and medical alarm systems and alarm systems, which monitor
temperature, humidity or any other condition not directly related to the
detection of an unauthorized intrusion into a premise or an attempted burglary,
or robbery at a premise are specifically excluded from regulation under this
section.
   Alarm user means any person, firm, partnership, corporation or other entity,
public or private, that uses an alarm system at its alarm site.
   Chief means the Chief of Police of Danville.
   Duress alarm means a silent alarm signal generated by the manual activations
of a device intended to signal a crises situation requiring police response.
   False alarm means an alarm dispatch request to the Police Department when
the responding officer finds no evidence of a criminal offense or attempted
criminal offense. An alarm dispatch request that is canceled by the alarm
business or the alarm user prior to the time the responding officer reaches the
alarm site shall not be considered a false alarm dispatch.
   Holdup alarm means a silent alarm signal generated by the manual activation
of a device intended to signal a robbery in progress.
   Intrusion alarm means an alarm system signaling an entry or attempted entry
into the area protected by the system.
   Monitoring means the process by which an alarm business receives signals
from alarm systems and relays an alarm dispatch request to the Town for the
purpose of summoning police response to the alarm site.
(Ord.#2011-05, § 2)
   5-3.3   Permit Required.
   a.   No alarm user shall operate, or cause to be operated, an alarm system
at its alarm site without a valid alarm permit issued by the alarm
administrator. A separate permit is required for each alarm site. The initial
permit application must be submitted to the alarm administrator within fifteen
(15) days after the alarm installation.
   b.   Upon receipt of a completed application form, the alarm administrator
shall issue an alarm permit to an applicant unless the applicant has failed to
pay any applicable fees or fines assessed.
   c.   Each permit application must include the name, address, and telephone
numbers of the person who will be the permit holder and be responsible for the
proper maintenance and operation of the alarm system and the name, address and
telephone number of the alarm business monitoring the alarm system. The Chief
may require such other information as necessary to accomplish the purposes of
this section. All information furnished with an application shall be
confidential.
   d.   An alarm permit cannot be transferred to another person. An alarm user
shall inform the alarm administrator of any change that alters any information
listed on the permit application within five (5) business days.
   e.   The Town Council may establish an application fee for alarm permits as
permitted by law as part of the Town's master fee schedule.
   f.   A permit shall expire one (1) year from the date of issuance, and must
be renewed annually by submitting an updated application and if applicable a
permit renewal fee to the alarm administrator. The alarm administrator shall
notify each alarm user of the need to renew thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of their permit. It is the responsibility of the alarm user to
submit an application prior to the permit expiration date. Failure to renew
will be classified as use of a non-permitted alarm system and citations and
penalties may be assessed.
(Ord. #2011-05, § 2)
   5-3.4   Alarm System Maintenance and Operation.
   a.   Each alarm user shall:
      1.   Maintain the premises and the alarm system in a manner that will
minimize or eliminate false alarm dispatches.
      2.   Make every reasonable effort to respond or cause a representative to
respond to the alarm system's location within one (1) hour when notified by the
Town to provide access to the premises.
      3.   Not manually activate an alarm for any reason other than an
occurrence of an event the alarm system was intended to report.
   b.   Each alarm user shall adjust the mechanism or cause the mechanism to be
adjusted so that an alarm signal audible on the exterior of an alarm site will
sound for no longer than twenty (20) minutes after being activated.
   c.   Each alarm user shall post a notice containing the name and telephone
number of the alarm business to be notified to render repairs, services, or
turn off the alarm when the alarm is activated. Such notice shall be posted
near the alarm in such a position as to be legible from the ground adjacent to
the building.
(Ord. #2011-05, § 2)
   5-3.5   Monitoring Procedures. An alarm business performing monitoring
services shall:
   a.   Not request dispatch for police response during the first week after
installation of an alarm system, but rather use that week to train the alarm
user on proper use of the alarm system.
   b.   Attempt to verify every alarm signal, except duress or hold up alarm
activation before requesting a police response to an alarm signal.
   c.   Communicate verified cancellations of alarm dispatch requests to the
Town in a manner and form determined by the alarm administrator.
   d.   Ensure that all alarm users of alarm systems equipped with duress
alarms are given adequate training as to the proper use of the duress alarm.
   e.   Utilize the procedure the alarm administrator shall develop to accept
verified cancellation of alarm dispatch requests.
(Ord. #2011-05, § 2)
   5-3.6   System Performance Reviews.  
   If there is reason to believe that an alarm system is not being used or
maintained in a manner that ensures proper operation and suppresses false
alarms, the alarm administrator may require a conference with an alarm user and
the alarm business responsible for the repair of the alarm system to review the
circumstances of each false alarm. Such a conference will be mandatory after
three (3) false alarm dispatches in a one (1)-year period.
(Ord. #2011-05, § 2)
   5-3.7   Penalty.
   a.   An alarm user shall be subject to warnings and fines depending on the
number of false alarm dispatches emitted from an alarm system within a calendar

within seven (7) calendar days after the notice is mailed, the Town's Police
Department will no longer respond to the alarm system.
   b.   Within seven (7) calendar days of the date of a non-response notice is

written request. The request shall set forth the reason(s) why the alarm should
not be placed on non-response status.

   5-6.4   License.
   a.   Form and Requirements.
      1.   Nature. The license is only a temporary, personal and
nontransferable permit to act within the provisions of this section and all
other applicable laws and regulations, and always expires no later than one (1)
year from its date. It has no validity when it has been seized, suspended or
revoked by the Police Department. Any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge,
mortgage or hypothecate the license, or to attach or execute on it, immediately
and permanently voids it.
      2.   Form. The Police Department shall design the form of license, which
shall contain the applicant-licensee’s photograph and a disclaimer of
responsibility on the part of the Town and its officials.
      3.   License Information. The licensee shall promptly inform the Police
Department of any changes in the information on the application, and the Police
Department may require that this include the names and addresses of any
employees or associates in the licensed activity.
   b.   Renewals. A license may be renewed by the Police Department but only as
a new license, upon payment of the renewal fee, with only as much of the
application renewed or repeated as the Police Department requires and as much
of the hearing process before the Town Council as they recommend or the Council
requires.
   c.   Bond. No license shall be issued, and none is valid, unless and while
the applicant-licensee has on file with the Police Department a currently valid
bond approved by the Police Department, or a cash deposit in the sum of five
thousand ($5,000.00) dollars, payable to the people of the State, or as ordered
by a court for the benefit of anyone injured contrary to its conditions, and
conditioned that the applicant-licensee will conduct all his licensed
activities in a quiet, decent, fair and honest manner and in complete
conformity with the laws and regulations of this State and County.
   d.   Seizure, Suspension, Revocation.
      1.   Whenever the Danville Police Department makes a written finding that
there exists or has occurred any violation of this section, or of any
applicable law or regulation, attributable to the licensee or activities
relating to the license, which immediately and seriously endangers the public
welfare, they may summarily seize the license, or declare it seized, if they
cannot practicably seize it. They shall so notify the licensee in waiting as
soon as practicable, and also orally if practicable. Upon demand by the
licensee, the Police Department shall grant a hearing on this subject within
forty-eight (48) hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and other holidays), and
shall then promptly make their written finding and decision whether to
reinstate, suspend or revoke the license.
      2.   Suspension. After a seizure hearing, or upon the Police Department’s
written finding that a similar condition exists but where the serious danger is
not immediate although impending, they may suspend the license for not over
thirty (30) days and seize it or declare it seized. They shall give notice and
proceed as for seizures (unless suspension follows a seizure hearing), except
that the hearing may be within five (5) business days.
      3.   Revocation. After a seizure or suspension hearing, or upon at least
ten (10) days’ written notice to the licensee, the Police Department may
conduct a hearing on revoking the license, which the Department may do on their
written finding that a condition described in paragraph d, 1. of this
subsection is a serious danger to the public welfare and is so serious,
dangerous, flagrant, willful, long-continued, repeated and/or uncorrectable
that revocation is an appropriate remedy. Such cause may include apparent
absconding by the licensee or his apparent abandonment of the activity, as well
as violations of this section.
      4.   Notice. If the Police Department is unable to seize the license, as
provided for here, they shall, and after seizure, suspension or revocation they
may, post notice of their action on the premises. No person shall remove such
notice without authorization during the reasonable period of posting stated
therein.
   e.   Reinstatement. After the period of a seizure or suspension, the Police
Department shall revalidate and return the license for any period remaining of
its original term, if the licensee pays the reinstatement fee.
   5-6.5   Fees.
   a.   General. All fees are nonrefundable and nonproratable, and shall be
paid to the Tax Collector. If any fee is not lawfully and timely paid, the
application or license is void.

pay an application fee of one hundred ($100.00) dollars.

picking up, removing, and disposing of all trash or refuse from their
operation.
   k.   Sidewalk vendors shall immediately clean up any food, grease or other
fluid or item related to sidewalk vending activities that is discharged on

year of the first violation; or

      4.   The Director may rescind a sidewalk vendor permit for the remaining

infraction or misdemeanor. Additional fines, fees, assessments, or any other
financial conditions beyond those authorized will not be assessed.
   d.   An administrative violation constitutes a separate and distinct
violation for each day that it exists and each such violation may be subject to
the maximum fine permitted under this chapter.

or (b), the Town shall accept, in full satisfaction, twenty percent (20%) of
the otherwise applicable fine.

(Ord. #15, §1[4])
7-2   SMOKING.
   7-2.1   Purpose and Findings.
   a.   Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contribution
to indoor air pollution; and
   b.   Reliable studies have shown that breathing sidestream or secondhand
smoke is a significant health hazard for certain population groups, including
elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with
impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive
airway disease; and
   c.   Health hazards induced by breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke
include lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased exercise tolerance,
decreased respiratory function, bronchoconstriction, and bronchospasm; and
   d.   Nonsmokers with allergies, respiratory diseases and those who suffer
other ill effects of breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke may experience a
loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick leave because
of adverse reactions to smoke; and
   e.   The smoking of tobacco, or any other weed or plant, is a danger to
health. Accordingly, it is determined that the health, safety and general
welfare of the residents of, persons employed in, and persons who frequent this
Town would be benefited by the regulation of smoking in enclosed places,
including places o£ employment.
   f.   The United States Environmental Protection Agency has determined that
second-hand smoke is a Class A carcinogen for which there is no safe exposure
level.
   g.   The United States Surgeon General has declared that nicotine is as
addictive as cocaine or heroin; no other addictive product or drug is sold
through vending machines.
   h.   Electronic smoking devices, commonly known as “electronic cigarettes,”
“e- cigarettes,” etc., are battery operated devices which deliver nicotine,
flavor and/or other substances through a vapor inhaled by the user. The
secondhand aerosol emitted from such devices has been found to be a potential
health hazard, containing at least ten chemicals known to the State of
California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm. The State
of California’s Tobacco Education and Research Oversight Committee (TEROC)
“opposes the use of e-cigarettes in all areas where other tobacco products are
banned.”
   i.   Secondhand marijuana smoke has been identified as a potential health
hazard, as evidenced by the California EPA including marijuana smoke on the
Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to cause cancer.
   j.   Numerous studies have found that nonsmokers living in multiple family
buildings can be exposed to secondhand smoke from neighbors who smoke. The
Surgeon General has concluded that eliminating smoking in indoor spaces is the
only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke exposure and that
separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings
cannot completely prevent secondhand smoke exposure. The American Society of
Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that
multi-unit housing be free from environmental tobacco smoke, marijuana smoke,
and electronic smoking devices’ aerosol.

has met the diversion requirement established by this section. This
documentation shall include the following:
      1.   A copy of the previously approved project WMP with the addition of
recyclable and/or reusable C&D and refuse waste volume or weight data entered
in Section II of the form;
      2.   Receipts, tickets, or any other documentation from certified C&D
recovery facilities that documents disposal for each C&D debris material type
by weight or volume and clearly indicates whether each material was landfilled
or recycled; and
      3.   Any additional information that the applicant believes is relevant
to determining its efforts to comply in good faith with this section.
   b.   Weighing of wastes. Applicants shall make reasonable efforts to ensure
that all C&D debris diverted or landfilled is measured and recorded using the
most accurate method of measurement available. To the extent practical, all C&D
debris shall be weighed by measurement on scales. Such scales shall be in
compliance with all regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For
C&D debris for which weighing is not practical due to small size or to other
considerations as determined by the official, a volumetric measurement shall be
used. For conversion of volumetric measurements to weight, the applicant shall
use the standardized conversion rates approved by the Town for this purpose.
   c.   Determination of compliance. The WMP compliance official shall consider
the information submitted pursuant to subsections
10-10.6(c) and
10-10.8(a) in order to determine whether the applicant has complied with the
diversion requirement as follows;
      1.   Full compliance. If the WMP compliance official determines that the
applicant has fully complied with the diversion requirement of this section,
such compliance shall be indicated on the WMP.
      2.   Good faith effort to comply. If the diversion requirement has not
been achieved, the WMP compliance official shall determine on a case-by-case
basis whether the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with this
section. In making this determination, the WMP compliance official shall
consider the availability of markets for the C&D debris landfilled, the size of
the project and the documented efforts of the applicant to divert the C&D
debris. If the WMP compliance official determines that the applicant has made a
good faith effort to comply with this section, such determination shall be
indicated on the WMP.
   d.   Noncompliance. If the WMP compliance official determines that the
applicant has not fully complied nor made a good faith effort to comply with
the diversion requirement pursuant to subsection c. above, the Town shall
withhold final project approvalfor all permits associated with the WMP. Final
project approval may be granted once the applicant provides satisfactory proof
of compliance, good faith efforts or payment of the civil penalty provided for
below.
      In addition, to withholding project approval and other remedies provided
for in this Code, the Town may impose a civil penalty on the applicant equal to
one percent (1%) of the total cost of the project, up to a maximum of one
thousand dollars ($1,000). The Town may petition the appropriate court to
impose, assess, and recover these civil penalties.
(Ord. 2009-05, § 1; Ord. 2010-07, § 1)
   10-10.9   Infeasibility Exemption.
   a.   Application. An applicant for a covered project may apply for an
infeasibility exemption from the diversion requirement at the time that the WMP
is submitted as required under subsection
10-10.7. The request for exemption must set forth the unique circumstances
making compliance infeasible. The applicant shall indicate on the WMP the
minimum rate of diversion that is feasible for each material and the specific
circumstances that makes it infeasible to comply with the diversion
requirement. Increased costs to the applicant generally will not be sufficient
basis for an exemption unless such costs are extraordinary.
   b.   Meeting with the official. The WMP compliance official shall review the
information supplied by the applicant and may meet with the applicant to
discuss possible ways of meeting the diversion requirement. The WMP compliance
official may request staff from the CCCSWA to attend this meeting or may
require the applicant to request a separate meeting with CCCSWA staff. Based on
the information supplied by the applicant and, if applicable, CCCSWA staff, the
WMP compliance official shall determine whether it is feasible for the
applicant to meet the diversion requirement.
   c.   Granting of exemption. If the WMP compliance official determines that
it is infeasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement due to
unique circumstances, the WMP compliance official shall determine the minimum
feasible diversion rate for each material and shall indicate this rate on the
WMP submitted by the applicant. The WMP compliance official shall return a copy
of the WMP to the applicant marked "Approved for Infeasibility Exemption."
   d.   Denial of exemption. If the WMP compliance official determines that it
is feasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement, the official
shall so inform the applicant in writing and the applicant shall resubmit a WMP
form in compliance with Section
10-10.7.
(Ord. 2009-05, § 1)
   10-10.10   Appeals.

(Ord. 2017-6, § 2)
   10-17.4   Permit Application Processing.
   a.   Prior to submitting an application for processing, the applicant shall
verify that the installation of an electric vehicle charging station will not
have specific, adverse impact to public health and safety and building
occupants. Verification by the applicant includes, but is not limited to:
electrical system capacity and loads; electrical system wiring, bonding and
overcurrent protection; building infrastructure affected by charging station
equipment and associated conduits; areas of charging station equipment and
vehicle parking.
   b.   A permit application that satisfies the information requirements in the
Town's adopted checklist shall be deemed complete and be promptly processed.
Upon confirmation by the Building Official that the permit application and
supporting documents meets the requirements of the Town's adopted checklist,
and is consistent with all applicable laws and health and safety standards, the
Building Official shall, consistent with Government Code Section 65850.7,
approve the application and issue all necessary permits. Such approval does not
authorize an applicant to energize or utilize the electric vehicle charging
station until approval is granted by the Town. If the Building Official
determines that the permit application is incomplete, he or she shall issue a
written correction notice to the applicant, detailing all deficiencies in the
application and any additional information required to be eligible for
expedited permit issuance.
   c.   Consistent with Government Code Section 65850.7, the Building Official
shall allow for electronic submittal of permit applications covered by this
Ordinance and associated supporting documentations. In accepting such permit
applications, the Building Official shall also accept electronic signatures on
all forms, applications, and other documentation in lieu of a wet signature by
any applicant.
(Ord. 2017-6, § 2)
   10-17.5   Technical Review.
   a.   It is the intent of this section to encourage the installation of
electric vehicle charging stations by removing obstacles to permitting for
charging stations so long as the action does not supersede the Building
Official's authority to address higher priority life-safety situations. If the
Building Official makes a finding based on substantial evidence that the
electric vehicle charging station could have a specific adverse impact upon the
publics health or safety, as defined in this chapter, the Town may require the
applicant to apply for a use permit.
   b.   In the technical review of a charging station, consistent with
Government Code Section 65850.7, the Building Official shall not condition the
approval for any electric vehicle charging station permit on the approval of
such a system by an association, as that term is defined by Civil Code Section
4080.
(Ord. 2017-6, § 2)
   10-17.6   Electric Vehicle Charging Station Installation Requirements.
   a.   Electric vehicle charging station equipment shall meet the requirements
of the California Electrical Code, the Society of Automotive Engineers, the
National Electrical Manufacturers Association, and accredited testing
laboratories such as Underwriters Laboratories, and rules of the Public
Utilities Commission or a Municipal Electric Utility Company regarding safety
and reliability.
   b.   Installation of electric vehicle charging stations and associated
wiring, bonding, disconnecting means and overcurrent protective devices shall
meet the requirements of California Electrical Code Article 625 and all other
applicable provisions of the California Electrical Code.
   c.   Installation of electric vehicle charging stations shall be
incorporated into the load calculations of all new or existing electrical
services and shall meet the requirements of the California Electrical Code.
Electric vehicle charging equipment shall be considered a continuous load.
   d.   Anchorage of either floor-mounted or wall-mounted electric vehicle
charging stations shall meet the requirements of the California Building or
Residential Code, as applicable per occupancy, and the provisions of the
manufacturer's installation instructions. Mounting of charging stations shall
not adversely affect building elements.
(Ord. 2017-6, § 2)
10-18   HISTORICAL BUILDING CODE.
   10-18.1   Adoption.
   The California Historical Building Code, Part 8 of Title 24 of the
California Code of Regulations, 2022 Edition, as published by the California
Building Standards Commission pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 17922,
is adopted in its entirety.
(Ord. 2019-09, § 2; Ord. 2022-06, § 3)
10-19   EXISTING BUILDING CODE.
   10-19.1   Adoption.
   The California Existing Building Code, Part 10 of Title 24 of the California
Code of Regulations, 2022 Edition, as published by the California Building

emergency use or encroachment of a right-of-way shall apply for a written
permit within ten (10) calendar days, beginning with the first business day the

12-2   PERMITS FOR ENCROACHMENTS 1
1   Editor’s Note: For the statutory provisions regarding the authority of the
Town to require permits for encroachment to municipal roads, see Streets and
Highways Code, §1460ff.
   12-2.1   Issuance.
   The written permits required by this chapter shall be issued by the City
Engineer for any lawful use, subject to conditions set forth in this chapter
and required by law. The City Engineer shall prescribe and provide a regular
form of application for a permit required by this chapter. The application form
shall contain space for the applicant’s name and address and the contractor’s
name, license number, and primary place of business, if the applicant proposes
to employ a contractor, together with the detail that in the judgment of the
City Engineer is necessary to establish the purpose and use, location,
dimension, and estimated dates of commencement and completion of the
encroachment. The application form shall be completed and signed by the
applicant and filed with the City Engineer.
   12-2.2   Application; Exhibits Required.
   The applicant shall enclose with, attach or add to the application for a
permit, a map, plat, sketch, diagram, or similar exhibit when required by the
City Engineer, of a size and in the quantity that he may prescribe, on which
shall be plainly shown all information necessary to locate, delineate,
illustrate, or identify the proposed use or encroachment and the right and
necessity of the applicant to cause such encroachment. If necessary, changes,
corrections, and notes will be made on the map, plat, sketch, diagram, or
similar exhibit and these items will become an integral part of the permit.
   12-2.3   Consent of Public Bodies.
   The applicant shall also enclose with, attach to, or add to the application
copies of the written order or consent to any work under the permit, required
by law, of the Public Utilities Commission, sanitary districts, water
districts, or any other public body having jurisdiction. A permit shall not be
issued until the order or consent, if required, is first obtained and evidence
of it filed with the City Engineer. The permittee shall keep himself adequately
informed of all State and Federal laws and local ordinances and regulations
which affect the permit. The applicant at all times shall comply with and shall
cause all his agents and employees to comply with all such laws, ordinances,
regulations, decisions, and court and similar authoritative orders, and shall
protect and indemnify the Town and all of its officers, agents, and employees
against any claims or liability proximately caused by the violations of such
law, ordinance, regulation, or order issued under police power and in
accordance with law, whether by himself or his agents or employees.
   12-2.4   Special Permit Required to Move Certain Objects.
   Before a vehicle or combination of vehicles or objects of weight, dimension,
or characteristic prohibited by law without a permit, is moved on a public
right-of-way, a permit shall first be granted by the City Engineer as set forth
in specifications adopted by resolution of the Town Council.
   12-2.5   Term; Beginning of Work or Use.
   The permittee shall begin the work or use authorized by a permit issued
under this chapter within ninety (90) days from date of issuance, unless a
different period is stated in the permit. If the work or use is not begun
within ninety (90) days, or within the time stated in the permit, then the
permit shall become void, unless before its expiration the time for beginning
has been extended in writing by the City Engineer. A permit for temporary
encroachments, as determined by the City Engineer, for continuing a use or
maintaining a temporary encroachment previously authorized, shall be valid for
a term of one (1) year from date of issuance, unless the permit specifies
otherwise, or unless sooner terminated by discontinuance of the use, removal of
the encroachment, or termination of the permit by written order of the City
Engineer mailed thirty (30) days before the date of termination.
   12-2.6   Completion of Work.
   The permittee shall complete the work or use authorized by a permit within
the time specified in the permit. If at any time the City Engineer finds that
delay in beginning, prosecuting, or completing the work or use is due to lack
of diligence by the permittee, he may cancel the permit and restore the right-
of-way to its former condition. The permittee shall reimburse the Town for all
expenses incurred by the City Engineer in restoring the right-of-way, plus
fifteen (15%) percent as administrative costs.
   12-2.7   Permit Nontransferable.
   No permit issued under this chapter is transferable. The person, public
agency, firm, or corporation actually making or maintaining the encroachment
shall obtain the permit and furnish the bond.
   12-2.8   Display Requirements.
   The permittee shall keep any permit issued under this chapter at the site of
work, or in the cab of a vehicle when its movement on a public highway is
involved, and the permit must be shown to any authorized representative of the
City Engineer or law enforcement officer on demand.
   A permit issued for continued use or maintenance of an encroachment may be
kept at the place of business of the permittee or otherwise safeguarded during
the term of validity but shall be made available to an authorized
representative of the City Engineer or law enforcement officer within a
reasonable time after demand.
   12-2.9   Encroachment or Use Change.
   No changes shall be made in the location, dimensions, character, or duration
of the encroachment or use granted by the permit except on written
authorization by the City Engineer, but no permit shall be required for the
continuing use or maintenance of encroachments installed by public utilities or
for changes to them where the changes or additions require no excavation of the
right-of-way.
   12-2.10   Fees.
   The schedule of fees will be those recommended by the City Engineer and
established and adopted by the Town Council from time to time by resolution.
Before a permit is issued the applicant shall deposit with the City Engineer
for payment to the Treasurer of the Town of Danville cash or check in a
sufficient sum to cover the fee for issuance of the permit, charges for field
investigation, and the fee for necessary inspection, all in accordance with
schedules established and adopted by the Council.
   Public utilities and political subdivisions, at the City Engineer’s option,
may make payment for the above changes as billed by the Town instead of advance
deposit as required above.
12-3   SECURITY DEPOSITS 1
1   Editor’s Note: For the statutory provisions authorizing the Town to require
a bond in such amount as deemed sufficient, see Streets and Highways Code,
§1467.
   12-3.1   Cash Deposit.
   Unless this section is waived in the permit and before a permit is
effective, an applicant shall deposit with the City Engineer or an agent
authorized by resolution of the Town Council cash or a certified or cashier’s
check in a sum to be fixed by the City Engineer as sufficient to reimburse the
Town for costs of restoring the right-of-way to its former condition, based on
the schedules, if any, adopted by resolution of the Town Council; but an
applicant may file a cash deposit on an annual basis in a sum estimated by the
City Engineer as sufficient to cover his activities during any twelve (12)
month period.
   12-3.2   Bond in Lieu of Cash Deposit.
   Instead of the cash deposit prescribed by subsection
12-3.1, the applicant, on approval by the City Engineer, may file a cash
deposit in the minimum sum established by the schedules, if any, adopted for
that purpose by the Council and in effect at the time of application for a
permit. The balance of the sum fixed by the City Engineer as sufficient to
reimburse the Town for expenses incurred in restoring the right-of-way to its
former condition may be filed in the form of an approved surety bond issued by
a company authorized to do a general surety business in the State.
   12-3.3   Annual Bond.
   Instead of a cash deposit, the applicant, on approval by the City Engineer,
may annually file with the City Engineer an approved surety bond issued by a
company authorized to do a general surety business in the State, in a sum fixed
by the City Engineer as sufficient to reimburse the Town for expenses to be
incurred in restoring the right-of-way to its former condition, subject to the
schedules, if any, adopted by resolution of the Town Council.
   12-3.4   Additional Bond or Cash Deposit.
   The City Engineer may require an additional bond or cash deposit at any time

former condition, subject to the schedules, if any, adopted by resolution of
the Town Council.

   In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, the City Engineer may
require satisfactory proof by certificate of insurance that the permittee has
in force a valid public liability insurance policy which includes the Town, its
officers, employees and agents as additional insureds. When so required, the
insurance coverage shall be in an amount the City Engineer deems sufficient to
adequately protect the additional insureds from liability for damages to person
(s) or property(s) arising from the activities related to the permit.
12-4   REQUIREMENTS AND REGULATIONS.
   12-4.1   Safeguards Required.

other safeguards necessary to protect the traveling public. Any omission on the
part of the City Engineer to specify in the permit what lights, barriers, or
other protective measures or devices shall be provided, erected, or maintained
by the permittee, or the fact that the City Engineer may not specify,
sufficient lights, barriers, or other protective measures or devices, shall not
excuse the permittee from complying with all requirements of law and
appropriate regulations and ordinances for adequately protecting the safety of
the traveling public. If at any time the City Engineer finds that suitable
safeguards are not being provided, the Town may provide, erect, maintain,
relocate, or remove the safeguards deemed necessary or may cancel the permit
and restore the right-of-way to its former condition, all at the expense of the
permittee.
   b.   A permittee making any excavation or leaving any obstruction within,
under, or on the right-of-way, or causing the same to be made, erected, or
left, shall place and maintain lights at each end of the excavation or
obstruction, at not more than fifty (50’) foot intervals along the excavation
or obstruction, from one-half (1/2) hour before sunset of each day to one-half
(1/2) hour after sunrise of the next day, until the excavation is entirely
refilled or the obstruction removed and the right-of-way made safe for use. In
addition, reflectorized warning signs conforming to the requirements of the
California Division of Highways shall be placed two hundred (200’) and four
hundred (400’) feet from each excavation or obstruction, in a position
adequately to warn public traffic.

for proper drainage as approved by the City Engineer and shall comply with the
requirements of Article III, Drainage, of this chapter.
   12-4.5   Interference with Travel of Public.

without the consent of the owner.
   12-4.6   Restoration of Right-of-Way.
   a.   On completion of the work, acts, or things for which a maintenance or
encroachment permit was issued, or when required by the City Engineer, the

this chapter and adopted specifications, or as directed by the City Engineer
within the limits of the specification. The permittee shall remove all
obstructions, impediments, material, or rubbish caused or placed on the right-

right-of-way to a safe and usable condition, as directed by the City Engineer.
   b.   After completion of all work, the permittee shall exercise reasonable
care in inspecting and maintaining the area affected by the encroachment. On
notice from the City Engineer the permittee shall immediately repair any
injury, damage, or nuisance in any portion of the right-of-way resulting from
the work done under the permit. If the permittee fails to act promptly or if
the exigencies of the injury or damage require repairs or replacement to be
made before the permittee can be notified or can respond to notice, the Town at
its option may make the necessary repairs or replacements or perform the
necessary work and the permittee shall be charged the actual costs of labor and
materials, plus fifteen (15%) percent as administrative costs. By acceptance of
the permit, the permittee agrees to comply with this subsection.
   12-4.7   Relocation or Removal of Installations.
   If any future construction, reconstruction, or maintenance work on a public
right-of-way requires the relocation or removal of installations or
encroachments in, on or under the public right-of-way, the permittee owning,
controlling, or maintaining the installations or encroachments shall relocate
or remove them at his sole expense; but this provision shall remain in effect
only so long as the right-of-way on which the installations or structures are
located is used for usual highway purposes and not as a freeway, and this
provision shall cease to apply when the highway becomes a freeway. When removal
or relocation is required, the City Engineer shall give the permittee a written
demand specifying the place of relocation, or that the installations or
encroachment must be removed from the right-of-way, and specifying in the

removal or relocation of the encroachment at the expense of the permittee.
   12-4.8   Repair Work Supervision and Inspection.
   All encroachment repair work done under a permit issued under this chapter

earth or imported material, unless otherwise specified in the permit. Within
the public highway, the minimum cover of three (3’) feet shall be measured from
the surface, existing or planned. The City Engineer is authorized to permit
installation of pipes or conduits where three (3’) feet of cover cannot be
provided because of topography, structures, or other engineering necessity.

entire length shall be removed from the ground and the hole backfilled and
compacted.
   12-4.14   Aids to Visibility.
   When the location or position of a pole or other obstruction makes
accentuation of its visibility to vehicular traffic necessary, the City
Engineer may require that the pole or other obstruction be painted or equipped
with reflectors or other aids to visibility prescribed or authorized by the
Public Utilities Commission or the Department of Public Works of the State of
California, at the expense of the permittee.

   12-4.17   Tree Planting and Maintenance.
   a.   Applications for permits to plant trees in the right-of-way shall be
made on a form prescribed by the City Engineer. The form shall include, in
addition to the other requirements, an agreement by the applicant to maintain
the trees in a neat, healthy, and safe condition to the satisfaction of the
City Engineer, and an agreement to remove the trees as directed by the City
Engineer and to pay the cost of removal on the permittee’s failure promptly to
remove the trees on direction of the City Engineer. The application shall show
the exact location and kind of trees to be planted, and no change shall be made
either in the location or kind of trees without the written approval of the
City Engineer.
   b.   All trees placed in the right-of-way shall be maintained by the
permittee or his successor in interest or by some other interested party in a
neat, healthy, and safe condition to the satisfaction of the City Engineer and
at no expense to the Town. If the encroachment is not located or maintained as
specified in this section, the City Engineer may direct the permittee to remove
the encroachment and restore the right-of-way to its former condition at the
expense of the permittee. If the permittee fails promptly to remove the
encroachment as directed, the City Engineer shall have the right to remove it
and collect the cost of removal from the permittee, together with all of the
Town’s costs and expenses in enforcing collection.
   c.   The City Engineer shall refuse to issue a permit authorizing the
planting of trees in the right-of-way when in his judgment the location as
described in the application or the nature of the growth above or below ground
of the kind of tree proposed will impede or inconvenience public travel, unduly
disturb the right-of-way, interfere with the construction or maintenance of
necessary facilities, or interfere with existing pipe lines, utility
installations, or other facilities lawfully placed within the right-of-way.
   12-4.18   Tree Trimming or Removal.
   a.   Trimming of trees will be permitted only when and in the manner
authorized by a permit issued under this chapter so that the shapeliness of the
tree may be preserved.

only when a necessity for removal exists. When a tree is removed under
authority of a permit, the entire stump shall be taken out for a distance of at
least two (2’) feet below the ground surface unless otherwise specified in the
permit, and the hole shall be backfilled and tamped. All debris from trimming
or removal shall be removed from the site and the right-of-way restored to its
former condition.

permit.
   No hedge, shrub, or other planting whatever or fence or similar structure
shall be maintained across any existing walkway in a sidewalk area or shoulder.
The intent of this restriction is to keep a walkway free for pedestrian or
other lawful public travel without interference by or with vehicular travel. No
encroachment will be permitted or maintained which impedes, obstructs, or
denies pedestrian or other lawful travel within the limits of the right-of-way
of a public highway or impairs adequate sight distance for safe pedestrian or
vehicular traffic.
   12-4.20   Hedge and Fence Maintenance.
   The permittee or property owner shall maintain the hedges, shrubs, or other
planting, or fence or similar structure, used for landscaping purposes in a

12-4.19, the City Engineer may direct the permittee or property owner to remove
the encroachment and restore the right-of-way to its former condition at the
expense of the permittee or property owner.
   12-4.21   Lawns.
   Other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, it is lawful for a person,
firm, or corporation or other body of persons to plant and maintain a lawn or
similar ground cover of any grass or type not otherwise prohibited by law
within the right-of-way without a written permit. However, the lawn or similar
ground cover shall not extend into the traveled way nor into the drainage
ditches, gutter, or other drainage facilities.
   The general public shall not be denied the use of a planted area for
pedestrian travel or other lawful use. The Town may use the planted area for
any purpose and may issue a permit to any applicant to go on the planted area
to perform work or otherwise encroach under this chapter. If the lawn or
similar ground cover is damaged or disturbed in the course of an authorized
encroachment, the permittee will be held responsible for the replacement unless
the permit specifically states otherwise.
   12-4.23   Monuments.
   Any monument of granite, concrete, iron, or other lasting material set for

   c.   Density of pedestrian traffic necessitates fewer newsracks than the
authorized number indicated. It is the purpose of this section to provide
maximum public access to all publications of general interest and circulation.
Since available space is limited and recognizing that there is considerable
public demand for publications of current concern, in determining which
publication vending machines shall be issued a permit to remain in a particular
location the Town Manager or his/her designee shall be guided by this chapter
consistent with considerations of public safety.
   d.   In the Old Town area along Hartz Avenue and Front Street newsracks
shall generally be permitted in the areas shown on the attached map. Other
placements may be approved by the Town Manager or his/her designee on a case by
case basis. All requirements provided for in this section shall remain in
effect except that the two hundred (200) foot minimum distance between
newspaper racks may be adjusted in the Old Town area only particularly in
instances where newsracks are less than two hundred (200) feet apart on the
same side of the street but are separated by an intervening street.
(Ord. #94-16, §2)
   12-5.10   Abandoned Newsracks.
   No person who places or maintains a newsrack on the sidewalk of the Town
shall permit such newsrack to remain unused for a period of thirty (30) days or
more. A newsrack or newsrack facility shall not be deemed “abandoned” if the
empty newsrack is attributable to a labor strike or a temporary or
extraordinary interruption of distribution or publication by the publication
sold or dispensed from that newsrack. (Ord. #94-16, §2)
   12-5.11   Removal—Hearing.
   a.   Any newsrack installed, used or maintained in violation of the
provisions of this section may be subject to the removal and storage by the
Town Manager or his/her designee. Such officer shall take steps to notify the
owner/permit holder thereof and request compliance within thirty (30) calendar
days prior to removal. At any time within the thirty (30) day period, an
administrative hearing to challenge the existence of a violation may be
requested by the owner/permit holder. Failure to request the hearing shall
result in removal and storage of the newsracks by the Town Manager or his/her
designee at any time after the expiration of the thirty (30) day period.
   b.   If the owner/permit holder requests a hearing as provided in paragraph
a. of this subsection, the hearing shall be administered by the Town Manager or
his/her designee. The owner/permit holder shall have thirty (30) days from the
date of any adverse ruling which may result from the hearing to comply with the
provisions specified in the ruling. If after the thirty (30) days from the date
of decision the owner/permit holder has failed to comply with the provisions of
this section cited in the decision, the subject newsracks shall be removed and
stored by the Town Manager or his/her designee.
   c.   The cost of removal and or storage by the Town Manager or his/her
designee of any newsrack subject to this section shall be chargeable as a civil
debt to the owner/permit holder thereof and may be collected by the Town in the
same manner as it collects any other civil debt or obligation. In addition, the
newsracks in question shall be deemed to be unclaimed property and may be
disposed of accordingly.
(Ord. #94-16, §2)
   12-5.12   Compliance by Existing Owner/Permit Holders.
   Owner/permit holders of newsracks located within the Town on the effective
date of the ordinance codified in this section shall have ninety (90) days from
said date to comply with the provisions of this section; thereafter, any
newsracks not in compliance shall be subject to removal by the Town Manager or
his/her designee as provided in this section. (Ord. #94-16, §2)
   12-5.13   Display of Material Harmful to Minors.
   No material which is harmful to minors, as defined in Section 313 of the
California Penal Code, shall be displayed in a public place, other than a
public place from which minors are excluded, unless blinder racks are placed in
front of the material so that the lower two-thirds (2/3) of the material is not
exposed to view. (Ord. #2000-05 §1)
12-6   MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF SIDEWALKS.
   12-6.1   Intent.
   It is the intent of this section to impose upon property owners the
affirmative duty to repair and maintain the sidewalk area adjoining their
property in a safe and non-dangerous condition. This duty runs to and in favor
of members of the public using the sidewalk area. (Ord. #95-05, §1)
   12-6.2   Definitions.
   In this section, unless the context otherwise requires:
   Owner shall mean the fee owner of real property and the person or persons in
possession of the real property.
   Repair and maintenance shall mean and include, but is not limited to,
maintenance and repair of surfaces, including grinding, removal and replacement
of sidewalks, repair and maintenance of curb and gutters, removal and filling
or replacement of parking strips, removal of weeds and/or debris, tree root
pruning and installing root barriers, trimming of shrubs and/or ground cover
and trimming shrubs within the area between the property line of the adjacent
property and the street pavement line of the adjacent property and the street
pavement line, including parking strips and curbs, so that the sidewalk area
will remain in a condition that is not dangerous to persons using the sidewalk
in a reasonable manner and will be in a condition which will not interfere with
the public convenience in the use of said sidewalk area.
   Sidewalk area shall mean the sidewalk, parking strip and curb immediately
adjoining real property.
(Ord. #96-05, §1)
   12-6.3   Duty to Maintain Sidewalk.
   The owner of a parcel of real property which fronts on any portion of a
sidewalk area is responsible for the repair and maintenance of the sidewalk
area and shall pay the cost and expense of such repair and maintenance. (Ord.
#96-05, §1)
   12-6.4   Liability of Owner.
   a.   The owner of a parcel of real property is under a duty to members of
the public to maintain the portion of any sidewalk area described in subsection
12-6.3 in a safe condition. If the owner makes an alteration or repair to the
sidewalk, the owner must use ordinary care in making the alteration and in
keeping the altered portion of the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition.
   b.   The failure of an owner to fulfill the duties imposed by paragraph a.
above, constitutes negligence and the owner shall be liable to members of the
public injured as a result of that negligence. (Ord. #96-05, §1)
   12-6.5   Authority of Town to Make Repairs.
   If the owner does not maintain the sidewalk in a safe manner, the Town may
make the necessary repairs and collect the cost of such repairs pursuant to the
authority of Streets and Highways Code Section 5600 et seq. (Ord. #96-05, §1)
ARTICLE II
ROAD DEDICATIONS AND SETBACKS 1
1   Editor’s Note: For the statutory provisions regarding irrevocable offers to
dedicate land for public purposes, see Government Code, §7050. For building
permit provisions, see Chapter X, this Code.
12-7   ROAD DEDICATION AND IMPROVEMENT.
   12-7.1   Findings.
   In enacting this Article the Town Council finds that the Town has
experienced explosive increases in population and motor vehicle operation, and
extensive changes from the former predominantly agricultural uses to land
development for high-activity purposes other than agricultural with attendant
building construction, which factors directly result in rapidly rendering the
present internal road system inadequate in width and development to provide
minimum acceptable service capacity to the lands being developed, which
inadequacy is growing at an increasing rate. The indirect result of these
factors of change and growth is to increasingly tend to deny to the public the
use of roads of minimum standards for safe and convenient vehicular and
pedestrian access and travel between many points inside and outside the Town.
   12-7.2   Cost.
   The Council further finds that the total cost of correcting Town road system
deficiencies substantially exceeds the total funds available to the Town for
this purpose, and that unless measures are taken to provide for the orderly and
systematic increase in width, capacity and improvement of the Town roads when
and as the development of land as aforesaid takes place, the citizens of this
Town will early suffer a condition of blight with pernicious effect upon the
economic welfare, public convenience and general prosperity of the Town.
   12-7.3   Intention.
   Therefore, the provisions of this Article are intended to define the
requirements and procedures for the dedication of right-of-way and the
improvement of those roads shown in the circulation element of the General Plan
of the Town of Danville, in connection with the issuance of building permits or
land use permits in certain land use districts in order to accomplish the
objectives set forth in subsection
12-7.4.
   12-7.4   Objectives.
   The objects of these provisions are:
   a.   To insure conformity to the Subdivision Map Act and to Chapter XXXI,
Subdivision, and to extend the application of the basic requirements thereof to
land development in which no subdivision is involved;
   b.   To spread the costs of required public improvements upon the abutting
properties as contemplated by law;
   c.   To cause the installation of those improvements necessary to properly
serve the property developed, at the time of its development, so that the
benefited property may enjoy the use of such improvements throughout the normal
life thereof, and so that such improvements are not indefinitely deferred to
the detriment of the public interest, safety and welfare;
   d.   To protect the public’s vested interest in the preexisting capacity of
the Town’s streets and highways, and to provide a policy for public
participation in the widening and improvement of streets and highways when
necessitated by development of abutting property;
   e.   To prevent the dissipation or improper use of the Town’s general
operating and maintenance funds in providing these improvements or in
maintaining faulty or substandard installations; and
   f.   To protect the public health, safety, living standards and common
welfare of the general public.
   12-7.5   Requirements Generally.
   No building or structure shall be erected or enlarged, and no building
permit shall be issued therefor, on any lot in any district set forth in
subsection
12-7.6 or on any lot where a variance or land use permit is conditioned on
compliance with this chapter, if such lot abuts a principal thoroughfare or
arterial as shown on “The City Major Roads Plan,” unless the one-half (1/2) of
the planned road which is located on the same side of the road’s center (as
shown on the Plan) as such lot has been dedicated and improved for the full
frontage width of the lot, or such dedication and improvement has been assured.
   12-7.6   Applicable Zoning Districts.
   This section shall be applicable to the following zoning districts:
   F-R, F-1, M-1, M-2, M-3, M-4, T-l, P-1, N-B, planned N-B, R-B, special R-B,
G-1, C, O-1, A-O, C-M, W-3, L-1 and H-1.
   12-7.7   Maximum Dedication.
   a.   The maximum area of land required to be dedicated in accordance with
this section shall not exceed twenty-five (25%) percent of the area of any such
lot which was of record in the County Recorder’s office, as of April 1, 1971.
   b.   Unless a variance is granted, no dedication shall be required by this
section which reduces the lot below:
      1.   The minimum for the zoning district involved or as required in
Chapter XXXII, Planning and Land Use; or
      2.   A width of fifty (50’) feet; or
      3.   An area of five thousand (5,000) square feet.
   c.   No dedication shall be required of any land under a building (as
defined in Chapter XXXII, Planning and Land Use) which existed on April 1,
1971.
   12-7.8   Existing Improvements in Right-of-Way.
   No additional improvements shall be required on a lot where complete
roadway, curb, gutter and sidewalk improvements exist within the present road
right-of-way contiguous thereto; but additional right-of-way may be required to
be dedicated to conform to future road widths.
   12-7.9   No Building in Dedicated Area.
   After March 31, 1971, no person shall erect any building or structure within
the area(s) required to be dedicated by this section.

a cash bond, or a bond executed by the lot owner as principal and a company
authorized to act as a surety in this State. The bond shall be payable to the
Town and be conditioned upon the faithful performance of all required work; and
it shall provide that if such work is not completed within the time specified,
the Town may have it completed, and the parties executing the bond shall be
firmly bound under a continuing obligation for the payment of all necessary
costs and expenses incurred in the construction thereof.
   12-7.14   Improvement Default.
   On any default or failure on the part of the owner (principal) to fully,
faithfully and properly do or complete any of the required improvements, the
Town may have part or all of the work done, and may collect the costs caused
thereby from the cash deposit (refunding any remainder) or enforce collection
thereof under the surety bond.
   12-7.15   Bond Term and Completion.
   The term of the (cash and/or surety) bond required by this section shall
begin when the cash is deposited or the surety bond is filed, and shall end

Building Department when improvements have been assured.
   12-7.17   Building Permit Issuance.
   When all dedication(s) and improvement(s) required by this section have been
satisfactorily assured, a building permit may be issued.
   12-7.18   Fees; None Required.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, no fees shall be charged

   12-8.15   Town Participation.
   a.   Costs. Upon proper written application to the Town Council and
investigation and recommendation to the Council by the City Engineer, the Town
may contribute to the costs of making any improvements required by this

application in conformity with the spirit and intent of this chapter.
   12-8.17   Lots Affected by Road Widening.
   On a lot which is affected by road widening required by the provisions of
this chapter, all required yards, setbacks, parking area, loading space, and
building locations for new buildings or structures or additions to buildings or
structures, shall be measured and calculated from the new lot lines being
created by the widening; but, for the purpose of establishing the required
front yard depth on a frontage where the ultimate curb line has been determined
under the provisions of this chapter, the depths of all existing front yards
may be measured from such ultimate curb line instead of the front lot line. In
applying all other provisions of this Code, the area of such lot shall be
considered as that which existed immediately before to such required road
widening.
   12-8.18   Sidewalks and Pedestrian Paths.
   a.   Surfacing of Pedestrian Paths. Pedestrian paths shall be surfaced with
the same material of the same thickness specified below for sidewalks and for a

site approved by the local school board. The one (1) mile distance shall be
measured along the shortest pedestrian route available or planned, measured
from the closest boundary of the school site and subdivision;
      3.   Along all streets wherein the area is zoned R-12 or in land use
districts having a higher density;
      4.   Along all streets within any portion of a subdivision zoned for
multiple family, business, or commercial land uses.
   c.   Sidewalk Width and Thickness. Sidewalks shall be at least four (4’)
feet wide, exclusive of curbs, and not less than three and five-eighths (3 5/
8”) inches thick.
   (Ord. #39-84, §2)

   Any person required to dedicate land or make improvements under this chapter
may appeal any determination made by the City Engineer hereunder to the
Planning Commission. His written appeal shall clearly and concisely state the
grounds therefor. The Planning Commission shall render its decision within
forty-five (45) calendar days after an appeal is properly filed with it.
   12-9.3   Appeal to Town Council.
   a.   The applicant or an affected Town official may appeal the Commission’s

   The Commission and the Council may make such modifications in the
requirements of this chapter or may grant such waivers or modifications of the
determinations which are appealed to them, as they determine are required to
prevent unreasonable hardship under the facts of each case, but each such
modification or waiver shall conform with the general spirit and intent of the
requirements of this chapter.
12-10   SETBACK REQUIREMENTS.
   12-10.1   Declaration of Policy.
   The Town is developing a master plan of streets and highways (and precise
sections thereof) for the purpose of assuring ample transportation facilities
for the present and future. The magnitude of this undertaking precludes these
plans being completed in their entirety in time to fully guide the rapid
development occurring within the Town; and the surveys, hearings, map
preparation, and requirements of law governing these matters necessitate that
detailed plans be developed progressively. To conserve the public interest and
to assure economies and public safety and welfare, it is imperative that
necessary rights-of-way for streets and highways within the Town be protected
against encroachment by permanent physical improvements, the existence of which
would make unnecessarily difficult or make impractical the retention or
creation of thoroughfares, adequate in alignment, dimensions and vision
clearance to serve the public needs, safety and welfare. Consequently, to deal
effectively with the practical problem thus presented, it is necessary to
establish certain minimum building line setbacks on a Town-wide basis.
   12-10.2   Requirements; Adopted Section of Streets and Highways Plan; Filing
Required.
    Whenever the Town Council adopts a precise section of the streets and
highways plan, the Engineering Department shall prepare a map of the highway,
sufficient to show the location of the highway on parcels of land to be
traversed or otherwise occupied by the highway when constructed, and file the
map in the County Recorder’s office and deliver a copy to the Chief Building
Official.
   12-10.3   Effect of Plan on Building Permit Issuance.
   Before issuing a building permit, the Chief Building Inspector or his
authorized deputy shall examine the precise plan. If he finds that the building
or structure proposed to be erected will lie within the boundaries of the
precise section of the streets and highways plan, or within the setback lines
of the existing zoning regulations affecting the land as measured from the
boundaries of the precise section, he shall grant the permit only if the cost
of the proposed building or structure is five hundred ($500.00) dollars or
less, otherwise, he shall refuse the permit and notify the applicant for the
permit of the reason for refusal.
   12-10.4   Chapter Administration.
   Any person aggrieved by the refusal of a building permit may appeal to the
Planning Commission. Administration of this chapter and of Streets and Highways
Code Section 741.2 is referred to the Planning Commission.
   12-10.5   Building Permit Issuance After Appeal; Conditions Required.
   The Planning Commission shall grant the permit only if all the following are
true:
   a.   There are special circumstances or conditions relating to the property
upon which the proposed building, structure, or other improvement is sought to
be placed;
   b.   Granting the application is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of substantial property rights; and
   c.   Balancing the interests of the public in preserving the integrity of
the master plan of streets and highways against the interest of the owner of
the land in using his property, the granting of the permit is required by
considerations of justice and equity.
   12-10.6   Exemptions.
   a.   Eminent Domain, Declaratory Relief, Zoning.
      1.   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed a condition precedent to the
acquisition of right-of-way by purchase or by proceedings in eminent domain.
      2.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict the right of
any person to seek declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure Section
1060, or to avail himself of any other legal or equitable remedy applicable to
his particular case.
      3.   No zoning regulations are to be construed as permitting a building

reason for an extension of time and the date is extended by the enforcing
officer in writing. A permit which has become void by reason of noncom-
mencement of work prior to the stipulated date may be renewed at the discretion

performed.

   Should the work described in a permit be performed in such a manner as to be
deemed unsatisfactory and/or unacceptable by the enforcing officer, then the
work shall be reconstructed by the permittee to the satisfaction of the
enforcing officer.
   Should the enforcing officer deem that delay in pursuit or completion of the
act or work be due to lack of diligence or willful act on the part of the
permittee, or should the work performed be deemed unsatisfactory and/or
unacceptable; then, if essential to the health, safety, or welfare of the
general public, the enforcing officer shall request the Town Council for
authorization to contract with any licensed general contractor to complete,
erect, install, reconstruct, or alter all structures or work in conformance
with approved plans and specifications, or to remove all structures and

or surety bond of the permittee, then any and all additional costs shall become

fee shall be required for municipalities or public districts.
   12-14.12   Security; Cash Deposit or Bond Required.
   Prior to the issuance of a permit the applicant shall deposit with the
enforcing officer cash or check for payment to the City Clerk in an amount
deemed adequate by the enforcing officer but not exceeding the estimated total
cost, including all labor and materials, of the work to be performed; except
that such deposit may be waived by the enforcing officer. In lieu of a cash
deposit, the applicant may file an approved surety bond issued by a company or
corporation authorized to engage in general surety business in the State of
California. The conditions of any cash deposit or surety bond made pursuant to
this subsection shall be that the permittee will diligently and in good faith
comply with all provisions of this Article, with all terms and conditions
contained in the permit issued him, and will pursue the work to completion
without undue delay except for reasonable cause. Upon satisfactory and
acceptable completion of the work as set forth in subsection

14-1   BENEFIT DISTRICTS AND PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS.
   14-1.1   Purpose.
   As a condition of approval of the grant of a land use enTitlement for the
development of property, a developer may be required to install public
improvements that provide a benefit to the general public and to other specific
properties in the vicinity of the improvements. This situation may occur when
one developer elects to seek approval and begin development sooner than
another.
   The purpose of this section is to establish a mechanism whereby a property
owner who benefits by but does not contribute to certain public improvements
will, at the time the benefited property owner develops property, reimburse the
developer who has installed improvements. (Ord. #76-85, §9-101)
   14-1.2   Definitions.
   In this section:
   Benefit district shall mean the geographical area which benefits by a
privately financed public improvement.
   Benefited property shall mean a property within a benefit district for which
no contribution to the cost of the public improvement was made at the time of
its construction. Benefited property includes property owned by a public
agency;
   Financing party shall mean a property owner or developer who installs or
pays for the installation of public improvements within a benefit district;
   Land use entitlement shall mean and include a permit or approval granted by
the Town for the development of property, including a subdivision map approval,
land use permit, development plan approval, grading permit, building permit and
architectural or design review approval.
Ord. #76-85, §9-102)
   14-1.3   Public Improvement Reimbursement Agreement: Procedure.
   a.   General. If a property owner is required to construct public
improvements as a condition of approval of a proposed development and the
required public improvements have the capacity and capability of serving and
are designed to serve additional properties not within the proposed development
and to directly benefit other properties in the vicinity, the property owner
may apply to the Town for a reimbursement agreement as provided in this
section.
   b.   Application. A person requesting a reimbursement agreement shall submit
an application on a form provided by the Town and shall provide information as
required by the Town Engineer, including the area of the proposed benefit
district. The applicant shall also submit a proposed form of agreement.
   c.   Notice and Hearing. The Town Council shall hold a public hearing on the
application. At least ten (10) days before the hearing the Town shall notify
each affected property owner in writing, advising of the hearing and providing
a copy of the proposed reimbursement agreement and staff report which will be
submitted to the Council. In this subsection, “affected property owner” means
(1) the record owner (as shown on the latest County Assessor’s secured real
property assessment roll) of each property within the proposed benefit district
and (2) the financing party.
      An affected property owner may file written or oral comments or
objections to the application before or at the hearing.
      No property may be added to a benefit district unless the notice is sent
to the affected property owner. Failure to receive the notice required by this
section shall not invalidate the reimbursement agreement.
   d.   Town Council Action; Findings. After the public hearing, the Town
Council may by resolution grant, grant with modification or deny approval of a
reimbursement agreement.
   Before granting approval, the Town Council shall make each of these
findings:
      1.   The improvement for which reimbursement is sought is a public
improvement which will, upon completion, be accepted by the Town;
      2.   The improvement is not located within the boundaries of the proposed
development;
      3.   The public improvement has the capacity and capability of serving
and is designed to serve additional properties not within the proposed
development due to the supplemental size, capacity, number or length of the
improvement;
      4.   The proposed benefit district represents a geographical area of
property which will benefit directly and substantially by the public
improvement; and
      5.   The method of determining contribution and the amount of
contribution is fair and reasonable to both the financing party and the
benefited property owner and fairly distributes the charge among all subject
parcels in proportion to the estimated benefit each will receive from the
proposed improvement.
   e.   Timing. A financing party may not request and the Town Council may not
approve a public improvement reimbursement agreement after the date
construction begins on a public improvement, except that if the improvement is
financed through the levy of a special assessment, the request may be made at
any time and the agreement may be approved concurrently with, or at any time
after, the levy of the assessment.
   f.   Recordation. The Town shall have an approved public improvement
reimbursement agreement, including a list of the benefited properties, recorded
in the office of the County Recorder.
   (Ord. #76-85, §9-103; Ord. #122, §1)
   14-1.4   Public Improvement Reimbursement Agreement: Contents.
   A public improvement reimbursement agreement shall include, but is not
limited to, the following provisions:
   a.   A statement of the total construction cost, the applicant’s equitable
share of the cost, and the amount of the total cost eligible for reimbursement;
   b.   A map approved by the Town Engineer showing each property included
within the benefit district and a list of each property by County Assessor
parcel number;
   c.   The method of spreading the eligible reimbursement cost to be charged
under the agreement to properties within the benefit district and the rate of
interest or appreciation to be added to initial charges during the period of
the agreement;
   d.   A provision indicating who the financing party is for the purpose of
receiving reimbursement, i.e. whether the developer or the property owner of
record at the time the reimbursement is made (this may depend upon whether the
public improvement is financed by the developer or by individual property
owners through an assessment district);
   e.   The date on which the reimbursement agreement takes effect and
benefited property owners begin contributions;
   f.   A statement that no reimbursement charges collected by the Town may be
distributed to a financing party until the public improvement is completed and
accepted by the Town;
   g.   A list of the administrative costs, if any, to be charged by the Town
to administer the agreement. These costs may be shown as a percentage of the
charges collected by the Town;
   h.   A provision that reimbursement to the financing party shall be paid
only from charges collected by the Town under the agreement from the benefited
properties listed in the agreement as such properties receive a land use
entitlement. Reimbursement to the financing party shall be paid only from such
charges collected within ten (10) years from the date the agreement becomes
effective, unless a different time period is approved by the Town Council; and
   i.   A provision that the Town is not liable to the financing party for
failure of the Town to collect a reimbursement charge due from a property or
because of legal inability of the Town to collect the charge from a property.
(Ord. #76-85, §9-104)
   14-1.5   Payment by Benefited Property Owner.
   a.   A benefited property owner shall pay to the Town the applicable
contribution charge set forth in the agreement whenever that person obtains a
land use entitlement. The charge is payable at the time the entitlement is
granted.
   b.   The contribution charge applies only (1) after the reimbursement
agreement is recorded; (2) during the period a reimbursement agreement is in
effect and (3) if the Town Engineer determines that the land use entitlement
involves the scope and type of development contemplated by the agreement.
Payment of the contribution charge is not required as a condition of issuing a
land use entitlement for the alteration or enlargement of an existing building
or structure (or the erection of an accessory building or structure) if the
work:
      1.   Is on the same parcel of land; and
      2.   Does not create an additional dwelling unit; and
      3.   Will not change the potential for traffic generation; and
      4.   In any three (3) year period will not exceed one-half (1/2) the
value of all existing improvements on that parcel of land.
   c.   No property may be assessed a double fee under this section.
   d.   A benefited property owner has no obligation to pay a contribution
charge if the owner does not develop the property during the effective period
of the reimbursement agreement. (Ord. #76-85, §9-105)
   14-1.6   Implementation by Town Council.
   The Town Council may adopt rules and regulations it considers necessary to
implement this section. (Ord. #76-85, §9-106)

   The Town of Danville finds that the development of cable television and
communications systems has the potential of having great benefit and impact
upon the people of the Town. Because of the complex and rapidly changing
technology associated with cable television, the Town finds that the public
convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing
regulatory powers which should be vested in the Town or such persons as the

17-2   GRANT OF FRANCHISE.
   17-2.1   Authority.
   a.   Authorization. The Town may grant a franchise to any person whether
operating under an existing license or offering to furnish and provide such a
system. By accepting the franchise, the operator agrees to supply the system
and services required for the full term of the franchise. No person shall
distribute television or radio signals by means of a cable system unless he has
a franchise to do so under this chapter.
   b.   Franchise is Non-Exclusive. A franchise granted under this chapter is
non-exclusive. The Council shall determine when it is in the public interest to
grant a franchise under this chapter. This chapter does not require the grant
of a franchise or prevent the Council from permitting more than one (1) cable
system to operate within the Town at any time.
   c.   Amendments. During the term of the franchise the Town may amend this
chapter to require additional or greater standards of construction, operation
or maintenance on the part of the operator, including the payment of a greater
percent of the gross annual receipts of a franchise for the remaining term of
the franchise.
   d.   Uses Permitted. A franchise authorizes the operator to engage in the
business of operating and providing a cable television system within the
franchise area, and for that purpose to erect, install, construct, repair,
replace, reconstruct, maintain and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and
along any street, such poles, wires, cable, conductors, ducts, conduit, vaults,
manholes, amplifiers, and appliances, attachments, and other property as may be
necessary and appurtenant to the system; and, in addition, so to use, operate
and provide similar facilities or properties rented or leased from other
persons, including but not limited to a public utility or other person
franchise area. Nothing in this chapter is intended to grant to the operator an
easement or right-of-way over private property. This chapter does not relieve
operator of any requirement of the Town now or hereafter in effect, including a
requirement relating to street work, street excavation permits, undergrounding
of utilities or the use, removal or relocation of property in streets.
   e.   Operator Rules and Regulations. The operator may impose such rules,
regulations, terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as are
reasonably necessary to enable the operator to exercise its rights and perform
its obligations under this franchise. However, those rules, regulations, terms
and conditions may not conflict with this chapter or applicable State and
Federal laws, rules and regulations. The operator shall provide to each
subscriber a simple and easy to understand written summary of any rules which
relate to such things as service charges; services; service installations,
modifications and repairs; payment, and other items of significant interest to
subscribers. The operator shall periodically supply subscribers with written
notice of any substantive changes to rules which directly affect the
subscriber’s charges or services.
      Prior to the approval of a franchise, the operator requesting the
franchise shall submit a complete copy of its rules and regulations to the Town
and such operating rules and regulations shall be deemed approved by the Town
upon granting of the franchise. Any subsequent changes in the operator’s rules
and regulations shall require prior approval of the Town, if so required by the
Franchise Agreement.
   f.   Annexations. If incorporated territory served by operator under
authority granted by Contra Costa County is annexed to the Town, the operator’s
franchise issued under this chapter, including regulated subscriber rates,
applies to the annexed territory upon the effective date of annexation, to the
extent permitted by law.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-2.2   Rights Reserved to Town.
   a.   Town Powers. Neither the grant of a franchise nor a provision of this
chapter is a waiver or bar to the exercise of any other governmental right or
power by the Town. In accepting a franchise, the operator acknowledges that its
rights are subject to the Police power of the Town to adopt and enforce general
ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public, and it agrees to
comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the Town
under such power.
      Any conflict between this chapter and any other present or future lawful
exercise of the Town’s powers shall be resolved in favor of the Town, except
that any such exercise that is not of general application in the jurisdiction
or applies exclusively to the operator or cable communications systems and
which contain provisions inconsistent with this chapter shall prevail only if
an emergency exists constituting a danger to health, safety, property or
general welfare or such exercise is mandated by law.
   b.   Responsibility Delegation. The Town may exercise or delegate its rights
and responsibilities under this chapter. The Town may assign a right, power or
duty of the Town to a designated officer, employee, department or board of
Town.
   c.   Right to Acquire. The Town may acquire the property of the operator, in
whole or in part, either by purchase or by the exercise of the right of eminent
domain, at a fair market value. Fair market value does not include any amount
for the franchise itself or for any of the rights or privileges granted.
   d.   Right to Require Removal of Property. At the expiration of the term for
which the franchise is granted, or upon its revocation, the Town may require
the operator to remove at its own expense its cable system from the streets and
public ways within the Town.
   e.   Right to Inspect. The Town has the right to inspect the operator’s
reports, records and facilities as provided in Section
17-8.
   (Ord. #23-83, §1; Ord. #96, §1A)
   17-2.3   Limitations.
   a.   Limitation. No privilege or exemption is granted or conferred by a
franchise granted under this chapter except those specifically prescribed.
   b.   Prohibitions. The operator is prohibited from doing the following:
      1.   Engaging in the business of selling at retail, leasing or renting
television sets or radios;
      2.   Soliciting or referring a subscriber to persons engaged in any
business which the operator may not engage in;
      3.   Providing information concerning the viewing patterns of
identifiable individual subscribers.
   c.   Other Statutes. A franchise granted under this chapter is subject to
present and future requirements prescribed by applicable Federal, State, County
and local law.
   d.   Use of Other Facilities. A privilege claimed under a franchise granted
in a street is subordinate to a prior or subsequent use of the street for
public purposes. The franchise does not relieve the operator of its obligation
to obtain electrical, encroachment or other permits from Town or a utility
company.
   e.   Time. Time is of the essence for the franchise. The operator is not
relieved of its obligations to comply promptly with any provision of this
chapter by the Town’s failure to enforce prompt compliance.
   (Ord. #23-83, §1, Ord. #96, §1B)
   17-2.4   Franchise Payments.
   a.   Franchise Fees.
      1.   In consideration of the granting of a franchise, the operator shall
pay to the Town during the life of the franchise, a certain percentage of the
system’s annual gross receipts attributable to subscribers and within the
Town’s franchise area. The fee shall not be less than three (3%) percent, nor
shall it exceed the maximum limit specified by law. The Town reserves the
right, however, to collect a franchise fee of five (5%) percent of the
operator’s gross annual receipts if and when the Town elects to seek and FCC
waiver to exceed the currently authorized three (3%) percent limit. To the
extent required by a franchise agreement the Town and the operator shall
jointly submit and recommend approval of an application for the FCC waiver of
the three (3%) percent limit.
      2.   During the term of the franchise, the Town may by resolution
increase the franchise fee percentage of gross annual receipts to that
percentage specified as a new maximum limit for such fees by future Federal
and/or State legislation.
   b.   Other Costs.
      1.   The operator shall reimburse the Town for all costs actually
incurred by the Town in obtaining professional advice and assistance during the
term of the operator’s franchise with respect to the appropriateness,
feasibility, reasonableness and desirability of the exercise by the operator of
the rights granted to it under this chapter. (Such costs may include technical
testing and evaluation, evaluation of a change in rates, and review of
applications for extension, renewal or transfer of the franchise.) However, the
operator is not required to pay the Town more than an amount equal to two (2%)
percent of annual gross receipts with respect to any calendar year for these
costs. The Town’s costs for any year for which it is otherwise enTitled to
reimbursement which exceed such limit may be carried forward to succeeding
years and reimbursed in amounts up to two (2%) percent of annual gross receipts
for up to three (3) succeeding years.
      2.   The reports and records required under this chapter shall be
furnished at the operator’s expense.
      3.   The operator shall reimburse the Town for the costs expended in
soliciting and evaluating applications and processing the franchise award to
the extent such costs are not recovered from the application fees.
   c.   Payment.
      1.   Fees due the Town under paragraph a. shall be computed at the end of
each calendar quarter on the basis of gross receipts during such quarter.
Within sixty (60) days after the end of each of the first three (3) quarters of
each calendar year, the operator shall pay the Town the amount due for each
quarter. Within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar year, the
operator shall compute the total amount due the Town for the calendar year and
shall pay that amount, less the aggregate amount of quarterly payments
previously made to the Town during the calendar year. Each payment shall be
accompanied by the operator’s report showing in reasonable detail (as may be
specified by the Town, such specification to be changed not more often than
once each year), its computation of gross receipts for the quarter or year
covered. At the operator’s option, the provisions of this subsection may be
satisfied on a fiscal year and fiscal quarter basis.
      2.   Payment of sums due to Town under paragraph b. shall be made within
thirty (30) days after receipt of billing by the operator.
   d.   Non-Waiver. Acceptance of a payment is not a release or an accord and
satisfaction of any claim the Town may have for additional sums payable or for
the performance of any other obligation under this chapter.
   (Ord. #23-83, §1)
17-3   SYSTEM CAPABILITY; CABLE SERVICE GENERALLY.

facility, community center and other community service facility open to the
general public and designated by the Town; and the operator shall provide
additional basic service outlets at these locations at its cost of labor and
materials, without other installation charges and without monthly service
charge when service is also available to private customers in that area. If an
installation required by the Town requires an extension of the operator’s
distribution plant not otherwise required by this chapter the installations
shall be made by the operator at its cost of time and materials to be paid by
the public agency for which the service is provided.
   (Ord. #23-83, §1; Ord. #96, §1C, D)
   17-3.2   Community Service Programming.
   The purpose of this subsection is to provide the means for high quality
professional cablecasting of community-oriented programming which originates
locally or is particularly responsive to local needs and interests.
   a.   Channel Capacity. The operator shall provide the following without
charge:
      1.   At least one (1) channel each for public access, educational access
and municipal access; and
      2.   All interface equipment and cabling necessary to permit transmission
of these channels on the cable system.
      If the Town determines there is a need for additional access channel
capacity, the Town may require the operator to provide up to three (3)
additional channels for this purpose. The award agreement shall set forth
procedures for such action including reasonable notice and opportunity for
response by the operator. This provision does not preclude the operator’s
voluntary allocation of a greater number of access channels.
   b.   Operator Support. The operator shall provide the following without
charge and in accordance with specifications in the award agreement:
      1.   Studio facilities, production, editing and other equipment, staffing
and ongoing financial support and other resources in order to permit quality
cablecasting (both live and on tape) on the access channels;
      2.   Portable equipment to enable production, and for remote insertion,
of live programming from points other than the community studio; and
      3.   Advice and technical assistance in the effective use of the access
channels.
   c.   Community Service Radio Access. The operator shall allocate an FM
channel, or designated time periods on a channel, of its FM radio spectrum for
community service programming without charge, as requested by the Town.
   d.   Access to Upstream Bandwidth. The operator shall provide without charge
access to portions of its upstream bandwidth when requested by an access
channel in order to permit direct feed of community service programming to the
head-end for purposes of transmitting live or recorded material on an access
channel. The operator shall also, without charge, provide the equipment and
technical assistance required to activate the origination capability of each
access channel from both the head-end and remote sites.
   e.   Access for Data, Audio, and/or Telemetry Transmission. The Town may
require the operator to make available, without charge, access to portions of
the system’s upstream and downstream bandwidth not otherwise in use, for
purposes of data, audio, and/or telemetry transmission by the Town, public
schools, or other government or public service agencies. The Town may require
this access only after the Town and the operator have agreed upon mutually
satisfactory procedures, including provisions: (1) enabling the operator to
realign or regain such frequencies for its own use when needed; and (2)
development of a reasonable service call contract to cover the operator’s
expenses in making and servicing system connections in support of Town
circuits.
   f.   Other Use of Access Channels. Subject to limitations specified in the
award agreement, the operator may use available air time on an access channel
at no charge for its own programming purposes during the periods of time the
channel is not otherwise needed for community service programming.
   g.   Access Channel Management. The Town wishes to ensure that each access
channel is operated in the highest public interest. The Town may delegate
responsibility for operation and management of a channel to another entity such
as a public non-profit corporation representing a broad spectrum of the
community. The Town may authorize the entity to receive and allocate funding,
facilities, equipment and other resources for community service programming
purposes, develop and administer operational policies, hire and supervise
personnel, and undertake other responsibilities necessary for access channel
operation.
   h.   Implementation. Procedures and conditions to implement this section
shall be set forth more specifically in the award agreement. The procedures and

(Ord, #23-83, §1)
   17-3.3   Rate Procedures.
   a.   Subscriber rates and charges shall be as set forth in the award
agreement. No increase in any rates or charges for basic service shall be
permitted for the first twelve (12) months after the new or rebuilt system is
completed as defined in subsection
17-2.3b, 3. pursuant to this award.
   b.   Subsequent proposals to increase rates or charges for basic service
shall be submitted to the Town in writing, and shall include the following:
      1.   An audited balance sheet and income statement for the most recent
three (3) full fiscal years;
      2.   Copies of submissions to the FCC on Forms 325 and 326 for the most
recent three (3) full years;
      3.   A pro forma balance sheet, income statement and projection for the
fiscal year following, assuming the requested rates and such other changes as
the operator may project;
      4.   Supporting schedules as required, including:
         (a)   Detail of total system operating revenues and system expenses;
         (b)   Number of subscribers;
         (c)   Detail of assets and depreciation and amortization schedules;
      5.   A schedule of all rates and charges in effect and proposed; and
      6.   Other supporting facts as the Town requests.
      The data provided shall be certified as true and accurate by the
operator’s Chief Financial Officer. The financial statements and statistics
required shall cover the operator’s system in the Town of Danville. However, if
the system serving Danville is part of a larger cable television system, then
the franchise agreement shall specify those parts of the operator’s system for
which financial information shall be required.
   c.   Procedure. Upon receipt of the operator’s request for changes in
subscriber rates and charges for basic service, the Town shall schedule a
public hearing within thirty (30) days after receipt of all supporting
financial information. The Town shall finally act on the request within one
hundred twenty (120) days after the close of the public hearing. The Town and
operator may mutually agree in writing to extensions of the deadlines set forth
in order that the operator may prepare and provide additional data requested by
the Town. If the Town does not act within one hundred twenty (120) days, the
operator’s proposed amendment to the rates and charges becomes effective. To
the extent that a proposed amendment is disapproved, the Town shall within the
one hundred twenty (120) day period, or mutually agreed extensions, set forth
in writing its findings of facts. The Town, in arriving at its decision to
approve or disapprove the operator request, may consider relevant factors such
as the operator’s quality of service, comparable rates in similar systems, and
the operator’s performance in meeting franchise requirements.
      In setting subscriber rates and charges, the operator is entitled to
recover the reasonable cost of providing service, including a fair return on
the operator’s invested capital.
   d.   Converters. There may be no rental charge for the use of the initial
converter box to receive basic service. Operator may institute a rental charge
for additional converter boxes. The operator may require a security deposit for
a converter in an amount and under terms established by the franchise
agreement.
(Ord. #23-83, §1; Ord. #96, §1E)
17-4   DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.
   17-4.1   General.
   a.   Capability. The cable system shall comply with the specifications in
subsection
17-3.1 and the award agreement.
   b.   Intent. It is the intent of the Town to have cable services made
available to all residents of the Town wishing such services. It is understood
that the cable television system presently serving within the Town does not
fully satisfy the requirements of Sections 17-3 and 17-5 of this chapter.
Subject to the other provisions of this chapter and the award agreement, and
operator shall undertake to construct, or reconstruct, a system which will
fully satisfy the requirements of this chapter in accordance with this section.
   c.   Plant Installation and Extension.
      1.   A new or rebuilt cable system shall be constructed so that cable
services will be available to all structures now included in the existing cable
system.
      The operator shall, as part of the application requirements provided in
Section
17-11, set forth its intentions for extension of the plant to occupied areas of
the Town not served by the existing cable system, and such areas shall be
included in the construction timetable.
      2.   If the construction plans of a prospective operator exclude any
currently occupied area of the Town, the prospective operator shall set forth
the basis for the exclusion. Upon satisfactory showing of special circumstances
(such as low population density or geographical constraints, making it
technically or economically infeasible for the operator to install the cable
system plant in a given occupied area without reimbursement from the subscriber
(s) to be served for unusual costs of construction) the Town may waive the
requirement for mandatory installation of plant.
      3.   The operator shall extend residential and institutional service (the
latter as set forth in the award agreement) into every new subdivision. The
capacity to provide cable communications service shall be available to newly
constructed structures on the date of first occupancy. Actual installation of
service may be delayed up to sixty (60) days from first occupancy or until
after final grading, whichever is first. Those new areas having more dwelling
units per strand mile of plant than the number specified in the award agreement
shall receive residential service for the normal installation fee.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-4.2   System Interconnection.
   a.   Desirability. Interconnection with other cable television systems is
desirable for such purposes as:
      1.   Sharing educational programming throughout the San Ramon Valley
Unified School District;
      2.   Sharing educational and locally originated programming with other
cable systems in Contra Costa County;
      3.   Participating in opportunities to receive public interest,
information or educational services which may become available on a regional or
statewide basis.
   b.   Interconnection. The operator shall, upon the directive of the Town and
in conformance with the technical specifications set forth in the award
agreement interconnect its system with any or all other systems serving the
franchise area, and any other systems which can be interconnected with the
operator’s system. Any additional investment by the operator required to
achieve interconnection shall be considered by Town in connection with
subscriber rates.
      To the extent the technical requirements necessary to achieve
interconnection are known at time of system design, the cable system shall be
constructed so as to make interconnections feasible with a minimum of system
modification at the time such opportunities become available.
   c.   Cooperation. The operator shall cooperate with any interconnection
corporation, regional interconnection authority or County, State or Federal
regulatory agency which may be established for the purpose of regulating,
facilitating, financing, or otherwise providing for the interconnection of
cable television systems beyond the boundaries of Town’s jurisdiction.
   d.   Notice: City Approval. The operator shall provide continuing notice to
the Town of all interconnection opportunities as they become available on a
regional or local basis, including copies of correspondence from any entity
seeking interconnection with this system.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-4.3   Construction.
   a.   Permits. Within thirty (30) days after acceptance of the franchise, the
operator shall proceed with due diligence (and at its own expense) to obtain
all necessary permits and authorizations which are required in the conduct of
its business, including, but not limited to, certificate of compliance, utility
joint use attachment agreement, microwave carrier license, and other permit,
license and authorization to be granted by regulatory agencies having
jurisdiction over the operation of cable television systems or associated
microwave transmission facilities. Town shall process the operator applications
in an expeditious manner.
   b.   Commencement; Completion.
      1.   Commencement. Within ninety (90) days after obtaining necessary
permits, licenses and authorizations, including right of access to poles and
conduits, the operator shall begin construction or reconstruction and
installation of the system.
      2.   Completion. Except as expressly approved by the Town and specified
in the franchise and subject to delay by reason of act of God, force majeure,
riot, strike, or other condition beyond the operator’s control (written notice
of which shall be promptly given to the Town) the operator shall complete
construction or reconstruction of the entire system not later than twelve (12)
months after execution of the award agreement.
      System construction is considered complete upon installation of all
required facilities and marketing of all services to the entire franchise area,
(excepting those areas exempted from service under this chapter).
   c.   Undergrounding. The term “undergrounding” includes a partial
undergrounding of cable equipment. All plant and drops shall be underground in
the same areas and to the same extent as electric utility services. Upon
obtaining the Town’s written approval, amplifiers, taps, traps and other
appurtenances may be placed in appropriate housing above the ground. The
operator shall, at its own expense (unless the award agreement or other
ordinances and agreements provide for payment by others) install its plant in
the same trench, at the same time, as the electric utility, whether or not
there is a specific request from a potential subscriber for service. Upon
written approval of the Town, the operator may satisfy the requirement of this
subsection by placing conduit and other required appurtenances, without cable,
in the trench.
      With respect to a residential structure erected in the franchise area
after the effective date of this chapter, and notwithstanding the foregoing,
the owner or developer shall perform or cause to be performed or shall pay the
operator’s reasonable cost of all trenching necessary for the underground
installation of service, including furnishing of imported backfill material,
the furnishing and installation of substructures, conduit and pedestals in
accordance with the operator’s plans and specifications. Subject to Section
17-5, the operator shall provide, install and pay for all other of its plant in
the trench. The operator shall provide plans and specifications to the owner or
developer and shall inspect the facilities required and certify to the Town
prior to final approval of the development that the facilities required are
properly installed. The Town may review the maps and specifications provided by
the operator.
   d.   Maps and Layout. The operator shall maintain and permit the Town to
inspect up-to-date route maps of suitable scale showing all receiving pickup
locations and the location of amplifiers and trunk distribution lines. Lines to
individual outlets need not be shown. The scale of the maps shall be sufficient
to clearly show the required details and shall be at least one inch equals four
hundred (1" = 400') feet.
   e.   Construction Standards. The system shall be installed and maintained in
accordance with standard good engineering practices and shall conform when
applicable with the National Electric Code, Bureau of Standards Handbook No.
130, Rule for Overhead Line Construction (General Order No. 95) of the
California Public Utilities Commission, the California Administrative Code,
Title 24, Part 3, and all applicable codes.
      The operator shall utilize existing poles, conduits, and other facilities
whenever possible, and may not construct or install new, different, or
additional poles, conduits, or other facilities on public or private property
without written approval of the Town or private property owner in cases where
no easement exists.
   f.   Other Construction, etc. The operator at its expense shall protect,
support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove its property when, in the
Town’s opinion, this action if required by reason of traffic conditions, public
safety, street vacation, freeway or street construction, change of
establishment of street grade, change or installation of sewers, drains,
waterpipes, power line, signal or communication lines, transportation
facilities, tracks, or other types of structure or improvements by governmental
agencies (whether acting in a governmental or a proprietary capacity), or any
other structure or public improvement. However, if action taken under this
subsection is primarily for the benefit of a new commercial enterprise, then
the commercial enterprise shall reimburse the operator for its actual, direct,
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred. Action taken under this section is
not a taking of the operator’s property and the operator is not entitled to a
surcharge.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-4.4   Default.
   Upon the operator’s failure, refusal, or neglect to perform work or other
act required by law and complete it in, on, over, or under a street within the
time prescribed, the Town may have the work or other act completed and upon so
doing shall submit to the operator an itemized statement of the costs. The
operator shall within thirty (30) days after receipt of the statement, pay to
Town the amount stated. (Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-4.5   Removal of Facilities.
   a.   If:
      1.   The use of any part of the public cable system is discontinued for
any reason for a continuous period of seven (7) days without prior written
notice to and approval by the Town; or
      2.   A franchise is terminated, cancelled, or expires;
   then the operator shall remove its facilities and restore the affected areas
in accordance with subsection
17-6.7. The operator is not required to remove conduit from underground.
   b.   If cable facilities are installed in a street or other area without
complying with this chapter, the Town may require the removal or reconstruction
of those facilities.
   (Ord. #23-83, §1)
17-5   SERVICE TO INDIVIDUAL SUBSCRIBERS.
   17-5.1   Subscriber Connections; Rates and Charges.
   a.   General. Installation of service to subscribers shall be done in a
workmanlike manner and in conformance with all applicable requirements
including the codes of the Town of Danville and the California Public Utilities
Commission. Prior to installing service on, or over a subscriber’s property,
the operator shall advise the subscriber of the operator’s intended
installation plan. If the subscriber requests specialized installation work,
the operator may require that the subscriber’s request be in writing and may
charge the subscriber based on the operator’s time and materials cost in excess
of standard installation. Specialized installations for which additional
charges are required of the subscriber shall not be made by the operator unless
an estimate of installation charges is provided to and approved by the
subscriber in advance of the work being done.
   b.   Standard Installation: Primary Drop and Additional Outlets.
      1.   Primary Drop. The standard charge for connecting a subscriber’s
premises to the cable plant shall be as set forth in the franchise agreement
and as may be adjusted to reflect actual changes in the operator’s costs in
accordance with that agreement and this chapter. (See subsection
17-3.3).
         The operator shall install primary drops at the standard rate to each
subscriber currently capable of being connected to the existing cable system at
a standard rate.
      2.   Additional Outlets. The charge for installation of an outlet in
addition to the primary connection shall be as set forth in the award agreement
and as may be adjusted in accordance with the award agreement and this chapter.
         The operator shall install an additional outlet at a standard charge
unless special circumstances make the installation more costly than usual as
provided in paragraph c.
      3.   The operator shall make no charge to a subscriber already connected
to the existing cable system for a replacement connection necessitated by a
rebuilt or new cable system if the subscriber authorizes connection to the new
or rebuilt system at the time the cable plant is installed. A subscriber
requesting connection at a later date may be assessed the standard charge.
   c.   Special Installation Charges. The operator may assess an additional
charge for a special installation to or within a structure. A special
installation includes one (1) or more of the following:
      1.   There exist special conditions in the structure or the property upon
which it is located or the subscriber requests a drop which is substantially
different from what the operator would have done had there been no such
request;
      2.   The installation is remote (“remote drop”), the distance to
subscriber’s building being more than one hundred fifty (150’) feet from the
nearest street or the nearest point on the operator’s distribution plant,
whichever is closer;
      3.   The installation is in a low density area, in which case paragraph
d. also applies.
         For a special installation, the operator may assess a special charge,
limited to the actual cost of labor and materials in excess of a standard
installation. A subscriber’s liability is limited to the standard charge,
however, unless the operator has provided an itemized estimate and obtained the
subscriber’s prior written consent to the special charge.
   d.   Installation in Low Density Areas. If the Town waives the mandatory
installation requirement under Section
17-4 as to any currently occupied area of the Town, operator shall, during
construction or rebuilding, provide notice to each prospective subscriber in
any such exempted area of the opportunity to have the cable system installed in
that area upon payment of a special fee. If a prospective subscriber then
indicates a desire to be served, the operator shall provide a written estimate
of the fee to be charged for extending cable system plant to the area in
question. Any easements required for special installation shall be obtained by
the subscriber, or by the operator at the subscriber’s expense.
   Franchise granted by the Town shall include a specific line extension policy
to implement this subsection.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-5.2   Subscriber Complaints; Repair Services.
   a.   Local Office. The operator shall maintain an office within the
franchise area for receiving and resolving subscriber complaints and problems.
The office shall be open during normal business hours, not less than 9:00 a.m.
to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays, excluding legal holidays. The office shall have a
publicly listed telephone number, toll-free to all subscribers, and shall have
facilities to receive and respond to complaint calls twenty-four (24) hours per
day, seven (7) days a week. The Town Council may, by resolution, waive the
requirement of an office within the franchise area and provide instead for an
office within a reasonable one way driving distance of the franchise area upon
finding that the ability of the operator to respond is not adversely affected.
   b.   Prompt Repair Service. The operator shall provide efficient service,
make repairs promptly and shall limit system failures and malfunctions to the
minimum time duration possible by promptly investigating and acting upon
service complaints. When there is a loss of service to an individual or the
system, the operator shall restore its normal standard of service within
twenty-four (24) hours of receiving notice of the problem. The operator may
restore service by temporary means for up to seventy-two (72) hours. Time for
completion is not extended for holidays or weekends.
      The operator shall maintain a staff of technicians capable of responding
to a system malfunction within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt of notice or
complaint and may not charge a subscriber for repair of a system malfunction.
   c.   Service Interruptions. The operator may initiate a service interruption
only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. In case of scheduled
service interruption the operator shall make all reasonable efforts to minimize
inconvenience to the subscribers, including when possible, at least twenty-four
(24) hour advance notice of the interruption.
   d.   Information to Subscribers. The operator shall provide written
information to subscribers setting forth procedures for making an inquiry or
complaint. The information shall be provided at the time service is begun and
whenever requested. Such information shall include:
      1.   The name, address and toll-free telephone number of the operator’s
department responsible for subscriber complaints and requests for repairs;
      2.   The name, address and telephone number of the Town office or
representative that subscribers may contact if a complaint regarding service or
fees is not satisfactorily resolved by the operator.
      3.   The procedures by which a subscriber may request an adjustment in a
service charge for periods of impaired service, as set forth in paragraph e.
including the right to seek resolution of disputes from the Town
representative.
   e.   Reduction in Charges for Extended Interruptions. Each subscriber is
entitled to a pro-rata reduction of cable service charges if a system
malfunction or other interruption causes a:
      1.   Loss of service for twelve (12) consecutive hours; or
      2.   Repeated losses of service which total twelve (12) hours in a week.
      For each such loss of service a subscriber may deduct one-thirtieth (1/
30) of the monthly bill. If only part of the service is interrupted (for
example, loss to a secondary outlet or loss of an expanded tier of service),
the subscriber may only deduct for that part of the service which was impaired.
      If a service interruption exceeds twelve (12) consecutive hours or a
total of twelve (12) hours in a week, a subscriber may request an adjustment
other than that provided in this paragraph. The operator shall provide in its
rules and regulations for a procedure by which the subscriber may request and
receive a credit against its monthly charge for such an extended service
interruption.
      The period of interruption is the time elapsing between the operator’s
receipt of notice or complaint and restoration of service.
      If the subscriber and operator are unable to agree on a mutually
acceptable adjustment in charges, the subscriber and operator may jointly agree
to resolve the dispute by arbitration under subsection
17-7.4. If the subscriber and operator do not agree to arbitration, then either
party may direct the problem to the attention of the Town representative and
the procedure provided in subsection
17-7.3b. shall govern.
      The Town may suspend the provisions of this paragraph during period of
system reconstruction.
   f.   Record of Complaints, Interruptions, Malfunctions. The operator shall
maintain a record of every complaint, service interruption and system
malfunction. The record shall include the nature and location of each such
problem, the date and time notice or complaint was received, and its
disposition, including the time taken to respond and to complete repairs.
   These records shall remain available for inspection at the operator’s local
business office for at least three (3) years after any transaction re- corded
in them.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-5.3   Disconnection of Services.
   a.   Disconnection for Nonpayment. The operator may disconnect or
discontinue service to a subscriber for nonpayment of charges for services
rendered if: (1) the subscriber has received at least one (1) full month of
service without providing full payment; (2) the customer has not paid the
amount in dispute in escrow (subsection
17-7.3d.): and (3) the operator has given the following written notice:
      1.   An itemized statement of charges, sent at least ten (10) working
days before the date the bill is due; and
      2.   A statement to the subscriber of his right to deposit the amount in
dispute in escrow in order to avoid disconnection.
   b.   Manner of Disconnecting. Service disconnected under this subsection
shall be done by the operator in the most efficient practical manner.
   c.   No Charges. There shall be no charge for discontinuing service but the
operator may require, in addition to payment of any delinquent fees, a
reasonable fee for reconnection.
   (Ord. #23-83, §1)
17-6   FRANCHISE TERM; DURATION; TERMINATION; TRANSFER.
   17-6.1   Duration.
   No franchise granted by the Town under this chapter may be for a term in
excess of fifteen (15) years. (Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-6.2   Extension; Renewal.
   a.   Extension. The Town may extend a franchise for periods of up to five
(5) years at a time. Before the Town grants an extension, the operator shall
comply with the requirements set forth in paragraph c.
   b.   Renewal. If the operator applies for a renewal of the franchise, the
renewal application must be submitted not less than thirteen (13) months nor
more than two (2) years before the franchise expiration date. For a renewal,
any terms and conditions of the existing franchise may be renegotiated,
including provisions related to changes in technology and in community needs
and preferences. If the operator does not apply for a renewal or extension or
if renegotiations do not result in a mutually acceptable agreement, the
franchise terminates at the expiration of its term without further action by
the Town.
   c.   Information Required. In applying for renewal or extension of a
franchise, the operator shall comply with informational and procedural
requirements established by the Town. These requirements may include: (1)
providing a comprehensive system and services evaluation described in
subsection
17-7.1; (2) a survey of subscribers, conducted by the Town at the operator’s
expense; (3) consent for performance testing and technical evaluation conducted
by the Town or its representative, at the operator’s expense; (4) reimbursement
for other costs related to Town’s evaluation of the application, including
costs of professional consultants; and (5) other requirements which may be
established by the Town at the time a renewal or extension application is
submitted. The Town shall provide opportunity for community review and comment
including at least one (1) noticed public hearing before granting a renewal or
extension.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-6.3   Termination.
   a.   Grounds. If the operator fails or refuses to comply with a material
requirement of this chapter or the award agreement, the Town may declare the
franchise terminated or exercise its other remedies as provided in this
chapter. If a franchise is terminated, the operator shall immediately and
automatically surrender all rights granted by the franchise and the award
agreement.
      Grounds for termination under this subsection include:
      1.   Excessive or repeated failure to meet required standards of
construction, operation, technical performance of subscriber service in a
timely manner;
      2.   Failure to maintain the required liability and indemnification
coverages or the performance bond;
      3.   Frequent violation by the operator of an order or ruling from a
regulatory entity having jurisdiction over operator, excepting an order or
ruling being contested by the operator in judicial or administrative
proceedings.
      4.   Fraud or deceit;
      5.   Insolvency or bankruptcy;
      6.   Unauthorized transfer of the franchise or the cable television
system;
      7.   Willful, flagrant, and repeated violation of a franchise
requirement.
      If the operator is in material breach of the franchise, the Town shall
have the right, in addition to other rights it may have, to terminate the
franchise.
   b.   Procedure. Before invoking its rights under this subsection, the Town
shall make a written demand that the operator correct the violation or cure the
circumstances constituting the breach. If after (30) days the operator has not
complied or submitted sufficient evidence of its intent and ability to do so
within a reasonable period of time, the Town shall give the operator notice of
the matter to be heard and the time and place of hearing at least ten (10) days
before the hearing.
      At the termination hearing, the Council shall consider recommendations of
Town staff and comments from the operator and interested persons. The Council
shall then determine an appropriate course of action for enforcement or
termination of the franchise.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-6.4   Holding Over.
   If the operator holds over after termination or expiration of a franchise
without the prior consent of the Town expressed by a resolution, the operator
shall pay the franchise fee on the same basis as that existing before
expiration or termination, it being understood that acceptance of the franchise
fee payments by the Town is not a recognition by the Town of any right of the
operator to an extension or renewal of the franchise. The operator shall also
pay any applicable penalties.
   If the operator continues an unauthorized operation for ninety (90) days
after notice from the Town, the operator forfeits to the Town all its gross
revenues from the system for the balance of the period the unauthorized
operation continues. (Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-6.5   Transfer of Ownership.
   a.   Consent of Town Required. A franchise is a privilege to be held in
personal trust by the original operator. It may not be sold, transferred,
leased, assigned or otherwise disposed of, in whole or in part, either by
forced or involuntary sale, or by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or
other means, without the prior consent of Town and then only under such
conditions as the Town prescribes.
      1.   A transfer may be made only by an instrument in writing, such as a
bill of sale. A copy of the proposed instrument shall be filed with the Town at
the time the operator applies for Town consent to the transfer. If the transfer
is approved, a copy of the executed document shall be filed with the Town not
less than thirty (30) days after the transfer is executed.
      2.   The consent of the Town may not be unreasonably withheld. However,
the Town may first evaluate the proposed transferee as to financial
responsibility, ability to provide the required level and quality of service
and ability to assume the obligations of the franchise. The proposed transferee
shall comply with the informational and procedural requirements of the Town for
such evaluation including the submission of evidence documenting its financial
ability to satisfy the requirements of the franchise. The proposed transferee
shall reimburse the Town for the costs of the evaluation, including
professional assistance, in accordance with subsection 17-2.5c.
      3.   If the operator is a corporation, prior approval of the Town is
required when there is an actual change in control, or if ownership of twenty-
five (25%) percent or more of its voting stock is to be acquired by a person or
group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already own twenty-five (25%)
percent or more of the voting stock, singly or collectively.
         The consent of the Town is not required for transfer of the franchise
to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the operator. However, the Town shall continue
to regard the operator and its transferee as a single entity for all purposes.
      4.   The Town may not consent to the sale, transfer, lease or assignment
of a franchise until all required system construction is complete, and the
system is supplying the required level of service to all subscribers, unless
the Town finds that it is in the public interest to consent to such a transfer
in order for those requirements to be fulfilled.
      5.   Upon foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial part
of the system or upon the termination of a lease covering all or a substantial
part of the system, the operator shall notify the Town of the fact. The
notification shall be considered as notice that a change in control of the
operator has occurred. In this case the Town’s approval of the new owner of the
system must be obtained as herein required.
   b.   Receivership. The Town may cancel a franchise thirty (30) days or later
after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the
business of the operator, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy,
or other action or proceeding, unless the receivership or trusteeship is
vacated prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) days, or unless:
      1.   Within thirty (30) days after his election or appointment, the
receiver or trustee complies with this chapter and remedies all defaults; and
      2.   Such receiver or trustee, within thirty (30) days, executes an
agreement, approved by the court, whereby the receiver or trustee assumes and
agrees to be bound by this chapter and the franchise granted to the operator.
   c.   Express Assumption of Responsibility. A transferee shall expressly
assume all obligations of the operator and expressly agree to be bound by this
chapter and the award agreement and is required to sign the award agreement.
   d.   Failure to Comply. Failure to comply with the requirements of this
subsection is a material breach of this chapter, subject to the remedies
provided for herein.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-6.6   Continuity of Service.
   a.   Continuity of Service Mandatory. A subscriber is entitled to continue
receiving service so long as his financial and other obligations to the
operator are met. The operator shall not cease providing full subscriber
service before the expiration date set forth in an agreement, license, or
franchise in effect at the time this chapter is enacted or before the
expiration date set forth in an award agreement entered into under this
chapter, unless the Town authorizes cessation or terminates the franchise under
the provisions of subsection
17-6.3.
   b.   Changes in Operation. In the event of a change in operation (due to
such factors as modification of the system, acquisition, termination, or
expiration of the franchise), the operator shall in good faith make every
reasonable effort to ensure that service continues uninterrupted during the
transitional period accompanying a change.
   c.   Extended Service.
      1.   If the franchise expires or is terminated, the Town may require the
operator to continue operation and service for a period not to exceed one (1)
year. During the extension the Town may reduce the boundaries of the areas the
operator is required to serve by partial termination of the franchise,
effective upon at least thirty (30) days written notice to the operator. This
chapter applies during a period of extended service.
   d.   Cooperation with Successor. In the event of expiration of termination,
the operator shall cooperate in good faith with its successor in interest.
Cooperation required may include but is not limited to moving the operator’s
plant to temporary positions on telephone poles where necessary to enable
installation by successor without unnecessary pole make-ready costs. The
successor shall reimburse the incumbent operator for direct, actual and
verifiable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the operator in responding to
requests for cooperation.
   e.   Willful Cessation of Service. If the operator fails to provide
continuous service on all or part of its system, and Town establishes that the
failure is willful and without just cause, the Town may, upon service of notice
to the operator, assume operational control of the system. The Town may
continue its control until full service is restored under conditions acceptable
to the Town or a permanent alternate is found to operate the system. During the
period of Town control, revenues from portions of the system under Town control
become property of the Town.
      Willful cessation of service is a material breach of the franchise and a
ground for termination in accordance with the procedures in subsection
17-6.3. The Town may also impose monetary sanctions in accordance with this
chapter.
      If there are two (2) or more operators authorized to serve or serving the
same area and one (1) operator withdraws solely because of financial reasons
arising out of an inability to obtain or retain a sufficient share of the
market, this action alone is not a willful cessation of service within the
meaning of this subsection and does not subject the withdrawing operator to the
franchise violation remedies set forth in subsection
17-7.5, including monetary penalties. However, the operator remaining shall
continue to provide service as required by its award agreement and may not
charge a hook-up fee to a customer formerly served by the withdrawing operator.
This provision excusing certain acts from the definition of willful cessation
of service does not permit the withdrawal of the only operator then serving the
area.
(Ord. #23-83, §1; Ord. #38-84, §1)
   17-6.7   Disposition of Facilities.
   a.   General Requirements. If a franchise is terminated, cancelled or
expires, the Town may order the operator to promptly remove its facilities from
the Town within a specified period of time. After such removal, the operator
shall promptly restore the street and other areas from which property is
removed to its condition before the operator’s use. The operator is not
required to remove conduit from underground.
   b.   Restoration of Property. In removing its plant structures and equipment
the operator shall refill at its own expense each excavation made by it and
shall leave all public ways and places in as good condition as that prevailing
before the operator’s removal of its equipment and appliances without affecting
the electrical or telephone cable wires or attachments. The Town shall inspect
and approve the condition of the public ways and public places and cables,
wires, attachments and poles after removal. The liability, indemnity and
insurance and the performance bond shall continue in effect during the period
of removal and until full compliance by the operator with the terms and
conditions of this paragraph and this chapter.
   c.   Removal or Restoration by Town; Reimbursement of Costs. If the operator
fails to complete the work required by paragraph b. above or any other work
required by Town law or ordinance within the time provided and to satisfaction
of the Town, the Town may cause the work to be done and the operator shall
reimburse the Town for the cost within thirty (30) days after receipt of an
itemized list of the costs, or the Town may recover such costs through any
security fund or bond provided by the operator.
   d.   Abandonment of Property. The Town may, upon written application by the
operator, approve the abandonment of the operator’s property, in place, under
such terms and conditions as the Town prescribes. Upon abandonment of property
in place, the operator shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Town such
instruments as the Town prescribes transferring and conveying the ownership of
the property to Town.
   (Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-6.8   Prior Cable System.
   It is understood that the operator currently providing cable television
services to the Town is operating under authority of a license previously
granted by the County Board of Supervisors. This license expires in October,
1986. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as abridging the term of that
license, or as altering the rights and obligations of the parties under it,
absent the mutual consent of the present operator and the Town. However, if the
present operator enters into a new award agreement with the Town under this
chapter before the expiration date of the existing license, the prior license
and all rights and obligations of the parties under it terminate upon the
effective date of the new award agreement. (Ord. #23-83, §1)
17-7   REGULATION AND EVALUATION OF FRANCHISE.
   17-7.1   Performance Evaluation.
   a.   Evaluation of System and Services. The Town and operator shall
periodically hold a comprehensive evaluation session in accordance with
procedures set forth in this article. The purpose of this is to evaluate the
cable system and services, to provide for technological, economic and
regulatory changes occurring in the cable industry, to promote the maximum
degree of flexibility in the cable system, and to achieve a continuing,
advanced, modern system responsive to community needs and desires.
   b.   Frequency of Evaluation Sessions. The first evaluation session shall be
held on or about the third anniversary date of the award agreement unless
continued to a later date by the Town. Subsequent evaluation sessions shall be
held at the request of the Town. No more than one (1) session may be required
during any three (3) year period, unless required to consider a request for
renewal or extension of the franchise. A dispute arising between evaluation
sessions is subject to the dispute resolution procedure in subsection
17-7.3.
   c.   Report. The operator shall prepare a written report before the
evaluation session. At least one hundred twenty (120) days before the scheduled
session date, the Town shall provide the operator a list of the information to
be included in the report. Topics for the report may include the following:
      1.   A summary of system operations during the period since the franchise
award or the last report, including:
         (a)   Services changed or added;
         (b)   Rate changes for any services;
         (c)   Total number of subscribers each year and number of subscribers
added and discontinued in each year;
         (d)   Level of subscriber complaints and system malfunctions and
success in resolving them;
         (e)   Support and assistance provided to community service television
operations;
         (f)   Operational compliance with technical requirements;

provision of this chapter.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-7.4   Arbitration.
   a.   Arbitration of a matter subject to arbitration under this chapter shall

share equally the cost of the third arbitrator.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-7.5   Franchise Violations.
   a.   Remedies, Generally. If the operator violates provision of this chapter
or the award agreement, or fails to comply with a requirement in a timely
manner, the Town may do any of the following:

      2.   Require the operator to cure violations before increasing any rates
or charges to subscribers;
      3.   Terminate the franchise for cause, as set forth in subsection
17-5.3.
      The exercise of these remedies is not a waiver by the Town of any other
remedy it may have, including the right to recover for damages, losses, costs
and expenses, including attorney’s fees arising from a franchise violation.
This provision for recovery of damages is in addition to the Town’s right to
apply its remedies under Section
17-10.
   b.   Procedure. If the Town believes the operator has violated this chapter
or the award agreement, or an applicable Federal, State or local regulation,
the Town may make a written demand on the operator to correct the violation. If
the violation is not corrected within a reasonable time as set forth in the
demand, the Town shall consider the matter at a public hearing. The Town shall
serve the operator with written notice of the matter to be considered and the
time and place of the hearing at least ten (10) days before the scheduled date
of the hearing. At the time of the hearing the operator and any interested
persons shall be heard. The Council may determine at that or subsequent
meetings an appropriate course of action for enforcement or termination of the
franchise.
   c.   Immaterial Breach. In order to provide the Town with some remedy for
immaterial or minor breaches other than expensive and time consuming legal
actions, the Town may impose a fine on the operator for an immaterial breach of
the franchise.
      If, after a hearing as provided for in paragraph b. above, the Council
determines that the operator has violated a provision of this chapter or the
award agreement, it may impose a fine not to exceed the amounts set forth in
this paragraph. The actual amount of the fine shall be based upon the
significance of the violation, its impact on subscribers, its duration, whether
the violation was beyond the operator’s control, and other pertinent
circumstances.
      These penalties are in addition to any rate adjustments to which
subscribers may be entitled.
      1.   Construction Violations. For failure to meet construction
requirements, to perform construction work within the required time periods, or
to begin service to subscribers in a timely manner, the Town may impose a fine
of up to five hundred ($500.00) dollars a day, or up to two thousand
($2,000.00) dollars a day for construction delays exceeding six (6) months.
      2.   Performance Violations. For failure to meet standards of service,
maintenance, operation or administration, or for failure to do so in a timely
manner, the Town may impose a fine of up to two hundred fifty ($250.00) dollars
per business day. Violations subject to this provision include, but are not
limited to: failure to provide required services; failure to provide timely
repairs; service interruptions without just cause; unauthorized disconnection
of subscribers; failure to give required notice or to maintain and permit
inspection of records as required; violations of technical standards, including
required signal carriage; and failure to comply with any regulatory
requirements, including payment of sums owed to the Town.
   d.   Material Breach. The quality and quantity of immaterial breaches in and
of themselves may amount to a material breach, in which event the franchise may
be terminated.
   e.   Payment of Fine. Town shall give the operator written notice of a fine
assessed under subsection
17-7.5c. and the operator shall pay the fine within thirty (30) days after
receipt of notice, or, if the operator requests arbitration under subsection

in favor of Town.
      If the operator does not pay a fine within the required thirty (30) days,
interest on amount of fine accrues monthly at the rate of one (1%) percent per
month. If the Town brings suit to enforce the payment of a fine and prevails,
the operator shall pay attorney’s fees and costs in addition to the fine and
interest thereon.

times with Federal, State and local laws and regulations, end executive and
administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination. (Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-9.2   Privacy.
   The monitoring of any subscriber terminal without specific written
authorization from the subscriber is prohibited. The operator is responsible
for protecting subscriber privacy and for prohibiting the tapping and/or
monitoring of cable, line, signal input device, or subscriber outlet or
receiver for any purpose, except the operator may conduct tests of the
functioning of the system where necessary in order to ensure proper maintenance
of the system and to collect performance data for agencies regulating the

maintain during the term of the franchise, an acceptable corporate surety bond,
irrevocable letter of credit drawn in the Town’s name, or other adequate surety
agreement (security) in the amount of fifty thousand ($50,000.00) dollars. The
security shall be conditioned so that in the event the operator fails to comply
with any provision of the franchise, there will be recoverable jointly and
severally from the principal and surety any damages, loss or costs suffered or
incurred by the Town as a result thereof, including attorney’s fees and costs
of any action or proceeding, and including the full amount of any compensation,
indemnification, or costs of removal or abandonment, of property as prescribed
elsewhere in this chapter or other costs which may be in default, up to the
full amount of the bond, letter of credit or other surety agreement. The
condition shall be a continuing obligation during the term of the franchise and
thereafter until the operator satisfies all obligations to the Town which
pertain to the franchise. Neither this subsection nor the security accepted by
the Town, nor damages recovered by the Town under the security excuses faithful
performance by the operator or limits the operator’s liability for damages.
   If at any time during the term of the franchise, the condition of the
corporate surety changes in such a manner as to render the bond, letter of
credit or other surety agreement unsatisfactory to the Town, the operator shall
replace it with other security of like amount and similarly conditioned,issued
by a corporate surety satisfactory to the Town. The Council may authorize or
require appropriate adjustments in the amount of the security required under
this subsection. (Ord. #23-83, §1)

liabilities of the Town with respect to its employees), of every kind and
nature whatsoever, including but not limited to damages for injury or death or
damage to person or property, due to the act or failure to act of the operator,
its employees or agents and regardless of the merit of any of the same,
including attorneys fees, accountant fees, expert witness or consultant fees,
court costs, per diem expense, traveling and transportation, or other costs or
expense arising out of or pertaining to the exercise or the enjoyment of any

pertaining to the act or failure to act of the operator, its employees or
agents.
   b.   The operator shall pay and satisfy every judgment, decree, order,
directive, or demand made or issued against the operator, Town, it officers,
boards, commissions, agents or employees when it is directly attributable to
the acts or failure to act of the operator, its employee or agents. Such
indemnity shall exist and continue without reference to or limitation by the
amount of any bond, policy of insurance, deposit, undertaking or other
assurance required under this chapter. However, neither the operator nor the
Town shall enter into any compromise or settlement of a claim, demand, cause of
action, suit, or other proceeding, without first obtaining the written consent
of the other, which shall not unreasonably be withheld.

person in an amount not less than one million ($1,000,000.00) dollars on
account of any one (1) occurrence, and property damages liability insurance in
an amount not less than one hundred thousand ($100,000.00) dollars resulting
from any one (1) occurrence. The Town shall be named as an insured in each
insurance policy. Where insurance is provided by a policy which also covers the
operator or another entity or person, it shall contain the standard cross-
liability endorsement. By regulation the Town may reasonably increase the
required face amounts of insurance as to any then-existing franchise.
   b.   Certificates evidencing insurance coverage shall be filed with the Town
at the beginning of the franchise term. Each certificate shall provide that the
insurance coverage will not be cancelled, reduced or changed without at least
thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Town. At least thirty (30) days

coverage is renewed shall be filed with Town. If the operator fails to obtain
or keep insurance in force, the Town may (but shall not be required to) obtain
insurance in which event the operator shall promptly reimburse the Town its
premium cost plus ten (10%) percent interest until paid.

insured account as security for the operator’s: (1) faithful performance of the
requirements of the franchise; (2) compliance with all orders, permits and
direction of the Town; (3) payment of any claims, liens, payments and taxes due
the Town.
    The security fund, if required, shall operate as follows:
   a.   Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of the franchise, the
operator shall deposit into an insured account, established by the Town, and
maintain on deposit throughout the term of the franchise, an amount of dollars
as set forth in the award agreement, for the purpose set forth in the first
paragraph of this subsection. The operator may earn interest on funds deposited
in the security fund.
      The Town may withdraw money from the security fund, including interest
and penalties due, if any of the following occurs:
      1.   After ten (10) days notice, the operator fails to pay to Town:
         (a)   Taxes or payments due and unpaid; or
         (b)   Damages, costs or expenses which the Town has incurred because
of the operator’s default.
      2.   After thirty (30) days notice, the operator fails to comply with a
provision of the franchise which the Town determines can be remedied by an
expenditure from the security fund. The Town shall notify the operator of the
amount and date of withdrawal.
   c.   Within thirty (30) days after notice that an amount has been withdrawn
by the Town from the security fund under this subsection, the operator shall
deposit a sum of money sufficient to restore the security fund to the original
amount.
   d.   The security fund established under this subsection shall become the
property of the Town if the franchise is cancelled because of the default of
the operator or revoked for cause. The operator is entitled to the return of
the balance of the fund at the end of the franchise term or at the earlier
termination if there is then no outstanding obligation.
   e.   Upon the operator’s successful completion of system construction, the
Town may reduce the security fund to a lesser amount and refund the difference
to the operator.
   f.   The rights reserved to the Town with respect to the security fund are
in addition to all other rights and remedies of the Town under the franchise.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)

   Upon filing of the acceptance under Section
17-11, the operator shall file with the Town and shall thereafter, during the

operator, obtain such insurance at the operator’s expense or terminate the
franchise as provided in subsection
17-10.7. (Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-10.7   Breach.
   The operator’s willful failure to provide and keep in force a bond, security
agreement or policy of insurance required under this chapter is, at the Town’s
election, a material breach of the franchise. (Ord. #23-83, §1)

FCC on the date this chapter takes effect;
      4.   A copy of the form of agreement, undertaking or other instrument
proposed to be entered into between the applicant and each subscriber;
      5.   A detailed statement setting forth in its entirety each agreement
and undertaking whether formal or informal, written, oral or implied, existing
or proposed to exist between applicant and any person which materially relates
or pertains to or depends upon the application and the granting of the
franchise;

unencumbered resources to provide that portion of the capital, if any, that is
to be financed by the operator’s own resources.
   f.   Any other detail, statement, information or reference pertinent to the
subject matter of the application which is required or requested by Town.
(Ord. #23-83, §1; Ord. #96, §1E)
   17-11.2   Application Fee.
   a.   The applicant for a franchise shall pay to the Town as an application
fee an amount equal to all costs (the “application cost”) actually incurred by
the Town in: obtaining professional advice and assistance; examining its needs
and interests and in formulating a policy which takes into account present and
prospective developments in cable television technology; drafting and
negotiating this chapter and franchises which will properly respond to those
needs and interests and, at the same time, take into consideration FCC rules
and regulations, economic and fiscal realities, cable technology and
availability of present and prospective services.
   b.   The applicant shall pay two thousand five hundred ($2,500.00) dollars
to the Town at the time and application if filed. This sum is not returnable.
The amount payable under paragraph a. shall be reduced, for each person awarded
a franchise by the two thousand five hundred ($2,500.00) dollars payment made
under this subsection. The balance for each system shall be paid in annual
installments until paid in full at the time of payment of the franchise fee
specified in subsection
17-2.4.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-11.3   Solicitation; Report; Criteria.
   a.   Solicitation. The Town may solicit applications for cable television
system franchises and may determine and fix the date upon which applications
must be received by the Town. The Town may make any other determinations and
specify any other times, terms, conditions or limitations respecting the
soliciting, calling for, making and receiving of applications.
   b.   Report. Upon receipt of an application for a franchise, Town shall
refer it to a designated representative who shall prepare a report and make a
recommendation respecting the application to the Town within ninety (90) days
after referral.
   c.   Criteria. In making a determination as to an application the Town may
consider the quality of the service proposed, rates to subscribers, income to
the Town, experience, character, back- ground, and financial responsibility of
the applicant and its management and owners, technical and performance quality
of equipment, willingness and ability to meet construction and physical
requirements, and any other considerations considered pertinent by Town
safeguarding the interest of the Town and the public. The Town may award a
franchise on the basis of these considerations and without competitive bidding.
(Ord, #23-83, §1)
   17-11.4   Procedure.
   a.   If after a public hearing the Town decides to reject an application,
rejection shall be by resolution and is final and conclusive.
   b.   If the Town decides to consider granting a franchise to an applicant it
shall:
      1.   Determine tentative terms and conditions of the franchise;
      2.   Adopt resolution of intention to consider the grant of a franchise.
The resolution shall give notice of receipt of the application, state the name
(s) of the proposed operator(s), describe the character of the franchise
desired, state conditions upon which the franchise may be obtained, set a time
and place when and where interested persons may inspect the applications, and
state a day, hour, and place when and where persons having an interest in or
objection to the grant of the franchise may file written protests and appear
before Town and be heard. The resolution shall be published at least once at
least ten (10) days before the hearing date.
      3.   Conduct a hearing at the time specified and proceed to hear and
consider all written and oral protests;
      4.   Make one (1) of the following determinations:
         (a)   Deny the franchise;
         (b)   Grant the franchise upon the terms and conditions specified in
the Town’s resolution of intentions;
         (c)   Grant the franchise upon other terms and conditions which the
Council deems appropriate.
   c.   If Town denies the franchise, denial shall be expressed by resolution.
If Town grants the franchise, the grant shall be expressed by ordinance
granting a franchise to the applicant. The action of the Town is final and
conclusive.
   d.   The operator, within thirty (30) days of receipt of written
notification by the Town following franchise award (upon initial franchise
award and any renewal thereof) shall reimburse Town for all expenses incurred
under this chapter in making the franchise award or renewal beyond those
defrayed by application fees. The Town shall furnish the operator a statement
of such expenses with the notification.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-11.5   Persons Included.
   This section applies to every person seeking a cable franchise in the Town,
including a person presently operating a system in the Town under an existing
license or franchise. (Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-11.6   Acceptance of the Franchise.
   a.   Filing Acceptance; Deadline. A franchise becomes effective when the
operator files written acceptance with the Town. Written acceptance shall be in
the form and substance approved by the Town. Written acceptance operates as an
acceptance of each and every term and condition and limitation contained in
this chapter and in the award agreement.
      Operator shall file written acceptance not later than 12:01 p.m. of the
fifteenth day next following the effective date of the ordinance granting the
franchise.
   b.   Failure to Accept. The operator’s failure to file written acceptance is
a rejection of the franchise. Thereafter, the Town may not receive the
operator’s acceptance. The operator has no right, remedy or redress unless the
Town, by resolution, determines that late acceptance may be received and filed,
and then upon such terms and conditions as the Town imposes.
   c.   City Rights. Every right and remedy which is available to the Town
continuously exists in and to Town and may not be modified, abridged, altered,
restricted or impaired.
   d.   In Lieu of Other Rights. A franchise granted and accepted is in lieu of
every other right, privilege, power, immunity, and authority exercisable by the
operator, pertaining to the construction, operation, or maintenance of a cable
television system in the Town.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
17-12   MISCELLANEOUS.
   17-12.1   Notices.
   A notice to the Town and reports to be filed with the Town shall be sent to
the Town Manager. A notice to the operator shall be sent to the address
provided by him. (Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-12.2   Severability.
   a.   If a provision of this chapter is superseded by a Federal, State, or
other statute, law or regulation, or is held invalid, all other provisions
remain valid, binding and enforceable. The Town declares that it would have
enacted this chapter and each section, subsection, subparagraph, sentence,
clause, and phrase irrespective of the fact that one (1) or more section,
subsection, subparagraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared invalid.
The invalidity of a portion of this chapter does not abate, reduce or otherwise
affect the consideration or other obligation required of the operator.
   b.   If a provision of this chapter determined by the Town as a material
provision is held invalid or declared preempted by Federal or State regulation
or law, the Town shall negotiate with the operator appropriate modifications to
the franchise to provide reasonable relief from the invalidity or preemption.
If the parties are unable to reach agreement on modifications, the dispute
shall be submitted to arbitration under subsection
17-7.4. The arbitrators’ decision is binding on the parties, provided that no
decision of the arbitrator may require the Town or operator to violate a
Federal or State law or regulation.
   c.   This chapter and its intended amendments and supplements are enacted
upon the belief and premise that it does not conflict with any applicable law
or regulation, including FCC regulations. If there is or becomes an
inconsistency between any such law or regulation and this chapter, the law or
regulation controls to the extent of such inconsistency.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-12.3   FCC or PUC Jurisdiction: Preemption.
   If the FCC, PUC or other Federal or State body exercises paramount
jurisdiction over the subject matter of a franchise granted under this chapter,
then to the extent that jurisdiction preempts or precludes the exercise of
jurisdiction by the Town, the jurisdiction of the Town ceases.
   The preemption or preclusion of the exercise by the Town of its police power
does not alter or affect any contractual benefit to the Town or operator nor
any contractual obligation of the operator under a franchise issued by Town.
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-12.4   Notice to New Subscribers.
   Before the operator provides cable television service to a subscriber, the
operator shall provide a written notice to the subscriber substantially as
follows:
   “The subscriber is hereby notified that in providing television service the
cable operator is making use of public rights-of-way and that the continued use
of such rights-of-way is in no way guaranteed. If the continued use of such
rights-of-way is denied to the operator for any reason, the operator will make
every reasonable effort to provide service over alternate routes. By accepting
cable television service, subscriber agrees he will make no claim nor undertake
any action against the Town, its officers, commissions or employees if the
service provided is interrupted or discontinued.
   If a dispute between the subscriber and the operator regarding service or
billing problems remains unresolved, the Town has specified procedures for
resolving the dispute (subsections 17-7.3 and 17-7.4). Information concerning
these procedures may be obtained by contacting (name, location and telephone
number of the operator’s office).”
(Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-12.5   No Value of Franchise.
   A court of public or private authority may not attribute value to a
franchise in a proceeding to which Town is a party or by which Town is
affected. (Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-12.6   Most Favored Nation.
   If the operator also holds or is granted a franchise (“outside franchise”)
for a cable television system serving an area (“outside area”) outside the Town
and the cable system serving the outside area is (for operating purposes)
essentially the same system which serves the Town, whether or not the outside
area is served by a separate headend, then the operator shall promptly advise
the Town and shall furnish the Town with a copy of the franchise and all
amendments to it. The Town may (after public hearing with notice and procedure
similar to that followed in awarding a franchise) amend by ordinance a
franchise to include those provisions of the outside franchise as Town elects.
However if a provision proposed to be included directly and substantially
affects the operator’s revenues from or cost of operating in the outside area,
then the provision may be included in the franchise only to the extent that the
corresponding operating circumstances in this franchise area are substantially
comparable.
   If the operator disagrees with a decision by the Town to amend a franchise
under this section, he may require that the matter be settled by arbitration as
provided in subsection
17-7.4. (Ord. #23-83, §1)
   17-12.7   Violations by Persons Other Than Operator.
   a.   Use of Public Streets. It is unlawful for a person to construct,
install, or maintain within a public street in the franchise area, or within
any other public property of the Town, or within a privately owned area within
the Town which has not yet become a public street but is designated as a
proposed public street on a tentative subdivision map approved by the Town, any
equipment or facilities for distributing a television or radio signal through a
cable system, unless a franchise or license under this chapter is in effect.
   b.   Unauthorized Connection to Cable Systems. It is unlawful for a person
to make or use an unauthorized connection, whether physically, electrically,
acoustically, inductively, or otherwise, with a part of a franchised cable
system within the Town for the purpose of enabling himself or others to receive
or use a television signal, radio signal, picture, program or sound, without
payment to the owner of the system.
   c.   Tampering with Facilities. It is unlawful for a person, without the
consent of the owner, to willfully tamper with, remove or damage a cable, wire
or equipment used for distribution of a television signal, radio signal,
picture, program or sound.
   (Ord. #23-83, §1)
17-13—17-15      RESERVED.
ARTICLE II
CABLE TELEVISION RATES
17-16   RATES.
   17-16.1   Initial Review of Basic Cable Rates.
   a.   Upon the adoption of this section, the Town shall immediately notify
all cable operators in the Town by certified mail, return receipt requested,
that the Town intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic
service tier and associated equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992.
   b.   Within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the Town, a cable
operator shall file with the Town, its current rates for the basic service tier
and associated equipment and any supporting material concerning the
reasonableness of its rates.
   c.    1.   If the Town is able to expeditiously determine that the cable
operator’s rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within
the FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark,
the Town Council shall:
         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         (b)   Act to approve the rates within thirty (30) days from the date
the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the Town.
      2.   If the Town Council takes no action within thirty (30) days from the
date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the Town, the proposed
rates will continue in effect.
   d.    1.   If the Town is unable to determine whether the rates at issue are
within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or
if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the Town Council
shall, within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its basic
cable rates with the Town, and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the
following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final
determination:
         (a)   Ninety (90) days if the Town needs more time to ensure that a
rate is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard; and
         (b)   One hundred fifty (150) days if the cable operator has submitted
a cost-of-service showing, seeking to justify a rate above the applicable
benchmark.
      2.   If the Town Council has not made a decision within the ninety (90)
or one hundred fifty (150) day period, the Town Council shall issue a brief
written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep
accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on
whose behalf the amounts are paid.
   e.   During the extended review period and before taking action on the
proposed rate, the Town Council shall hold at least one (1) public hearing at
which interested persons may express their views and record objections.
   f.   An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed
initial basic rate may request the City Clerk to record the objection during
the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before the
decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part of
the record, the objector must provide the City Clerk with the objector’s name
and address.
   g.   If a cable operator submits its current basic cable rate schedule as
being in compliance with the FCC’s reasonable rate standard, the Town Council
shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in accordance with the
standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the Town Council’s findings, the
initial basic cable rates shall be established as follows:
      1.   If the current basic cable rates do not exceed the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the future increases will
be made in accordance with FCC rules.
      2.   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operators per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by ten (10%) percent, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for
inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September
30, 1992 and the initial date of regulation.
      3.   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the cable
operator’s per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the
initial basic cable rates shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation and
the number of channels added to the basic service tier.
   h.   If a cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted
level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-
service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic cable service rate
above the FCC’s reasonable rate standard. The Town Council will review a cost-
of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for the cost-of-service review.
The Town Council may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if
the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service
determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the cable
operator’s September 30, 1992 rates minus ten (10%) percent, will prescribe the
cable operator’s new rates.
   i.    1.   Formal Resolution. After completion of its review of the cable
operator’s proposed rates, the Town Council shall adopt its decision by formal
resolution. The decision shall include one of the following:
         (a)   If the proposal is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the Town Council shall approve the
initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or
         (b)   If the proposal is not within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard
and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
the Town Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the
FCC’s reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service
analysis.
      2.   Rollbacks and Refunds. If the Town Council determines that the
initial basic cable rates are submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or
that the cable operator’s cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the
Town Council shall give the cable operator prompt written notice of its
determination. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of this notice, the cable
operator may request reconsideration or modification. Upon receipt of a request
for reconsideration or modification, the Town Council will, within thirty (30)
days, hold a hearing at which the cable operator is given an opportunity to be
heard. If, after such hearing, the Town Council determines either that its
original determination shall stand, or to modify its original determination
while still finding that the initial basic cable rates exceed the reasonable
rate standard or that the cost of service showing justifies lower rates, the
Town Council may order the rates reduced in accordance with paragraph g. or h.
above, as applicable. In addition, the Town Council may order the cable
operator to pay to subscribers, refunds of the excessive portion of the rates
with interest (computed as applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue
Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September
1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the Town Council’s decision
resolution.
      3.   Statement of Reasons for Decision for Public Notice. If rates
proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there
were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution
must state the reasons for the decision and the Town Council must give public
notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in a
newspaper of general circulation printed and published in the County of Contra
Costa and distributed in the Town of Danville.
   j.   The Town Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic service tier
or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with
applicable Federal regulations
(Ord. #94-17, §2)
   17-16.2   Review of Request for Increase in Basic Cable Rates.
   a.   A cable operator who wishes to increase the rates for the basic service
tier or associated equipment shall file a request with the Town and notify all
subscribers at least thirty (30) days before the cable operator desires the
increase to take effect. Any increase taken by the cable operator shall be in
accordance with FCC policy.
   b.    1.   If the Town Council is able to expeditiously determine that the
cable operator’s rate increase request for basic cable service is within the
FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, the
Town Council shall:
         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         (b)   Act to approve the rate increase within fifteen (15) days from
the date the cable operator filed its request with the Town.
      2.   If the Town Council takes no action within thirty (30) days from the
date the cable operator filed its request with the Town, the proposed rates
will go into effect.
   c.    1.   If the Town Council is unable to determine whether the rate
increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the Town
Council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following
additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         (a)   Ninety (90) days if the Town Council needs more time to ensure
that the requested increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard as
determined by the applicable price cap; and
         (b)   One hundred fifty (150) days if the cable operator has submitted
a cost-of-service showing, seeking to justify a rate increase above the
applicable price cap.
      2.   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review
period.
      3.   If the Town Council has not made a decision within a ninety (90) or
one hundred fifty (150) day period, the Town Council shall issue a brief
written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep
accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate
increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.
   d.   During the extended review period and before taking action on the
requested rate increase, the Town Council shall hold at least one (1) public
hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   e.   An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed
rate increase may request the City Clerk to record the objection during the
public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before the
decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part of
the record, the objector must provide the City Clerk with the objector’s name
and address.
   f.   If the Town Council is unable to make a final determination concerning
a requested rate increase within the extended time period, the cable operator
may put the increase into effect, subject to subsequent refund if the Town
Council later issues a decision disapproving any portion of the increase.
   g.   If a cable operator presents its request for a rate increase as being
in compliance with the FCC’s price cap, the Town Council shall review the rate
using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by
the FCC. Based on the Town Council’s findings, the basic cable rates shall be
established as follows:
      1.   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      2.   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, the Town Council shall disapprove the proposed rate
increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   h.   If a cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to
justify a rate increase above the price cap, the Town Council will review the
submission pursuant to the FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The Town
Council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the cable operator
makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting
in a rate below the price cap or below the cable operator’s then current rate
will prescribe the cable operator’s new rate.
   i.   The Town Council’s decision concerning the requested rate increase,
shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable
operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by
other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the
reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a
person requesting the City Clerk to record the objection or may be submitted in
writing at anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.
      1.   The Town Council may order refunds consistent with sub- section 17-
16.1i.2 of subscribers’ rate payments with interest if:
         (a)   The Town Council was unable to make a decision within the
extended time period as described in paragraph c. above; and
         (b)   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         (c)   The Town Council determines that the rate increase as submitted
exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify
the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the Town Council
disapproves any portion of the rate increase; and
         (d)   The Town Council shall initiate an order as outlined in CFR
76.933(c).
      2.   The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the Town Council’s decision
resolution.
   k.   The Town Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic service tier
or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with
applicable federal regulations.
(Ord. #94-17, §2)
   17-16.3   Cable Operator Information.
   a.    1.   In accordance with CFR 76.938, a franchising authority may
require the production of proprietary information to make a rate determination
in those cases where cable operators have submitted initial rates, or have
proposed rate increases, pursuant to an FCC Form 393 (and/or FCC Forms 1200/
1205) filing or a cost-of-service showing. The franchising authority shall
state a justification for each item of information requested and, where related
to an FCC Form 393 (and/or FCC Forms 1200/1225) filing, indicate the question
or section of the form to which the request specifically relates. Upon request
to the franchising authority, the parties to a rate proceeding shall have
access to such information, subject to the franchising authority’s procedures
governing nondisclosure by the parties. Public access to such proprietary
information shall be governed by applicable State or local law.
      2.   In case where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable
rate standard, the Town Council may request additional information only in
order to document that the cable operator’s rates are in accord with the
standard.
   b.    1.   A cable operator submitting information to the Town Council may
request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for
public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and over all of
the information and all copies of the information to which it applies.
      2.   If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be
physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply.
If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request
applies shall be identified.
      3.   Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for
withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons
are based.
      4.   Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this
subsection, shall not be considered.
   c.   Requests which comply with the requirements of paragraph b. above, will
be acted upon by the Town Council. The Town Council will grant the request if
the cable operator presents by a preponderance of the evidence, a case for
nondisclosure consistent with applicable Federal regulations. If the request is
granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the information
withheld from public inspection. If the request does not present a case for
nondisclosure and the Town Council denies the request, the Town Council shall
take one of the following actions:
      1.   If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any
direction from the Town, the cable operator may request that the City return
the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the Town will comply with
this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so
requires, will the information be made available for public inspection.
      2.   If the information was required to be submitted by the Town Council,
the information will be made available for public inspection.
   d.   If the Town Council denies the request for confidentiality, the cable
operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC or a court of competent
jurisdiction within five (5) working days of the Town Council’s decision, and
the release of the information will be stayed pending review.
(Ord. #94-17, §2)
   17-16.4   Automatic Rate Adjustments.
   a.   In accordance with FCC regulations, the cable operator may adjust its
base per channel rate for the basic service tier annually by the final GNP-PI
(Gross National Product fixed weight price index).
   b.    1.   The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its
rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost
factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceed the
GNP-I (Gross National Product-index). These factors include retransmission
consent fees, programming costs, state and local taxes applicable to the
provision of cable television service, and costs of franchise requirements.
      2.   For all categories of external costs other than retransmission
consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external
costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the

19-1   INTRODUCTION.
   19-1.1   Title.
   The title of this chapter is “Grading” and shall be known as The Grading
Ordinance. (Ord. #89-22, §92-8.01)
   19-1.2   Purpose and Intent.
   a.   The purpose of this chapter is to establish controls on the earthwork
permitted by the Town in the course of, or in conjunction with, construction.
The controls are established for reasons of aesthetics, sound soil engineering
practice, erosion control, water quality protection and environmental
sensitivity.
   b.   It is the intent of the Town to limit grading operations and to ensure
that the public health, safety and welfare are maintained.
   c.   Nothing in this chapter voids the provisions of Chapter 70 of the
Uniform Building Code as adopted by the Town. In the case of a conflict between
this chapter and the Uniform Building Code, the more restrictive document will
prevail.
   d.   The provisions of this grading ordinance are not intended to prevent
the use of any material or method of construction not specifically prescribed
by the grading code provided any such alternate has been approved under this
title. The Town Engineer may approve any such alternate up to the time of the
certification of the building pad if he finds that the proposed design is
satisfactory and complies with the provisions of the grading code; and that the
material, method or work offered is, for the purpose intended, at least the
equivalent of that prescribed in quality, strength, effectiveness and safety.
   e.   It is not the intent of this chapter to preclude projects with previous
tentative map or grading plan approvals from continuing with the projects as
designed prior to adoption of this chapter. Grading plans submitted for review
and approval before adoption of this chapter are not subject to the conditions
of this chapter.
(Ord. #89-22, §92-8.02)
   19-1.3   General Definitions.
   In this chapter, the following definitions apply unless otherwise stated:
   As graded shall mean the surface conditions existing on completion of
grading.
   Bedrock shall mean in-place solid rock.
   Bench shall mean a relatively level step excavated into earth material as
part of a manufactured slope.
   Berm shall mean earth mounding placed in such a manner as to screen or
visually separate one area from another. A berm typically refers to earth
placed at the fine grade phase of a development which is landscaped at project
completion.
   Borrow shall mean earth material acquired from an off-site location for use
in grading on a site.
   Certification shall mean a written engineering or geological professional
opinion concerning the progress and completion of the work in accordance with
approved plans. It is not a guarantee of the design or future performance of
the earthwork.
   Chief Building Official (CBO) shall mean the individual charged with the
ultimate authority to enforce the Building Regulations (Danville Municipal Code
Chapter X). The Chief Building Official has the authority to enforce this
chapter from pad certification through project completion. Additionally,
projects not requiring pad certification and projects requiring less than 5,000
cubic yards of earth to be moved may be administrated by the Chief Building
Official.
   Civil engineer means a professional engineer in the branch of civil
engineering holding a valid certificate of registration issued by the State of
California.
   Clearing and grubbing shall mean and refer to the removal of items such as,
but not limited to, debris, grasses, weeds, scrub brush, etc. from a site in
preparation for grading of a site.
   Compaction shall mean the artificial densification of soil by various means.
   Cut shall mean the removal of existing earth material to achieve a specific
engineered grade. See also “Excavation”.
   Drip line shall mean a line extending around a tree directly underneath the
outermost branches of the tree.
   Earth material shall mean any rock, natural soil or fill, and/or any
combination thereof.
   Engineering geologist shall mean a professional geologist in the branch of
engineering geology holding a valid certificate of registration as an

movement of wind, water, and/or ice.
   Erosion-control specialist shall mean a professional civil engineer,
landscape architect or other licensed professional person experienced in
erosion-control work, retained by the developer in a professional or
consultative capacity (not as a contractor performing construction work in the
development), and responsible for analysis, plans, specifications, supervision
and certifications regarding slope-control planting and related slope control
work, other than grading, for a specific project.
   Excavation shall mean any earth, sand, gravel or similar material which is
cut into, dug, quarried, removed, displaced, relocated or bulldozed by either
manual or mechanical means and the conditions resulting therefrom.
   Fill shall mean a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   Grade shall mean the vertical elevation of the ground surface.
   a.   Existing grade shall mean the grade prior to the start of work
encompassed by a specific plan or permit.

   Grading shall mean any excavating or filling, or combination thereof.
   a.   Limited grading shall mean the movement of earth for small projects
such as individual building foundations, driveways, local roadways, utility
excavations, etc. Limited grading generally refers to the movement of less than
fifty (50) cubic yards of material.
   b.   Mass grading shall mean the movement or redistribution of large
quantities of earth over large areas. Disruption of the majority of the on-site
surface terrain is common. Unless sensitively completed, modifications or
elimination of major and minor natural landforms may result.
   c.   Contour grading shall mean the movement of earth in such a manner that
the final landform has a natural round appearance. This is accomplished by
blending finish contours with the adjacent natural terrain to achieve a
consistent grade; and by avoiding flat two (2) dimensional or angular surfaces.
Contour grading techniques may be applied to both limited and mass grading
projects.
   Hardscape shall mean and refer to the impervious horizontal surfaces placed
on a site for primarily pedestrian circulation. Certain portions of vehicular
circulation areas may be included in the definition of a hardscape area
providing extraordinary design considerations apply.

expressed as a ratio of horizontal distance to vertical distance.
   Soil shall mean naturally occurring surficial (unconsolidated) deposits
overlying bedrock.
   Soil engineer (or geotechnical engineer) shall mean a civil engineer who is
experienced in soil mechanics and has a valid certificate as a registered civil
engineer or geotechnical engineer by the State of California, who investigates
and reports on the stability of existing or proposed slopes and retaining
walls, controls the placement and compaction of fills, recommends soil bearing
values, and provides design criteria and calculations for special earth
structures such as buttress fills.
   Soil engineering shall mean the application of the principles of soil
mechanics in the investigation, evaluation, and design of civil works involving
the use of earth materials, and the inspection and testing of the construction
thereof.
   Terrace shall mean a relatively level step utilizing grading and retaining
walls constructed in the face of an engineered slope surface for drainage and
maintenance purposes.
   Town Engineer shall mean the individual charged with the ultimate authority

(Ord. #89-22, §92-8.03)
19-2   PROHIBITED ACTIONS.
   19-2.1   General.
   a.   Prohibited Action; Permit Required. No person shall do any grading,
clearing and grubbing or locate or maintain any grading equipment on any lot or
property without first obtaining the appropriate grading permit unless such
work is specifically exempted under this chapter. No permit shall be issued
until applicant obtains conceptual approval from Chief of Planning.
   b.   Prohibited Action; Grading. No person shall grade, whether or not a
permit is required under this chapter, so that dirt, soil, rock, debris, or
other material washed, eroded, or moved from the property by natural or
artificial means creates a public nuisance or hazard, or an unlawful
encroachment on other property or on a public road or street. Any such matter
deposited within the right-of-way of a public road or street which may
constitute a nuisance or hazard to public traffic shall be removed immediately
by the permittee. Failure to do so on notice from the Town is a misdemeanor and
the Town may have the matter removed at the expense of the responsible party
and/or permittee in addition to any other appropriate action.
   c.   Prohibited Action; Water Obstruction. No person shall obstruct, impede,
interfere or otherwise adversely affect the natural flow of storm waters,
whether unconfined upon the surface of the land, within land depressions or
natural drainage paths, within unimproved channels or watercourses, or within
improved ditches, channels or conduits, except for construction operations
permitted by the Town.
   d.   Prohibited Action; Construction in Public Rights-of-Way. No person
shall perform any work or construct any facility (including, but not limited
to, excavation, embankment, trenching, driveway construction, or drainage
facility) within the right-of-way of a public road or street, or within an
easement under the jurisdiction of this Town without an encroachment permit
from the Town.
   (Ord. #89-22, §92-8.05)
19-3   PERMITS REQUIRED.
   19-3.1   General.
   No person may grade, fill, excavate, store, or dispose of soil and earth
materials or perform any other land-disturbing or land-filling activity without
first obtaining a permit as set forth in this chapter, unless exempted by
subsection
19-3.2 below. (Ord. #89-22, §92-8.10)
   19-3.2   Exemptions.
   A grading permit is not required for the following:
   a.   An excavation below finished grade for basements and footings of a
building, retaining wall, swimming pool or other structures authorized by a
valid building permit. This shall not exempt the fill made with the material
from such excavation nor exempt any excavation having an unsupported height
greater than five (5’) feet after the completion of the structure;
   b.   Cemetery graves;
   c.   Emergency work as authorized by the Town to protect the public health,
safety, welfare and property; or to maintain the safety, use or stability of a
public way or drainage course;
   d.   Grading on a site or contiguous sites held under one ownership in which
all of the items in paragraphs 1. or 2. exist.
      1.   A fill not intended to support structures which the Town Engineer
determines will not change, obstruct or otherwise adversely affect the existing
drainage pattern if the fill:
         (a)   Is placed on a natural grade having a slope of less than five
(5’) feet horizontal to one (1’) foot vertical; and
         (b)   Is less than three (3’) feet in depth at its deepest point as
measured vertically from natural grade to the surface of the fill; and
         (c)   Does not exceed one hundred (100) cubic yards; and
         (d)   Is no closer than three (3’) feet to an exterior property line;
or
      2.   An excavation which:
         (a)   Is less than three (3’) feet in depth at its deepest point as
measured vertically from the natural ground surface to the finished elevation
of the excavation; and
         (b)   Does not result in the movement of more than one hundred (100)
cubic yards; and
         (c)   Does not create a cut slope greater than five (5’) feet in
height or steeper than three (3’) feet horizontal to one (1’) foot vertical;
and
         (d)   Is no closer than five (5’) feet to an exterior property line or
no closer than one-half (1/2) the height of any existing building or retaining
structure or slope (whichever is greater).
   e.   Weed Abatement. Erosion-control measures may be required if the Town
Engineer determines that the weed abatement may create adverse runoff potential
and siltation concerns. (Ord. #89-22, §92-8.11)
   19-3.3   Grading Permits.
   A grading permit is required to control all forms of grading activity on a
site. The grading permit may be phased at the applicant’s discretion into
segments of work as long as the site is not left in an unstable, erodible or
unsafe condition. The possible phasing of the grading permit is referenced
below.
   a.   (Rough) Grading Permit. The purpose of a rough grading permit is to
allow the applicant to begin working on a site requiring minor to moderate
grading. It can also be used for mass grading or infrastructural improvements
in which building pads, street rights-of-way and slopes are graded to
substantial conformance with the approved plans, but no specific improvements
are proposed. The scope of work covered by a rough grading permit includes the
following:
      1.   Site preparation, site private drainage, over-excavation (if
required), clearing and grubbing;
      2.   Grading of building pads, street rights-of-way and cut slopes to a
rough grade condition:
      3.   Importation and stockpiling of fill material required for the
project which will be compacted in place within five (5) working days;
      4.   Implementation of erosion-control measures;
      5.   Any other work deemed reasonable and necessary by the Town Engineer
to bring the site to a stable geological condition.
   b.   Fine Grading Permit. Grading that is required to take a project from
pad certification to project completion is called fine grading, and falls under
the authority of the Chief Building Official. It may also be used to encompass
the entire grading aspect of a project.
      The scope of work covered by the free grading permit includes the
following:
      1.   Re-grade to acceptable line and grade tolerances (fine grade) of any
areas to be covered by any paving or hardscape surface;
      2.   Finish grading of all cut and/or fill slopes, landscape berms and
berms adjacent to the building;
      3.   Lot drainage and side-yard swale.
   c.   Hillside Grading Permit. A hillside grading permit is required when the
existing average gradient of the site is ten (10%) percent or greater. This
permit category serves to identify hillside sites and to ensure adequate
attention is given to potential problems, such as slope stability and erosion
control, associated with hillside grading and falls under the authority of the
Town Engineer.
      Grading necessary to construct retaining wall structures in hillside
areas (Zones 3 and 4), as defined in paragraph c. of this subsection, shall be
confined within seven (7’) feet of the building footprint of the structure and
within the necessary roadways to permit vehicular access to the site.
Applicants for grading permits will be encouraged to construct retaining walls
within the footprint if it is apparent that graded cut and fill slopes cannot
be integrated into the natural surroundings in an acceptable manner.
      Plans prepared for sites designated as falling within hillside areas as
defined in the Hillside/Ridgeline Ordinance Scenic Hillside and Major Ridgeline
Development Ordinance 29-84 1 or as defined above shall include the following:
      1.   Detailed sections of keyways, retaining structures, buttressing and
daylighting of all slopes;
      2.   Private drainage improvements such as slope drainage devices,
terrace drains, desilting basins and subdrain systems; and
      3.   Any other design considerations which were utilized to preserve the
natural terrain.
(Ord. #89-22, §92-8.12)
*   Editor’s Note: Ordinance #29-84, Scenic Hillside and Major Ridgeline
Development, is codified as Section
32-69 of Chapter XXXII, Planning and Land Use.
   19-3.4   Erosion-Control Permit.
   No person shall do any work requiring a grading or paving permit without
also obtaining an erosion-control permit.
   The purpose for this requirement is to minimize the quantity of silty debris
entering a Town or County-maintained storm water collection facility or roadway
due to construction site run-off.
   A site required to implement desilting or erosion-control measures shall
have them installed and operable prior to October 15 and at any other time
erosion potential exists. The contractor shall install these measures according
to the current edition of the Town’s “Erosion-Control and Winterization”
guideline and regulations prescribed herein.
   The erosion-control permit may be included within the scope of the grading
permit; however, a grading permit may not be issued until an erosion-control
plan has been accepted for review by the Town. The erosion-control permit may
be waived by the Town Engineer for projects of a minor nature as determined by
the Town Engineer. (Ord. #89-22, §92-8.13)
   19-3.5   On-Site Paving Permit.
   No person shall do paving work on new parking lots, new private streets, or
overlays of existing parking lots or private streets without first obtaining an
on-site paving permit.
   This permit may be incorporated into the fine grading permit for on-site
construction or the encroachment permit for any proposed paving to be located
within a site.
   Pavement striping shall be shown on the approved site plan in accordance
with standards and shall be reviewed and approved by the Chief Building
Official and Chief of Planning to assure compliance with existing conditions of
approval and other applicable laws and ordinances, such as handicap
requirements prior to permit issuance. (Ord. #89-22, §92-8.14)
   19-3.6   Blasting Permit.
   No person shall do any blasting without first obtaining a blasting permit.
   An application for a blasting permit may be accepted for review by the Town
Engineer only after all possible alternative design concepts and construction
methods have been explored and rejected. The burden of justifying the necessity
for the use of dynamite or similar explosives on a construction site is the
applicant’s.
   Any proposed project requiring the blasting of natural terrain to achieve an
engineered grade is discouraged by the Town of Danville unless reviewed by the
Town Engineer. New construction shall be designed to conform to the existing
terrain. (Ord. #89-22, §92-8.15)
   19-3.7   Conditions of Approval.
   Approval of permits shall be made subject to the appropriate conditions or
requirements necessary to protect public health, safety, and general welfare;
including, but not limited to the following:
   a.   Completion of the work within a period approved by the Chief Building
Official or Town Engineer;
   b.   Cleaning up the area and planting in accordance with approved plans;
   c.   Designation of the area covered by the permit;
   d.   Designation of the limits, rate of grade and elevation of proposed
slopes and cut of all areas;
   e.   Reasonable provisions for controlling excessive dust;
   f.   Hours and days of operation;
   g.   Safety precautions such as barricades, flashers, flagmen, etc. to guide
pedestrian and vehicular traffic in, around, and by the operation;
   h.   Posting of a good and sufficient bond to assure compliance with the
conditions;
   i.   Other conditions deemed necessary by the Chief Building Official or
Town Engineer based on engineering practices accepted in the area;
   j.   The conditions of approval shall be considered to be part of the
approved grading plan and shall be attached to all approved sets of plans;
   k.   Designation and approval of a haul route;
   l.   Water source location;
   m.   Tree ordinance.
(Ord. #89-22, §92-8.16)
   19-3.8   Liability and Property Damage.
   For permits with a valuation of fifty thousand ($50,000.00) dollars or more,
permittee shall provide satisfactory proof by certificate of insurance that the
permittee has in force a valid public liability insurance policy which includes
the Town, its officers, employees and agents as additional insureds. The
insurance coverage shall be in an amount the Town Engineer deems sufficient to
adequately protect the additional insureds from liability for damages to person
(s) or property(s) arising from the activities related to the permit.
   The Town Engineer may waive the provisions of this chapter relating to cash
deposit or surety bond for permits required upon satisfactory proof by
certificate of insurance that the permittee is adequately insured to assure
reimbursement to the Town for repair of any damage. (Ord. #89-22, §92-8.17)
   19-3.9   Denial of Permit.
   a.   Hazards. A permit shall be denied in any case where the work as
proposed by the applicant may adversely affect the stability of adjoining
property, result in the depositing of debris on any public way, interfere with
any existing drainage course, or be in an area where no reasonable amount of
corrective work can eliminate or sufficiently reduce the flooding or geological
hazard.
      If, in the opinion of the Town Engineer, the land area for which grading
is proposed is subject to geological or flood hazard to the extent that no
reasonable amount of corrective work such as retaining structures, buttress
fills, or drainage devices can convincingly eliminate or sufficiently reduce
the hazard to human life or property, the Town Engineer shall make a written
finding so stating and shall deny the grading permit and the building permits
for habitable structures.
   b.   Hazard Created. The Town shall not issue a permit where the work, as
proposed by the applicant, is liable to constitute a hazard to public or
private property or result in the deposition of debris on any public way or
interfere with any existing drainage course.
   c.   Land Use. A permit shall not be issued for work that will not comply
with all provisions of this chapter and any conditions imposed by the planning
agency on approval of the use.
   d.   Existing Building or Zoning Code Violations. A permit shall not be
issued under this chapter if any building or zoning code violations are found
to exist on the site.
   e.   Rejection and Revisions. Rejection of the application or plans shall be
considered a denial of the permit. However, denial of a permit based on
insufficient or inadequate plans shall not preclude the applicant from
submitting a revised application or revised plans in conjunction with a pending
application.
(Ord. #89-22, §92-8.18)
   19-3.10   Time Limits of Grading Operations.
   a.   The permittee shall fully perform and complete all of the work required
to be done pursuant to the permit within the time limit specified therein or,
if no time is so specified, within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date
of issuance of the permit.
   b.   If the work is not completed within the specified time, a request for
an extension of time setting forth the reasons for the requested extension
shall be presented in writing to the Town Engineer. The Town Engineer may grant
additional time for the work.
   c.   If all the permit work required is not completed within the time limit
specified in paragraph a. above, no further grading shall be done without
renewing the permit. A written request for renewal shall be submitted to the
Town Engineer. A new application may be required considering the time between
the expiration date and the renewal request, changes in Town regulations or
subsequent development in the immediate area. Plans must be revised and
rechecked.
(Ord. #89-22, §92-8.19)
   19-3.11   Responsibility of Permittee.
   The permittee shall be ultimately responsible for ensuring that all
permitted construction is accomplished within the parameters set by any and all
applicable codes, provisions and conditions of approval; and that such work
proceeds per the approved plans. The permittee shall also execute a “hold
harmless” clause on the permit, which shall read as follows:
   “By accepting this permit, the permittee, for contractors, and employees,
promises to save, indemnify and hold harmless the Town of Danville and its
employees, agents and representatives from all liabilities and claims for
damages by reason of injury or death to any person(s), damage to property, from
any cause whatsoever while in, upon or in any way connected with the work
covered by this grading permit, and does further promise to defend these
indemnities in any claim or action arising out of, or as a result of, the work
done under this permit.”
(Ord. #89-22, §92-8.20)
   19-3.12   Protection of Adjoining Property.
   No work shall be undertaken which may result in damages to, obstruction of,
or possible hazards to any adjoining property. Whenever any portion of the work
requires entry onto adjacent property for any reason, the permit applicant
shall obtain the written consent of the adjacent property owner or his
authorized representative, and shall file a copy of the consent with the Town
Engineer before a permit for such work may be issued. (Ord #89-22, §92-8.21)
   19-3.13   Notice of Non-Compliance.
   If the soil, civil, or Town Engineer finds that the work is not in
conformance with this chapter or with the plans approved by the Town Engineer,
Chief Building Official, or with locally accepted practices, permittee shall be
immediately notified in writing of the nonconformity and of the corrective
measures to be taken. (Ord. #89-22, §92-8.22)
   19-3.14   Permit Administration.
   a.   Application.
      1.   Written. To obtain a permit the applicant shall first file a written
application on an approved form. Every application shall conform to the
requirements set forth in subsection
19-3.10.
      2.   Information. The following shall be included on each application
form: site description; names, addresses, and phone numbers of persons
involved; estimate of the time schedule of work; estimate of the cost of
performing the work; signature of the owner or authorized agent; and any other
information required by the Town Engineer.
      3.   Accompanying Materials. The application shall be accompanied by the
following material: Applicable fees; engineer’s estimate of quantities and cost
of work; three (3) copies of a geotechnical or engineering geology reports;
four (4) sets of grading or site plans; four (4) sets of interim and final
erosion-control plans; master work schedule; approved bonds or securities; any
other additional information required by the Town Engineer.
      4.   Civil and Soil Engineer’s Signatures. Plans shall be prepared and
signed by the civil engineer. The plans shall also be reviewed for conformance
to the soil engineer’s recommendations and signed by the soil engineer.
Signatures may not be required if approved by the Town Engineer.
      5.   Other Clearances. Written clearance will be required from both
Building and Planning Divisions. Written clearances may also be required from,
but not limited to, the following agencies: The California Regional Water
Control Board, California Department of Fish and Game, Fire Protection
District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The applicant shall be responsible for
submitting copies of plans and reports required by those divisions or agencies.
      6.   Haul Routes. If the grading project includes the movement of earth
material to or from the site in an amount considered substantial by the Town
Engineer, the permittee shall submit a haul plan for review and approval by the
Town Engineer prior to the issuance of a grading permit. This plan should
include the proposed route, size of trucks, dust control measures, and time and
frequency of trips. The Town Engineer may require alternate routes or special
requirements in consideration of the possible impact on the adjacent community
or roadway. There shall be no additional fee for the haul route plan check.
      7.   Peer Review. The Town may contract for outside technical peer review
of civil and geotechnical engineering reports and plans at the applicant’s
expense. The cost for peer review shall be added to the permit fee. Any
disputes arising from peer review shall be resolved by the Town Engineer within
ten (10) working days from the applicant’s written request.
   b.   Approval and Issuance.
      1.   Applications in which the design meets the requirements of this
chapter, and the construction is not deemed detrimental to adjoining properties
or to the public interest, shall be approved. When all fees and bonds are
posted, a permit shall be issued, and the approval and issuance shall be noted
on the application and plans.
      2.   Applications and plans found inadequate or not in compliance with
this chapter shall not be approved until revised to conform to the conditions
and regulations prescribed herein.
      3.   The issuance of a permit shall constitute an authorization to do
only that work which is described or illustrated on the application for the
permit, or on the development plans and specifications approved by the Town
Engineer.
      4.   Grading permits do not relieve the owner of the responsibility of
securing permits or licenses that may be required from other departments or
divisions of the governing agencies. When an application is approved and a
permit issued, one set of approved plans shall be kept available for reference
at the job site during grading and construction. The permit shall be posted
securely in a conspicuous location on the site.
      5.   Permits for projects requiring approved public improvement plans
shall not be issued prior to the return to the Town of the first plan check of
the improvement plan, unless specifically authorized by the Town Engineer.
   c.   Amendments.
      1.   All changes in the plans, grades, or extent of work shall be
submitted to the Town Engineer for written approval and incorporation into the
permit prior to starting any work covered by the proposed revision. The
approving agency may amend the permit to include the altered plans, or may deny
approval of the changes.

disturbed to the least extent possible.
      The following shall serve as a guide within a particular slope zone with
the exception that, where approved by the Planning Commission or Town Council,
the guidelines for one zone may be applied to limited portions of an adjacent
zone to permit the extension or transition of a logical design concept. This
guideline will not preclude satisfying requirements for fire apparatus access
roads.
   b.   The “Percent Natural Slope” on a site will be calculated as the average
gradient of the entire site unless one (1) of the following conditions exist:

the development shall conform to Ordinance 29-84. 1 Development of ridgelines
not addressed in Ordinance 29-84 1 and of minor significance is permitted where
the natural profile can be retained with no abrupt changes in grade and where
development and attendant improvements are least visible from other
developments (existing and future) and roads below. Ridge-lines not identified
as “significant” during the development review process may be developed as
appropriate in accordance with other applicable development guidelines.

after receipt of the map, may forward to the Planning Department its findings
and recommendations thereon.
   31-9.7   Subdivision Conference.
   Within thirty (30) calendar days after the filing of a tentative map in
compliance with subsection
31-9.5, the Planning Department may hold a subdivision conference on the
tentative map, after giving written notice to all interested agencies. At such
conference the recommendations of the Planning Department and the other
affected agencies may be considered and correlated. Following the conference,
the Department shall make a written report of the recommendations to the
appropriate advisory agency, and shall serve the report on the subdivider and
on each tenant of the subject property (in the case of a proposed conversion to
a condominium project, community apartment project, or stock cooperative

   The subdivider may submit a written request for exceptions as to street
improvements, widths, grades, and other subdivision matters or variances from
zoning requirements, subject to the approval of the advisory agency.
   31-9.9   Expiration; Extension.
   The approval or conditional approval of a tentative map expires thirty (30)
months after its original approval. This expiration terminates all proceedings,
and no final map or parcel map of all or any portion of the real property
included within the tentative map shall be filed without first processing a new
tentative map. Upon application by the subdivider, filed before this expiration
date, the advisory agency which originally approved the tentative map may
extend this expiration date for a period or periods totaling not more than
twenty-four (24) months after the original expiration date.
   31-9.10   Action by Advisory Agency.
   a.   Approval of Tentative Map. The advisory agency, pursuant to subsection
30-6.6 of this Code, shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the
map, and shall report such action in writing direct to the subdivider, the
Engineering Department and such other agencies as requested. In the case of a
proposed tentative map for a minor subdivision the advisory agency shall hear
it within fifty (50) working days after filing it and thereafter render a
decision within fifteen (15) calendar days unless these time limits have been
extended by mutual consent of the parties concerned. In the event the map is
disapproved, the advisory agency’s report shall set forth the basis of its
action and identify the requirements or conditions which have not been met or
performed.
   b.   Approval of Exception and Variance Applications. The advisory agency
shall also approve or disapprove the application of the subdivider for
exceptions and variances.
   c.   Findings. The advisory agency shall not approve a tentative map unless
it shall find that the proposed subdivision, together with the provisions for
its design and improvement, is consistent with the applicable general and
specific plans required by law. When approving the tentative map for a minor
subdivision, the advisory agency shall make findings as required concerning the
fulfillment of construction requirements.
   31-9.11   Appeal; Procedure; Fee.
   Any person who wishes to appeal the action of the advisory agency with
respect to the tentative map or the improvements required as a condition of the
tentative map, may appeal the decision. The procedure for any such appeal shall
be as provided for in subsections 30-7.2 and 30-7.3 of this Code. The fee for
any such appeal shall be as established by resolution of the Town Council.
(Ord. #98-06, §7)
31-10   VESTING TENTATIVE MAPS.
   31-10.1   Purpose.
   The purpose of this section is to establish a procedure for the approval of
a tentative map that provides certain statutorily vested rights to a subdivider
under the Vesting Tentative Map Statute (Government Code Section 66498.1 et
seq.). This section implements and supplements that statute and the Danville
Subdivision Ordinance.
   This section may be cited as the Danville Vesting Tentative Map Ordinance.
(Ord. #78-85, §94-3.002)
   31-10.2   Definitions.
   As used in this section:
   a.   Vesting tentative map is a tentative map for a residential subdivision
which has been filed, processed and approved in accordance with the Vesting
Tentative Map Statute and this section and which has printed conspicuously on
its face the words “Vesting Tentative Map”;
   b.   The definitions set forth in the Subdivision Ordinance apply.
(Reference: Government Code Section 66452 (c)*, all subsequent references are
to the State Government Code.)
(Ord. #78-85, §94-3.004)
   31-10.3   Applicability.
   This section applies only to residential developments. Beginning January 1,
1988, this section will also apply to non-residential developments. (Reference:
California Government Code Section 66498.7)
(Ord. #78-85, §94-3.006)
   31-10.4   Procedure.
   a.   Option to File Vesting Tentative Map. When a tentative map is required,
a vesting tentative map may be filed instead.
   b.   Filing. A vesting tentative map shall have printed conspicuously on its
face the words “Vesting Tentative Map” before the Town may accept it for
filing.
   c.   Subdivision Ordinance Applies. Except as otherwise provided in this
section, Chapter XXXI, Subdivision applies to a vesting tentative map and a
vesting tentative map is processed in the same manner as a tentative map.
   d.   Accompanying Data. Such information as is ordinarily required under the
provisions of this chapter for the filing of a tentative map shall also be
required for the filing of a vesting tentative map. Supplemental information as
relates to the vesting nature of the proposed vesting tentative map may also be
required.
   (Ord. #78-85, §94-3.008)
   31-10.5   Development Rights.
   a.   Development Rights Created. The approval of a vesting tentative map
confers a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance
with the Town’s ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the date the
Town determines the application is complete. (See California Government Code
Sections 66498.1, 66474.2, 65943.)
   b.   Duration of Development Rights. The right to proceed with development
as set forth in paragraph a. continues for one (1) year following the
recordation of the final map or parcel map. If a project covered by a single
vesting tentative map is divided into phases and more than one (1) final map is
recorded, the one (1) year period begins for each phase when the final map of
that phase is recorded.
   c.   Expiration of Development Rights.
      1.   The right to proceed with development as set forth in paragraph a.
expires if a final map is not approved before the vesting tentative map
expires.
      2.   The time within which a final map may be filed is governed by County
Ordinance Code Section 94-2.610 and Government Code Section 66452.6 (a), (d)
and (e).
      3.   If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building
permit during the one (1) year period specified in paragraph b., the right to
proceed with development continues until the building permit expires.
      4.   If a final map is recorded based upon a vesting tentative map and
the development rights expire, the final map remains in effect without the
development rights.
   d.   Extension of Time for Exercise of Development Rights.
      1.   If the Town does not process an application for a grading permit or
for design or architectural review within thirty (30) days of the date the
application is complete, the one (1) year period specified in paragraph b. is
automatically extended by the time exceeding the thirty (30) day period used by
the Town to complete processing.
      2.   Before the expiration of the one (1) year period specified in
paragraph b., a subdivider may apply to the Town Council for a one (1) year
extension. (Reference: California Government Code Sections 66498.1 (b), 66452.6
(g))
(Ord. #78-85, §94-3.010)
   31-10.6   Effect of State and Federal Laws.
   This section relates only to the imposition of conditions and requirements
imposed by the Town and does not affect the obligation to a subdivider to
comply with the conditions and requirements of State or Federal laws,
regulations or policies. (Reference: California Government Code Section 66498.6
(b))
(Ord. #78-85, §94-3.012)
   31-10.7   Town’s Right to Condition or Deny Approval.
   a.   This section does not: (1) enlarge or diminish the types of conditions
which the Town may impose on a development; or (2) diminish or alter the Town’s
power to protect against a condition dangerous to the public health or safety.
   b.   The Town may condition or deny a permit, approval, extension or
entitlement relating to a vesting tentative map if it determines that either:
      1.   The failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or
the community in a condition dangerous to their health or safety; or
      2.   The condition or denial is required to comply with State or Federal
law. (Reference: State Government Code Sections 66498.6 (a), 66498.1 (c))
(Ord. #78-85, §94-3.014)
   31-10.8   Fees.
   The amount of a fee imposed (processing, park dedication, etc.) as fixed by
resolution is determined at the time the fee is paid. (Ord. #78-85, §94-3.016)

any defective work for the one (1) year period and the performance security
shall then be released. The new security shall include the cash deposit
described above and shall be not less than the cash deposit or fifteen (15%)
percent of the estimated cost of the construction of the improvements,
whichever amount is greater, and shall be retained for the one (1) year
guarantee period. If the subdivider does not substitute a new acceptable
security for the one (1) year guarantee period, the performance security shall
be retained.
      Upon expiration of the one (1) year guarantee period, and upon
notification by the appropriate Town department responsible for certifying
compliance, the City Clerk shall release all securities posted guaranteeing the
improvements.
   b.   Payment Security. Security in the form of a cash deposit or acceptable

these regulations will also be consistent with the General Plan.
(Ord. #2015-06, §2)
   32-1.3   Applicability of Zoning and Development Regulations.
   This chapter applies to and regulates all land uses and development of land
including private and public uses of private and/or public land within the Town
of Danville.
   a.   Compliance Required. No structure shall be altered, erected, or
reconstructed in any manner, nor shall any structure or land be used for any
purpose, other than as allowed by this chapter.
   b.   Conflicts with other Plans. When there is a conflict between this
chapter and the general plan, the general plan shall prevail. In addition, if a
conflict occurs between the requirements of this chapter and standards adopted
as part of a development agreement or specific plan, the requirements of the
development agreement or specific plan shall apply.
   c.   Minimum Requirements. The requirements of this chapter are minimum
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general
welfare. When this chapter provides for a discretionary approval, more
stringent requirements may be imposed as determined necessary by the review
authority to promote land use and development compatibility, provide
environmental protection, and/or meet other purposes of this chapter.
   d.   Private Agreements. The requirements of this chapter are not intended
to interfere with, abrogate, annul, or repeal any agreement, covenant (e.g.,
CC&Rs), easement, or restriction between private parties. However, if this
chapter conflicts with requirements imposed or required by other private
agreements, covenants, or easements, the provisions of this chapter shall
control. The Town shall not enforce, or take into consideration as part of an
action, any private agreement, covenant, or restriction unless it is a party to
the agreement, covenant, or restriction.
   e.   Other Permits May Be Required. Nothing in this chapter eliminates the
need for obtaining other permits required by the Town or obtain other permits
and/or following regulations of a special district or agency or State or
Federal agency.
(Ord. #2015-06, §2)
   32-1.4   Exercise of Discretion.
   In the event that a provision of this chapter or a condition of approval
imposed on a project or property through Town-approval of a discretionary
planning entitlement allows the review authority to exercise judgment in the
application of a specific development standard, land use, or condition of
approval, the review shall include, but is not limited to, an analysis as to
whether:
   a.   The proposed project complies with all applicable provisions of this
chapter;
   b.   The exercise of authority will act to ensure the compatibility of the
proposed project with its site and surrounding properties;
   c.   The manner in which authority is exercised will result in a more
practical application of the provisions of this chapter given specific
characteristics of the site and its surroundings; and
   d.   The decision is consistent with the intent of the general plan and any
other applicable regulation or standard.
(Ord. #2015-06, §2)
   32-1.5   Enforcement.
   No land in the Town shall be used for any purpose not permitted under this
chapter, nor shall any building or structure be erected, constructed, altered,
moved or maintained contrary to this chapter. Any use of land, building or
structure contrary to this chapter is unlawful and constitutes a public
nuisance. On order of the Town Council, the City Attorney shall commence an
action for the abatement and removal of any such nuisance and for an injunction
preventing the further unlawful use of any land, building or structure
violating this chapter. The remedies provided for in this section shall be
cumulative and not exclusive.
(Ord. #2015-06, §2)
   32-1.6   Nonconforming Uses.
   a.   Defined. Any lawful use of land or buildings existing prior to the
adoption of this chapter, which use does not conform to the provisions of this
chapter, shall be a nonconforming use and shall not be in violation of this
chapter until the use is discontinued or ceases for any reason.
   b.   Repair - Rebuilding. If any building or structure constituting a
nonconforming use is destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, act of God or the
public enemy, or other accident or catastrophe, or if an existing use of land
is temporarily terminated, the building or structure may not be repaired or
rebuilt if damaged in excess of fifty percent of its reasonable market value at
the time of destruction or damage, without approval of a Land Use Permit
application. Any existing, nonconforming use of land which is interrupted by
any cause may lawfully be resumed within six months of the interruption.
   c.   Extension - Enlargement. An existing nonconforming use may be extended
or enlarged only after the approval of a Land Use Permit by the Town.
(Ord. #2015-06, §2)
   32-1.7   Utilities and Pipelines.
   The use of land for rights-of-way for the construction, maintenance and
repair of public utilities and publicly owned utilities, and for privately
owned pipelines for the transportation of oil, gas, water, and other substances
transportable by pipelines, is not regulated or restricted by this chapter.
Accessory and appurtenant structures forming a part of public utilities,
publicly owned utilities and pipelines are not regulated or restricted by this
chapter except for setback regulations.
(Ord. #2015-06, §2)
   32-1.8   Drainage Requirements and New Construction Adjacent to Major and
Non-Major Channels.
   a.   Drainage facilities and all new construction shall be installed under a
permit issued pursuant to this Chapter, adequate to meet and comply with the
drainage design standards and requirements set forth in Chapter XXXI,
Subdivision.
   b.   A permit for the installation of drainage facilities will not be issued
until applications, plans and exhibits for such facilities are submitted which
comply with the requirements of this section and Article I through Article V.
(Ord. #2015-06, §2)
   32-1.9   Zoning Districts for Open Space.
   To comply with the Government Code Section 65910 the following zoning
districts are deemed to be zoning districts for open space when applied in
conformance with the open space policies of the general plan: Agricultural
Preserve District (A-4), General Agricultural District (A-2), and Planned Unit
Development District (P-l). This section neither limits the use of these zoning
districts to the implementation of general plan open space policies, nor
precludes the Town from adopting additional ordinances to implement those
policies.
(Ord. #2015-06, §2)
   32-1.10   Water and Sewer Requirements.
   Water supply and sewage systems and/or facilities required for any use,
construction, structure, or other development to be established under a
planning application approval issued pursuant to this Chapter shall comply with
the Danville Municipal Code and obtain the approval of the East Bay Municipal
Utility District, Contra Costa Health -Environmental Health Division, and/or
the Central Contra Costa Sanitary District.
(Ord. #2015-06, §2)
   32-1.11   Required Area Reduced by Public Use.
   If part of a lot or parcel of land, which meets the minimum area requirement
for its zoning district, is acquired for public use in any manner, including
dedication, condemnation, or purchase, and if the remainder of the lot or
parcel has not less than eighty percent of the area required for its land use
district, the remainder shall be considered as having the required area, but
front yard, side yard, and rear yard setback requirements shall be met. This
provision does not apply to public right-of-ways or easements which are used
for the purpose of vehicular access for the lot or parcel. If a lot or parcel
of land has an authorized nonconforming status as to area under any Town
ordinance, the parcel shall retain its nonconforming status if the acquisition
for public use does not reduce the remainder below eighty percent of the
existing nonconforming area. The setback, side yard, and rear yard requirements
of the land use district shall be met, except for buildings or structures in
existence at the time of public acquisition.
(Ord. #2015-06, §2)
   32-1.12   Side Yards on Lots Established Before Effective Date.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, minimum side yard
setbacks for the first floor of a primary residence shall be permitted in any
single family residential district, two family district, or multiple family
residential district according to the following table for any lot or parcel of
land which was established prior to December 12, 1978 by records in the Office
of the Recorder for the area or district in which the lot or parcel of land is
situated:
 
Width of Lot at Front Yard Minimum Aggregate Side Yard Minimum Single Side Yard
Setback                    Allowed                     Allowed
100 feet or less but more  20 feet                     10 feet
than 50 feet
50 feet or less            10 feet                     5 feet
 
Side yard setbacks for any portion of the primary residence other than the
first floor shall observe a minimum setback of an additional five feet beyond
the minimum first floor setback, or meet the minimum side yard setback
requirements for the applicable zoning district, whichever is less. (Ord.
#2015-06, §2)
   32-1.13   Accessory Structures in Rear Yards.
   Accessory structures may occupy not more than thirty percent of a required
rear yard area.
(Ord. #2015-06, §2)
   32-1.14   Off-Street Parking.
   a.   Generally. Except as provided for in Section 32-45 (Downtown Business
District), it is the intent of this Chapter that all land uses shall be
provided with sufficient space located off-street for the parking of vehicles
to meet the needs of persons employed at or making use of such land uses. No
planning application or building permit for the erection of a new structure or
for the enlargement of an existing structure, or for the development of a land
use, shall be approved unless it includes off-street parking facilities as
required by this Chapter.
   b.   Application to Existing Land Uses. Land uses in existence (i.e.,
occupied by a structure) on July 1,1982, shall not be subject to the
requirements of this chapter, provided that any off-street parking facilities
now required or serving such land uses shall not, in the future, be reduced
below these requirements. Any expansion of the use resulting in a higher
parking demand shall be subject to the requirements of this Chapter.
   c.   Fractional Parking Space. Where the computation of required off-street
parking spaces results in a fractional number, only the fraction of one-half or
more shall be counted as one.
   d.   Mixed Uses. Where property is occupied or intended to be occupied by
two or more establishments falling into different classes of uses, the off-
street parking required shall be the sum of the requirements for the various
individual establishments, computed separately; off-street parking provided for
one use shall not be considered as being provided for any other use.
   e.   Location. Required off-street parking shall normally be provided on the
same lot or premises as the main use it serves. Where this is impractical, the
decision making authority, by approval of a Land Use Permit, may authorize
provision for parking on any parcel located within two hundred (200') feet of
the lot containing the main use. Any allowed off-site parking shall be
available for the subject use, and shall not be counted toward the required
parking supply for any other concurrent use.
   f.   Design and Layout. Off-street parking areas shall be designed in such a
manner as to conform to the following regulations, subject to review and
approval by the decision making authority:
Angle of Parking Degrees Stall Width Curb Length Stall Depth Driveway Width

      1.   Thirty percent (30%) of the total required parking may be provided
in compact parking stalls. A compact stall shall be at least eight by sixteen
(8' x 16') feet in size including allowable overhang and shall be marked with
standard pavement markings.
      2.   All off-street parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate
maneuvering areas and means of vehicular access to the main and auxiliary
streets. Where the parking area does not abut on a street, there shall be
provided an access drive not less than twelve feet in width in the case of one-
way traffic, and not less than twenty feet in width in all other cases, leading
to the parking area in such a manner as to secure the most appropriate
development of the property in question.
      3.   Required off-street parking areas shall be surfaced with an
asphaltic or Portland cement binder pavement, or similar material so as to
provide a durable and dustless surface, and shall be so graded and drained as
to prevent the ponding of water.
      4.   Parking areas shall not be used for automobile sales, storage,
repair work, dismantling or servicing of any kind.
      5.   A planter or landscaped strip at least four feet in width shall be
provided adjacent to street rights-of-way. Dead corners and other waste areas
shall be landscaped to provide a visual break in the paved area. Parking areas
of more than five parking spaces shall provide, in addition to the required
parking area, an area equal to not less than five percent of the total parking
area devoted to landscaping. Within this planter or landscaped strip, an
irrigation system shall be installed. Such a landscaped strip or planter shall
be provided to create the necessary visual and physical break between the
pedestrian traffic utilizing the sidewalks along the streets and the vehicular
traffic in the parking area, and by this means, substantially reduce the
traffic hazard to the pedestrian.
      6.   Parking spaces shall be marked or maintained on the pavement and any
other directional marking or signs shall be installed as permitted or required
by the decision making authority, to insure the maximum utilization of space,
sufficient traffic flow, and general safety.
      7.   Lighting, if provided, shall be directed downward and away from
residential areas and public streets so as not to produce a glare as seen from
such areas, in order to insure the general safety of other vehicular traffic
and the privacy and well-being of the residential areas, and the lighting
intensity shall be no greater than reasonably required to light the parking
area.
      8.   Access to public parking areas and curb cuts for driveways shall be
located to insure an efficient and safe traffic flow into the parking areas and
along the public streets.
      9.   Parking areas shall be designed so that if a vehicle overhangs a
sidewalk or landscape area, the sidewalk maintains minimum accessible width
requirements and that the landscaping is low enough for the vehicle to
overhang.
      10.   Within any of the commercial, industrial and multiple family
residential zones, parking areas shall be designed so that vehicles are not
permitted to back out of the parking areas onto streets.
      11.   A six feet high, solid fence, or seven foot tall fence if the top
one-foot is a lattice design, or masonry wall of acceptable design, shall be
provided along the edge(s) of any public parking areas adjacent to
residentially zoned property to protect these residential properties from the
interruption and nuisances of the vehicles using the parking areas.
      12.   A barrier curb or wheel stop at least six (6") inches in height
shall be provided adjacent to landscaping which a vehicle cannot overhang,
buildings, and other areas to prevent damage to these facilities by the
vehicles utilizing the parking areas.
   g.   Maintenance and Operation. All required parking facilities shall be
provided and maintained in a safe and functional condition so long as the use
exists which the parking facilities were designed to serve. Off-street parking
facilities shall not be reduced in total area, except when such reduction is in
conformity with the requirements of this Chapter.
   h.   Common Parking Facility. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to
prevent the joint use of off-street parking for two or more land uses on the
same property if the total of such spaces when used together shall not be less
than the sum of the requirements for the various individual uses computed
separately in accordance with the requirements of this Chapter.
   i.   Number of Required Spaces. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided
for each land use on the basis of the following schedules:

ineffective.
      1.   Corner Lot. Four-sided corner lots shall be considered to have a
primary front yard and a secondary front yard, the two (2) interior property
lines shall be treated as side yards, and there shall be no rear yard. Corner
lots composed of more than four (4) property lines shall be considered to have
a primary front yard and a secondary front yard, interior side yards, and a
rear yard. The property line considered to be the rear yard shall be separated
from either the primary front yard or the secondary front yard property line by
at least one (1) side yard property line. Regardless of its location on either
the primary or secondary front yard, front-loaded garages shall maintain a
minimum front yard setback of twenty (20) feet.
      2.   Flag Lot.  For flag lots, the front setback shall be measured from
the point where the access strip meets the bulk of the lot to the nearest point
of the wall of the structure.
      3.   Determination of setbacks on irregular-shaped lots. The Planning
Division shall determine setbacks for irregular-shaped lots that are not
covered by any of the above examples on a case-by-case basis.
   f.   Second Story Setbacks Applicable to R-6, R-7, R-10, R-12, and R-15
Districts and Lots that are fifteen thousand (15,000) Square Feet or Smaller in
any Other Zoning District. The gross square footage of second story additions
shall be no larger than eighty percent (80%) of the gross square footage of the
ground floor of the home. Gross square footage shall be defined as the sum of
the square footage of both conditioned living space and garage or other non-
conditioned storage space. As a minimum, the second story addition along the
primary front elevation, and secondary front elevation as applicable, shall be
recessed a minimum of five (5) feet as measured vertically from the existing
ground floor exterior elevations, where such additions are setback less than
thirty-five (35) feet from any front property line. Where a setback of thirty-
five (35) feet or more from the property line are observed for both ground
floor and second story additions, the second story setbacks are waived.
   g.   For any single family residential lot that was created prior to July 1,
1982, side yard setbacks shall be permitted consistent with the Section
32-1.12.
   h.   Projections into Setbacks. Where allowed in the applicable District, an
architectural feature that is part of the primary structure may extend beyond
the wall of the structure and into a required primary front, secondary front,
side, or rear yard setback in compliance with the following table.

subdivision map, final development plan or other entitlement, setback
restrictions established through such entitlement process shall apply to
continuing or future development within the approved project. At the discretion
of the Chief of Planning, proposals for exterior architectural modification or
additions to any residential structure for which architecture was initially
approved through public hearing may be subject to approval of a Development
Plan application and, at the discretion of the Chief of Planning, may be
referred to the Design Review Board and/or Planning Commission for review.
   b.   Visibility at Intersections for Corner Lots.
      1.   The maximum height of fences and vegetation shall be two and one-
half (2-1/2) feet above the curb grade, or three (3) feet above the pavement
surface at the outside edge of pavement adjoining the premises, within the
sight distance triangle of corner lots.
      2.   An exception for vegetation in the site distance triangle is allowed
for trees with limbs and canopies which maintain a seven (7) foot vertical
clearance from the sidewalk or roadway.
   c.   Creek Structure Setbacks.
      1.   Major creek channels are defined as San Ramon Creek, Sycamore Creek,
Green Valley Creek, East Branch of Alamo Creek, and the West Branch of Alamo
Creek. For properties that abut major channels, all additions and/or new
structures shall meet the creek current structure setback requirements as
defined by Contra Costa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District or
as determined by the City Engineer.
      2.   For properties that abut non-major channels, all additions and/or
new structures shall meet the structure setback requirements as defined in
Danville Municipal Code Chapter 31-29, as determined by the City Engineer.
      3.   All structures shall observe the minimum creek setback or the
property line setback otherwise established under the applicable zoning
district, whichever is greater.
   d.   Breezeways. For purposes of determining the maximum allowable height
and minimum yard setbacks, a structure shall not be considered connected to,
and part of, the primary residence by utilizing a breezeway unless: the
breezeway is structurally integrated into the construction of both the primary
residence and the second structure; the distance of the wall-to-wall separation
between the two (2) structures connected by the breezeway does not exceed
twelve (12) feet, and; the depth of the breezeway roof structure including
eaves (front to back) is at least twelve (12) feet. A structure shall be
restricted to the maximum height requirement applicable to an accessory
structure if the breezeway does not meet all of the above requirements.
However, a structure attached to the primary residence in any manner shall
comply with the setback standards applicable to the primary residence.
   e.   Garage conversions. The conversion of either the entire garage or any
portion of the garage to living space or other residential use is allowed if:

   32-45.3   Applicability.
   This section applies to all development within the Downtown Business
District (designated DBD on the Town zoning map) and regulates all existing
uses, proposed new uses, remodels and new construction.
   Land uses will be regulated through the Development Plan review procedure as
follows:
   a.   Existing Uses and Structures. A lawful use of land or buildings
existing on November 16, 2017, but which does not conform to this chapter, is a
legal nonconforming use/business. No review is required for such a structure,
use or business until there is a change of use and/or business. Expansion or
intensification of a legal nonconforming use/business is discouraged. Minor
intensification or expansions may be considered under a Land Use Permit under
special circumstances if the application meets the character and intent of the
DBD in which it is located and there is finding of substantial conformance with
this chapter.
      All exterior alterations of structures, or alterations to the exterior
physical expression of businesses or uses, as applicable require Development
Plan pursuant to Division 5 of this chapter. A legal nonconforming use may be
sold as a legal nonconforming use providing the character and type of business
remains the same and all impacts relating to traffic, parking and other
environmental impacts are not increased. A legal nonconforming use shall be
deemed illegal after the use ceases for thirty (30) consecutive days.
   b.   New Uses Within an Existing Structure. When a new use/business is
proposed for an existing structure necessitating exterior alterations to the
structure, the applicant is required to obtain Development Plan approval
pursuant to Division 5 of this chapter.
   c.   New Structures. Development Plan approval pursuant to Division 5 of
this chapter is required for a new project. A "new project" includes not only
projects involving a complete redevelopment of the site, resulting in all new
construction, but shall also include projects resulting in changes to the
facade of existing buildings, or remodeling which results in an increase of the
floor area ratio of an existing development. Maintenance, such as like
replacement, or repair of dilapidated features, is not considered a new project
and is not subject to a development plan.
   d.   Joint Study Session Review. Development plan applications for
properties located within Areas 11, 12 and 13 are subject to joint study
session review by the Design Review Board, Planning Commission and Town
Council, prior to final action by the Planning Commission. The Heritage
Resource Commission shall also be included if the project involves a Town-
identified Heritage Resource.
   e.   Designated Heritage Resources or Historically Significant Resource.
Alteration of a Designated Heritage Resource or a historically significant
resource requires development plan approval pursuant to Division 5 and
subsection
32-72.8 as regards the reviewing body for the proposed alteration and the
standards of review to be considered prior to issuance of the requisite
Certificate of Approval.

Division 3
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
   32-45.22   Architectural Development Standards.
   This section sets forth specific architectural design guidelines for the
development of new structures and the remodel of existing structures which
changes the appearance in the designated Downtown Business District.
   Danville's Downtown Business District contains a mixture of historic
buildings and architectural styles in a pedestrian friendly setting. Though
considerable variation exists in the downtown with respect to architectural
styles, the overall scale and character of the downtown respects the areas'
nineteenth century origins. The different architectural styles that form a
historical context for the downtown include:
      •   Gothic Revival (169 Front Street - Vecki House);
      •   Victorian (100 School Street - Shuey/Podva House);
      •   Vernacular (411 Hartz Avenue - McCauley House);
      •   Victorian Stick (205 Railroad Avenue - Danville Depot);
      •   Neoclassic Rowhouse (146 Diablo Road - (Elliot House);
      •   Queen Anne Cottage (500 Hartz Avenue - Eddie House);
      •   Traditional Commercial Storefronts (360, 370 and 376 Hartz Avenue);
      •   Craftsman/California Bungalow (402 and 404 Hartz Avenue - George
Foster House); and
      •   Spanish Eclectic/Spanish Revival (345-349 Hartz Avenue, 201 Front
Street, McDonald's Drug Store and Danville Presbyterian Church).
   Chapter 3 - "Architectural Styles" of the Town's Design Guidelines for
Heritage Resources includes a comprehensive description of these architectural
styles. The Town's Survey of Historically Significant Resources identifies
additional styles that transition from one era to another, including types or
subsets of the Victorian era such as Italianate, Stick/Eastlake, and Colonial
Revival.
   For the thirteen (13) land use areas identified downtown, all development
standards contained in section
32-45 must be applied in a manner which ensures that the design of new
buildings is successful on a stand alone basis, while working in context with
the buildings' surroundings, allowing for effective integration of the new
building into the existing downtown fabric.
   Retail and restaurant uses are required to be the primary ground-floor uses
established in Areas 1, 2, 2A, 3 and 11, in order to promote the creation of a
pedestrian friendly environment and to provide for retail continuity.
Storefront design standards included in this section are intended to facilitate
these objectives.
   The following construction materials and detailing apply to all thirteen
(13) land use areas set forth in Division 2.
   a.   Project Design.
      1.   Design of all buildings shall be consistent with these guidelines;
corporate, chain or franchise designs are not permitted.
      2.   Use of a variety of traditional architectural styles and shapes is
permitted. Designs may relate to historic elements seen within the area, but
shall be also distinguishable as being newer than the Heritage Resources.
Imitation, period pieces, or reproduction of historic styles, such as those
seen in theme amusement parks, are not allowed.
      3.   Building detailing shall be incorporated into each of the four sides
of the building and consistent with the building's dominant architectural
style. Visible blank walls are not allowed. Walls shall be articulated through
windows, signs, lighting, vertical landscaping, or other architectural
detailing. Detailing shall be an integral part of the building design and used
appropriately throughout.
      4.   Outdoor spaces defined or partially enclosed by buildings shall be
designed to function as focal points, merchandise display area, and/ or
gathering spaces for sitting and walking as appropriate to the site.
      5.   Exterior lighting shall be addressed as an integral part of building
landscaping and design.
   b.   Building Mass and Scale.
      1.   Larger building facades shall be broken into smaller units to convey

Division 4
PARKING STANDARDS
   32-45.30   General Requirements for On-site Parking.
   a.   Applicability to Existing Land Uses. A land use existing in the
Downtown Business District as of November 21,1988, or for which a building
permit has been issued, is not subject to the requirements of this chapter
until there is a change of use/ business or expansion of the structure,
provided that on-site parking facilities now required or serving such land uses
are not reduced below these requirements in the future. A project already
approved as of November 21, 1988 shall comply with the original conditions of
approval until a new project is submitted and approved for the site. Parking
required by the original conditions of approval may be removed with approval of
the Planning Commission provided the owner demonstrates that removal is
consistent with the intent and purpose of this chapter.
   b.   Parking Computation Methodologies. Where the computation of required
off-site parking spaces results in a fractional number, the resulting
computation will be rounded to one-tenth (1/10) of a parking space. Where the
computation of required on-site parking spaces results in a fractional number,
only the fraction of one-half (1/2) or more shall be counted as one (1) parking
space. When performing computations, rounding shall not be performed until the
final result is reached.
   c.   Joint Use Parking Agreements. A joint-use parking agreement may be used
when the Town determines that all of the required parking cannot be met on-site
or in the Town's municipal parking lots. A joint-use parking agreement may be
considered when the joint-use parking is to be provided on a nearby or adjacent
lot but the distance from the adjacent parking to the proposed facility shall
not be greater than one hundred fifty (150) feet. Such parking shall be
specifically designated for the uses to which it is assigned. The same parking
spaces may not be counted toward the required parking for more than one (1) use
at a time.
         The applicant shall provide evidence to the satisfaction of the Chief
of Planning that the joint-use parking agreement provides for a specified
number of parking stalls, is recorded to run with the property and is
enforceable for a specified term.
   d.   Off-Site Parking Credit. "Off-Site Parking Credit" means that a portion
of the required parking spaces is provided on-site and/or a portion is provided
in the municipal parking lot where the same parking spaces are assigned to more
than one (1) use at one (1) time. The Off-site Parking Credit is required in
Areas 1, 2, 2A, 3 and 11.
         Because Areas 1, 2, 2A, 3 and 11 are developed with high density
retail and restaurant uses and the availability of on-site parking is limited,
a parking reduction of 20 percent will apply when it is determined that the
off-site parking credit will be used. This parking reduction will only be
allowed when a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the required parking is
purchased in the off-site public lot.
   e.   In Lieu Fees. Those properties and uses required to provide parking in
off-site municipal parking lots pursuant to Section
32-45.31 of this Code shall pay an in lieu parking fee for each space required.
The number of parking spaces used to calculate the required in lieu payment
shall be based on the applicable standards of this Code. The amount of the in
lieu parking fee per space shall be as set forth by resolution of the Town
Council, in effect at the time the applicant 1) completes an application for a
building permit or 2) initiates the land use activity that creates the demand
for additional municipal parking, whichever comes first. In calculating the in
lieu parking fee, if a credit to the property owner for Assessment District 73/
74 (i.e., the Clocktower Municipal Parking Lot) is applicable, the credit shall
not exceed the amount owed to the Town by way of the new project. Any in lieu
parking fees due to Lhe Town shall be paid at issuance of a building permit or
exercise of a land use entitlement creating the demand for additional parking,
whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 2009-02, § 2)
   f.   Tandem Parking. Tandem parking is permitted only when the parking is
used to meet the needs of employees or valet service is being provided. The
property for which tandem parking is permitted must be posted or designated as
such and the property owner must record a deed restriction.
   g.   Compact Parking. Up to thirty percent (30%) of the required parking may
be provided in compact stalls. The compact stall dimension shall measure a
minimum of eight (8) feet by sixteen (16) feet.
   h.   Historic Preservation Parking Relief. A reduction in the total number
of parking spaces required under this chapter for a property designated a
Heritage Resource shall be permitted according to the determination made by the
Town, as provided by Town approval of historic preservation incentives for the
Heritage Resource pursuant to subsection
32-72.1 of the Municipal Code.
   i.   Assessment District 73/74. Contra Costa County. Any parcel of land
located within the existing Municipal Lot Assessment District (AD 73/74) shall
receive credit for participation in that district by one (1) of the following:
      1.   If the parcel is within the one hundred percent (100%)-area of
benefit (i.e., is a property with a shared boundary with the Clocktower
equivalent to the parking demand that would be created with 100% floor area
ratio coverage, after o observance of the requisite minimum front yard setback
for retail.
      2.   If the parcel is located outside of the one hundred percent (100%)
area of benefit (i.e., is not a property with a shared boundary with the
Clocktower Municipal Parking Lot), then it shall receive full credit for the
actual on-site spaces plus full credit for the actual dollar amount paid into
AD 73/74 against payment of any in lieu fees.
   j.   Loading and Deliveries. Deliveries are encouraged in the Downtown
Business District between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. due to the
commercial density of the area and the disruptive nature of loading activities
at later times. Each Development Plan shall be required to include provisions
for off-site loading such as a designated area, parking management plan or
provisions for the use of a required parking stall to be used for loading
during off-business hours. Handicapped parking stalls may be used for
deliveries during hours in which the business being served is not open to the
public.
   k.   Unless otherwise approved, parking areas may not be used for
merchandise sales, storage, repair work, dismantling or servicing of any kind.

square footage is both less than 50% of the existing square footage of the
structure and all building additions since November 21,1988 are cumulatively
less than 50% of the original building size, the new square footage added must
comply with the new parking standards;
         Where the addition to an existing structure is proposed and the added
square footage is greater than fifty percent (50%) of the existing square
footage of the structure or the added square footage takes the structure
cumulatively, since November 21, 1988, beyond 50% of the original building
size, the entire square footage of the building, both existing and new, shall
meet the parking requirements of this chapter.

32-63   P-1 PLANNED UNIT DISTRICT.
   32-63.1   General.
   a.   P-1 Planned Unit District. All land within a P-1 district may be used
as allowed and regulated in this section.
   b.   Intent and Purpose. A large-scale integrated development, infill
development, or a General Plan special area of concern provides an opportunity
for, and requires cohesive design when flexible regulations are applied;
whereas the application of conventional regulation, designed primarily for
individual lot development, to a large-scale development, infill development,
or special area may create a monotonous and inappropriate neighborhood or
development. The planned unit P-1 district is intended to allow diversification
in the relationship of various uses, buildings, structures, lot sizes and open
spaces, ensure compatibility with surrounding land uses, and to ensure
substantial compliance with the General Plan and the intent of the Town
Municipal Code in requiring adequate standards necessary to satisfy the
requirements of the public health, safety and general welfare. These standards
shall be observed without unduly inhibiting the advantages of a large-scale
site or special area planning. The P-1 district may also be used to provide
additional zoning control by establishing site specific conditions of approval
and standards for a specific P-1 district.
(Ord. #98-07, §2)
   32-63.2   Uses.
   a.   Uses. The following uses are allowed in the P-1 district:
      1.   Any land uses permitted by an approved final development plan which
are in harmony with each other, serve to fulfill the function of the planned
unit development, and are consistent with the General Plan;
      2.   A detached single family dwelling on each legally established lot
and the accessory structures and uses normally auxiliary to it;
      3.   A second unit which complies with Section
32-76 of this chapter, if a land use permit is first obtained
   b.   Restriction. No person shall grade or clear land, erect, move, or alter
any building or structure on any land, after the effective date of its rezoning
to a P-1 district, except when in compliance with an approved final development
plan and/or this section.
   c.   Interim Exceptions. If any land has been zoned P-1 district but no
preliminary development plan approved thereon, the following may be approved:
      1.   Single Family Dwelling. Where it is established to the satisfaction
of the Chief of Planning that a vacant parcel of land is a legal lot and the
one (1) detached single family dwelling proposed to be located thereon is
consistent with the general plan, the dwelling may be placed on the lot without
being subject to the application submittal, development plan review and
approval provisions of this chapter.
      2.   Nonconforming Use. Until a final development plan is approved, any
nonconforming use lawfully existing at the time of the establishment of P-
1 zoning on that property may be repaired, rebuilt, extended, or enlarged in
accordance with Section
32-4.
(Ord. #98-07, §2)
   32-63.3   Site Minimums.
   a.   Areas. There is no minimum site area for a P-1 district. The
appropriateness of using a P-1 district shall be determined on a case-by case
basis based on the specific characteristics of the site and the need to provide
additional zoning control by establishing site specific conditions of approval
and standards for a specific P-1 District.
   (Ord. #98-07, §2)
   32-63.4   Density.
   a.   Residential. In computing the net development area to set residential
densities, use the general plan as a guide and exclude areas which are not
developable due to geologic, topographic, and natural factors (such as creeks,
floodplains, etc.), areas set aside for churches, schools, commercial use or
other nonresidential use, but include areas set aside for common open space,
outdoor recreation or parks.
   (Ord. #98-07, §2)
   32-63.5   Rezoning.
   a.   Procedure. After initiation by the planning agency or final application
approval, an area may be zoned “P-1 planned unit district” in accordance with
Title 7 of the California Government Code and this chapter, and the zoning map
of the area shall then be identified with the map symbol “P-1.”
   b.   Ordinance Plan. If an application for P-1 zoning and a preliminary or
final development plan is finally approved, the preliminary or final
development plan and any conditions attached thereto, as approved or later
amended, shall be filed with the Planning Department, and they are thereby
incorporated into this chapter and become a part of the ordinance referred to
in paragraph a. of this subsection.
   c.   Rezoning and Development Plan Application. Except as waived in writing

      1.   Building bulk, height, land coverage, visual appearance from
adjacent land, and design compatibility with existing adjoining development and
land which will remain, shall be considered and controlled.
      2.   A development's design should successfully integrate individual
buildings and the building groups with the surrounding development, other
physical features in the area, and existing development which will remain.
      3.   The design of structures should provide for harmonious composition
of mass, scale, color, and textures, with special emphasis on the transition
from one (1) building type to another, termination of groups of structures,
relationships to streets, exploitation of views, and integration of spaces and
building forms with the topography of the site and the urban or suburban
character of the area.
      4.   Provisions are to be made for an efficient, direct and convenient
system of pedestrian circulation, together with landscaping and appropriate
treatment of any public areas or lobbies.
      5.   Off-street parking and loading areas should be integrated into the
overall vehicular circulation system.
   b.   Latitude of Regulations. The Planning Commission may recommend and the
Town Council may adopt as part of the preliminary development plan, and may
require in the final development plan; standards, regulations, limitations and
restrictions which are either more or less restrictive than those specified
within an alternate zoning district which would be applicable if the P-
1 district were not proposed, and which are designed to protect and maintain
property values and community amenities in the subject community, and which
would foster and maintain the health, safety and general welfare of the
community. If standards, regulations, limitations and restrictions which are
less strict than those specified in the code are proposed, the applicant shall
prepare alternate plans. as determined necessary by the Chief of Planning,
which comply with applicable standards, regulations, limitations and
restrictions, to allow a comparison of floor area ratio between the proposed
plan and the plan which complies with all applicable standards. The floor area
ratio of the proposed project shall be limited to be comparable with the
alternate plan, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission or Town
Council, as a result of demonstrated benefits to the project and/or
neighborhood resulting from the proposed plan. The standards, regulations,
limitations and restrictions may include, but are not limited to the following:
      1.   Height limitations on buildings and structures;
      2.   Percent coverage of land by buildings and structures;
      3.   Parking ratios and areas expressed in relation to use of various

(2 1/2) years from the effective date of zoning change and plan approval;
      2.   The proposed planned unit development is consistent with the county
General Plan;
      3.   In the case of residential development, it will constitute a
residential environment of sustained desirability and stability, and will be in
harmony with the character of the surrounding neighborhood and community;
      4.   In the case of the commercial development, it is needed at the
proposed location to provide adequate commercial facilities of the type
proposed, and that traffic congestion will not likely be created by the
proposed center, or will be obviated by presently projected improvements and by
demonstrable provisions in the plan for proper entrances and exits, and by
internal provisions for traffic and parking, and that the development will be
an attractive and efficient center which will fit harmoniously into and will
have no adverse effects upon the adjacent or surrounding development;
      5.   In the case of proposed industrial development, it is fully in
conformity with the applicable performance standards, and will constitute an
efficient and well organized development, with adequate provisions for railroad
and/or truck access service and necessary storage, and that such development
will have no adverse effect upon adjacent or surrounding development; and
      6.   The development of a harmonious, integrated plan justifies
exceptions from the normal application of this Code.

ARTICLE VII
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT
32-69   SCENIC HILLSIDE AND MAJOR RIDGELINE DEVELOPMENT. *
*   Editor's Note: Section #2 of Ord. #29-84 provides as follows:
   Section 2. The requirements of this ordinance do not apply to the following:
   (1)   A project for which a building permit was issued before the effective
date of this ordinance;
   (2)   A project for which a complete building permit application was
submitted before adoption of Ordinance No. 27-84 (An Interim Ordinance to
Suspend Development Along Ridgeline Areas) or any extension thereof; or
   (3)   A valid tentative subdivision map approved before the effective date
of this ordinance. However, the development of parcels created by such
tentative subdivision maps shall not be exempt from the provisions of this
ordinance.
   32-69.1   Findings and Declaration of Intent. *
   a.   The Town Council finds that:
      1.   There are hills and ridges within the Town which because of their
physical dominance of the Town's landscape constitute significant natural
topographical features and comprise a large part of the natural open space and
scenic resources of the community;
      2.   It is desirable to require in these areas an alternative approach to
traditional and conventional flat land practices of residential development, to
keep grading and cut and fill operations consistent with the retention of the
natural character of the hillside and ridgeline areas, and to preserve the
predominant views both from and of the hillside and ridgeline areas;
      3.   Passive open spaces are desirable and necessary to maintain the
quality of life enjoyed by the residents of the community;
      4.   The retention of scenic hillsides and ridgelines in as near a
natural state as is feasibly consistent with the rights granted by law to
property owners to develop their properties is important to the community's
aesthetic qualities and will preserve a desirable visual identity of the Town;
      5.   Hillside development requires special attention to the provision of
public facilities and improvements in order to protect the heath and safety of
human life and property;
      6.   The repair and stabilization of unsafe slide areas is crucial to the
health, safety and welfare of the community, and to the preservation of both
public and private investments in such areas;
      7.   The Town recognizes that each property has its own unique
characteristics, including, but not limited to topography, tree cover and
visual impact. The regulations in this chapter are intended to provide
flexibility in the treatment of the development of individual properties as
indicated by their uniqueness rather than to provide a fixed set of strict
standards applicable in the same manner to all properties. In this way each
property can be developed to its full potential consistent with the land use
constraints as imposed by this chapter and other applicable land use
regulations; and
      8.   The imposition of the regulations imposed by this chapter may
protect the Town from liability for soils instability by requiring that
consideration be given to the presence of critically expansive soils or other
soils problems.
   b.   The purposes of this section are to:
      1.   Preserve significant features of scenic hillsides and major
ridgeline areas in essentially their natural state as part of a comprehensive
open space system;
      2.   Keep the semi-rural qualities of the Town by preserving its open and
uncluttered natural topographic features;
      3.   Encourage in these areas an alternative approach to conventional
flat land practices of development;
      4.   Keep grading and cut and fill operations consistent with the
retention of the natural character of the scenic hillsides and major
ridgelines;
      5.   Minimize the water runoff and soil erosion problems incurred in
adjustment of the terrain to meet on-site and off-site development needs;
      6.   Insure that the open space as shown on any Development Plan is
consistent with the open space element shown on the General Plan;
      7.   Preserve the predominant views of the scenic hillsides and major
ridgelines and to retain the sense of identity and image that these areas now
impart to the Town and its environs;
      8.   Require retention of trees and other vegetation which stabilize
slopes, retain moisture, minimize erosion and enhance the natural scenic beauty
and safety qualities of the hills;
      9.   Require planting whenever appropriate to maintain necessary cut-and-
fill slopes, to stabilize them by plant roots, and to conceal the raw soil from
view; and
      10.   Require retention of natural landmarks and prominent natural
features that enhance the character of the Town. (Ord. #29-84, §8-5001; Ord.
#2002-03, §2)
*   Editor's Note: Section #2 of Ord. #29-84 provides as follows:
   Section 2. The requirements of this ordinance do not apply to the following:
   (1)   A project for which a building permit was issued before the effective
date of this ordinance;
   (2)   A project for which a complete building permit application was
submitted before adoption of Ordinance No. 27-84 (An Interim Ordinance to
Suspend Development Along Ridgeline Areas) or any extension thereof; or
   (3)   A valid tentative subdivision map approved before the effective date
of this ordinance. However, the development of parcels created by such
tentative subdivision maps shall not be exempt from the provisions of this
ordinance.
   32-69.2   Definitions.
   In this section unless the context otherwise requires:
   Major ridgeline areas means lands situated at the crest of a range of hills
or mountains. When referring to land or areas to which this section applies,
major ridgeline areas shall be as identified on Figure 10 of the Danville 2010
General Plan, as may be amended from time to time.
   Scenic hillside areas means lands with elevated land formations with unique
visual character. When referring to land or areas to which this section
applies, scenic hillside areas shall be as identified on Figure 10 of the
Danville 2010 General Plan, as may be amended from time to time. (Ord. #29-84,
§8-5002; Ord. #2002-03, §2)
   32-69.3   Applicability and Relation to Other Land Use Regulations.
   a.   This section applies to scenic hillside and major ridgeline areas which
are shown and defined as such on Figure 10 of the Danville 2010 General Plan,
as may be amended from time to time.
   b.   Both the regulation established under the zoning district to which the
land is classified and this section shall apply to lands identified as scenic
hillside and major ridgeline areas. If there is a conflict between this section
and the land use regulations established under the zoning district, this
section and the regulations, requirements, and the conditions imposed under the
authority of this section shall control. (Ord. #29-84, §8-5003; Ord. #2002-03,
§2)
   32-69.4   Uses and Development of Lands Identified as Scenic Hillside or
Major Ridgeline Areas.
   a.   Permitted Uses. The uses and conditional uses permitted on lands
identified as scenic hillside or major ridgeline areas shall be as established
under the zoning district in which the site is located.
   b.   Prohibited Development. No development is permitted within one hundred
(100) feet (measured vertically) of the centerline of a major ridgeline (the
line running along the highest portion), except when an exception is granted by
the Planning Commission in accordance with subsection
32-69.10.
   c.   Development Prohibited Without Permit. Except as provided under
subsection
32-69.12, no person may grade, clear, construct upon or alter scenic hillside
or major ridgeline areas without approval granted under this section.
   d.   Subdivisions. The subdivision of lands identified as major ridgeline or
scenic hillside areas shall not result in the creation of a building site
within one hundred (100) feet (measured vertically) below the centerline of a
major ridgeline, the creation of a lot that does not have a building site on a
slope less than thirty percent (30%) in steepness, or in any way results in a
building site which does not comply with any of the requirements within this
section.
   e.   Grading. No grading which results in the movement of twenty-five (25)
or more cubic yards of soil within lands identified as scenic hillside or major
ridgeline area shall be allowed without a hillside grading permit. A scenic
hillside or major ridgeline development plan permit may be required, at the
discretion of the Chief of Planning, prior to the issuance of a hillside
grading permit. Factors in determining the need for a scenic hillside or major
ridgeline development plan permit shall include visibility of the site, impacts
on mature trees, drainage issues, the steepness of the site, and geotechnical
stability. The movement of one hundred (100) or more cubic yards of soil shall
not be allowed without the approval of both a hillside grading permit and
scenic hillside or major ridgeline development plan permit.
   f.   Development Standards. No person may construct improvements on lands
identified as scenic hillside or major ridgeline areas, nor shall any building
or other permit be issued, unless or until the applicant has complied with the
development standards contained within subsection
32-69.7.
(Ord. #29-84, §8-5004; Ord. #2002-03, § 2; Ord. #08-07, § 2)
   32-69.5   Application for Scenic Hillside or Major Ridgeline Development
Permit.
   a.   Requirement for Permit. A person who desires to erect a structure on,
or to grade or improve lands identified as scenic hillside or major ridgeline
areas, or to make exterior modifications to existing structures located upon
such lands, must receive a scenic hillside or major ridgeline development plan
permit. The application may be combined with an application for a land use
permit, tentative subdivision map, rezoning, or other land use entitlement.
   b.   Application and Information. An applicant shall file an application on
a form provided by the Town. The Chief of Planning will also require
supplemental plans and information needed to properly review the application,
including, but not limited to, the following:
      1.   Site Development Plan. A site development plan, drawn at a one (1)
inch equals twenty (20) feet scale (or as otherwise authorized by the Chief of
Planning), showing the location and outline of all existing and proposed
structures, streets, parking areas, retaining walls, limits of grading,
utilities, and the location of nearby homes on adjacent properties.
      2.   Tree Survey Plan. An accurately drawn tree survey plan, drawn at a

the ground. The plan shall indicate any trees which are proposed to be removed.
      3.   Tree Report. A tree report, prepared by a certified arborist and
listing all trees shown on the tree survey plan. For all trees determined to be
protected trees, as defined by Section
32-79, the report shall evaluate the health of the trees and shall identify any
mitigation measures that should be employed to maximize the long term health of
the trees. If development is proposed to occur within the dripline of any
protected tree, the report shall evaluate the potential impact of the
development of the tree(s), and recommend mitigation measures to prevent or
minimize damage to the tree(s).
      4.   Geotechnical and Soils Report. A preliminary geotechnical and soils
investigation and report prepared by a certified engineering geologist licensed
by the State of California or by a registered civil engineer qualified in soils
mechanics by the State of California. The report shall identify any significant
geologic problems, critically expansive soils or other unstable soil condition
which, if not corrected, may lead to structural damage or future geologic
problems both on and off the site. The report shall include recommendations for
corrective measures deemed necessary to prevent potential damage to the
proposed development and adjacent properties. The report shall take into
consideration geotechnical and soil issues related to the specific design and
features of the subject development plan application, as found necessary by the
City Engineer.

proposed structure.
      11.   Story Poles/Footprint Stakes. Unless otherwise approved by the
Planning Division, the applicant shall be required to install story poles and
to stake and paint, or chalk, the outline of the proposed structure's
footprint. The story poles shall be constructed to depict the maximum height of
the primary ridgeline of the structure. Story poles shall be constructed using
sturdy materials. Red flags shall be affixed to the top of each story pole. The
story poles and stakes shall be established on the site a minimum of ten (10)
days prior to any Design Review Board, Planning Commission and/or Town Council
meeting on the project, and shall be maintained as required until after each
hearing. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in a delay in the
hearing schedule for the project.
   c.   Designation of Reviewing Body. The reviewing body is the authority
charged with the duty of acting on a scenic hillside or major ridgeline
development plan request. For an application that requires only grading or
building permit approval for lands identified as scenic hillside areas, the
Chief of Planning shall be the reviewing body. At the discretion of the Chief
of Planning, such application may be referred to the Design Review Board and/or
the Planning Commission for consideration. In all other cases requiring
processing of a scenic hillside or major ridgeline development plan
application, the Planning Commission shall be the approving body. (Ord. #29-84,
§8-5005; Ord. #2002-03, §2)
   32-69.6   Minimum Lot Area for Lands Identified as Scenic Hillside or Major
Ridgeline Areas.
   The minimum lot area shall not be less than that prescribed by the
applicable land use district and which is consistent with the general plan.
However, the required lot areas may be required to be larger than the minimum
allowable lot size when the reviewing body finds that it is necessary to do so
because of the physical terrain, such as slopes greater than thirty (30%)
percent or areas of geotechnical instability, in order to assure that there
will be suitable building site for the approved use. In determining whether it
is necessary to increase or decrease the lot area, the reviewing body shall
apply the standards set forth in subsection
32-69.7. (Ord. #29-84, §8-5006; Ord. #2002-03, §2)
   32-69.7   Hillside Development Standards.
   Development of lands identified as scenic hillside of major ridgeline areas
shall comply with the following development standards.
   a.   Structure Height. The maximum height of the primary residence
constructed on lands identified as major ridgeline or scenic hillside areas
shall be twenty-eight (28) feet. For homes with a finished grade building
elevation located within twenty-eight (28) feet (measured vertically) below the
centerline of a major ridgeline (requiring approval of an exception as outlined
in this section), the maximum height of the primary residence shall be limited
to twenty-four (24) feet. The maximum height of any accessory structure on such
lands shall be fifteen (15) feet.
      The maximum allowable height of any structures shall be measured
vertically, at any point of the footprint of the proposed structure, from
either natural grade or finished grade building elevation, whichever is lower.
These height limits do not apply to chimneys or other minor architectural
features.
   b.   Mass. The design of the primary residence or accessory structure(s)
shall minimize the perception of excessive bulk. Structures constructed on
slopes shall utilize stepped foundations. Architecture shall include sufficient
variation to avoid large flat wall areas and to create shade and shadow. Two-
story vertical walls and long, uninterrupted roof ridgelines shall be avoided.
   c.   Colors/Materials. Exterior colors for all structures shall be muted
with the intent of blending into the surrounding natural environment. Colors
such as browns and tans are considered appropriate on lands identified as
scenic hillside or major ridgeline areas. Natural materials such as wood siding
are preferred. Roof materials shall be dark in color and non-reflective, or as
otherwise approved through the permit process. Red tile roofs are expressly
prohibited. Mockups of the exterior colors shall be provided on the structure,
as determined necessary by the Chief of Planning, for final review and approval
by the Planning Board (whichever was the approving body) prior to the painting
of the structure.
      Any future addition shall match the approved colors and materials for the
primary structure. Any change to the approved colors and materials shall
require approval of a revised scenic hillside or major ridgeline development
plan application. A deed notification shall be required to be recorded to run
with the title of the property which notifies future property owners of the
color and materials restrictions.
   d.   Landscaping. When a development is proposed on lands identified as
scenic hillside or major ridgeline areas, tree planting to help screen the
development from view shall be established. Trees shall be of a native variety
and shall be planted in a natural pattern to break up the mass of the
structure. Palm trees shall not be allowed (see hillside/ridgeline design
guidelines for recommended tree list). Trees shall be minimum fifteen (15)
gallon box specimen size. Depending on the visibility and need for immediate
screening, trees may be required to be twenty-four (24) to forty-eight (48)
inch box specimen size. Automatic drip irrigation for the trees shall be
required until the trees are established, with a minimum of two (2) years. The
trees shall be maintained in a healthy growing condition on the site.
      When trees are required to be planted to mitigate visual impacts of a
proposed development, the applicant shall submit a cash deposit, or other
security acceptable to the Chief of Planning, in the minimum amount of five
thousand ($5,000) dollars with a maximum amount of fifteen thousand ($15,000)
dollars. After two (2) full growing seasons, the Planning Division shall
inspect the health of the trees that were required to be planted. Prior to the
Town's release of the security deposit, the applicant shall be required to
replace any of the required trees that have not survived. Where replacement
trees are required to be planted, the two (2) year security period shall be
repeated. However, upon approval by the Chief of Planning, the amount of the
security may be reduced to reflect the estimated value of the replacement
trees.
      Prior to the issuance of permits to initiated the approved development,
the applicant shall be required to record a declaration to run with the title
of the property to notify subsequent property owners of the obligation to
maintain the required trees on the site in a healthy condition.
   e.   Vegetation. Existing native vegetation on a site proposed for
development, including trees, shrubs, and grasses, shall be preserved to the
extent possible, during and after construction, and shall be consistent with
any recommendations contained within an arborists report prepared for the
project.
   f.   Grading. Grading of a site shall be limited to the minimum level
necessary to reasonably develop the site. Establishment of large flat pads and
yard areas on slopes greater than twenty (20%) percent shall be discouraged.
The use of extensive retaining wall systems to develop building pad areas and/
or yard areas serving the residence shall be avoided.
   g.   Fencing. All fencing shall be open wire fencing. Fence posts shall be
natural wood color, or painted a dark color. Solid wood fencing within thirty
(30) feet of the primary structure may be considered through the development
plan review process where such fences are found not to result in negative
visual impacts.
   h.   Lighting. Exterior lighting shall be established and maintained at
minimal functional levels of brightness. Light sources shall be screened to
direct light onsite and to screen the light source from offsite views. Light
fixtures shall be kept low to the ground. (Ord. #29-84, §8-5007;Ord. #2002-03,
§2)
   32-69.8   Additional Development Requirements.
   The reviewing body may impose additional restrictions or requirements
related to the development of a parcel located within identified scenic
hillside or major ridgeline areas. These additional restrictions may be
required if it is found that the parcel requires additional protection because
of its prominence and location or if it is determined that there may be
exceptional hazards related to its development. Such additional restrictions or
requirements must be consistent with the requirements of this section. (Ord.
#29-84, §8-5008; Ord. #2002-03, §2)
   32-69.9   Dedication.
   The reviewing body may require as a condition of approval the dedication of
(a) scenic easement(s) covering the remaining undeveloped areas of a parcel
approved for development. No development that alters the natural appearance of
the land, including the construction of structures or grading, shall be allowed
within the area covered by the scenic easement(s). Non-native plantings, such
as vineyards or orchards may be considered on a case by case basis through the
development review process. (Ord. #29-84, §8-5009; Ord. #2002-03, §2)
   32-69.10   Exception to Permit Development Within One Hundred (100) Feet of
Major Ridgeline.
    An exception to modify paragraphs b. and d. of subsection
32-69.4 to permit development within one hundred (100) feet (measured
vertically) of the centerline of a major ridgeline may be granted by the
Planning Commission in accordance with the zoning ordinance when the Planning
Commission finds any one (1) of the following:
   a.   Due to the application of this section, a structure could not otherwise
be constructed on the parcel;
   b.   Development is designed to take place as far beneath the centerline of
the major ridgeline as practical; or
   c.   The proposed siting, grading, landscaping and architecture are such
that the development will not conflict with the purposes set forth in
subsection
32-69.1.b. (Ord. #29-84, §8-5010; Ord. #2002-03, §2)
   32-69.11   Map.
   a.   Figure 10 of the Danville 2010 General Plan Map, showing the land
subject to this section and referred to in subsection
32-69.3a, is attached to this section and incorporated by reference. *
   b.   If, in fixing the boundaries of lands identified as scenic hillside or
major ridgeline areas as shown on Figure 10 of the Danville 2010 General Plan
in relation to a specific parcel of property, there is uncertainty or dispute
as to whether a property is subject to this section, the applicant shall
prepare a precise topographic study fixing the location of the property in
relation to the centerline of the pertinent adjoining major ridgeline. (Ord.
#29-84, §8-5011; Ord. #2002-03, §2)

32-69.
   This section does not apply to:
   a.   Emergency site maintenance and emergency site repairs;
   b.   A one-time, first-story building addition, with a maximum height of
fifteen (15) feet, containing less than one hundred (100) square feet of floor
area; or
   c.   Animal-secure wire fencing;
   d.   As to scenic hillside areas only, the performance of work for which
neither a building permit, grading permit, conditional use permit, subdivision
map approval or other land use entitlement is required. (Ord. #29-84, §8-5012;
Ord. #2002-03, §2)
   32-69.13   Exception.
   Any proposed development within lands identified as major ridgeline or
scenic hillside areas that is not consistent with the development standards
contained within this section shall require the approval of an exception by the
Planning Commission during a noticed public hearing. In order to grant an
exception, the Planning Commission must determine that the exception will not
result in development which is contrary to the purposes of this section as set
forth in subsection 32.69.1.b. (Ord. #29-84, §8-5013; Ord. #2002-03, §2)
   32-69.14   Appeal.

32-70   WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES.
   32-70.1   Title.  
   This chapter shall be titled the "Wireless Communication Facilities
Ordinance for the Town of Danville." (Ord. #2018-07, § 2)
   32-70.2   Purpose and Intent.
   a.   The Town of Danville intends this chapter to establish reasonable,
uniform and comprehensive standards and procedures for wireless facilities
deployment, construction, installation, collocation, modification, operation,
relocation and removal within the Town's territorial boundaries, consistent
with and to the extent permitted under federal and California state law. The
standards and procedures contained in this Chapter are intended to, and should
be applied to, consistent with and to the extent permitted under federal and
California state law, protect and promote public health, safety and welfare,
and also balance the benefits that flow from robust, advanced wireless services
with the Town's local values, which include without limitation the aesthetic

application requirements, forms, checklists, guidelines, informational handouts
and other related materials that the Chief of Planning finds necessary,
appropriate or useful for processing any application governed under this
chapter. All applications shall, at a minimum, require the applicant to
demonstrate that the proposed project will be in planned compliance with all
applicable health and safety laws, regulations or other rules, which includes
without limitation all building codes, electric codes and all FCC rules for
human exposure to RF emissions. All applications for wireless facilities in the
public rights-of-way shall also contain sufficient evidence (such as a valid
CPCN) of the applicant's regulatory status as a telephone corporation under the
California Public Utilities Code. The Town Council further authorizes the Chief
of Planning to establish other reasonable rules and regulations, which may
include without limitation regular hours for appointments with applicants, as
the Chief of Planning deems necessary or appropriate to organize, document and
manage the application intake process. All such rules and regulations must be
in written form and publicly stated to provide applicants with prior notice.
   c.   Procedures for a Duly Filed Application. Any application for a Land Use
Permit or section 6409 approval will not be considered duly filed unless
submitted in accordance with the procedures in this section
32-70.6.c.
      1.   Pre-Submittal Conference. Before either planning or building
application submittal, the applicant must schedule and attend a pre-submittal
conference with the Chief of Planning for all proposed projects that: (1)
require Planning Commission approval; (2) involve more than five wireless
facilities in the public right-of-way; (3) involve any wireless facilities
proposed to be located in the public rights-of-way in or within 250 feet from a
residential district; or (4) involve a Section 6409 collocation, modification
or other change to an existing camouflaged or concealed facility. Pre-submittal
conferences for all other proposed projects are strongly encouraged but not
required. The pre-submittal conference is intended to streamline the review
process through informal discussion that includes, without limitation, the
appropriate project classification and review process, any latent issues in
connection with the proposed or existing wireless tower or base station,
including compliance with generally applicable rules for public health and
safety; potential concealment issues or concerns (if applicable); coordination
with other Town departments responsible for application review; and application
completeness issues. To mitigate unnecessary delays due to application
incompleteness, applicants are encouraged (but not required) to bring any draft
applications or other materials so that Town staff may provide informal
feedback and guidance about whether such applications or other materials may be
incomplete or unacceptable. The Planning Division shall use reasonable efforts
to provide the applicant with an appointment within five working days after
receiving a written request and any applicable fee or deposit to reimburse the
Town for its reasonable costs to provide the services rendered in the pre-
submittal conference.
      2.   Submittal Appointment. All applications must be submitted to the
Town at a pre-scheduled appointment with the Chief of Planning. Applicants may
generally submit one application per appointment, but may schedule successive
appointments for multiple applications whenever feasible and not prejudicial to
other applicants. The Chief of Planning shall use reasonable efforts to provide
the applicant with an appointment within five working days after the Chief of
Planning receives a written request and, if applicable, confirms that the
applicant complied with the pre-submittal conference requirement. Any
application received without an appointment, whether delivered in-person, by
mail or through any other means, will not be considered duly filed unless the
applicant received a written exemption from the Chief of Planning at a pre-
submittal conference.
   d.   Applications Deemed Withdrawn. To promote efficient review and timely
decisions, any application governed under this chapter will be automatically
deemed withdrawn by the applicant when the applicant fails to tender a
substantive response to the Planning Division within 90 calendar days after the
Chief of Planning deems the application incomplete in a written notice to the
applicant. The Chief of Planning may, in the Chief of Planning's discretion,
grant a written extension for up to an additional 30 calendar days when the
applicant submits a written request prior to the 90th day that shows good cause
to grant the extension. Delays due to circumstances outside the applicant's
reasonable control will be considered good cause to grant the extension.
   e.   Peer and Independent Consultant Review. The Town Council authorizes the
Chief of Planning to, in the Chief of Planning's discretion, select and retain
an independent consultant with specialized training, experience and/or
expertise in telecommunications issues satisfactory to the Chief of Planning in
connection any permit application. The Chief of Planning may request an
independent consultant review on any issue that involves specialized or expert
knowledge in connection with wireless facilities deployment or permit
applications for wireless facilities, which include without limitation:
      1.   permit application completeness and/or accuracy;
      2.   pre-construction planned compliance with applicable regulations for
human exposure to RF emissions;
      3.   post-construction actual compliance with applicable regulations for
human exposure to RF emissions.
      4.   whether and to what extent a proposed project will address a gap in
the applicant's wireless services;
      5.   whether and to what extent any technically feasible and/or
potentially available alternative sites or concealment techniques may exist;
      6.   the applicability, reliability and/ or sufficiency of any
information, analyses or methodologies used by the applicant to reach any
conclusions about any issue with the Town's discretion to review;
      7.   any other issue identified by the Chief of Planning that requires
expert or specialized knowledge.
   f.   The Chief of Planning may request that the independent consultant
prepare written reports, testify at public meetings, hearings and/or appeals
and attend meetings with Town staff and/or the applicant. In the event that the
Chief of Planning elects to retain an independent consultant in connection with
any permit application, the applicant shall be responsible for the reasonable
costs in connection with the services provided, which may include without
limitation any costs incurred by the independent consultant to attend and
participate in any meetings or hearings. Before the independent consultant may
perform any services, the applicant shall tender to the Town a deposit in an
amount equal to the estimated cost for the services to be provided, as
determined by the Chief of Planning. The Chief of Planning may request
additional deposits as reasonably necessary to ensure sufficient funds are
available to cover the reasonable costs in connection with the independent
consultant's services. In the event that the deposit exceeds the total costs
for consultant's services, the Chief of Planning shall promptly return any
unused funds to the applicant after the wireless facility has been installed
and passes a final inspection by the Building Official or his or her designee.
In the event that the reasonable costs for the independent consultant's
services exceed the deposit, the Chief of Planning shall invoice the applicant
for the balance. The Town shall not issue any construction or grading permit to
any applicant with any unpaid deposit requests or invoices. (Ord. #2018-07, §
2)
   32-70.7   Development Standards.
   a.   Preferred Locations. When evaluating an application for a Land Use
Permit for compliance with this chapter, the approval authority will take into
account whether any or more preferred locations are technically feasible and
potentially available. Any locations within the downtown business district,
within 250 feet from a residential dwelling, attached to a decorative light
standard or otherwise not listed below in this section
32-70.7 shall be considered "discouraged." All applicants for a Land Use Permit
must propose new wireless facilities in locations according to the following
preferences, ordered from most preferred to least preferred:
      1.   Private property and existing or replacement structures in the
public rights-of-way outside the downtown business district and not within 250
feet from a residential dwelling;
      2.   Private property and existing or replacement structures in the
public rights-of-way within general open space districts and not within 250
feet from a residential dwelling;
      3.   Private property and existing or replacement structures in the
public rights-of-way within public and semi-public districts and not within 250
feet from a residential dwelling;
      4.   New, non-replacement structures in the public rights-of-way within
general open space districts and not within 250 feet from a residential
dwelling; and
      5.   New, non-replacement structures in the public rights-of-way within
public and semi-public districts and not within 250 feet from a residential
dwelling.
      6.   Existing or replacement structures in the public rights-of-way on
major arterial streets not within 125 feet of a residential dwelling;
      7.   New, non-replacement structures in the public rights-of-way on major
arterial streets not within 125 feet of a residential dwelling.
   b.   General Development Standards. All new wireless facilities and
collocations, modifications or other changes to existing wireless facilities
that require a Land Use Permit under this chapter must conform to the generally
applicable development standards in this section
32-70.7.b.
      1.   Concealment. All wireless facilities must be concealed to the
maximum extent feasible with design elements and techniques that mimic or blend
with the underlying support structure, surrounding environment and adjacent
uses. In addition, wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way may not
unreasonably subject the public use, for any purpose including expressive or
aesthetic purposes, to inconvenience, discomfort, trouble, annoyance,
hindrance, impediment or obstruction.
      2.   Overall Height. All wireless facilities must be compliant with the
maximum height limits applicable in the subject land use district; provided,
however, that (1) completely stealth wireless facilities on private property in
a preferred location may exceed the maximum height limit by not more than 10
feet; (2) concealed wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way on poles
with electrical lines may exceed the maximum height limit by not more than the
minimum separation from electrical lines required by CPUC General Order 95,
plus four feet; and (3) concealed wireless facilities in the public rights-of-
way on poles without electrical lines may exceed the maximum height limit by
not more than four feet.
      3.   Setbacks. Wireless facilities on private property must be compliant
with all setback requirements applicable in the subject land use district.
      4.   Noise. Wireless facilities and all transmission equipment must
comply with all noise regulations and shall not exceed, either individually or
cumulatively, such regulations. The approval authority may require the
applicant to incorporate appropriate noise-baffling materials and/ or
strategies to avoid any ambient noise from equipment reasonably likely to
exceed the applicable noise regulations.
      5.   Landscaping. All wireless facilities must include landscape features
and a landscape maintenance plan when proposed to be placed in a landscaped
area. The approval authority may require additional landscape features to
screen the wireless facility from public view, avoid or mitigate potential
adverse impacts on adjacent properties or otherwise enhance the concealment
required under this section
32-70.7.b.l0. All plants proposed or required must be native and/or drought-
resistant.
      6.   Site Security Measures. Wireless facilities may incorporate
reasonable and appropriate site security measures, such as locks and anti-
climbing devices, to prevent unauthorized access, theft or vandalism. All
wireless facilities shall be constructed from graffiti-resistant materials. The
approval authority may require additional concealment elements as the approval
authority finds necessary to blend the security measures and other improvements
into the natural and/ or built environment. The approval authority shall not
approve barbed wire, razor ribbon, electrified fences or any similar security
measures.
      7.   Backup Power Sources. The approval authority may not approve
permanent backup power sources within the public rights-of-way that emit noise
or exhaust fumes.
      8.   Lights. Wireless facilities may not include exterior lights other
than as may be required under FAA, FCC, other applicable governmental
regulations or applicable pole owner policies related to public or worker
safety. All exterior lights permitted or required to be installed must be
installed in locations and within enclosures that mitigates illumination
impacts on other properties to the maximum extent feasible. Any lights
associated with the electronic equipment shall be appropriately shielded from
public view. The provisions in this subsection shall not be interpreted to
prohibit installations on street lights or the installation of luminaires on
new poles when required by the approval authority.
      9.   Signage; Advertisements. All wireless facilities must include
signage that accurately identifies the equipment owner/operator, the owner/
operator's site name or identification number and a toll-free number to the
owner/operator's network operations center. Wireless facilities may not bear
any other signage or advertisements unless expressly approved by the Town,
required by law or recommended under FCC or other United States governmental
agencies for compliance with RF emissions regulations.
      10.   Future Collocations and Expansions. To the extent feasible and
aesthetically desirable, all new wireless facilities should be designed and
sited in a manner that accommodates potential future collocations and equipment
installations that can be integrated into the proposed wireless facility or its
associated structures with no or negligible visual changes to the outward
appearance. The approval authority may waive the requirements in this section
32-70.7.b.10 when the approval authority determines future collocations at a
proposed wireless facility would be aesthetically undesirable.
      11.   Utilities. All cables and connectors for telephone, primary
electric and other similar utilities must be routed underground to the extent
feasible in conduits large enough to accommodate future collocated wireless
facilities. To the extent feasible, undergrounded cables and wires must
transition directly into the pole base without any external doghouse. Meters,
panels, disconnect switches and other associated improvements must be placed in
inconspicuous locations to the extent possible. The approval authority shall
not approve new overhead utility lines or service drops merely because
compliance with the undergrounding requirements would increase the project
cost. Microwave or other wireless backhaul is discouraged when it would involve
a separate and unconcealed antenna.
      12.   Compliance with Laws. All wireless facilities must be designed and
sited in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws,
regulations, rules, restrictions and conditions, which includes without
limitation the California Building Standards Code, Americans with Disabilities
Act, General Plan and any applicable specific plan, the Danville Municipal Code
and any conditions or restrictions in any permit or other governmental approval
issued by any public agency with jurisdiction over the project.
      13.   Public Safety. All wireless facilities shall not interfere with
access to a fire hydrant, fire station, fire escape, water valve, underground
vault, valve housing structure or any other public health or safety facility.
No person shall install, use or maintain any facilities, which in whole or in
part rest upon, in or over any public right-of-way, when such installation, use
or maintenance endangers or is reasonably likely to endanger the safety of
persons or property, or when such site or location is used for public utility
purposes, public transportation purposes or other governmental use, or when
such facilities unreasonably interfere with or unreasonably impede the flow of
pedestrian or vehicular traffic including any legally parked or stopped
vehicle, the ingress into or egress from any residence or place of business,
the use of poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes,
permitted sidewalk dining, permitted street furniture or other objects
permitted at or near the location where the wireless facilities are located.
   c.   Design Guidelines. The Chief of Planning may develop, and from time to
time amend, design guidelines consistent with the generally applicable design
regulations to clarify the aesthetic and public safety goals and standards in
this chapter for Town staff, applicants and the public. The design guidelines
shall provide more detailed standards to implement the general principals
articulated in this section
32-70.7, and may include specific standards for particular wireless facilities
or site locations, but shall not unreasonably discriminate between functionally
equivalent service providers. The design guidelines, and any subsequent
amendments, shall not be effective unless approved by a resolution adopted by
the Planning Commission. In the event that a conflict arises between the
development standards specified in this chapter and the design guidelines
adopted under this section
32-70.7.C, the development standards specified in this chapter shall control.
(Ord. #2018-07, § 2)

   a.   General Notice Requirements. Except as provided in section
32-70.8.b, public notice in accordance with Danville Municipal Code §
32-4.9 shall be given for all applications for a Land Use Permit governed under
this chapter.
   b.   Deemed-Approval Notice. Not more than 30 days before the applicable
shot clock expires, and in addition to any public notice required prior to a
decision, an applicant for a Land Use Permit must provide a posted notice at
the project site that contains (1) a statement the project will be
automatically deemed approved pursuant to California Government Code § 65964.1
unless the Town approves or denies the application or the applicant voluntarily
agrees to toll the timeframe for review within the next 30 days; (2) a general
description for the proposed project; (3) the applicant's name and contact
information as provided on the application submitted to the Town; and (4)
contact information for the Planning Division. The public notice required under
this section
32-70.8.C will be deemed given when the applicant delivers written notice to
the Planning Division that shows the appropriate notice has been posted at the
project site. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, the
approval authority shall be permitted to act on an application for a Land Use
Permit at any time so long as any applicable prior public notice in this
section
32-70.8.C has occurred.
   c.   Decision Notice. Within five calendar days after the approval authority
acts on a Land Use Permit application governed under this chapter or before the
shot clock expires (whichever occurs first), the approval authority or its
designee shall send a written notice to the applicant. In the event that the
approval authority denies the application (with or without prejudice), the
written notice to the applicant must contain (1) the reasons for the decision
and (2) instructions for how and when to file an appeal. (Ord. #2018-07, § 2)
   32-70.9   Decisions and Appeals.
   a.   Required Findings. The approval authority may approve or conditionally
approve an application for a Land Use Permit submitted under this chapter when
the approval authority finds all of the following:
      1.   The approval authority can make all the findings required for a Land
Use Permit in accordance with Danville Municipal Code §
32-3.5;
      2.   The proposed wireless facility complies with all applicable
development standards in section
32-70.7 and any applicable provisions in the Town's design guidelines; and
      3.   The applicant has demonstrated that its proposed wireless facility
will be in compliance with all applicable FCC regulations and guidelines for
human exposure to RF emissions; and
      4.   The applicant has proposed to place the wireless facility in the
most-preferred location or, if the wireless facility is not proposed in the
most-preferred location, the applicant has demonstrated a good-faith effort to
identify and evaluate more-preferred alternative locations through a meaningful
comparative analysis; and
      5.   The applicant has provided the approval authority with a meaningful
comparative analysis that shows all more-preferred alternative designs
identified in the administrative record are either technically infeasible or
unavailable.
   b.   Conditional Approvals; Denials without Prejudice. Subject to any
applicable federal or California laws, nothing in this chapter is intended to
limit the approval authority's ability to conditionally approve or deny without
prejudice any Land Use Permit application governed under this chapter as may be
necessary or appropriate to protect and promote the public health, safety and
welfare, and to advance the goals or policies in the General Plan and any
specific plan, the Danville Municipal Code and/ or this chapter.
   c.   Limited Exception. In the event that an applicant claims that strict
compliance with the development standards in section
32-70.7 would effectively prohibit the applicant's ability to provide personal
wireless services, the Planning Commission may grant a limited exception from
such requirements in accordance with this section
32-70.C.
      1.   Required Findings for a Limited Exception. The Planning Commission
shall not grant any limited exception unless the applicant shows that:
         i.   The proposed wireless facility qualifies as a "personal wireless
service facility" as defined in 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(C)(ii), as may be amended
or superseded;
         ii.   The applicant has provided the Planning Commission with a
reasonable and clearly defined technical service objective to be achieved by
the proposed wireless facility;
         iii.   The applicant has provided the Planning Commission with a
written statement that contains a detailed and fact-specific explanation as to
why the proposed wireless facility cannot be deployed in compliance with the
applicable provisions in this chapter;
         iv.   The applicant has provided the Planning Commission with a
meaningful comparative analysis with the factual reasons why all alternative
locations and/or designs identified in the administrative record (whether
suggested by the applicant, the Town, public comments or any other source) are
not technically feasible or potentially available to reasonably achieve the
applicant's reasonable and clearly defined technical service objective to be
achieved by the proposed wireless facility; and
         v.   The applicant has demonstrated to the Planning Commission that
the proposed location and design is the least non-compliant configuration that
will reasonably achieve the applicant's reasonable and clearly defined
technical service objective to be achieved by the proposed wireless facility,
which includes without limitation a meaningful comparative analysis into
multiple smaller or less intrusive wireless facilities dispersed throughout the
intended service area.
      2.   Scope. Any limited exception shall be narrowly tailored to ensure
that any deviations from the development standards in section
32-70.7 are no greater than necessary to avoid an effective prohibition of the
applicant's personal wireless services. Limited exceptions shall be based on
the facts and circumstances of the applicant, its demonstrated technical
service objectives at the time the exception is granted and the proposed
wireless facility, and shall not be deemed to establish any precedent for
similar deviations for the same or any other applicant, location or wireless
facility.
   d.   Appeals. Within ten (10) days after the approval authority approves or
denies any application for a Land Use Permit, any interested person may file an
appeal for cause in accordance with the provisions in Danville Municipal Code §
32-4.7; provided, however, that appeals from an approval shall not be permitted
when based solely on the environmental effects from radio frequency emissions
that are compliant with applicable FCC regulations and guidelines. (Ord. #2018-
07, § 2)
   32-70.10   Standard Conditions.
   a.   Conditions Adopted by Town Council Resolution. The Town Council may,
either on its own motion or upon a recommendation from the Chief of Planning,
adopt by resolution standard conditions of approval for wireless facilities
subject to this chapter. All wireless facilities, whether approved by the
approval authority or deemed approved or deemed granted by law shall be
automatically subject to all such standard conditions of approval as may be
adopted in a resolution by the Town Council.
   b.   Modifications to Standard Conditions. The approval authority (or the
appellate authority) shall have discretion to modify or amend any standard
conditions of approval on a case-by-case basis as may be necessary or
appropriate to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare, allow
for the proper operation of the approved wireless facility, maintain compliance
with applicable laws and/or to advance the goals or policies in the General
Plan and any specific plan, the Danville Municipal Code and/or this chapter.
(Ord. #2018-07, § 2)
   32-70.11   Temporary Wireless Facilities.
   a.   Non-Emergency Temporary Wireless Facilities. Except as provided in
section
32-70.11.b, the requirements, procedures and standards in this section shall be
applicable to all applications for a Temporary Use Permit for a temporary
wireless facility.
      1.   Administrative Review. A duly filed application shall be reviewed
for completeness. After the Chief of Planning deems the application complete,
the Chief of Planning shall review the application for conformance with the
required findings and render a written decision to the applicant. Any denials
must include the reasons for the denial. The review shall be administrative in
nature and shall not require notice or a public hearing.
      2.   Required Findings. The Chief of Planning may approve or
conditionally approve a Temporary Use Permit for a temporary wireless facility
only when the Chief of Planning finds:
         i.   The proposed temporary wireless facility will not exceed the
overall zone height limit of the zoning district in which it is located;
         ii.   The proposed temporary wireless facility complies with all
setback requirements applicable to the proposed location;
         iii.   The proposed temporary wireless facility will not involve any
excavation or ground disturbance;
         iv.   The proposed temporary wireless facility will be compliant with
all generally applicable public health and safety laws and regulations, which
include without limitation maximum permissible exposure limits for human
exposure to RF emissions established by the FCC;
         v.   The proposed temporary wireless facility will not create any
nuisance or violate any noise limits applicable to the proposed location;
         vi.   The proposed temporary wireless facility will be identified with
a sign that clearly identifies the (i) site operator, (ii) the operator's site
identification name or number and (iii) a working telephone number answered 24
hours per day, seven days per week by a live person who can exert power-down
control over the antennas;
         vii.   The proposed wireless temporary wireless facility will be
removed within 30 days after the Chief of Planning grants the temporary use
permit, or such longer time as the Chief of Planning finds reasonably related
to the applicant's need or purpose for the temporary wireless facility (but in
no case longer than one year); and
         viii.   The applicant has not been denied an approval for any
permanent wireless facility in substantially the same location within the
previous 365 days.
      3.   Appeals. Any applicant may appeal the Chief of Planning's written
decision to deny an application for a Temporary Use Permit for a temporary
wireless facility. The written appeal together with any applicable appeal fee
must be tendered to the Town within 10 days from the Chief of Planning's
written decision, and must state in plain terms the grounds for reversal and
the facts that support those grounds. The Town Manager shall be the appellate
authority. The Town Manager shall issue a written decision that contains the
reasons for the decision, and such decision shall be final and not subject to
any further administrative appeals.
   b.   Emergency Temporary Wireless Facilities. Temporary wireless facilities
may be placed and operated within the Town without a Temporary Use Permit only
when a duly authorized federal, state, county or Town official declares an
emergency within a region that includes the Town in whole or in part. Any
temporary wireless facilities placed must be removed within five days after the
date the emergency is lifted. Any person or entity that places temporary
wireless facilities pursuant to this section
32-70.11.b must send a written notice that identifies the site location and
person responsible for its operation to the Chief of Planning as soon as
reasonably practicable under the circumstances. (Ord. #2018-07, § 2)
   32-70.12   Amortization of Nonconforming Wireless Facilities
   Any nonconforming wireless facilities in existence at the time this chapter
becomes effective must be brought into conformance with this chapter in
accordance with the amortization schedule in this section
32-70.12. As used in this section, the "fair market value" will be the
construction costs listed on the building permit or application for the subject
wireless facility and the "minimum years" allowed will be measured from the
date on which this chapter becomes effective.
Fair Market Value   Minimum Years Allowed on Effective Date
Less than $50,000    5
$50,000 to $500,000    10
Greater than $500,000   15
The Chief of Planning may grant a written extension to a date certain when the
wireless facility owner shows (1) a good faith effort to cure non-conformance;
(2) the application of this section would violate applicable laws; or (3)
extreme economic hardship would result from strict compliance with the
amortization schedule. Any extension must be the minimum time period necessary
to avoid such extreme economic hardship. The Chief of Planning may not grant
any permanent exemption from this section.
Nothing in this section is intended to limit any permit term to less than ten
(10) years. In the event that the amortization required in this section would
reduce the permit term to less than 10 years for any permit granted on or after
January 1, 2007, then the minimum years allowed will be automatically extended
by the difference between 10 years and the number of years since the Town
granted such permit. Nothing in this section is intended or may be applied to
prohibit any collocation or modification covered under 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a) on
the basis that the subject wireless facility is a legal nonconforming wireless
facility. (Ord. #2018-07, § 2)
   32-70.13   Special Provisions for Section 6409 Approvals.
   a.   Applicability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
chapter, this section
32-70.13 applies to all requests for approval to collocate, replace or remove

   c.   Required Approval. Any request to collocate, replace or remove
transmission equipment at an existing wireless tower or base station submitted
with a written request for approval under Section 6409 shall require an
approval in such form determined by the Chief of Planning consistent with all
valid and enforceable terms and conditions of the underlying permit or other
prior regulatory authorization for the tower or base station (each amendment a
"section 6409 approval"). Each section 6409 approval shall be subject to the
Chief of Planning's approval, conditional approval or denial without prejudice
pursuant to the standards and procedures in this section
32-70.13. However, the applicant may voluntarily elect to seek a major or minor
wireless permit subject to the general standards and procedures in this
chapter.
   d.   Decisions; Appeals.
      1.   Administrative Review. The approval authority shall review a
complete and duly filed application for a section 6409 approval, and may act on
such application without prior notice or a public hearing.
      2.   Decision Notices for Denials. In the event that the approval
authority denies the application, the written notice to the applicant must
contain (1) the reasons for the decision; (2) a statement that denial will be
without prejudice; and (3) instructions for how and when to file an appeal.
      3.   Required Findings for Approval. The approval authority may approve
or conditionally approve an application any application for a section 6409
approval when the approval authority finds that the proposed project:
         i.   Involves collocation, removal or replacement of transmission
equipment on an existing wireless tower or base station; and
         ii.   Does not substantially change the physical dimensions of the
existing wireless tower or base station.
      4.   Criteria for Denial without Prejudice. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this chapter, and consistent with all applicable federal laws and
regulations, the approval authority may deny without prejudice any application
for a section 6409 approval when the approval authority finds that the proposed
project:
         i.   Does not meet the findings required in section
32-70.13.d.3;
         ii.   Involves the replacement of the entire support structure; or
         iii.   Violates any legally enforceable law, regulation, rule,
standard or permit condition reasonably related to public health or safety.
      4.   Conditional Approvals. Subject to any applicable limitations in
federal or state law, nothing in this section
32-70.13 is intended to limit the approval authority's authority to
conditionally approve an application for a section 6409 approval to protect and
promote the public health and safety.
      5.   Appeals. Any applicant may appeal the approval authority's written
decision to deny without prejudice an application for section 6409 approval.
The written appeal together with any applicable appeal fee must be tendered to
the City Clerk within ten calendar days from the approval authority's written
decision, and must state in plain terms the grounds for reversal and the facts
that support those grounds. The Town Manager shall be the appellate authority
for all appeals from the approval authority's written decision to deny without
prejudice an application for section 6409 approval. The Town Manager shall
review the application de novo without notice or a public hearing; provided,
however, that the Town Manager's decision shall be limited to only whether the
application should be approved or denied in accordance with the provisions in
this section
32-70.13 and any other applicable laws. The Town Manager shall issue a written
decision that contains the reasons for the decision, and such decision shall be
final and not subject to any further administrative appeals. (Ord. #2018-07, §
2)
32-71   REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.
   32-71.1   Purpose.
   a.   It is the Town's policy to provide individuals with disabilities
reasonable accommodation in regulations and procedures to ensure equal access
to housing, and to facilitate the development of housing. The purpose of this
chapter is to provide a procedure under which a disabled person may request a
reasonable accommodation in the application of zoning requirements.
   b.   This chapter is based on requirements of the federal and state fair
housing laws, and implements the Housing Element of the General Plan. It is
distinct from the requirements for a variance set forth in Government Code
Section 65906 and Danville Municipal Code Section
32-3.12, Variance.
(Ord. #2014-09, § 1; Ord. 2015- 08, § 1)
   32-71.2   Definitions.
   In this chapter:
   Disabled person means a person who has a medical, physical or mental
condition that limits a major life activity (as those terms are defined in
California Government Code Section 12926), anyone who is regarded as having
such a condition or anyone who has a record of having such a condition. It
includes a person or persons, or an authorized representative of a disabled
person. The term "disabled person" does not include a person who is currently
using illegal substances, unless he or she has a separate disability. (42
U.S.C. § 3602(h).)
   Fair housing laws means (1) the Federal Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3601
and following) and (2) the California Fair Employment and Housing Act
(Government Code Section 12955 and following), including amendments to them.
   Reasonable accommodation means providing disabled persons flexibility in the
application of land use and zoning regulations and procedures, or even waiving
certain requirements, when necessary to eliminate barriers to housing
opportunities. It may include such things as yard area modifications for ramps,
handrails or other such accessibility improvements; hardscape additions, such
as widened driveways, parking area or walkways; building additions for
accessibility; tree removal; or reduced off-street parking where the disability
clearly limits the number of people operating vehicles. Reasonable
accommodation does not include an accommodation that would (1) impose an undue
financial or administrative burden on the Town or (2) require a fundamental
alteration in the nature of the Town's land use and zoning program. (Government
Code Section 12927(c)(1), (1) and Section 12955(1); 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B);
28 C.F.R. § 35.150 (a)(3).)
(Ord. #2014-09, § 1; Ord. 2015-08, § 1)
   32-71.3   Requesting Reasonable Accommodation.
   a.   Request. A disabled person may request a reasonable accommodation in
the application of the Town's land use and zoning regulations. Such a request
may include a modification or exception to the requirements for the siting,
development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would
eliminate regulatory barriers. A reasonable accommodation cannot waive a
requirement for a conditional use permit when otherwise required or result in
approval of uses otherwise prohibited by the Town's land use and zoning
regulations.
   b.   Availability of information. Information regarding this reasonable
accommodation procedure shall be prominently displayed at the public
information counters in the Planning Division, advising the public of the
availability of the procedure for eligible applicants, and be made available in
any other manner as determined by the Chief of Planning.
   c.   Assistance. If an applicant needs assistance in making the request, the
Planning Division will endeavor to provide the assistance necessary to ensure
that the process is available to the applicant.
   d.   Balancing rights and requirements. The Town will attempt to balance (1)
the privacy rights and reasonable request of an applicant for confidentiality,
with (2) the land use requirements for notice and public hearing, factual
findings and rights to appeal, in the Town's requests for information,
considering an application, preparing written findings and maintaining records
for a request for reasonable accommodation.
(Ord. #2014-09, § 1; Ord. 2015- 08, § 1)
   32-71.4   Application Requirements.
   a.   Application. The applicant shall submit a request for reasonable
accommodation on a form provided by the Planning Division. The application
shall include the following information:
      1.   The applicant's name, address and telephone number;
      2.   Address of the property for which the request is being made;
      3.   The name and address of the property owner, and the owner's written
consent to the application;
      4.   The current actual use of the property;
      5.   The basis for the claim that the individual is considered disabled
under the fair housing laws: identification and description of the disability
which is the basis for the request for accommodation, including current,
written medical certification and description of disability and its effects on
the person's medical, physical or mental limitations;
      6.   The rule, policy, practice and/or procedure of the Town for which
the request for accommodation is being made, including the Zoning Code
regulation from which reasonable accommodation is being requested;
      7.   The type of accommodation sought;
      8.   The reason(s) why the accommodation is reasonable and necessary for
the needs of the disabled person(s). Where appropriate, include a summary of
any potential means and alternatives considered in evaluating the need for the
accommodation;
      9.   Copies of memoranda, correspondence, pictures, plans or background
information reasonably necessary to reach a decision regarding the need for the
accommodation; and
      10.   Other supportive information deemed necessary by the department to
facilitate proper consideration of the request, consistent with fair housing
laws.
   b.   Review with other land use applications. If the project for which the
reasonable accommodation is being requested also requires some other
discretionary approval (such as a land use permit, development plan, general
plan amendment, rezoning, subdivision map), then the applicant shall submit the
reasonable accommodation application first for a determination by the Chief of
Planning, before proceeding with the other applications.
   c.   Fee. The fee for an application for reasonable accommodation shall be
established by resolution of the Town Council. However, an applicant may submit
written information documenting financial hardship and the Chief of Planning
may reduce or waive the established fee based on financial hardship.
(Ord. #2014-09, § 1; Ord. 2015- 08, § 1)
   32-71.5   Approval Authority; Notice; Decision.
   a.   Approval authority.
      1.   Chief of Planning. The Chief of Planning has the authority to review
and decide upon requests for reasonable accommodation, including whether the
applicant is a disabled person within the meaning of this section, or when a
reasonable accommodation request includes an encroachment into the required
minimum yard setback areas, maximum height requirements, or whenever a
reduction in required parking is requested. The Chief of Planning may refer the
matter to the Planning Commission or to the Design Review Board if the proposed
accommodation is visible from the street fronting the property.
      2.   Planning Commission. Upon referral by the Chief of Planning or an
appeal of the Chief of Planning's action, the Planning Commission has the
authority to review and decide upon requests for reasonable accommodation,
including whether the applicant is a disabled person within the meaning of this
section, or when a reasonable accommodation request includes an encroachment
into the required minimum yard setback areas, maximum height requirements, or
whenever a reduction in required parking is requested.
   b.   Notice. No advance notice or public hearing is required for
consideration of reasonable accommodation requests by the Chief of Planning.
Requests for reasonable accommodation subject to review by the Planning
Commission require advance notice and a public hearing pursuant to the
requirements of Danville Municipal Code subsection 30-3.3.
   c.   Decision. The Chief of Planning shall render a decision or refer the
matter to the Planning Commission within 30 days after the application is
complete, and shall approve, approve with conditions or deny the application,
based on the findings set forth in Danville Municipal Code subsection
32-71.6. The decision shall be in writing and mailed to the applicant and to
all residents and property owners within 350 feet of the project site.
      1.   If the application for reasonable accommodation involves another
discretionary decision, the reviewing body for that decision shall accept as
final the Chief of Planning's determination regarding reasonable accommodation,
unless the reasonable accommodation request has been referred by the Chief of
Planning to the Planning Commission for consideration.
      2.   If the application for reasonable accommodation is referred to, or
reviewed by, the Planning Commission, a decision to approve, approve with
conditions or deny the application shall be rendered at the conclusion of the
Planning Commission's deliberations, based on the findings set forth in
Danville Municipal Code subsection
32-71.6.

      2.   The requested accommodation is necessary to make specific housing
available to a disabled person;
      3.   The requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial or
administrative burden on the Town; and
      4.   The requested accommodation would not require a fundamental
alteration in the nature of a Town program or law, including land use and
zoning.
   b.   Other requirements.
      1.   An approved request for reasonable accommodation is subject to the
applicant's compliance with all other applicable zoning regulations.
      2.   A modification approved under this chapter is considered a personal
accommodation for the individual applicant and does not run with the land.
      3.   Where appropriate, the reviewing authority may condition its
approval on any or all of the following:
         (a)   Inspection of the property periodically, as specified, to verify
compliance with this section and any conditions of approval;
         (b)   Removal of the improvements, where removal would not constitute
an unreasonable financial burden, when the need for which the accommodation was
granted no longer exists;
         (c)   Time limits and/or expiration of the approval if the need for
which the accommodation was granted no longer exists;
         (d)   Recordation of a deed restriction requiring removal of the

32-72   HISTORIC PRESERVATION.
   32-72.1   Purpose and Findings.
   a.   Danville has a rich heritage that reflects the Town's role in the
development of the San Ramon Valley. This heritage is reflected in individual
structures and sites as well as historic development patterns, particularly in
the Downtown area. In recognition of this historic heritage, the Town's General
Plan establishes a goal of preserving historic and cultural resources within
the Town and recognizing such resources as an essential part of the Town's
heritage. In order to achieve that goal, the Town's General Plan contains a
number of policies, including:
      1.   Ensuring that the rehabilitation and restoration of historic
buildings respects the historic character and setting of the buildings.
      2.   Ensuring that new construction within the Downtown area is
compatible with nearby historic buildings and is consistent with the historic
development patterns of the Downtown.
      3.   Ensuring that owners of historic buildings and sites are aware of
and provided with appropriate financial and use incentives to ensure the
continued economic viability and usefulness of those buildings.
      4.   Promoting public awareness and enjoyment of historic resources
within Danville.
   b.   The Town Council finds that adopting this chapter will help achieve the
goals and policies of the General Plan, that historic preservation will help
ensure the economic vitality of the Downtown area, help preserve property
values throughout Town and enrich the cultural and educational lives of the
Town's residents.
   c.   Pursuant to this chapter, the Town will adopt a survey of historically
significant resources. Those properties identified as historically significant
resources will receive protection from demolition or exterior alterations. In
addition, property owners may request that their properties be designated as
heritage resources, which are eligible for economic and land use incentives.

32-73   INCLUSIONARY HOUSING.
   32-73.1   Title.
   This section shall be entitled the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance.
(Ord. #2014-08, § 2)
   32-73.2   Findings.
   The Town Council of the Town of Danville finds that Danville is experiencing
a housing shortage for affordable housing. A goal of the Town is to achieve a
balanced community with housing available for households of a range of income
levels. Increasingly, households with very low, low and moderate incomes who
work and/or live within the Town are unable to locate housing at prices they
can afford and are increasingly excluded from living in the Town. The Town
finds that the high cost of newly constructed housing does not, to any
appreciable extent, provide affordable housing, and that continued new
development which does not include nor contribute toward lower cost housing
will serve to further aggravate the current housing problems by reducing the
supply of developable land. The Town further finds that the housing shortage
for affordable housing is detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare,
and further that it is a public purpose of the Town, and a public policy of the
State of California as mandated by the requirements for a Housing Element of
the Town's General Plan, to make available an adequate supply of housing for
persons of all economic segments of the community.
(Ord. #2014-08, § 2)
   32-73.3   Purpose.
   The purpose of this section is to enhance the public welfare and assure that
new residential developments with eight (8) or more dwelling units or lots
contribute to the attainment of the Town's housing goals by increasing the
production of affordable housing, and additionally stimulating funds for
development of affordable housing. The regulations set forth in this chapter
shall apply to all areas of the Town of Danville.
(Ord. #2014-08, § 2)

density, and environmental constraints. In such cases the applicant, upon
approval of the Town Council, may contribute fees in lieu of providing
inclusionary affordable units. Such fees shall be known as "in lieu

their corresponding number of bedrooms; standards for maximum qualifying
household incomes; standards for maximum sales prices or rental rates; party/
process responsible for certifying tenant incomes; construction scheduling, how
vacancies will be marketed and filled; restrictions and enforcement mechanisms
binding on property upon sale or transfer; maintenance provisions; and any

      1.   If the BMR units are built within the project, they are not required
to be evenly dispersed throughout the development.
      2.   BMR units are not required to represent the predominant unit type in
the project (e.g., locating affordable attached duet units on corner lots in a
primarily single family development or including affordable secondary units
into a primarily single family development).
      3.   The exterior design and character of the BMR units shall be
substantially consistent with that of the non-BMR units in the residential
development.
      4.   There may be a reduction of interior amenities provided within the

   a.   The Town Manager is hereby designated the enforcing authority of this
section.
   b.   The provisions of this section shall apply to all agents, successors
and assigns of an applicant proposing a residential development governed by
this section. No building permit or occupancy permit shall be issued, nor any
development approval be granted, which does not meet the requirements of this
section.
   c.   In the event that it is determined that a BMR unit is being occupied as
a rental unit and that rents in excess of those allowed by operation of this
section have been charged, the Town may take the appropriate legal actions or
proceedings to recover, and the project owner shall be obligated to pay to the
tenant (or to the Town in the event the tenant cannot be located), any excess
rental charges.
   d.   The Town may institute any appropriate legal actions or proceedings
necessary to ensure compliance herewith, including but not limited to actions
to revoke, deny or suspend any permit or development approval.
(Ord. #2014-08, § 2)
   32-73.14   Appeals.
   Any person aggrieved by any action involving denial, suspension or
revocation of an occupancy or other permit, or denial, suspension or revocation
of any development approval, may appeal such action or determination in the
manner provided for appeal of use permits, by subsections
1-8.1 through
1-8.5 of the Danville Municipal Code. The developer may appeal for a reduction,
adjustment, or waiver of obligations if he or she establishes the absence of a
reasonable relationship or nexus between the impact of the development and the
inclusionary housing requirement.
(Ord. #2014-08, § 2)
   32-73.15   For-Rent Below Market Rate Accessory Dwelling Units.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of any other section contained within this
chapter, and if it is determined to be appropriate by the Danville Town
Council, the applicant may fulfill a development's inclusionary housing
requirements with the development of second units, as set forth in this
section.
      a.   Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to all new
residential developments with eight (8) or more lots throughout the Town, with
the exception of developments established within the Downtown Redevelopment
Area.
      b.   Scope. If the Town Council determines that development of for-rent
Below Market Rate (BMR) accessory dwelling units would be appropriate for a
project, the minimum number of for-rent BMR second units supplied in a project
shall be equivalent to twenty-five percent (25%) of the number of market rate
units established in the project.
      c.   Affordable Housing Agreement. An affordable housing agreement, as
generally provided for in subsection
32-73.10g, shall be recorded as a deed restriction on the property which
incorporates a for-rent BMR second unit.
      d.   Qualifying Households: Maximum Income of Renters. The for-rent BMR
second unit shall not be rented to a household with an income which exceeds the
high end of the "low" income range (Note: The Town shall advise the owners of
any annual changes in the area median incomes).
      e.   Restriction on Rental Rate. The rental rate shall not exceed what is
affordable to a household earning the high end of the "low" income range,
adjusted for household size and providing for appropriate allowance for
utilities. A maximum of thirty percent (30%) of the household income shall be
assigned to the housing costs for the for-rent BMR second unit (this shall
cover both the unit's rental rate and an appropriate allowance for utility
costs). The Town shall advise the owner of annual changes in the allowable
rental rate (and shall provide a schedule for utility allowance adjusted for
household size).
      f.   Self-Reporting. The owner shall self-report the status of the for-
rent BMR second unit (using a Town-supplied reporting form) in conjunction with
receipt of the Town's annual rental rate update report. Owners of the for-rent
BMR second units are not required to continuously market and rent the second
units. If the Town determines that all the for-rent BMR units within a
particular development have met the occupancy goal and intent of this section,
then the Town may eliminate the requirement to self-report the status of the
for-rent second unit(s) in that development.
      g.   Design Parameters. The for-rent BMR second units shall be designed
such that the physical layout of the unit and its interrelationship with the
primary unit ensures its availability as a self-contained viable second unit.
         1.   Architectural and Physical Design. For-rent BMR second units
shall be architecturally compatible with main residential unit in roof pitch,
scale, colors, materials, trim, windows, as well as other exterior physical
features. The maximum floor area of a for-rent BMR second unit shall be as
defined in subsection
32-73.15g,5.
         2.   Relationship to Main Residence.
            (a)   The second unit may be detached or attached to the main
residence;
            (b)   If detached second units are proposed, each second unit shall
be designed to provide privacy for the main residential unit (i.e., minimum
number of windows facing the main unit, relative location of entry areas, and
the like) and shall meet all setback requirements applicable to the main
residence;
            (c)   The second unit shall have a separate entrance from the main
unit;
            (d)   There shall be no direct access from main residence to the
second unit;
            (e)   There shall be a wall separating the garage of the primary
residence and the garage/ parking area of the secondary unit;
            (f)   The second unit shall have a separate mailing address to
allow independent contact with the unit's occupants; and
            (g)   Any proposed modifications to the second unit must secure
prior review and approval by the Chief of Planning.
         3.   Adequate Facilities. At the time the tentative map associated
with the project is reviewed, a finding must be made that the following
adequate facilities are provided:
            (a)   The second unit shall have complete independent living
facilities, adequate to meet the needs of at least a one-person household;
            (b)   Permanent provisions for food preparation, sleeping, and
bathing needs shall be provided;
            (c)   Disposal of sanitary waste shall be provided by the public
sanitary sewer district;
            (d)   Provision of potable water shall be provided by the municipal
utility district;
            (e)   To function as an independent living unit, the accessory
dwelling shall be required to have its own water heater, washer/dryer hookups,
air-conditioning/heating unit (with independent cooling /heating controls).
         4.   Parking Requirements. The second unit shall have its own on-site
covered parking space (nine by nineteen (9' x 19') feet, minimum clear), which
shall be walled off and accessed separately. The on-site parking space for the
second unit may be provided as a garage or as a carport.
         5.   Minimum Lot Size/Maximum Second Unit Size/Floor Area Ratio.
            (a)   The second unit shall be a minimum of six hundred fifty (650)
square feet in size for developments with lots averaging eight thousand (8,000)
square feet or more (i.e., projects with a density 4.15 dwelling units per
acre);
            (b)   The second unit shall be a minimum of five hundred (500)
square feet in size for developments with lots averaging less than eight
thousand (8,000) square feet (i.e., projects with a density greater than 4.15
dwelling units per acre);
            (c)   Projects with a typical minimum lot size of six thousand five
hundred (6,500) square feet (i.e., equivalent to a density of five (5) dwelling
units per acre) shall not be allowed to utilize this approach for meeting their
affordable housing requirements;
            (d)   The resulting floor area ratio (FAR) for the primary and
secondary units on an individual lot shall not exceed sixty percent (60%);
            (e)   Deviation from the above-cited dimensional criteria may be
considered by the Town Council on a project-by-project basis.
         6.   Setback requirements will be determined on a project-by-project
basis.

the project in order to evaluate the financial need for the incentive(s). At
the developer's cost, the Town may retain a consultant to review the financial
report. (If the developer is a nonprofit organization, the Town Council may
elect to pay the cost of the consultant.)
   b.   Findings required for denial. The Town shall grant the requested
incentive or concession unless the Town makes a written finding based upon
substantial evidence that the incentive or concession:
      1.   Is not required to provide for affordable housing costs or for rents
to be set at the specified levels; or
      2.   Would have a specific adverse impact upon public health and safety
or the physical environment, or on any property listed in the California
Register of Historical Resources, and for which there is no feasible method to
satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the impact without rendering the development
unaffordable to low and moderate income households. "Specific adverse impact"
means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on
objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or
conditions. (Government Code Section 65589.5.)

32-79   TREE PRESERVATION.
   32-79.1   Purpose and Intent.
   The Town of Danville contains many species of native and non-native trees
that are of great beauty and significance. It is recognized that the
preservation of these trees enhances the natural beauty, sustains the long term
potential increase in property values which encourages quality development,
maintains the natural ecology, retains the tempering effect of extreme
temperatures, helps to create and retain the identity and quality of the Town
which is necessary for successful business to continue, improves the
attractiveness of the Town to residents and visitors, prevents the erosion of
top soil, provides protection against flood hazards and risk of landslide, and
increases the oxygen output of the area which is needed to combat air
pollution. It is also recognized that construction activities around trees can
harm or destroy trees. For these reasons, the Town Council finds that in order
to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the Town of
Danville, while at the same time recognizing individual rights to develop
private property in a manner which will not be prejudicial to the public
interest, it is necessary to enact regulations controlling the removal of and
preservation of trees within the Town. One of the purposes of this chapter is
to provide financial incentives and security to protect and replace damaged or
destroyed trees to the maximum extent possible.

      4.   Specific reasons for requesting removal of tree(s).
   b.   A tree report prepared by a certified arborist or member of the
International Society of Consulting Arborists, shall be submitted as part of
the Tree Removal permit, if determined necessary by the Chief of Planning. The
adequacy of the tree report shall be subject to determination by the Chief of
Planning.
   c.   Application for, and granting of a Tree Removal permit may be jointly
considered with an application for other development entitlements which may be
required.
(Ord.# 2001-01, §3; Ord. 2009-04, §2)
   32-79.6   Decision Regarding Permit.
   a.   Time of Decision. The Planning Division shall render a decision
regarding the permit within fifteen (15) working days after the filing of a
complete application. If an application is being jointly considered with any
other application for a development entitlement, then the decision on the Tree
Removal permit shall be rendered simultaneously with a decision on the
development entitlement application.
   b.   Criteria. In order to issue a Tree Removal permit the Town shall
consider the following criteria:
      1.   The condition of the tree(s) with respect to its health, imminent
danger of falling, proximity to existing structures, and interference with
utility infrastructure.
      2.   The necessity to remove the tree(s) to allow for the reasonable use,
enjoyment or development of the property.
      3.   The age and/or size of the protected tree with regard to the
appropriateness of the size of the area in which the tree is planted and
whether its removal would encourage healthier, more vigorous growth of other
plant material in the area.
      4.   If none of the above criteria are satisfied, the Planning Commission
may authorize removal if it finds that, due to the location of the tree on the
property and its orientation as it related to the residence on the property
and/or actively used yard areas, the tree is unreasonably adversely impacting
the property owner's enjoyment and/or use of the property. In this case,
mitigation tree replacement plantings may be required as found appropriate by
the Planning Commission.
      5.   The effect of the removal of the tree upon soil erosion or whether
its removal will result in a significant diversion or increase in the flow of
surface water.
      6.   The number, species, size and location of other protected trees in
the area and the effect the removal of the tree(s) will have upon shade,
privacy between properties, and scenic beauty of the area.
      7.   Possible visual impacts within a Town-identified Major Ridgeline or
Scenic Hillside Area created as a result of the tree removal.
   c.   Additional Recommendations.  The Chief of Planning may refer any Tree
Removal application to the Planning Commission for review and action. Upon such
referral, the timeline for action established under paragraph a of this
subsection shall automatically increase to forty-five (45) days unless
connected to another development application, in which case the request shall
be considered jointly with that application.
   d.   Mitigation Measures. The Planning Division shall grant or deny the
application, or grant the application with conditions of approval which are
intended to help mitigate the removal of the tree(s). Where mitigation is
determined to be necessary, the Town may require the planting of on-site or
off-site replacement trees (location and species to be determined by the Town)
which are of a cumulative diameter necessary to equal the diameter of the tree
(s) which are approved for removal.
(Ord.# 2001-01, §3; Ord. 2009-04, §2)
   32-79.7   Appeal.
   A person aggrieved by the decision of the Planning Division may appeal to

   32-79.8   Memorial Trees.
   A person who wishes to sponsor a memorial tree planted on public property
may file an application with the Town's Maintenance Services Department. The
application shall contain the following information:
   a.   Name of the person for whom the tree is to be planted.
   b.   Species of tree preferred.
   c.   Desired location of planting.
(Ord. #2001-01, §3; Ord. 2009-04, §2)
   32-79.9   Tree Protection During Development.
   a.   Applicability. This subsection applies to development which would occur
within the dripline of one (1) or more protected tree(s), as established on the
preliminary development plan, demolition plan, and/or grading plan. For the
purpose of this subsection, development shall mean any work or improvement that
requires approval from the Town.
   b.   Security. Before issuance of a demolition, grading, or building permit:
      1.   Where development is proposed within the dripline of one (1) or more
protected tree(s), the property owner or developer shall submit a security to
the Chief of Planning on a per tree basis. The required security shall be
established as follows:
         (a)   The applicant shall be required to secure an appraisal of the
condition and value of all affected trees. The appraisal shall be done in
accordance with the then current edition of the "Guide for Establishing Values
of Trees and Other Plants," by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers
under the auspices of the International Society of Arboriculture. The appraisal
shall be performed by a certified arborist, and shall be subject to review and
approval by the Chief of Planning.
         (b)   For a major development, if the appraised value of the tree(s)
is fifty thousand ($50,000.00) dollars or less, the applicant shall deposit
with the Town a cash security, letter of credit, or other security found to be
acceptable by the Chief of Planning, equal to the value of each tree required
to be appraised, for the purpose of securing and guaranteeing the applicant's
obligations under paragraph c of this subsection. If the appraised value of the
tree(s) is over fifty thousand ($50,000.00) dollars, the applicant shall
deposit with the Town a cash security, or other security found to be acceptable
by the Chief of Planning, equal to fifty thousand ($50,000.00) dollars plus
one-half (1/2) of any amount between fifty thousand ($50,000.00) dollars and
one hundred thousand ($100,000.00) dollars plus one quarter (1/4) of any amount
between one hundred thousand ($100,000.00) dollars and one hundred fifty
thousand ($150,000.00) dollars plus one tenth (1/10) of any amount in excess of
one hundred fifty thousand ($150,000.00) dollars.
         (c)   For a minor development, if the appraised value of the tree(s)
is twenty-five thousand ($25,000.00) dollars or less, the applicant shall
deposit with the Town a cash security, letter of credit, or other security
found to be acceptable by the Chief of Planning, equal to the value of each
tree required to be appraised, for the purpose of securing and guaranteeing the
applicant's obligations under paragraph c of this subsection. If the appraised
value of the tree(s) is over twenty-five thousand ($25,000.00) dollars, the
applicant shall deposit with the Town a cash security, or other security found
to be acceptable by the Chief of Planning, equal to twenty-five thousand
($25,000.00) dollars plus one-half (1/2) of any amount between twenty-five
thousand ($25,000.00) dollars and fifty thousand ($50,000.00) dollars plus one
quarter (1/4) of any amount between fifty thousand ($50,000.00) dollars and
seventy-five thousand ($75,000.00) dollars plus one tenth (1/10) of any amount
in excess of seventy-five thousand ($75,000.00) dollars.
         (d)   The Town shall retain the security until the termination of the
guarantee periods required under this chapter. Any funds remaining on deposit
at the expiration of the guarantee period, and after all of the developer's or
property owner's obligations under this chapter have been satisfied, shall be
returned to the developer or property owner. Nothing under this chapter
prohibits the transfer of the security obligation should the property change
ownership.
   c.   Guarantee and Replacement. A developer or property owner shall:
      1.   Guarantee the health of each protected tree on the site that is not
approved for removal from the date of the Town's finaling of the permit
associated with the last construction activity which endangered the tree until
the completion of at least two (2) full growing seasons after the completion of
the construction activity;
      2.   Replace a protected tree(s) that dies during the guarantee period,
as a result of damage caused by the development, with a tree(s) of a species
approved by the Town, of a cumulative number and trunk diameter which equals
the total trunk diameter of the tree(s) that died. The developer or property
owner shall also be required to install and maintain irrigation (as determined
necessary by the Chief of Planning) for the replacement tree(s) until the tree
(s) are established;
      3.   Relocate and maintain during construction any tree identified for
temporary stockpiling. During the period of time such trees are stockpiled,
they shall be maintained by a licensed nurseryman;
      4.   Replace any stockpiled tree(s) that dies during the guarantee period
with a tree(s) of the same species with a cumulative trunk diameter equal or
greater than the total trunk diameter of the tree(s) which died;
      5.   Notify the Chief of Planning of any damage that occurs to a
protected tree(s) during construction so that professionally acceptable methods
of treatment may be administered. The repair of the damage shall be at the
expense of the responsible party and shall be by professional standards,
approved by the Chief of Planning. Failure to notify the Chief of Planning and/
or to administer acceptable methods of treatment may result in the issuance of
a stop work order for any permit associated with the project development
activity. If determined necessary by the Chief of Planning, the Town may
utilize security funds submitted as part of the development to retain a
qualified third party arborist to review the tree(s) and have any necessary
mitigation on the tree(s) performed;
      6.   In addition to replacing a guaranteed tree(s), upon determination by
the Chief of Planning that a guaranteed tree has died through the fault of the
applicant, pay to the Town a Civil Penalty in accordance with subsection
32-79.10.b., below.
      7.   A tree shall be presumed to have died through the fault of the
applicant unless the applicant can prove to the Town that the tree died for
reasons beyond the applicant's control or, in the case of stockpiled trees, the
applicant used reasonable care to maintain the tree. In addition to such
penalty, whenever the cost of replacing a tree(s) for which a civil penalty is
levied is less than the appraised value of the tree(s), the applicant shall
also pay the Town the difference between that appraised value and the cost of
the replacement tree(s). The applicant's verified receipt for the cost of the
replacement tree(s) shall be conclusive proof of the cost. If the applicant
chooses not to submit such receipt within ten (10) days following replacement
of the tree(s), then the Chief of Planning shall determine the value of the
replacement tree.
      8.   Use of Penalties Collected. Penalties collected under this section
shall be used as follows, as found appropriate by the Chief of Planning:
         (a)   To upgrade street trees along nearby public streets.
         (b)   To beautify or enhance public places, including parks and open
spaces, within the Town.
         (c)   To beautify or enhance the site where the tree removal occurred.
(Ord.# 2001-01, §3; Ord. 2009-04, §2)
   32-79.10   Penalties.
   a.   Criminal Penalties. Any person, including but not limited to the

three (3) times the value of the tree. For purposes of calculating the value of
the tree(s), the then-current edition of the "Guide for Establishing Values of
Trees and Other Plants" by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers under
the auspices of the International Society of Arboriculture shall be used. The
Town's use of penalties collected shall be as established under subsection
32-79.9.c.7.
   c.   Cumulative Remedies. The foregoing remedies shall be deemed
nonexclusive, cumulative, and in addition to any other remedy the Town may have

32-81—32-82   RESERVED.
32-83   PARK DEDICATION.
Division 1. GENERAL
   32-83.1   Purpose.
   This section is enacted under Section 66477 of the Government Code of the
State of California and the Town’s police power. The park and recreational
facilities for which dedication of land and/or payment of a fee is required by
this section are in accordance with the Recreation element of the General Plan.
(Ord. #69-85, § 8-6201)
   32-83.2   General Requirements.
   a.   Subdivision and Parcel Maps. At the time of approval of a tentative map
or parcel map, the Town shall determine the land required for dedication or the
amount of in lieu fee payment. As a condition of approval of a final
subdivision map or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in
lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the Town, for park or recreational
purposes at the time and according to the standards and formula contained in
this section.
   b.   Building Permit. As a condition of approval of a permit to build a
residential structure, including a multiple family structure, mobile home, or
second unit, an owner shall pay a fee for public park or recreational purposes
in accordance with the same standards as if a final map or parcel map were
required. (Ord. #69-85, § 8-6202)
   32-83.3   General Standard.
   It is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health,
welfare, and safety require that five (5) acres of property for each one
thousand (1,000) persons residing within the Town be devoted to park and
recreational purposes.
   The park and recreational facilities for which dedication of land or payment
of a fee or both are required, shall be in accordance with the Recreation, Park
and Open Space Elements of the General Plan. (Ord. #69-85, § 8-6203)
Division 2. REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS
   32-83.4   Formula for Dedication of Land.
   The amount of land to be dedicated, or the fees to be paid, shall bear a
reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreation facilities by the
future inhabitants of the development.
   The amount of land dedicated or fees paid is based upon the number of units
to be constructed, determined by the tentative map or building permits in
projects without maps, and the household size.
   The dedication of land, or the payment of fees, or both, shall be the
proportionate amount necessary to provide five (5) acres of park area per one
thousand (1,000) persons.
   No fee or land dedication is required on a parcel for which dedication
requirements have previously been met. (Ord. #69-85, § 86210)
   32-83.5—32-83.10   Reserved.
   32-83.11   Standard and Formula for Dedication of Land.
   The amount of land to be dedicated shall be determined according to the
following standards and formula:
   a.   The average number of persons occupying the type(s) of units to be
constructed is multiplied by the park acreage standard, five (5) acres per one
thousand (1,000) (.005); the product shall equal the minimum park acreage
dedication for each unit of that type to be constructed.
      Average number of persons/unit x .005 = minimum acreage dedication/unit.
   b.   The following table of population density applies:
Park Land Dedication Formula Table
 
Type of Dwelling   Average Persons per   Multiplied by Park Acreage Required
                   Unit                  Standard           per Dwelling Unit
Single Family,     3.02                x .005               .0151
Detached
Single Family,     2.04                x .005               .0102
Attached
Duplex             1.8                 x .005               .009
Cluster, 3 or 4    1.87                x .005               .00935
Cluster, 5 or more 1.76                x .005               .0088
 
   c.   Land dedicated for a park shall be suitable in location and topography
for development as a park with active recreational facilities.
   d.   Land offered for dedication for local park or recreational purposes
shall have access to at least one (1) existing or proposed public street to be
constructed in the subject project. The provision of street access and related
improvements shall be made without consideration of credit. The Town may waive
this requirement if it is unnecessary for the maintenance of the park area or
access by residents.
   e.   The land to be dedicated and the improvements to be made under this
section are subject to approval by the Town.
   f.   Dedication of the land shall be made in accordance with the procedures
in Division 5. (Ord. #69-83, §8-6211; Ord. #2003-08, §1)
   32.83.12   Standards and Formula for Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication.
   a.   General Formula. When a fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication,
the fee shall be equal to the value of the land prescribed for dedication in
subsection
32-83.11 and in an amount determined in accordance with paragraph b. below.
   b.   Amount of Fee. When a fee is to be paid in lieu of park land
dedication, the amount of the fee shall be determined at the time of final map
approval or building; permit issuance, whichever is the time of fee collection,
and shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which would
otherwise be required for dedication under subsection
32-83.11.
   c.   Determination of Fair Market Value. The predominate zoning of the Town
is single family residential. Therefore, for the purpose of determining the in
lieu fee, the fair market value of a buildable acre is based upon the value of
land zoned for single family residential development. For purposes of this
section, a buildable acre shall mean a typical acre of land located in other
than an area on which building is excluded because of flooding, topography,
easements, or other restriction and would otherwise be suitable for active park
development.
   As of May 3, 2005, the market value of a buildable acre of land in Danville
zoned single family residential is $985,543. This amount was established by
review of assessors records and recent sales within the Town.
   d.   Establishment of Maximum Fee. Based on the value of an acre of land as
established in subsection
32-83.12.c multiplied by the acreage required for dedication established in
subsection
32-83.11, the maximum in lieu fee shall be:
   Single family, detached      $14,882
   Single family, attached      $10,053
   Duplex               $8,870
   Cluster, 3 to 4 units         $9,215
   Cluster, 5 or more units      $8,673
 
   e.   Determining Amount of Fee to be Paid. The actual fee to be paid shall
be determined at the time the fee is due. The fee shall be the amount set forth
in the following table, multiplied by any increase in the Consumer Price Index
for the San Francisco Bay Area from July 3, 2005 to the date of payment. In no
event shall the fee exceed the maximum specified in subsection
32-83.12d. above.
   Single family, detached      $7,873
   Single family, attached      $5,318
   Duplex               $4,692
   Cluster, 3 to 4 units         $4,875
   Cluster, 5 or more units      $4,588
   f.   For the purposes of this subsection:
      Single Family, Detached means an unattached residential dwelling unit
constructed on a single parcel.
      Single Family, Attached means an attached residential dwelling unit
constructed on a separate parcel.
      Duplex means two (2) attached residential dwelling units constructed on a
single parcel.
      Cluster, 3 or 4 means residential dwelling units attached in groups of
three (3) or four (4) constructed on a single parcel.
      Cluster, 5 or More means residential dwelling units attached in groups of
five (5) or more constructed on a single parcel.
   g.   Fees in Lieu of Land; 50 Parcels or Less. Only the payment of fees, not
the dedication of land, may be required in a development containing fifty (50)
parcels or less.
   However, nothing in this subsection prohibits the dedication and acceptance
of land for park and recreation purposes in projects of fifty (50) parcels or
less, where the developer proposes such dedication voluntarily and the land is
acceptable to the Town.
(Ord. #69-85, §8-6212; Ord. #137, §§1, 2; Ord. #90-1, §§1 and 2; Ord. #90-21,
§§1 and 2; Ord. 2003-08, §§2–4; Ord. 2005-02, §1)
   32-83.13   Determination of Land or Fee.
   Whether the Town accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a
fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by
consideration of the following:
   a.   The natural features, access, and location of land in the subdivision
available for dedication;
   b.   The size and shape of the subdivision and land available for
dedication;
   c.   The feasibility of dedication;
   d.   The compatibility of dedication with the Danville Park and Recreation
Element of the General Plan, and
   e.   The location of existing and proposed park sites and trails.
   The Town determination as to whether land shall be dedicated, a fee be
charged, or a combination of both, is final.

CREDIT; EXEMPTIONS
   32-83.20   Credit for Developer-Provided Park and Recreation Improvements.
   The value of park and recreation improvements provided by a subdivider to
the dedicated land shall be credited against the fees or dedication of land
required by this section. The Town reserves the right to approve such
improvements before agreeing to accept the dedication of land and to require in
lieu fee payments should the land and improvements be unacceptable.
(Ord. #69-85, §8-6220)
   32-83.21   Credit for Private Open Space.
   Where private open space or recreational facilities within the development,
usable for active recreational uses, is provided and such area is to be
privately owned and maintained by the future owner(s) of the development, the
Town may give partial credit, not to exceed fifty (50%) percent against the
requirement of land dedication or payment of fees. An application for partial
credit should be made to the Town at the time the tentative map is submitted
for official review so that dedication requirements can be determined as soon
as possible.
(Ord. #69-85, §8-6221)
   32-83.22   Standards for Credit.
   The standards for partial credit are that:
   a.   Yards, court areas, setbacks, and areas required by the zoning and

Developments shall not be included in the computation private open space;
   b.   The private ownership and maintenance of the area is adequately
provided for by recorded written agreement, covenants or restrictions;
   c.   Use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreation
purposes by recorded covenant which runs with the land in favor of the future
owners of the property and which cannot be eliminated without the consent of
the Town;
   d.   The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for
park and recreation purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size,
shape, topography, geology, access, and location;
   e.   Facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance
with the provisions of the recreation element of the General Plan; and
   f.   The open space for which credit is given is a minimum of one (1) acre
and provides four (4) park elements from among those listed below:
      1.   Recreational open spaces, which are generally defined as parks areas
for active recreation pursuits such as soccer, golf, baseball, softball, and
football, have at least one (1) acre of maintained turf with less than five
percent (5%) slope.
      2.   Court areas, which are generally defined as tennis courts, badminton
courts, shuffleboard courts, or similar hard-surfaced areas especially designed
and exclusively used for court games.

Town Manager or his designee, The facilities must be available for public use
under a lease or similar agreement with a term of not less than twenty-five
(25) years and be owned and maintained as described in subsection
32-83.22 paragraph b. above. The agreement shall provide for scheduled public
use of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of peak use times as determined
by the Town.
   h.   The credit granted shall bear a reasonable relationship to the park and
recreation needs of the subdivision residents met by the private facilities.
The credit granted shall be related to the recreation facilities developed and
the resulting reduction of the burden on public facilities to serve subdivision
residents. The determination of the Town as to whether credit shall be given
and the amount of credit is final.
(Ord. #69-85, §8-6222)
   32-83.23   Exemptions.

Division 2
ADMINISTRATION AND PROCEDURES
   32-98.4   Administration.
   The Chief of Planning shall administer and enforce this article. Each
officer and employee of the Town shall assist and cooperate with the Chief of
Planning in enforcement of this article. (Ord. #91-30, §2; Ord. #95-06, §3)
   32-98.5   Owner's Consent.
   No sign may be placed upon a property without the consent of the property
owner. ([Ord. #91-30, §2; Ord. #95-06, §3)
   32-98.6   Permits Required.
   A sign permit provides Town review of signs for all businesses. The
standards contained in this article are intended to be maximums. The Town may
impose more strict standards than these regulations if the proposed sign is
determined to exceed what is necessary for adequate identification.
   a.   A sign permit is required prior to placing a sign (including individual
letter signs) in the Town, unless the sign is specifically exempted under this
article.
   b.   All signs not in conformance with this article, existing upon the date
of adoption of this article, are permitted to re- main in use until such time
as there is a request to change the sign or application for a new sign permit
for any sign related to the subject business. Use of temporary/promotional
signs are ex- empt from this section. Sign permits for new signs may be
conditioned upon removal of existing signs made illegal by this article.
      Any alteration or change of face to an existing sign is subject to the
provisions of this article. The owner, or his assigned agent, shall obtain a
sign permit before making such alterations to an existing sign. However, no
permit is required for repainting a sign the same color, cleaning or other
normal maintenance or repair of a sign, as long as the sign is not structurally
modified in any manner. A change of face for a tenant of a multi-tenant sign is
permitted without requiring the entire sign to conform with this article, if
the face change is less than fifty-one (51%) percent of the total sign area. If
the face change for a multi-tenant sign is greater than fifty-one (51%) percent
of the total sign area, then the sign shall be subject to subsection
32-98.32 and shall be amortized over a period of six (6) months.
   c.   Signs in existence on the date of adoption of this article which have
been granted an exception by the Town of Danville, may change a sign face
providing that the factors justifying the original exception still pertain.
   d.   Prior to installation, a building permit shall be required for all
signs attached to a structure or anchored to the ground.
(Ord. #91-30, §2; Ord. #95-06, §3)
   32-98.7   Exceptions.
   Upon application, the Design Review Board or Chief of Planning may grant an
exception to a regulation in this article, or at the discretion of the Chief of
Planning, the application may be referred to the Planning Commission. An
exception may be granted when the following conditions are found to be present:
   a.   The proposed exception conforms as closely as practicable to the
regulations pertaining to sign size, number, and location; and
   b.   The proposed exception is not inconsistent with the intent and purpose
of the sign regulations; and
   c.   Either:
      1.   Strict adherence to the sign regulations does not allow adequate
identification of the site because of the site's location or configuration, or
because the proposed business or use is obscured from view by adjacent
buildings and/or vegetation; or
      2.   The architectural style, materials or construction elements of the
building are such that a sign placed in conformance with this chapter would
conflict with other aesthetic considerations.
(Ord. #91-30, §2; Ord. #95-06, §3)
   32-98.8   Exemptions.
   The following signs are exempt from obtaining a sign permit but shall comply
with all other regulations of this article:

safety or welfare of the public, such as a sign identifying high voltage,
underground cable or related to the construction of Town capital improvement
projects.

32-104    TRI-VALLEY TRANSPORTATION DEVELOPMENT FEES.
   32-104.1 Purpose and Use of Fees.  
   The purpose of the fees described in this section is to generate funds to
finance improvements to regional transportation projects which are designed to
help mitigate the regional impacts of forecasted development within the Tri-
Valley Development Area. The fees will be used to finance the road improvements
listed in the Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement Establishing the Tri-Valley
Transportation Council for Planning and Facilitating the Implementation of
Transportation Improvement Projects in the Tri- Valley Transportation Area
(JEPA). As discussed in more detail in the JEPA, there is a reasonable
relationship between the fees and the types of development projects that are
subject to the fees in that the development projects will generate additional
traffic on regional transportation facilities in the Tri-Valley area, thus
creating a need to expand or improve existing facilities to mitigate adverse
traffic and infrastructure impacts that would otherwise result from such
development projects.
(Ord. #2009-07, § 2; Ord. #2015-02, § 1)

(Ord. #2009-07, § 2; Ord. #2015-02, § 2)
   32-104.4 Payment of Fees.  
   a.   Project developers shall be required to pay the fees prior to issuance
of building permits for the project, or no later than occupancy, and to the
extent permitted by law; and
   b.   The fees shall be levied on all development projects not exempt from
payment of the fee; and
   c.   The fees shall apply on all significant changes to existing development
agreements adopted after the execution of this Agreement. The fee shall be
applied to all components of a project that are subject to an amended or
renewed development agreement. As used herein, significant means any of the
following: (a) change in land use type (e.g., office to retail); (b)
intensification of land use types (e.g., increase in square footage of approved
office); (c) extension of term of development agreements; and (d) reduction or
removal of project mitigation requirements or conditions of approval.
(Ord. #2009-07, § 2; Ord. 2015-02, § 3)
   32-104.5 Annual Fee Adjustment Process.  
   The fees set forth by Resolution of the Town Council pursuant to Section
32-104.3 of the Danville Municipal Code shall be adjusted annually on March 1
to account for inflation using the Engineering News Record Construction Cost
Index for the San Francisco Bay Area for the period ending December 31 of the
preceding calendar year. Such adjustment shall not require further notice or
public hearing.

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
32-117    FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION REGULATIONS.
Division 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS
   32-117.1   Findings of Fact.
   a.   The flood hazard areas of the Town are subject to periodic inundation
which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   b.   These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards that increase flood heights and
velocities also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. #133, §8-4801; Ord. #2002-02, §2)
   32-117.2   Statement of Purpose.
   It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specified areas by provisions designed to:
   a.   Protect human life and health;
   b.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   c.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   d.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   e.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   f.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   g.   Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
   h.   Insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions. (Ord. #133, §8-4802; Ord. #2002-02, §2)
   32-117.3   Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this section includes methods and
provisions for:
   a.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   b.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   c.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   d.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   e.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas. (Ord. #133, §8-4804; Ord. #2002-02, §2)

on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by flood
waters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not
less than ten (10) and no more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot. Use of
breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and
shall meet the following conditions:
      1.   Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than
that which would occur during the base flood; and
      2.   The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural
damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the
event of the base flood.
   l.   Building (See "structure").

effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   q.   Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means
the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including
the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final
site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   r.   Flood, flooding, or flood water means:
      1.   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;

applicable to the community.
   v.   Flood Insurance Study means the official report provided by the Federal
Insurance Administration that included flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate
Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of
the base flood.
   w.   Flood-related erosion means the collapse or subsidence of land along
the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by
waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical level or suddenly
caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied
by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash
flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusually and
unforeseeable event which results in flooding.
   x.   Flood-related erosion area or flood-related erosion prone area means a
land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water which, due to
the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven
currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage.
   y.   Flood-related erosion area management means the operation of an overall
program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related
erosion damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans,
flood-related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations.
   z.   Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being
inundated by water from any source (See "flooding").
   aa.   Floodplain Administrator is the individual appointed to administer and
enforce the floodplain management regulations.
   bb.   Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and
enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but
not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain
management regulations, and open space plans.
   cc.   Floodplain management regulations means this ordinance and other
zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other
application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination
thereof that provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and
damage.
   dd.   Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary

   ee.   Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1)
foot. Also referred to as "Regulatory Floodway."
   ff.   Floodway fringe is that area of the floodplain on either side of the
"Regulatory Floodway" where encroachment may be permitted.
   gg.   Fraud and victimization as related to Division 5, Variances, of this
section, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the Town of
Danville will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to
government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50)
to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed
below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased
risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the
community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and
suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, the future
owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood
damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   hh.   Functionally dependent use means a use that cannot perform its
intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to
water. The term includes only docking facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, and does not include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   ii.   Governing body is the local governing unit, i.e., county or
municipality, which is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide
for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   jj.   Hardship as related to Division 5, Variances of this section, means
the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the
requested variance. The Town of Danville requires that the variance be
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.
All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
   kk.   Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the
ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   ll.   Historic structure means any structure that is:

communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or
directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
   mm.   Levee means a man made structure, usually an earthen embankment,
designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to
contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from
temporary flooding.

(See "basement" definition).
      1.   An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor
that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an
area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor
provided it conforms to applicable non elevation design requirements,
including, but not limited to:
         (a)   The wet floodproofing standard in section 32-117.34c;
         (b)   The anchoring standards in section 32-117.32;
         (c)   The construction materials and methods standards in section 32-
117.33; and
         (d)   The standards for utilities in section 32-117.36.
      2.   For residential structures, all subgrade-enclosed areas are
prohibited as they are considered to be basements (See "basement" definition).
This prohibition includes below grade garages and storage areas.
   pp.   Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."
   qq.   Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous
parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent
or sale.
   rr.   Market Value shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the
structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of
depreciation that has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of
replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor
determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the
building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined
by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and
functional obsolescence as approved by the Development Services Director, but
shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of
replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those
contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only
if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent
professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the
differences.
   ss.   Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance
Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to
which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are
referenced.
   tt.   Mudslide describes a condition where there is a river, flow or
inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual
condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on
the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain.
   uu.   Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone area means an area with land surfaces
and slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate
indicate a potential for mudflow.

effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community.
   xx.   Obstruction includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation,
channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, weir, fence, rock, gravel,
refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or
projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.
   yy.   One hundred year flood or 100-year flood (See "baseflood").
   zz.   Primary frontal dune means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or
ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately
landward and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from
high tides and waves during major coastal storms. The inland limit of the

a relatively mild slope.
   aaa.   Public safety and nuisance as related to Division 5, Flood Hazard
Variance Procedure, of this section means that the granting of a variance must
not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire

temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   ccc.   Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more
than one (1) foot.
   ddd.   Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development
into compliance with State or local floodplain management regulations, or, if
this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that
impacts may be reduced include protecting the enforcement provisions of the
ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing State
or Federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other
development.
   eee.   Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river
(including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.

provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the permit. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation of the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
   jjj.   Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally
above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured
home.

   lll.   Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which
equals or exceeds fifty (50%) percent of the market value of the structures
before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes
structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
      1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      2.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
   mmm.   V zone (See "coastal high hazard area").
   nnn.   Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this
ordinance that permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be
prohibited by this ordinance.
   ooo.   Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with this ordinance. A structure or other development without
the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of
compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such
time as that documentation is provided.
   ppp.   Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of
floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or

   f.   Alteration of Watercourses. Whenever a watercourse is to be altered or
relocated, the Development Services Director shall:
      1.   Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water
Resources prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit
evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration; and
      2.   Require that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse be maintained.
   g.   Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries. The Development Services Director
shall make interpretations where needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions,
grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries or
the special flood hazard area). The person contesting the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Division 5 of this section.

floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
   c.   A flood hazard variance shall only be issued upon a determination that
the flood hazard variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief. (Ord. #133, §8-4244; Ord. #2002-02, §2)
   32-117.45   Showing Necessary for Flood Hazard Variance.
   a.   A flood hazard variance shall only be issued upon:
      1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      2.   A determination that failure to grant the flood hazard variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      3.   A determination that the granting of a flood hazard variance will
not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense; create nuisances; cause fraud on or victimization
of the public; or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   b.   Flood hazard variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of this subsection
and subsection
32-117.44 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
create no additional threats to public safety. (Ord. #133, §8-4245; Ord. #2002-

      1.   Residential. For residential development the fee shall be determined
by determining the number of preschool age and school age children per unit,
multiplied by the percentage of residents anticipated to desire child care,
multiplied by the per child cost of providing child care in Danville. For
Danville this formula is computed as follows:

      1.   The developer shall prepare a survey or assessment of the estimated
child care needs generated by the proposed project together with an action plan
addressing how the child care needs resulting from the project will be
mitigated. The action plan shall include information on the location and
capacity of existing or proposed child care facilities and how these will be
used, established, maintained and operated. If the action plan recommends that
child care facilities be provided by existing facilities or through proposed
facilities which are not a part of the project, the developer shall provide
sufficient information to determine that child care needs generated by the
project shall be mitigated. The child care survey or assessment may be prepared
by a qualified consultant or by the developer using the preschool and school
age child yield rates contained in subsection
32-126.6a.,1 and 2 of this section, as approved by the Chief of Planning.
      2.   The Planning Department shall determine the type and extent of
participation in the construction or establishment of facilities.

   32-140.1   Intent and Purpose.
   The Town Council finds and declares that:
   a.   The intent and purpose of this article is to create a fee to be
collected of all new development to provide the minimum funding necessary to
offset costs to Town resources in the implementation of a National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). In this regard, the Danville Town Council
hereby finds, based on the staff report submitted herewith, and oral and
documentary evidence submitted to the Town Council at a public hearing on
August 6, 1991, that this fee does not exceed the reasonable cost of providing
the service or regulatory activity for which the fee is charged and is not
levied for general revenue purposes.
   b.   The Town of Danville does hereby support the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, the San Francisco Bay Region of the California Regional
Water Quality Control Board, the Contra Costa County Flood Control and Water
Conservation District and the local municipalities in the County of Contra
Costa in their mutual efforts to identify and reduce storm water runoff
pollutant discharge into the waters of San Francisco Bay.
   c.   New development within the Town of Danville does inherently create
additional drainage volume and add to the existing pollutants entering the
waters of San Francisco Bay.
   d.   The Town of Danville General Plan for Infrastructures has Goals and
Policies specifying the incorporation of flood control systems to preserve
existing waterways consistent with public safety and requires that the cost of
upgrading those public facilities be borne by new developers and not existing
residents.
   e.   The Town of Danville staff will be responsible for the implementation
of portions of the Federal Clean Water Act requiring identification of
pollutants and ultimately their removal from storm water runoff from sites
within the Town's boundaries. In order to implement this program and comply
with directives of the Town General Plan, Town staff and resources will be
devoted to this end, and funding for this program shall be collected from new
development.
   f.   This article is adopted under the police power of the Town, Article XI,
Section 7 of the California Constitution, and under the appropriate provisions
of the Planning and Zoning Law of the State of California, Government Code
§66014 through §66018.

Council. (Ord. #91-26, §1; Ord, #98-06, §9)
   32-140.4   Time of Payment.
   The NPDES fee shall be paid to the Town of Danville before issuance of a
building permit. (Ord #91-26, §1)
