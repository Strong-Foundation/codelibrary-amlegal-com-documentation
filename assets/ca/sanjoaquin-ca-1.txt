requirements of this section, the City Clerk may give written notice of such
insufficiency to the appellant, stating with particularity the defects or
omissions therein. Failure of the appellant to file an amended appeal within
seven calendar days of the date of service of such notice of insufficiency

Equalization.

those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of his or
her refusal to pay the tax imposed on the energy charges, division (M) below
will apply.
      (2)   The duty to collect tax from a service user shall commence with the
beginning of the first full regular billing period applicable to the service
user where all charges normally included in the regular billing are subject to
the provisions of this section. Where a person receives more than one billing,
one or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall
arise separately for each billing.
   (M)   Additional powers and duties of Tax Administrator.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator shall have the power and duty, and is hereby
directed, to enforce each and all of the provisions of this section.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have the power to adopt rules and

herein imposed.  A copy of the rules and regulations shall be on file in the
Tax Administrator's office.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may make administrative agreements to vary
the strict requirements of this section so that collection of any tax imposed
here may be made in conformance with the billing procedures of particular
service supplier so long as the agreements result in collection of the tax in
conformance with the general purpose and scope of this section. A copy of each
agreement shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office.
      (4)   The Tax Administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person
who asserts a right to exemption from the tax imposed by this section. The Tax
Administrator shall provide the service supplier with the name of any person
who the Tax Administrator determines is exempt from the tax imposed hereby,
together with the address and account number to which service is supplied to
any exempt person. The Tax Administrator shall notify the service supplier of
termination of any person's right to exemption hereunder, or the change of any
address to which service is supplied to any exempt person.
      (5)   The Tax Administrator shall provide notice to all service
suppliers, at least 90 days prior to any annexation or other change in the
city's boundaries. The notice shall set forth the revised boundaries by street
and address, along with a copy of the final annexation order from LAFCO.
   (N)   Assessment; service user administrative remedy.
      (1)   Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has
deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by him or her from the amounts
remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or that a service user has
refused to pay the amount of tax, the person may be relieved of the obligation
to collect taxes due under this section from certain named service users for
specified billing periods as set forth below.
      (2)   The service supplier shall provide the city with amounts refused
and/or unpaid along with the names and addresses of the service users
neglecting to pay the tax imposed under provisions of this section. Whenever
the service user has failed to pay the amount of tax for a period of two or
more billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation
to collect taxes due.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator shall notify the service user that the Tax
Administrator assumed responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated
periods and demand payment of the taxes. The  notice shall be served on the
service user by handing it to him or her personally or by deposit of the notice
in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the service
user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect
the tax; or, should the service user's address change, to the last known
address. If a service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator
within 15 days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or  her,
which shall be the date of the service of the notice upon him or her, which
shall be the date of mailing if service is not accomplished in person, a
penalty of 25% of the amount of the tax set forth in the notice shall be
imposed, but not less than $5. The penalty shall become part of the tax herein
required to be paid.
   (O)   Records.  It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and
remit to the city any tax imposed by this section to keep and preserve, for a
period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount
of the tax as he or she may have been liable for the remittance to the Tax
Administrator, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to
inspect at all reasonable times.
   (P)   Refunds.
      (1)   Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more than
once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax
Administrator under this section, it may be refunded as provided in this
division.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (P)(1) above, a service
supplier may claim a refund; or take as credit against taxes remitted the
amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or
received when it is established that the service user from whom the tax has
been collected did not owe the tax; provided, however, that, neither a refund
nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax erroneously or
illegally collected has either been refunded to the service user or credited to
charges subsequently payable by the service user to the person required to
collect and remit. A service supplier that has collected any amount of tax in
excess of the amount of tax imposed by this section and actually due from a
service user, may refund the amount to the service user and  claim credit for
the overpayment against the amount of tax which is due upon any other monthly
returns, provided the credit is claimed in a return dated no later than three
years from the date of overpayment.
      (3)   Notwithstanding other provisions of this division, whenever a
service supplier, pursuant to an order of the State Public Utilities Commission
or a court of competent jurisdiction, makes a refund to service users of
charges for past utility services, the taxes paid pursuant to this section on
the amount of the refunded charges shall also be refunded to service users, and
the service supplier shall be entitled to claim a credit for the refunded taxes
against the amount of tax which is due upon the next monthly returns. In the
event this section is repealed, the amounts of any refundable taxes will be
borne by the city.
      (4)   A service supplier may refund the taxes collected to the service
user in accordance with this division or by the service supplier's customary
practice.
      (5)   Any claims for refunds of taxes imposed by this section must be
presented to the city no later than three years after the date of payment for
which a refund is claimed to be due.
   (Q)   Termination or suspension of utility user's tax.
      (1)   The service supplier shall, upon notification, terminate or suspend
collection of any utility user's tax commencing with the first full billing
period which occurs after the effective date of the action by the City Council.
      (2)   Collection of the tax imposed in this section shall terminate on
the twentieth anniversary of the date on which the provisions of this chapter
became effective.
   (R)   Operative date.  The tax imposed under this ordinance shall apply to
bills rendered on the thirtieth day following a declaration by the City Council
that not less than two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure voted in
favor of the adoption of this section or as soon thereafter as the respective
utilities are physically and mechanically able to get "on line" for the
imposition of charges (not more than 60 days).

requires an RFP or RFQ process, the city shall comply with said process to
secure funding.
(Ord. 15-100, passed 2-11-2015)

SPECIAL WATER AND SEWER CONNECTION CHARGES
§ 50.01  APPLICABILITY.
   Before a permit or permits shall be issued by the city for sewer and/or
water connections to property of the type described in divisions (A) and (B) of
this section, and/or before any work is done by the city to extend existing
sewer and/or water mains to serve property to the type described in divisions
(A) and (B) of this section, the procedures and requirements of this subchapter
shall be followed and abided by:
   (A)   Property outside of the city limits which shall hereafter be annexed
to the city, which property shall use existing sewer and/or water facilities
for which the property shall not have made full payment of its share of the
cost thereof; and/or property outside of the city limits which shall hereafter
be annexed to the city for which property it is necessary to extend existing
sewer and/or water lines in order to give sewer and/or water service to the
same; and
   (B)   Property within the city, which property shall use existing sewer and/
or water facilities for which the property shall not have made full payment of
its share of the cost thereof; and/or property within the city, for which
property it is necessary to extend existing sewer and/or water lines in order
to give sewer and/or water service to the same.
(1994 Code, § 13.24.010)  (Ord. 71-2, passed - -1971)
§ 50.02  CONNECTION CHARGE.
   (A)   The owner of property of the type described in §
50.01 applying for sewer and/or water service from the city, shall, in the
manner hereinafter provided, pay to the city for the privilege a sum to be
computed by the City Engineer which is equivalent to the fair and reasonable
cost to the property owner of acquiring the use of existing facilities and/or
of extending new facilities to serve the property of the applicant. In
computing the cost, the City Engineer shall consider, among other things, the
following factors in order to arrive at a fair reasonable sum:
      (1)   The cost to similar property within the city which has paid for the
facilities to be acquired or used;
      (2)   The present or past cost to the city of extending existing
facilities across the front footage of the property to be served;
      (3)   The availability of any new facilities installed for use by
adjacent property owners which will share in the cost of the same on hooking
up;
      (4)   A credit for any excess capacity installed: and
      (5)   In regard to annexed property any amounts for which bonds of the
city are outstanding and to which the property has or will become subject to
upon annexation.
   (B)   The sum to be determined by the City Engineer under the provisions of
this section shall be computed on a front footage basis.
(1994 Code, § 13.24.020)  (Ord. 71-2, passed - -1971)
§ 50.03  PERMIT APPLICATION.
   The owner of property of the type described in §
50.01 applying for sewer and/or water service from the city shall fill out an
application for the same at the office of the City Clerk on an application form
to be furnished by the city giving his or her name, address, the legal
description of the property for which sewer and/or water service is requested
and the type of hookup required, whether water, sewer or both. The City Clerk
shall transmit the application to the City Engineer who shall forthwith
determine the cost to the property owner in accordance with the provisions of §
50.02. Upon computing the cost, the City Engineer shall bring the matter before
the City Council, which body shall authorize or disapprove the application by
minute order. In making a determination in this regard, the City Council shall
consider, among other relevant factors, the physical location of the property
to be served in relationship to existing facilities and the amount of expense,
if any, to the city in giving the service requested for which there will not be
an immediate return to the city. The City Council may reject any such
application if the property requesting service is physically remote from
existing facilities or if the expense to the city is disproportionate; if the
application is approved by the City Council, the same shall then be acted on by
the Superintendent of Public Works but only after the property owner has either
paid to the city the full sum required thereby or entered into a written
agreement with the city to pay the same on completion of the work required
thereby either in full or on a stipulated installment basis.

supplying utility service to the property. Upon completion of the work by the
City Superintendent of Public Works, he or she shall file a written report with
the City Council setting forth the fact that the required underground
facilities have been provided and the cost thereof, together with a legal

over to the Assessor and Tax Collector a notice of lien on each of the
properties on which the assessment has not been paid, and the Assessor and Tax
Collector shall add the amount of the assessment to the next regular bill for
taxes levied against the premises upon which the assessment was not paid. The
assessment shall be due and payable at the same time as the property taxes are
due and payable, and if not paid when due and payable, shall bear interest at
the rate of 6% per annum.

§ 52.04  LIQUID WASTE DISCHARGE POLICY.
   The City Sewer Department builds and operates local wastewater collecting
systems within the area. The following basic Department policies apply to
liquid waste discharges within the service area boundaries. Generally, liquid
wastes originating within the city boundaries will be removed by the city's
collection system provided the wastes will not damage structures, create
nuisances such as odors, menace public health, impose unreasonable collection,
treatment or disposal costs on the city, interfere with wastewater treatment
processes, exceed quality requirements set by regulatory government agencies,
or detrimentally affect the local environment. The highest and best use of the
city sewerage system is the conveyance of domestic wastewater. The use of the

fees and charges received under this chapter, giving the names and addresses of
the persons on whose account the fees and charges were paid, the date and
amount thereof, and the purpose for which charges were paid.
(1994 Code, § 13.20.110)  (Ord. 78-105, passed - -1978)
§ 52.31  ESTIMATIONS.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, whenever the fees and charges required by
this chapter are based on estimated values or estimated quantities, the
Superintendent shall make the determinations in accordance with established
estimating practices.
(1994 Code, § 13.20.120)  (Ord. 78-105, passed - -1978)
§ 52.32  GENERALLY.
   Rates charged shall be as follows.
   (A)   The charges for basic service, new connections to and increased
utilization of existing connections shall all be based upon a unit of service
which shall be termed a residential equivalent. For the purpose of this chapter
the residential equivalent shall be defined as that service necessary to
transport, treat and dispose of an amount of wastewater equal in quantity and
quality to the daily amount which can be expected to be discharged from an
average single-family residence in the area. In terms of quantity, a
residential equivalent shall be any amount from a single connection up to a
maximum of 415 gallons per day. In terms of quality, a residential equivalent
shall be wastewater which shall not require more treatment than is required for
ordinary domestic sewage with a BOD5 equal to 250 mg/l. In the event that the
discharge of wastewater through any connection exceeds the above definition of
a residential equivalent in either quantity or quality, then the connection
shall be charged a basic service charge equal to the established basic charge
for a single residential equivalent times the number of residential equivalents
contained in the discharge. The Superintendent shall determine the number of
residential equivalents for each connection. In the event that the discharger
has reason to believe that the number of residential equivalents calculated by
the Superintendent are not accurate, the Superintendent shall investigate the
connection and make a separate determination of the number of residential
equivalents contained in the discharge and report to the City Council who will
set the service charge accordingly.
   (B)   The charge for basic service shall be $4.50 per month for each
residential equivalent or portion thereof except that mobile homes shall be
charged $3.60 per month.
   (C)   In the event that a connection shall discharge wastewater to the
system in amounts that vary substantially from season to season, then the
connection shall pay a basic service charge for the entire year based upon the
period of greatest discharge and no reduction shall be allowed for periods of
decreased flow.
   (D)   The minimum service charge shall be that amount established for a
residential equivalent in division (B) of this section, except in the case of
mobile homes which may be charged an amount less than the basic charge.
   (E)   Any new connection to the sewer system of the city shall pay a
connection charge as set forth in division (F) of this section, plus actual
cost to the city for any construction work, materials, meter or other
appurtenances furnished by the city in making the connection.
   (F)   The connection charge which shall be considered to be a partial
payment for a proportionate part of the existing facilities shall be according
to the following schedule:
      (1)   Single-family residence: $200 per connection;
      (2)   Multiple-family residence consisting of two units: $175 per unit;
      (3)   Multiple-family residence consisting of three or more units: $150
per unit; and
      (4)   Commercial or industrial connection: The charge shall he or she
determined by the future resolution of the City Council acting on the written
report and recommendation of the Superintendent. The basic factor to be
considered shall be the proportionate contribution that the subject connection
will discharge to the sewer facilities in terms of flow and BOD. However, in no
event shall the connection charge be less than $200.
   (G)   Whenever any user already connected to the sewer system of the city
shall make a change in the operations conducted on the property, which will
result in a significant increase in the amount of capacity required to service
the connection, the monthly charge shall be equal to the then current basic
service charge times the number of residential equivalents of increased use.
   (H)   In any case where the volume and/or quality of flow may be in doubt,
the city may require that the flow be metered to determine volume and/or
sampled from time to time to determine quality.
   (I)   The rates fixed by this chapter may, from time to time, be modified by
resolution of the City Council.

§ 53.05  FEES, CHARGES, RESPONSIBILITY, AND PAYMENTS.
   (A)   Fees and charges.  Fees and charges for utility services shall be in
the amounts designated by city resolution.
   (B)   Property owner’s responsibility.  An owner or purchaser of premises
maintaining water or sewer connections or furnished solid waste disposal
service shall assume responsibility for financial obligations of such service
effective the date possession of the property is taken.
   (C)   Payments.
      (1)   Place of payment.  Bills are payable at City Hall, 21900 West
Colorado Avenue, San Joaquin, California, or to an authorized city collector or
city collection agent.
      (2)   Due date.  Payments for utilities are due and payable on the first
day of each month succeeding the month in which the services are used. In the
event an account is closed, the monthly charges will be prorated on a semi-
monthly basis. If payments for utilities are not paid by the 25th day of the
month after the charges become due, the city shall add a delinquency penalty as
authorized by city resolution.
      (3)   Credit to account.  Payments shall be credited to a customer’s
account only when actually received by the city or city collector or collection
agent. Payments shall be received “on account” of the customer and shall not
apply to charges for any particular period.
      (4)   Checks.  If a remittance tendered in payment of any account fails
to clear through the banks and is returned, the account shall be considered
unpaid, any receipts issued therefor shall be void, and the indebtedness shall
be restored to the account.
      (5)   Service charge for returned checks.  A service charge designated by
city resolution shall be assessed for returned checks. This charge shall be
made against the account originally credited, shall be added to the amount of
the bill, and shall become a part thereof. This returned check service charge
is in addition to any collection, restoration or reconnection charges which may
otherwise become due and payable. Assessment of this service charge shall not
relieve the maker of any criminal or civil liability provided by law.
   (D)   Disputed bills.  Should the amount of any bill for service be
questioned, the customer should promptly request an explanation. If the
explanation is not satisfactory or is not understood, the customer must pay the
bill under protest in order to avoid discontinuance of service. Protests will
be addressed to the City Manager, must be in writing, and must state the
reasons why the charges are believed to be incorrect. The City Manager will
analyze the facts of the case and is authorized to make such adjustments in the
charges as may be necessary to effect an equitable settlement. Failure of a
customer to pay under protest after initial explanation is offered will warrant
discontinuance of service without further notice if bill is not paid by
delinquency date.
   (E)   Failure to receive bills.  Utility service bills shall be mailed to
the mailing address on the application or other address known to the city. The
applicant, property owner, or his or her authorized agent may list a mailing
address with the city for use in mailing bills. Failure to request such listing
or to receive any bill, invoice, or notice shall not relieve responsibility for
timely payment as required.
(Ord. 13-105, passed 11-12-2013)
§ 53.06  DEPOSITS AND SECURITY PAYMENT.
   (A)   Deposit required.  All applicants for utility service shall pay a cash
deposit at the time of making application for utilities service in the amount
of three times the monthly charge for the utilities, or in the case of water
meters or special service in the amount of three times the estimated monthly
charge therefor as determined by the City Manager. When actual records of
previous consumption or charges at the service location are not available, or
where the use of the property or the nature or extent of services rendered will
change, the estimate shall be based on charges to customers whose installations
are similar in size and similarly operated. The city shall have the right to
utilize the deposit to pay any outstanding delinquent charges.
   (B)   Return of deposit.  Upon the closing of any account, the balance of
the security or prepaid charges, remaining after the closing bill for service
has been paid, and less any city offsets, shall be returned to the customer
upon application for refund, provided such application is made within one year
after discontinuance of service. No interest shall be paid by the city on any
such balance. In the event no such application is received in one year, said
balance shall be forfeited.
   (C)   Failure to pay bills promptly.  If a customer fails to pay his or her
bills promptly as required by this chapter and the city utilizes the customer’s
deposit for payment, the City Manager may require as a condition precedent to
further service and as security for the payment of bills thereafter to be
incurred, further security as described in division (A) above, provided that
service will not be discontinued or disconnected for failure to make such
deposit until at least 15 days after notice of intention to do so has been
given to the customer and to the consumer, if different.
(Ord. 13-105, passed 11-12-2013)
§ 53.07  LATE PAYMENT OF UTILITY SERVICE BILL.
   (A)   Service charge.  Whenever a payment of any bill for utility services
is not received by the specified delinquent date, the delinquency service
charge designated by city resolution shall be, without notice, added to the
amount of such bill and become part thereof. This division shall not apply to
payments due from any government or governmental agency.
   (B)   Delinquency notice.  A delinquent bill notice or reminder, stating the
amount past due and remaining unpaid and the service charge due and payable,
may be mailed to the customer and to the owner of the premises.
   (C)   Collection or restoration charge.  Upon any of the following listed
occurrences, the City Manager may send a representative to collect the bill or
discontinue the utility service, and the service charge designated by city
resolution shall be charged for this collection follow-up and/or any
restoration or reconnection of service during normal working hours.
      (1)   When a delinquent bill, bill notice or reminder, or dishonored
check remains unpaid more than seven days after a mailing of a notice or
reminder thereof;
      (2)   When a written application for service is not received as provided
in this chapter; or
      (3)   When service has been discontinued for violations of other sections
of this code or of rules and regulations issued as authorized in this code.
   (D)   Discontinuance for nonpayment.  The City Manager may discontinue, upon
ten days’ written notice, any or all utility services being rendered, at any or
all premises for which the customer is responsible for payment of charges,
including main, branch, and front footage charges owed, and may require payment
in full of all amounts due including service charges and cost of discontinuance
and restoration of the service, before any service is restored; provided
however, that water service to a dwelling, or to a part of a multifamily
dwelling, leased or rented to a tenant who is not a customer shall not be
terminated without 20 days’ prior written notice  from the City Manager to the
tenant where the City Manager has actual knowledge that such tenant is not a
customer.
   (E)   City collection of debt.  Delinquent fees and charges as well as
service charges and penalties assessed under this chapter constitute a debt to
city. The city may avail itself of any remedies at law including but not
limited to collection through a collection agency, filing of lien, and court
action.
   (F)   Notice of lien.

§ 54.002  FINDINGS.
   (A)   A reliable minimum supply of potable water is essential to the public
health, safety, and welfare of the people and economy of the Central Valley
region.  The City of San Joaquin is located in Central California which is a
semi-arid region and is largely dependent upon water supplies. A growing
population, climate change, environmental concerns, and other factors in other
parts of the state and western United States, make the region highly
susceptible to water supply reliability issues.
   (B)   Careful water management that includes active water conservation
measures not only in times
of drought, but at all times, is essential to ensure a reliable minimum supply
of water to meet current and future water supply needs.
   (C)   Article X, Section 2 of the California Constitution declares that the
general welfare requires that water resources be put to beneficial use, waste
or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented; and

water be fully exercised with a view to the reasonable and beneficial use
thereof in the interest of the people and for the public welfare.
   (D)   Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution declares that a
city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary and
other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws. 
   (E)   Cal. Water Code § 375 authorizes water suppliers to adopt and enforce
a comprehensive water conservation program to reduce water consumption and
conserve supplies by ordinance or resolution.
   (F)   The adoption and enforcement of a water conservation program is
necessary to manage the city's potable water supply in the short and long-term
and to avoid or minimize the effects of drought and shortage within the city.
Such program is essential to ensure a reliable and sustainable minimum supply
of water for the public health, safety, and welfare.
(Ord. 15-103, passed 6-9-2015)
§ 54.003  DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish a water conservation plan
that will reduce water consumption within the city through conservation, enable
effective water supply planning, assure reasonable and beneficial use of water,
prevent waste of water, maximize the efficient use of water within the city to
avoid and minimize the effect and hardship of water shortage to the greatest
extent possible, and meet any state laws or state regulations requiring water
conservation.
   (B)   This chapter establishes water conservation standards intended to
alter behavior related to water use efficiency at all times and authorizes the
City Council to adopt further measures to be implemented during times of
declared water shortage or declared water shortage emergencies, with increasing
restrictions on water use in response to worsening drought or emergency
conditions and decreasing supplies.

administrative hearings or court proceedings held to determine disposition of

reason, the animal regulations officer shall, within a reasonable time, provide
the owner or keeper of the animal, if known, with the opportunity for a post
seizure hearing to determine the validity of the seizure or impoundment, or

      (6)   Notwithstanding satisfaction of the requirements for redemption, an
animal regulations officer, at his or her discretion, may refuse to permit the

or any other municipal, county or state law, until in his or her opinion the
need for the retention of such animal no longer exists. The animal regulations
officer shall document in writing the need for the retention of an animal under
this division and notify the owner of his or her right to contest that
determination by filing a written request for a hearing within two business
days of receipt of the determination. If the owner requests a hearing, the
animal regulations officer shall schedule a hearing before a hearing officer
appointed by the City Manager. The hearing shall be held within five business

   (I)   Abandonment.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, an
impounded animal which is not redeemed within the specified holding period,
whether due to a failure to satisfy monetary obligations or otherwise, shall be
considered to be abandoned by its owner and shall become the property of the

the animal.

      (1)   Upon request, an owner may surrender his or her animal to the city

city shall be subject to a fee as set forth by city resolution for each animal.
      (3)   The surrender of an animal by an owner to the city and subsequent

charges, veterinary charges or any other charges related to the impounding and
keeping of the animal.
   (K)   Removing animal from custody without permission prohibited.  No person

§ 92.14  KEEPING OF POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS AND VICIOUS ANIMALS.
   (A)   Investigation, confinement, seizures and impoundment.
      (1)   Whenever an animal suspected of being potentially dangerous or
vicious is reported, an animal regulations officer shall investigate the
circumstances and if the officer finds that the animal shows a propensity to
attack, bite, scratch, annoy or harass people or other animals without
provocation, or displays any other such behavior, the officer shall notify the
owner in writing, stating the facts and circumstances. The animal regulations
officer may order that the animal be kept within an enclosure, securely leashed
or otherwise controlled.
      (2)   If the animal regulations officer has probable cause to believe an
animal may be designated as "potentially dangerous" or "vicious" under this
chapter, and the owner is unwilling or unable to properly contain and/or
control the animal immediately or the animal poses an immediate threat to the
safety of persons or domestic animals, the animal may be seized pending the
outcome of a hearing or trial and any appeals conducted pursuant to this
chapter, or during the period of time the owner requires to comply with any
requirements imposed hereunder. Any animal seized hereunder shall be impounded
and kept at the Animal Shelter at the owner's expense.
      (3)   The animal's owner shall be charged for all costs incurred or fees
applicable with respect to such impoundment unless a finding is made that the
animal is not potentially dangerous or vicious, in which case the owner shall
be charged only for independently incurred impound costs and fees, if any. An
animal held under the provisions of this section shall not be released until
the owner pays all charges as specified in §
92.14 of this chapter. If the owner refuses to pay such charges, the animal
shall be treated as abandoned by the owner, and disposed of pursuant to §
92.14 of this chapter. Disposal of the animal does not release the owner from
his or her responsibility to pay the keeping charges.
      (4)   The owner of an animal that has bitten another animal or person
shall, upon demand from any animal regulations officer, demonstrate to the
animal regulations officer that the animal has been properly immunized with a
rabies vaccine in accordance with the provisions of this chapter or otherwise
release the animal to the animal regulations officer for inspection or
quarantine.  The animal shall be quarantined for a period of ten days, or for
such period as required by state law.
   (B)   Petition to declare animal as potentially dangerous or vicious.  If an
animal regulations officer has investigated and determined that there is
probable cause to believe that an animal is potentially dangerous or vicious,
an animal regulations officer, the Chief of Police or their designee may
prepare a petition to have the animal declared potentially dangerous or
vicious. The petition may be filed with the Court or the City Manager. If filed
with the Court, the procedures set forth in Cal. Food and Agricultural Code §§
31621 through 31624, as those sections may be amended from time to time, shall
apply. If filed with the City Manager, the procedures set forth in this article
shall apply. The petition shall be on forms prescribed by the Judicial Council
or by the City Attorney's office for compliance with this chapter.
   (C)   Administrative hearing.  There is hereby created an administrative
procedure for the hearing of petitions filed with the City Manager. Hearings
for classification as "potentially dangerous" or "vicious" shall be conducted
as follows:
      (1)   The owner shall be given, by first class mail with return receipt
requested, or personal service, notice of a hearing, a copy of the petition,
and notice of the restrictions that will apply to the animal if it is
classified as a potentially dangerous or vicious animal. A failure of the owner
to receive notice by first class mail with return receipt requested shall not
affect the validity of these proceedings.
      (2)   The owner may waive his or her right to a hearing by filing a
written waiver with the city, whereupon an animal regulations officer or
designee shall make the findings and apply the sanctions provided in this
chapter.
      (3)   If the animal has not been impounded, the hearing shall be set not
less than five business days nor more than 30 days after the notice was mailed
to the owner by first class mail with return receipt requested or the owner was
personally served. If the animal has been impounded, the hearing shall be set
not less than five days after the notice was mailed to the owner by first class
mail with return receipt requested or the owner was personally served, and
within 15 days of the date of impoundment. The owner of the animal may agree to
an earlier or later hearing date.
      (4)   If the owner fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing shall
nevertheless proceed, and an appropriate order shall be issued.
      (5)   The hearing shall be conducted before a hearing officer appointed
pursuant to the Administrative Hearings chapter of the city.
      (6)   The hearing shall be conducted informally and the technical rules
of evidence shall not apply. The hearing officer shall consider all relevant
evidence presented at the hearing. The officer filing the petition shall be
present at the hearing and shall present evidence that the animal is
potentially dangerous or vicious by witness testimony or affidavits, incident
reports, and other records.
      (7)   The hearing officer may continue hearings, based on good cause, as
established by one of the parties to the hearing.
      (8)   After the hearing, the owner or keeper of the dog shall be notified
in writing of the determination and orders issued, either personally or by
first class mail with return receipt requested. The hearing officer shall make
a written determination within 15 days after the hearing is concluded, unless
the animal has been impounded, in which case the determination shall be made in
five business days. The decision of the hearing officer shall be final. A
failure of the owner to receive notice by first class mail with return receipt
requested shall not affect the validity of these proceedings.
      (9)   If the owner or keeper of the animal contests the determination, he
or she may, within five days of the service of the notice of determination if
service is by personal service, or within six days of service of the notice of
determination if service is by mail, appeal the decision of the hearing officer
to the Superior Court - Selma Division, or other court having jurisdiction. The
owner or keeper of the animal shall serve personally or by first class mail
with return receipt requested notice of the appeal to the city. Any such appeal
shall be a trial de novo.

threat to public health and safety at the new location.
         (b)   The owner of the vicious animal shall be prohibited from owning,
possessing or controlling other animals of the same species for a period of
three years after the original determination that the animal is vicious.

and vaccinated in the jurisdiction where the animal is to be taken.
         (f)   If the animal is not euthanized, the owner shall spay or neuter
the animal, at the owner's expense, within ten days after the vicious animal
determination. The owner shall provide a deposit in the amount of $500 to
ensure the spay or neuter of the animal which deposit shall be forfeited if the
owner does not provide proof of the spay or neuter within the ten day time
period. In addition, the failure to have the animal spayed or neutered shall be
considered a violation of this section.
         (g)   The owner of the animal shall be liable for all redemption fees
incurred pursuant to §
92.12 of this chapter. Those fees shall be paid within six days of the decision
of a hearing officer or court, and before the animal is released from the

securely inside the owner's or custodian's dwelling, in an enclosure on the
owner's or custodian's premises, or under other adequate control as approved by
an animal regulations officer. If an approved means of restraint is impossible
or impracticable, such animal shall be impounded in the Animal Shelter at the
owner's expense, until such time as the owner of such animal shall provide for
an approved means of restraint. If the owner of the animal does not provide an
approved means of restraint within six days of the decision of the hearing
officer or court, the animal shall be deemed abandoned.
         (b)   The owner of a potentially dangerous animal shall conspicuously
display signs with a symbol warning of the presence of a potentially dangerous
animal.
         (c)   While off the owner's premises, a potentially dangerous animal

court, the animal shall be deemed abandoned.
   (E)   Failure to meet requirements.
      (1)   Inspection.  If all requirements for owners of potentially
dangerous or vicious animals are not satisfied, or the owner is unable or
unwilling to implement them, the animal shall be euthanized either by the
Animal Shelter or by a licensed veterinarian. Proof of euthanasia shall be
provided to an animal regulations officer within three days of its occurrence.
      (2)   An animal regulations officer is authorized to make whatever
inspections he or she deems necessary to ensure compliance with these

dog, shall be considered a misdemeanor. As an alternative to filing a petition
to have an animal declared vicious pursuant to this chapter, if an animal
regulations officer has investigated and determined that there is probable
cause to believe that an animal is vicious, the animal regulations officer may
issue a misdemeanor criminal citation or may submit the case to the City
Attorney for filing of a criminal complaint. Upon conviction for a violation of
this section, the Court may order the destruction of the animal or any
conditions to insure that the animal is confined to an enclosure and such other
measures to keep the animal under physical control. The animal may be seized
and impounded pending final disposition by the Court.
      (2)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the right of any person or
officer to take any proceedings against a potentially dangerous or vicious
animal or the owner thereof otherwise permitted or provided by federal, state
or local law, including the Municipal Code.
   (H)   Penalties for violation.  Violations of this chapter or any orders
from a Court, a hearing officer, or an animal regulations officer pursuant to
this chapter shall be deemed misdemeanors. Such violations shall also carry
civil penalties up to $1,000.
(Ord. 14-101, passed 7-8-2014)
§ 92.15  EXCESSIVE ANIMAL NOISE.
   (A)   Prohibition on harboring animals which make excessive noise.  No
person shall keep, maintain or harbor, or cause or permit to be kept,
maintained, or harbored, upon any premises within the city, any dog or animal
which creates excessive noise. A violation of this section is a misdemeanor
unless the City Attorney files the action as an infraction.
   (B)   Enforcement action.  If an animal regulations officer determines upon
investigation that there is probable cause to believe that the owner of the
animal is maintaining an animal which creates excessive noise, the officer may
take the following actions:
      (1)   First offenses. For first time offenses, the officer should issue a
warning to the owner of the animal notifying the owner of the excessive noise
complaint(s) and inform the owner of steps necessary to correct the problem and
the consequences if the owner fails to take corrective steps.
      (2)   Second offenses. For second offenses, the officer should issue a
first offense administrative citation or submit the matter to the City Attorney
for enforcement.
      (3)   Third and subsequent offenses. For third and subsequent offenses,
the officer should issue the next level administrative citation or submit the
matter to the City Attorney for enforcement.
      (4)   Seizure and impoundment. The investigating officer may seize and
impound an animal which is creating excessive noise. The owner of such animal
shall be responsible for the costs of impoundment as provided for in §
92.14 of this chapter.
   (C)   Removal of animal from city.  Upon a third sustained offense within an
18 month period, the animal making the excessive noise shall be deemed a public
nuisance requiring the owner to permanently remove the animal from the city. A
failure to remove the animal shall be a misdemeanor.
(Ord. 14-101, passed 7-8-2014)e
§ 92.16  ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Administration and authority. The City Manager is authorized to

without a warrant for the following purposes:
         (a)   When the officer has the express permission of the owner or
occupant of the premises;
         (b)   When the officer has probable cause to believe that any rabid,
injured, sick, abandoned, mistreated or neglected animal is present;
         (c)   When in pursuit of any animal at large in the city;
         (d)   To seize and impound a potentially dangerous or vicious animal
in accordance with this chapter;
         (e)   When the officer has probable cause to believe that there exists
in any building or upon any premises or property any condition which may be in
violation of this chapter;
         (f)   When the officer observes a violation of this chapter occurring
upon any building or upon any premises or property, or when entry on the
building, premises or property is necessary to prevent a continuing violation
of this chapter;
         (g)   When the officer is aiding with the execution of a search and/or
seizure warrant;
         (h)   Upon exigent circumstances or for any other lawful reason.
      (2)   Before entering private property without the consent of the
occupant, the officer shall make reasonable attempts to contact the occupant of
the property, if possible.
      (3)   If none of the circumstances exists for entry on private property
without a warrant, the officer shall obtain a warrant before entering private
property.
      (4)   In no event shall entry on private property be more extensive than
that necessary to seize the animal or to prevent further violations of this
chapter or other animal regulation laws.
      (5)   Neither the animal regulations officer nor the city shall be liable
for any damages from a reasonable entry.
      (6)   Nothing in this section shall prevent an animal regulations officer
from entering private property during the performance of the officer's duties

misdemeanor for any person to willfully resist, delay or obstruct any animal
regulations officer in the discharge or attempt to discharge any duty of his or
her office.
   (D)   Applicability of state laws.  Conflicts in the Municipal Code.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of
the Cal. Food and Agricultural Code, Cal. Health and Safety Code, Cal. Penal
Code, and Code of Regulations relating to animal health, control and care, and
rabies control, shall apply when such provisions are more stringent than the
provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   If a section elsewhere in the Municipal Code is in conflict with a
provision of this chapter, the more stringent provision shall apply.
   (E)   Use of equipment to impound and firearms authorized.  In performance
of his or her duties, an animal regulations officer shall have the authority to
employ the use of a tranquilizer gun and any animal-control equipment or device

within a 48 hour period, the owner of the animal shall be liable for the cost
to provide special services to respond to the animal at large, menacing dog or
excessive noise. Charges shall include a reasonable charge for the officer's
time, the actual cost of any equipment used or damaged, together with an
additional 10% for administrative overhead. These charges shall be computed and
a bill submitted to the owner of the animal. The bill shall be a debt owed to
the city and a failure to pay that bill within 30 days is a violation of the
Municipal Code. If the city is obligated to initiate litigation to recover this
debt, the owner shall be liable for cost of suit, attorneys' fees, and cost of
collection.
   (I)   Violations: penalties.
      (1)   Violations of this chapter shall be misdemeanors unless a
particular section designates that a violation is an infraction. The City
Attorney may file any violation of this chapter deemed a misdemeanor as an
infraction. Each and every day a violation exists is a separate offense.
      (2)   The city may also pursue any other remedy, including issuing
administrative citations and obtaining injunctions and abatement orders.

insufficiency to the appellant, stating with particularity the defects or
omissions therein. Failure of the appellant to file an amended appeal within
seven calendar days of the date of service of such notice of insufficiency

notice of any insufficiency within seven calendar days shall result in the
appeal being heard on its merits, without regard to any insufficiency.
      (5)   Notice of hearing.  Upon receipt of an appeal, or if notice of
insufficiency is given in accordance with this section, upon receipt of an
amended appeal within the time specified, the City Clerk shall cause on copy to

to be a public nuisance.
   (B)   Cultivated and useful grasses and pastures are not a public nuisance
as determined by the City Manager and/or his or her designated representative

an adequate fire break may be required.
(1994 Code, § 8.34.020)
   (C)   Waste matter, as defined in §

(Ord. 08-106, passed 10-8-2008)
§ 97.02  FINDINGS.
   (A)   The City Council of the City of San Joaquin finds and determines as
follows:
      (1)   Property values and the general welfare of the community are
founded, in part, upon the appearance and maintenance of private properties;
      (2)   There is a need for further emphasis on property maintenance and
sanitation in that certain conditions, as described in this chapter, have been
found from place to place throughout the city;
      (3)   That the existence of such conditions as described in this chapter,
is injurious and inimical to the public health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the city and contributes substantially and increasingly to the
deterioration of the community;
      (4)   That unless correct measures are undertaken to alleviate such
existing conditions, and assure the avoidance of future problems in this
regard, the public health, safety and general welfare and specifically the
social and economic standards of the community will be depreciated;
      (5)   That the abatement of such conditions will improve the general
welfare and image of the city; and
      (6)   That the abatement procedures set forth in this chapter are
reasonable and afford due process to all affected persons.
   (B)   The purposes of this chapter are to safeguard, remedy and prevent the
decay and deterioration of our community by elimination of public nuisances. 
The procedures established in this chapter are cumulative and in addition to
any other remedy established by law.
(Ord. 08-106, passed 10-8-2008)
§ 97.03  PROCEEDINGS FOR ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Authority.  The City Manager or his or her designee shall have
principal responsibility for enforcing this chapter and shall be referenced as
Enforcement Officer. Any provision of this chapter which refers to the City
Manager shall be interpreted to include a reference to a designee of the City
Manager. Additionally, this chapter may be enforced by Code Enforcement
Officers as authorized by city law.
   (B)   Right of entry; consent; warrant. Whenever necessary to make an
inspection to enforce any provision of this chapter, or whenever the City
Manager has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or
upon any premises, any condition which makes the building or premises a public
nuisance as defined in this chapter, the City Manager may enter the building or
premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty
imposed upon the City Manager by this chapter, including the abatement of any
public nuisance, provided all inspections, entries, and abatements shall be
done in a reasonable manner and with the consent of the owner, agent, or
occupant. If an owner, occupant or agent refuses permission to enter, or
inspect, or abate, the City Manager may seek an administrative warrant pursuant
to the procedures provided for in Cal. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1822.50
through 1822.59, as amended, to perform the duties imposed upon the City
Manager.
   (C)   Responsibilities defined.  Owners remain liable for violations of
duties imposed by this chapter even though an obligation is also imposed on the
occupants of the building. Buildings, structures, premises and parts thereof
shall be responsible for such maintenance. To determine compliance with this
section, the building or premises may be re-inspected.

Act of 1989 (Cal. Public Resources Code §§ 40000 et seq.), the city is required
to prepare, adopt and implement source reduction and recycling plans to reach
landfill diversion goals, and is required to make substantial reductions in the
volume of waste materials going to the landfills, or face fines up to $10,000
per day.
   (B)   In order to meet these goals it is necessary that the city promote the
reduction of solid waste, and reduce the stream of solid waste going to
landfills.
   (C)   Waste from construction, demolition, and renovation of buildings
represents a significant portion of the volume of waste presently coming from
the City San Joaquin and much of this waste is particularly suitable for
recycling and reuse.

other measurements approved by the city that can be converted to tonnage
amounts. The WMP Compliance Official will evaluate and may monitor each covered
project to determine the percentage of waste salvaged and recycled or reused
from the covered project. For covered projects including both construction and
demolition, diversion of materials shall be tracked and measured separately. To
the maximum extent feasible, project waste shall be separated on-site if this
practice increases diversion. For construction and/or demolition projects, on-
site separation shall include salvageable materials (e.g., appliances,
fixtures, plumbing, metals, etc.) and dimensional lumber, wallboard, concrete
and corrugated cardboard.
(Ord. 13-103, passed 6-5-2013)

construction phase of a covered project, the applicant shall, as a condition
precedent to final inspection and to issuance of any certificate of occupancy
or final approval of project, submit documentation to the Building Official
that proves compliance with the requirements of the city. The documentation
shall show actual waste tonnage date, supported by original or certified
photocopies of receipts and weight tags or other records of measurement from
recycling companies, deconstruction contractors, and/or landfill and disposal
companies. Receipts and weight tags will be used to verify whether waste
generated from the covered project has been or is to be recycled, reused,
salvaged or disposed. The applicant shall make reasonable efforts to ensure
that all designated recyclable and reuse waste salvaged or disposed are
measured and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available.
   (B)   To the extent practical, all construction and demolition waste shall
be weighed in compliance with all regulatory requirements for accuracy and
maintenance. For construction and demolition waste for which weighing is not
practical due to small size or other consideration, a volumetric measurement
shall be used. For conversion of volumetric measurements to weight, the
applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the city for
this purpose.
   (C)   If covered project involves both demolition and construction, the
report and documentation for the demolition project must be submitted and
approved by the Building Official before issuance of a building permit for the
construction phase of a covered project. Alternatively, the applicant may
submit a letter stating that no waste or recyclable materials were generated
from the covered project, in which case this statement shall be subject to
verification by the Building Official. Any deposit posted shall be forfeited if
the applicant does not meet the timely reporting requirements of this section.
(Ord. 13-103, passed 6-5-2013)
§ 99.14  SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause, or
phrase of this chapter or any part thereof, is for any reason held to be
unconstitutional, invalid, or ineffective by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of
the remaining portions of this chapter or any part thereof. The City Council
hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection,
subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter irrespective
of the fact that one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs,
sentences, clauses or phrases be declared unconstitutional, invalid, or
ineffective.

§ 100.01  FINDINGS.
   (A)   In 1996, with the adoption of Proposition 215, the California voters
approved the Compassionate Use Act (Cal. Health and Safety Code § 11362.5) to
ensure that seriously ill Californians have the right to obtain and use
marijuana for medical purposes where that medical use is deemed appropriate and
has been recommended by a physician, without fear of criminal prosecution under
limited, specified circumstances.
   (B)   In 2004, the State Legislature enacted SB 420 to clarify the scope of
the Compassionate Use Act and provide additional statutory guidance regarding
medical marijuana use.  These statutes are codified at Cal. Health and Safety
Code §§ 11362.7 et seq., and allow cities and counties to adopt supplemental
rules and regulations.
   (C)   On October 9, 2015, almost 20 years after passage of the Compassionate
Use Act, the Governorn signed the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act
(“Act”), comprised of California legislative bills AB 243, AB 266, and SB 643. 
The Act creates a comprehensive state licensing system for the commercial
cultivation, manufacture, retail sale, transport, distribution, delivery, and
testing of medical cannabis, all subject to local control. One of the purposes
of the Act is to ensure uniformity among jurisdictions that wished to allow
commercial marijuana operations.
   (D)   Pending before the votes on November 8, 2016, is the Control,
Regulate, and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“AUMA”).  The purpose of AUMA is
to establish a comprehensive system to legalize, control and regulate the
cultivation, processing, manufacture, distribution, testing, and sale of
nonmedical marijuana, including marijuana products. Adults, age 21 and older,
will be allowed to possess marijuana and grow certain amounts at home for
personal use.
   (E)   On February 9, 2016, the City Council and Planning Commission adopted
Resolution Nos. 2016-11 and 2016-01, respectively, “Reaffirming, and Confirming
that the City Zoning Regulations in Title IV, Chapter 154 of the San Joaquin
Municipal Code Constitute a Permissive Zoning Code such that Marijuana
Cultivation Uses and Uses that are not Specifically Enumerated in the Zoning
Regulations on the Municipal Code are Prohibited.”
   (F)   Under MMRSA, and AUMA if it passes, the City retains its police powers
and land use authority to regulate or ban marijuana activities, including
commercial marijuana operations, cultivation, distribution and consumption for
the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of San Joaquin.
(Ord. 2016-105, passed 12-6-2016)

§ 150.001  ADOPTION BY REFERENCE.
   The following primary codes are adopted by reference:
   (A)   The 2019 National Electrical Code of the National Fire Protection
Association;
   (B)   The 2019 Uniform Building Code of the International Conference of
Building Officials, with current volumes and appendices, excepting that the
Uniform Building Code's regulations as to building permits for fences less than
six feet in height shall not be controlling;
   (C)   The 2019 Uniform Fire Code, Volumes 1 and 2, including Appendix
Chapters 1-C, II-A, II-B, II-F, III-A, III-B, IV-B, VI-C, VI-D and VI-E;
   (D)   The 2019 Uniform Plumbing Code of the International Association of

Officials, including Appendix Chapters A through D;
   (F)   The 2019 Uniform Administrative Code;
   (G)   The 1994 Uniform Housing Code of the International Conference of
Building Officials, except its definition of "substandard building";
   (H)   The 1997 Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings;
   (I)   The 2019 Dwelling construction under the Uniform Building Code;
   (J)   The 1997 Uniform Sign Code, providing that if any provision thereof
conflicts with City Municipal Code, the City Municipal Code shall be
controlling;
   (K)   The 1997 Uniform Zoning Code providing that if any provision thereof
conflicts with City Municipal Code, the City Municipal Code shall be
controlling; and
   (L)   The City Council finds that local climatic and topographic conditions
in the city require protection of public health, safety and welfare in addition
to that provided by the Uniform Building Code adopted in division (B) of this
section. Therefore,
Chapter 151 of this code, and not the applicable sections of the Uniform
Building Code, will govern the construction of fences with the city.

§ 150.002  CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES ON EXPANSIVE SOILS.
   (A)   (1)   Within the city there are native soils which expand when wet and
thereby destabilize any structure built upon these soils.
      (2)   The existence of the expansive soils is local geologic condition
which requires the protection of the public health, safety and welfare in
addition to those protections provided by the Uniform Building Code.
   (B)   Therefore, notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of the Uniform
Building Code as it may from time to time be amended, no person shall build or
commence the construction of any structure requiring a slab or continuous
perimeter foundation until the person has either:
      (1)   Removed the native soil and installed a properly compacted non-
expansive soil to a depth of at least three feet below the lowest extension of
the foundation or slab. Soil removal and replacement hall extend at least five
feet beyond the perimeter foundation line; or
      (2)   Provided to the City Building Official the written report of a
qualified soils engineer stating that the native soils at the site of the
proposed construction are non-expansive and are properly compacted and suitable
for construction of the proposed structure according to the approved plans for
the structure.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001  PURPOSE.
   In order to promote public health, safety and general welfare; orderly
growth and development of the city; proper use of land; conservation,
stabilization and protection of the use value of property; and adequate
provisions for necessary utilities and convenience, the City Council has
adopted the provisions of this subchapter.
(1994 Code, § 16.04.010)  (Ord. 78-101, passed - -1978)
§ 153.002  PLANNING COMMISSION; DUTIES.
   Pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act of the state,  as it now exists or may
hereafter be amended, the provisions of this chapter are supplemental to those
of the Act, and shall apply to all subdivisions of land hereafter made when the
land is entirely, or partially, within the limits of the city. The Planning
Commission is designated as the advisory agency referred to in the Act, and is
charged with the duty of making investigations and reports on the design and
improvement of proposed subdivisions, recommending the kinds, nature and extent
of the improvement required to be installed in subdivisions, and recommending
to the City Council the action that should be taken on tentative maps. The
Planning Commission is authorized to approve, conditionally approve or
disapprove parcel maps.
(1994 Code, § 16.04.020)  (Ord. 78-101, passed - -1978)
§ 153.003  DEFINITIONS.
   Whenever any words or phrases as used in this chapter are not defined herein
but are defined in the Subdivision Map Act as last amended, the definitions are
incorporated herein and shall be deemed to apply as though set forth in this
subchapter.
(1994 Code, § 16.04.030)  (Ord. 78-101, passed - -1978)
§ 153.004  CONFORMITY WITH GENERAL PLAN.
   (A)   A subdivision shall, at all times, conform to the general plan of the
city and any specific plan of streets and highways. In the absence of a general
plan or specific plan, the street design in the proposed subdivision shall
relate to the existing streets in the area adjoining the subdivision, but all
existing streets adjacent thereto need not necessarily be carried into the
subdivision.
   (B)   Any report as to conformity to the general plan, which is required
pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code § 65402 as the result of a proposed division of
land, may be included as part of and at the same time as the action taken by
the advisory agency on the division of land.
(1994 Code, § 16.04.040)  (Ord. 78-101, passed - -1978)
§ 153.005  FILING OF MAPS; FEES.
   Fees in regard to the filing of tentative and final maps shall be paid to
the city as set forth by resolution of the City Council.
(1994 Code, § 16.04.050)  (Ord. 78-101, passed - -1978)
§ 153.006  PARK AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES.
   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Cal. Gov't Code
§ 66477. The park and recreational facilities for which dedication of land and/
or payment of a fee is required by this chapter are in accordance with the
recreation element of the general plan of the city, adopted by the city on 9-
17-1973. As a condition of approval of a final map or parcel map, the
subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at the
option of the city, for park or recreational purposes at the time and according
to the standards and formula contained in this chapter as follows.
   (A)   The subdivider shall dedicate to the city land equal to .018 acres
times the number of dwelling units to be constructed in the subdivision and, in
addition thereto, pay to the city the sum of $100 for each dwelling unit to be
constructed in the subdivision. This option shall not apply to subdivisions
containing 50 parcels or less without the consent of the subdivider.
   (B)   The subdivider shall pay to the city the sum of $200 for each dwelling
unit to be constructed in the subdivision.
   (C)   All land dedicated hereunder and all fees paid hereunder shall be used
for the purpose of providing park or recreational facilities to serve the
subdivision in carrying out the recreation element of the general plan of the
city.
   (D)   For the purpose of computing the amount of land to be dedicated or the
amount of fees to be paid hereunder, the subdivider shall file a verified
written report with the city stating the type of dwelling units to be
constructed in the subdivision and the number of dwelling units to be
constructed on each parcel in the subdivision. Where property in the
subdivision is zoned R-1, it shall be conclusively presumed that there will be
one dwelling unit constructed on each R-1 parcel. In other cases, the Planning
Commission may accept the verified written report of the subdivider as
conclusive or in the alternative consider the same together with published
standards in general use in making a determination.
   (E)   Subdivisions containing less than five parcels shall be exempt from
the provisions of this division.
(1994 Code, § 16.04.060)  (Ord. 78-101, passed - -1978)
Editor's note:
   This section is currently undergoing review and revision by the city
§ 153.007  SOIL REPORT.
   A preliminary soils report prepared by a civil engineer registered in the
state and based upon adequate test borings shall be submitted to the City
Engineer for every subdivision for which a tentative and final map is required.
However, the preliminary soils report may be waived by the City Engineer,
provided, the City Engineer finds that due to the knowledge the city has as to
the soils qualities of the soils in the subdivision, no preliminary analysis is
necessary. If the city has knowledge of, or the preliminary soils report
indicates, the presence of critically expansive soils or other soils problems
which, if not corrected, would lead to structural defects, a soils
investigation of each lot in the subdivision may be required by the City
Engineer. The soils investigation shall be done by a civil engineer registered
in the state, who shall recommend the corrective action which is likely to
prevent structural damage to each structure proposed to be constructed in the
area where the soils problem exists. The Planning Commission may approve the
subdivision or portion thereof where the soils problem exists, if it determines
that the recommended action is likely to prevent structural damage to each
structure to be constructed and a condition to the issuance of any building
permit may require that the approved recommended action be incorporated in the
construction of each structure.
(1994 Code, § 16.04.070)  (Ord. 78-101, passed - -1978)
§ 153.008  SURVEY MONUMENTS.
   In addition to any other requirement of this chapter relating thereto, at
the time of making the survey for the final map, the engineer or surveyor shall
set sufficient durable monuments to conform with the standards described in
Cal. Business and Professions Code § 8771 so that another engineer or surveyor
may readily retrace the survey. At least one exterior boundary line of the land
being subdivided must be adequately monumented or referenced before the final
map is recorded, as required by Subdivision Map Act § 66495.
(1994 Code, § 16.04.080)  (Ord. 78-101, passed - -1978)
§ 153.009  ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE.
   No tentative map or tentative parcel map filed pursuant to the provisions of
this subchapter shall be approved until an environmental impact analysis is
prepared, processed and considered in accordance with the provisions of §§
154.180 through 154.189. The subdivider shall provide the additional data and
information and deposit and pay the fees as may be required for the preparation
and processing of environmental review documents.
(1994 Code, § 16.04.090)  (Ord. 78-101, passed - -1978)
§ 153.010  VIOLATIONS.
   It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to violate any of the
provisions of this subchapter, and each person, firm or corporation shall be
deemed guilty of a separate offense every day during any portion of which any
violation of any provision of this subchapter is committed, continued or
permitted by such person, firm or corporation. Any lot, street, alley or other
feature made the subject of this subchapter maintained contrary to the
provisions hereof shall constitute a public nuisance.

with the office of the City Engineer. The City Engineer shall return one copy
thereof to the subdivider showing corrections, if any, or a statement that the
map is correct. When the final map is found by the City Engineer to conform to
the tentative map approval and be otherwise correct, he or she shall certify
the final map tracing and return the same to the subdivider or his or her
agent.
   (B)   The final map, as certified by the City Engineer and containing all
other required certifications properly executed and acknowledged thereon may
then be filed with the City Council for its approval.
   (C)   Not later than ten days following the filing of the final map or not
later than the regular meeting of the City Council following the meeting at
which the final map is first presented, whichever is later, the City Council
shall act to approve or disapprove the final map. Failure of the City Council
to act on the map within the prescribed time or any authorized extension
thereof, shall be deemed approval of the map; provided that, the same conforms
to all requirements of law and the rulings made thereunder. At the time as the
final map has been approved and all conditions of the approval have been
fulfilled, the City Clerk shall certify the approval of the City Council
thereto.
   (D)   A final map shall be disapproved only for failure to meet or perform
requirements or conditions which were applicable to the subdivision at the time
of approval of the tentative map; and provided further, that disapproval shall
be accompanied by a finding identifying the requirements or conditions which
have not been met or performed. When the failure of the map to meet the
requirements or conditions imposed by this chapter is the result of technical
and inadvertent error which does not materially affect the validity of the map,
the map shall be conditionally approved, subject to correction of the minor
errors.
   (E)   All streets, highways and parcels of land shown on the final map and
intended for any public use shall be offered for dedication for public use. All
offers for dedication are to be irrevocable and in perpetuity. Streets or
portions of streets may be offered for future dedications where the immediate
opening and improvement is not required, but where it is necessary to insure
that the city can later accept dedication when the streets are needed for the
further development of the area on adjacent areas. The subdivider shall also
offer in writing to dedicate all public utilities within the subdivision or any
off-site improvements required to complete the same. All the offers for
dedication are to be irrevocable and in perpetuity. The subdivider shall
furnish the city with a proper deed granting to the city all easements as shown
on the final map. The deed shall be furnished before any final map is approved
by the city. Likewise, before any final map is approved by the city, the
subdivider shall improve or agree to improve all lands dedicated for streets,
highways, public ways and easements in the following particulars together with
the other improvements in the subdivision hereinafter specified:
      (1)   Adequate distribution lines for domestic water supply to each lot;
      (2)   Sewage collecting system where main lines of an adequate disposal
system are available;
      (3)   Adequate drainage of the subdivision streets, highways, ways and
alleys; and if any portion of the land is subject to sheet overflow, or ponding
by local storm water or should the ground table be less than ten feet below the
surface, the elimination of the conditions or in the alternative the execution
of a comprehensive agreement covering the construction of buildings and
structures which will overcome the hazards thereof;
      (4)   Adequate grading and surfacing of streets, highways, ways and
alleys;
      (5)   Curbs, gutters and sidewalks;
      (6)   Fire hydrants; and
      (7)   Street lights and mailboxes unless the same shall have been
exempted by the Planning Commission or the City Council.
   (F)   Unless improvements have been made prior to the acceptance of the
final map, the subdivider shall be required as a condition of the final map
approval to enter into a written agreement with the city in regard thereto as
specified in § 66462 of the Subdivision Map Act. To assure the city that the
work will be completed and the improvements made and lien holders paid, an
improvement security shall be furnished by the subdivider guaranteeing faithful
performance and guaranteeing payment for labor and materials in the manner and
amounts specified in §§ 66499 through and including 66499.10 of the Subdivision
Map Act. The form and amount of the improvement security shall be approved in
writing by the City Attorney.
   (G)   In the event the subdivider is required to install improvements for
the benefit of the subdivision which may contain supplemental size, capacity or
number for the benefit of property not within the subdivision as a condition
precedent to the approval of a subdivision or parcel map, or to install off-
site improvements for the benefit of the subdivision and thereafter to dedicate
the improvements to the public, the subdivider may be reimbursed for that
portion of the cost of the improvements equal to the difference between the
amount it would have cost the subdivider to install the improvements to serve
the subdivision only and the actual cost of the improvements in the manner and
amount as appears lawful and reasonable to the City Council.

The Secretary of the Planning Commission shall give notice by mail of the time
and date of the hearing to the person filing the map at least five days prior
to the hearing, and shall also publish notice for the time and in the manner
required by § 66451.3 of the Subdivision Map Act. At least ten days prior to
the hearing copies of the map shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the
Planning Commission to the City Engineer. It is the duty of the official to
render a written report to the Planning Commission relative thereto, or in the
alternative appear in person at the hearing thereon and report to the Planning
Commission. Failure to file the report or appear at the hearing shall be deemed
approval of the map by the official affected thereby.
   (C)   Failure of the proposed subdivision of land to conform to the
requirements and provisions of this chapter, may be grounds for disapproval of
the map by the Planning Commission.
   (D)   As a condition to the approval of the map the Planning Commission may
require the owner to enter into a written agreement with the city calling for
the installation of all proposed or contemplated streets, alleys, sewer lines,
water lines, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, fire hydrants or drainage facilities
necessary to serve the subject property, and to furnish an improvement security
as specified in division (F) of §
153.041.
   (E)   Before the Planning Commission shall approve any map all proposed
streets and parcels of land intended for any public use shall be offered for
dedication to the city. Intended easements shall be deeded to the city.
   (F)   At the hearing on the tentative parcel map, the Planning Commission
shall act thereon. The hearing may be adjourned for any period reasonably
necessary to allow the Planning Commission sufficient time in which to make a
proper study and determination of the matter in no event to exceed a period of
30 days. The decision of the Planning Commission respecting the map shall be
adopted by a resolution of that body, which resolution shall specify the
conditions of the approval, if any. A copy of the resolution together with a
copy of a final parcel map shall be forthwith transmitted by the Secretary of
the Planning Commission to the City Clerk for recording. The final parcel map
shall contain the information specified in and conform to the requirements of §
153.040. Before recording the final parcel map, the City Clerk shall issue and
affix a parcel map number thereto. If dedications appear on the parcel map its
approval and recording shall require a resolution of the City Council accepting
the same.

(Ord. 78-104, passed - -1978)
§ 153.098  RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL; RESTRICTIONS; REQUIREMENT OF FEES
AND/OR DEDICATION.
   (A)   Within the school district where it has been determined pursuant to §
153.097 that conditions of overcrowding exist, neither the City Council nor the
Planning Commission shall approve an ordinance rezoning property to a
residential use or to a more intense residential use, grant a discretionary
permit for residential use or approve a tentative subdivision map or tentative
parcel map for residential purposes, unless the decision-making body makes one
of the following findings:
      (1)   Action will be taken pursuant to this subchapter to provide
dedications of land and/or fees to mitigate the conditions of overcrowding
within that attendance area; or
      (2)   There are specific overriding fiscal, economic, social or
environmental factors which in the judgment of the decision-making body would
benefit the city, thereby justifying the approval of a residential development
otherwise subject to the provisions of this subchapter for dedications of land
or fees.
(1994 Code, § 16.24.110)
   (B)   For the purpose of establishing an interim method of providing
classroom facilities where overcrowding conditions exist, as determined
pursuant to §

development, the dedication of land, the payment of fees in lieu thereof, or a
combination of both, as determined by the City Council or the Planning
Commission during the hearings and proceedings for specific residential
development projects falling within their respective jurisdictions. Prior to
imposition of the fees or dedications of land, it shall be necessary for the
decision-making body acting on the application to make the following findings:
      (1)   The city general plan provides for the location of public schools;
      (2)   The land or fees, or both, transferred to a school district shall
be used only for the purpose of providing interim classroom and related
facilities;
      (3)   The location and amount of land to be dedicated or the amount of
fees to be paid, or both, shall bear a reasonable relationship and will be
limited to the needs of the community for interim facilities and shall be
reasonably related and limited to the need for schools caused by the
development;

§ 154.002  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the growth of the city in an
orderly manner that is consistent with the San Joaquin General Plan and to
preserve and promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the city. More
specifically, this Zoning Ordinance is adopted to achieve the following
objectives:
   (A)   Provide precise standards and guidelines for the orderly growth and
development of the city, consistent with the goals and policies of the General
Plan;
   (B)   Ensure compatibility between residential and nonresidential
development and land uses;
   (C)   Promote a well-designed city through the regulation of signing,
landscaping, and site planning;
   (D)   Ensure a safe, effective transportation system, including parking and
loading areas;
   (E)   Promote and protect residential, commercial, and industrial

Joaquin, including all uses, structures, and land owned by any person, firm,
corporation, or organization. Any governmental agency shall be exempt from the
provisions of this chapter only to the extent that such property may not be
lawfully regulated by the city. City government uses, including, without
limitation, fire stations, police stations, and public safety facilities, may
be permitted in any district subject to the approval of a conditional use
permit.

occupied, enlarged, altered, demolished, or moved in any zoning district,
except in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. Specific

enlarge the scope of permitted uses; they are for purposes of clarity only. A

type or similar to the listed use type per the applicable zoning district or
determined to be such through the determination of the City Manager or
designee, in order to be authorized under the Zoning Ordinance.

other provisions of this code, or other plans and policies adopted by the city,
the Zoning Ordinance shall prevail; excepting the San Joaquin General Plan,
which prevails over this chapter.

strict application of certain provisions thereof, a variance may be granted as

relief from the strict application of this chapter where such application will
deprive the property owner of privileges or usage enjoyed by similar properties
because of the subject property's unique and special conditions.

are met in reference to the property being considered:
         (a)   There are exceptional or special circumstances applicable to the

surroundings, whereby strict application of the Zoning Ordinance deprives such
property of privileges enjoyed to other property in the vicinity having the
identical zoning district classification;

thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privileges
inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and

authorizes a use or activity which is not otherwise expressly authorized by the

Guidelines, the temporary use permit shall be processed as a conditional use
permit application.
   (B)   The City Manager shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny
applications for temporary use permits based on consideration of the

ensure compliance with the findings for a temporary use permit including, but
not limited to:

references, zoning district boundaries, and other information on the map
adopted by the Council, are hereby incorporated into this code by reference.
   (B)   Whenever uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of a district shown
on the zoning map, the following regulations shall apply:
      (1)   Where a boundary line is indicated as following a lot or property
line, it shall be construed as coinciding with the property ownership line.
      (2)   Where zone boundaries are indicated as a street, alley, railroad
right-of-way, canal or other watercourse, the centerline of such shall be
considered to be the boundary line.
      (3)   In the event of abandonment of any street, alley, or right-of-way,
the property shall immediately become classified in the same district as the
property adjoining the former street, alley, or right-of-way.

determine the boundary line in question.
   (C)   Before property is annexed to the city it shall be pre-zoned to a

(Ord. 2021-03, passed 12-7-2021)
§ 154.142  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ANTENNA.  A device or system of wires, poles, rods, dishes, or similar
devices used to transmit and/or receive radio or electromagnetic waves.
   ANTENNA ARRAY.  Two or more antennas having active elements extending in one
or more directions, and directional antennas mounted upon and rotated through a
vertical mast or tower interconnecting the beam and antenna support, all of
which elements are deemed to be part of the antenna.
   ANTENNA EQUIPMENT.  Equipment, switches, cabling, power sources, shelters,
or cabinets associated with an antenna, located at the same fixed location as
the antenna, and when collated on a structure, is mounted, or installed at the
same time as such antenna.
   APARTMENT.  A room or suite of two or more rooms in a multiple dwelling
occupied or suitable for occupancy as a residence for one family.
   APARTMENT HOUSE.  See DWELLING, MULTIPLE.
   APPLICANT.  Any person, firm, corporation, company, or other entity that
applies for a building, planning, cannabis, telecom, or other similar
development permit.
   ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRATION.  For telecom equipment, means concealment
techniques that completely screen all transmission equipment from public view
and integrate the transmission equipment with the underlying structure and
surrounding built environment such that, given the particular context, the
average, untrained observer does not recognize the existence of the wireless
facility or concealment technique.
   BASE STATION.  The same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001
(b)(1), which defines that term as a structure or equipment at a fixed location
that enables FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communications between user
equipment and a communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as
defined in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(9) or any equipment associated with a
tower. The term includes, but is not limited to, equipment associated with
wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and public safety
services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services
such as microwave backhaul. The term includes, but is not limited to, radio
transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, regular and backup power
supplies, and comparable equipment, regardless of technological configuration
(including distributed antenna systems and small-cell networks). The term
includes any structure other than a tower that, at the time the relevant
application is filed with the state or local government under this section,
supports or houses equipment described in 47 C.F.R. sections 1.40001(b)(l)(i)
and (ii) that has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning
district or siting process, or under another state or local regulatory review
process, even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of
providing such support.
   CABINET.  A wireless communication facility equipment enclosure that is used
exclusively to contain radio or other equipment necessary for the transmission
and/or reception of wireless communication signals. Cabinets can be located on
a rooftop, on pedestals on the ground, or underground depending on the location
of the wireless antennas.
   CAMOUFLAGE or CAMOUFLAGED FACILITY.  A telecom facility in which the
antenna, and sometimes the support equipment, are hidden from view, or
effectively disguised as may reasonably be determined by the Planning
Commission or other appropriate reviewing authority, in a false tree, monument,
cupola, or other concealing structure which either mimics, or which also serves
as, a natural or architectural feature. Concealing structures which are not
such a natural or architectural feature to the average observer do not qualify
within this definition.
   COLOCATION.  The same as defined by the Federal Communication Commission
("FCC") in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(2), which defines that term as "the
mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support
structure for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency
signals for communications purposes." As an illustration and not a limitation,
the FCC's definition effectively means "to add" new equipment to an existing
facility and does not necessarily refer to more than one wireless facility
installed at a single site.
   ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.  A facility for transmitting electricity,
and includes any structures, equipment or other facilities used for that
purpose.
   ELIGIBLE FACILITIES REQUEST or EFR.  The same as defined by the FCC in 47
C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(3), which defines that term as any request for
modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially
change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station, involving:
      (1)   Colocation of new transmission equipment;
      (2)   Removal of transmission equipment; or
      (3)   Replacement of transmission equipment.
   ELIGIBLE SUPPORT STRUCTURE.  The same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R.
Section 1.40001(b) (4), which defines that term as any tower or base station as
defined in this section; provided, that it is existing at the time the relevant
application is filed with the state or local government under this definition.
   EXISTING.  The same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)
(4), as may be amended, which provides that a constructed tower or base station
is existing for purposes of the FCC's section 6409 regulations if it has been
reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning ordinance or siting process,
or under another state or local regulatory review process; provided, that a
tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned
area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for purposes
of this definition.
   FCC.  The Federal Communications Commission or its successor agency.
   OPERATOR or TELECOM OPERATOR.  Any person, firm, corporation, company, or
other entity that directly or indirectly owns, leases, runs, manages, or
otherwise controls a telecom facility or facilities within the city.
   OVER THE AIR RECEPTION DEVICES (OTARD).  Any over-the-air reception device
subject to 47 C.F.R. section 1.4000 et seq., and which includes satellite
television dishes not greater than one meter in diameter.

section 332(c)(7)(C)(i), which defines the term as facilities that provide
personal wireless services.
   PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICES.  The same as defined in 47 U.S.C. section 332(c)
(7)(C)(i), which defines the term as commercial mobile services, unlicensed
wireless services, and common carrier wireless exchange access services.
   PSEUDO-NATURAL INTEGRATION.  Concealment techniques that completely screen
all transmission equipment from public view and integrate the transmission
equipment with the surrounding natural environment. Given that pseudo-natural
integration mimics natural features, these manmade concealment techniques are
more obvious to the average, untrained observer such that the observer may not
need special knowledge to recognize the existence of a pseudo-naturally
integrated telecom facility. Such concealment techniques include faux-trees and
other faux-plants or faux-geologic features (monoshrubs, monorocks and other
faux-natural features).
   RADIO FREQUENCY OR RF.  Radio frequency or electromagnetic waves generally
between 20 kHz and 300 GHz in the electromagnetic spectrum range. This is the
frequency range at which energy from an oscillating current can radiate off a
conductor into space as radio waves.
   REMOTE RADIO UNIT OR RRU.  The electronic devices that are used to amplify
radio signals so that there is increased performance (farther distance) of the
outgoing radio signal from the antenna. It is generally installed in cell
towers or monopoles and are controlled by a controller placed inside a closed
shelter on the ground nearby the wireless facility.
   SATELLITE DISH ANTENNA.  Any accessory structure capable of receiving, for
the sole benefit of the principal use, radio or television signals from a
transmitter or transmitter relay located in planetary orbit.
   SECTION 6409.  Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job
Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-96,126 Stat. 156, codified as 47 U.S.C.
section 1455(a).
   SIGNIFICANT GAP.  A gap in the service provider's own wireless telecom
facilities, as defined in federal case law interpretations of the Federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996.
   SITE.  In general terms means any plot or parcel of land or combination of
contiguous lots or parcels of land.
   SITE FOR TELECOM FACILITIES.  The same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R.
section 1.40001(b)(6), which provides that "for towers other than towers in the
public rights-of-way, the current boundaries of the leased or owned property
surrounding the tower and any access or utility easements currently related to
the site, and, for other eligible support structures, further restricted to
that area in proximity to the structure and to other transmission equipment
already deployed on the ground."
   SMALL CELL WIRELESS FACILITY or SCWF.  A small wireless facility as defined
by the FCC and that meets the requirements specified in §
154.147.
   STEALTH FACILITY.  Any telecom facility designed to blend into the
surrounding environment and is visually unobtrusive. Examples of stealth
facilities may include architecturally screened roof-mounted antennas, facade-
mounted antennas painted and treated as architectural elements to blend with
the existing building, or elements designed to appear as vegetation or trees.
   SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE.  The same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. section
1.40001(b)(7), which defines that term differently based on the particular
wireless facility type (tower or base station) and location (in or outside the
public ROW). For clarity, this definition organizes the FCC's criteria and
thresholds for a substantial change according to the wireless facility type and
location.
      (1)   For towers outside the public ROW, a substantial change occurs
when:
         (a)   The proposed colocation or modification increases the overall
height more than 10% or the height of one additional antenna array not to
exceed 20 feet (whichever is greater); or
         (b)   The proposed colocation or modification increases the width more
than 20 feet from the edge of the tower or the width of the tower at the level
of the appurtenance (whichever is greater); or
         (c)   The proposed colocation or modification involves the
installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the
technology involved, not to exceed four; or
         (d)   The proposed colocation or modification involves excavation
outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the
tower, including any access or utility easements currently related to the site.
      (2)   For towers in the public ROW and for all base stations, a
substantial change occurs when:
         (a)   The proposed colocation or modification increases the overall
height more than 10% or ten feet (whichever is greater); or
         (b)   The proposed colocation or modification increases the width more
than six feet from the edge of the tower or base station; or
         (c)   The proposed colocation or modification involves the
installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no
existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or
         (d)   The proposed colocation or modification involves the
installation of any new ground-mounted equipment cabinets that are 10% larger
in height or volume than any existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or
         (e)   The proposed colocation or modification involves excavation
outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment
already deployed on the ground.
      (3)   For all towers and base stations wherever located, a substantial
change occurs when:
         (a)   The proposed colocation or modification would defeat the
existing concealment elements of the support structure as reasonably determined
by the City Manager or designee; or
         (b)   The proposed colocation or modification violates a prior
condition of approval; provided however, that the colocation need not comply
with any prior condition of approval related to height, width, equipment
cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a
substantial change described in this definition.
   SUPPORT EQUIPMENT.  The physical, electrical and/or electronic equipment
included within a telecom facility used to house, power, and/or process signals
from or to the facility's antenna or antennas.

does not include a small wireless facility, which is defined separately under
SMALL CELL WIRELESS FACILITY) used in the transmission or reception of such
signals; telecommunication towers or similar structures supporting said
equipment; associated equipment cabinets and/or buildings; and all other
accessory development. These facilities include amateur radio antenna
structures that exceed 30 feet in height but do not include government-operated
public safety networks.
   TEMPORARY WIRELESS FACILITIES.  Portable wireless facilities intended or
used to provide personal wireless services on a temporary or emergency basis,
such as a large-scale special event in which more users than usual gather in a
confined location or when a disaster disables permanent wireless facilities.
Temporary wireless facilities include, without limitation, cells-on-wheels
("COWs"), sites-on-wheels ("SOWs"), cells-on-light-trucks ("COLTs"), interim
telecom sites, or other similarly portable wireless facilities not permanently
affixed to site on which it is located.
   TOWER.  The same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. section 1.40001(b)(9),
which defines that term as any structure built for the sole or primary purpose
of supporting any FCC-licensed or authorized antennas and their associated
facilities, including structures that are constructed for wireless
communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and
public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed
wireless services such as microwave backhaul, and the associated site. Examples
include, but are not limited to, monopoles, monotrees, and lattice towers.
   TRANSMISSION EQUIPMENT.  The same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. section

   (A)   Telecommunication permits required. Wireless telecommunication permits
shall be subject to review as follows:
      (1)   Encroachment telecommunication permit. City staff shall have the
authority to issue an encroachment permit for a telecom facility that is
proposed to be located in the right-of-way (ROW) on streetlight poles, traffic
signals or utility poles when its design and installation is consistent with
all provisions of this section of the code, qualifies as a small cell wireless
facility (see § 154.147), or is subject to a valid master license agreement or
other agreement with the city for antennas that do not exceed 50 feet in
height. Telecom facilities that do not conform to these regulations or exceed
the 50-foot height limit shall be approved by the City Council as a City
Council telecom permit, except for SCWFs that may not exceed 50 feet in height,
with certain exceptions as described in §
154.147.
      (2)   Administrative telecommunication permit. City staff shall have the
authority to issue a telecom permit for a wireless telecom facility or SCWF
that is proposed on private property when its design and installation is
consistent with provisions of this chapter of the code, is eligible for
approval pursuant to section 6409 as described in §
154.148, qualifies as a SCWF, or modifications to existing wireless Telecom
facilities that do not vary significantly in size, aesthetics or other
parameters from the original installation at the discretion of city staff.
      (3)   Telecommunication permit. All wireless telecom facilities that are
not eligible for approval of an encroachment telecom permit or an
administrative telecom permit or is not in conformance with section 6409 (see §
154.148), or does not qualify as a small cell wireless facility, or is a new
facility that exceeds 50 feet, shall be subject to review and approval by the
Planning Commission in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Temporary telecommunication permit. A temporary use permit subject
to the city staffs prior review for telecom facilities on private property or
for telecom facilities in the public ROW. Approval in accordance with the
procedures and standards in §
154.150 is required for any temporary wireless telecom facility, unless
deployed in connection with an emergency pursuant to Chapter 32, Civil Defense,
or other lawful emergency authority.
   (B)   Other permits and regulatory approvals. In addition to any telecom
permit, administrative permit, or other permit required under this code, the
applicant must obtain all other permits and regulatory approvals as may be
required by any other federal, state, or local government agencies, which
includes without limitation building permits, encroachment permits, electrical
permits, plumbing permits, and any other permits and/or regulatory approvals
issued by other departments or divisions within the city. Furthermore, any
permit or approval granted under this chapter or deemed granted or deemed
approved by law shall remain subject to any and all lawful conditions and/or
legal requirements associated with such other permits or regulatory approvals.
   (C)   Appeals.
      (1)   Decisions of any reviewing authority made pursuant to this
subchapter may be appealed to the next highest reviewing authority. However,
per federal law, decisions regarding small cell wireless facility permits and
eligible facilities requests under section 6409 may not be appealed but are
final once they have been decided by the appropriate reviewing authority. The
decision-making and appeal process for telecom permit applications shall be as
follows:

      (2)   Decisions on small cell wireless facilities and telecom facilities
subject to section 6409(a) are not appealable to the Planning Commission or
City Council, per federal law.
   (D)   Timing.
      (1)   At the time of adoption of this subchapter, litigation is underway
regarding certain of the required "shot clocks" or timelines for permit
approvals. Per federal law and the FCC, requested permits that are eligible
facility requests or SCWFs proposed for installation on preexisting structures
may carry a 60-day timeframe/shot clock, provided that an application is
submitted and is complete in all respects. Other SCWFs that are not eligible
facility requests may carry a 90-day shot clock, and the city must notify the
applicant within ten days whether an application is "materially incomplete."
The city will observe all applicable federal and state timelines with respect
to permits requested under this part and will administratively adjust and
publish those timelines should court rulings or legislation change those
timelines. An ordinance modification to this subchapter in due course will be
thereafter sought by staff if such timelines are changed.
      (2)   Notice of "shot clock" expiration. The applicant is required to
provide the City Manager or designee with written notice of the applicants
estimate regarding the expiration of any applicable timeframe for review, which
the applicant shall send by secure method (e.g., certified mail, registered
mail, overnight carrier, any one of which shall require a receipt signature),
no earlier than 30 nor later than 20 days prior to the applicants estimation of
the time of shot clock expiration. The applicants estimate of the "shot clock"
expiration is not necessarily binding on the city.
   (E)   Required findings. The City Manager or designee shall make all of the
following findings when approving telecom facilities, including SCWFs:
      (1)   The proposed telecom facility complies with all applicable
development standards described, or qualifies for a variance;
      (2)   The applicant demonstrated that its proposed wireless facility will
be in full compliance with all applicable FCC rules and regulations for human
exposure to radio frequency emissions;
      (3)   The applicant demonstrated a good-faith effort to identify and
evaluate alternate locations and potentially less-intrusive designs; and
      (4)   Lack of such a facility would result in a significant gap of
coverage.
   (F)   Other regulations. All telecom facilities and SCWFs are subject to
provisions of this subchapter and the following other requirements:
      (1)   Conditions in any permit or license issued by a local, state, or
federal agency, which has jurisdiction over the telecom facility of SCWF;
      (2)   Rules, regulations, and standards of the FCC and the CPUC;
easements, covenants, conditions, or restrictions on the underlying real
property; and
      (3)   The California Building Code, California Fire Code and portions of
the Uniform Fire Code, California Mechanical Code, and California Electrical
Code, as amended by state or local law or regulation.
   (G)   Regulations not in conflict or preempted. All telecom facilities
within the city shall comply with all applicable design standards, with the
General Plan, with any applicable specific plan, and with the San Joaquin
Municipal Code, unless specifically exempted by the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 12-7-2021)
§ 154.144  ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Setbacks and minimum traversable paths. Setbacks shall be measured
from the part of the telecom facility closest to the applicable lot line or
structure. The setbacks and minimum traversable path requirements applicable in
the public ROW shall be determined by city staff based upon the safety needs of
the location in order to assure Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) access,
traffic sight distance and related considerations.
   (B)   Maintenance. The telecom operator shall maintain the telecom facility
in a manner consistent with the original approval of the facility.
   (C)   Non-conformities. A proposed telecom facility shall not create any new
or increased non-conformities as defined in the San Joaquin Municipal Code,
such as, but not limited to, a reduction in and/or elimination of parking,
setbacks, landscaping or loading zones.
   (D)   Technical consultants. At its discretion, the city may engage outside
technical consultants to evaluate and/or verify the information used to support
the applicant's showing(s) in its application or with testimony in city
proceedings, and where applicable pursuant to this section. The reasonable cost
for the consultants shall be borne by the applicant. An advance deposit for the
estimated cost of the fees for the outside consultants shall be promptly paid
to the city by the applicant upon request by the city. Failure to pay such
deposit shall render any pending application incomplete until paid. After the
consultant's work has been completed, if the amount of the deposit was
insufficient to cover the cost of the consultants' fees the applicant shall
immediately reimburse the city for any shortfall. If the cost of the work is
less than the estimate the amount over shall promptly be repaid to the
applicant at the conclusion of the application proceedings.
   (E)   Review procedures. The City Council by resolution may adopt further
procedures for review of wireless facilities.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 12-7-2021)
§ 154.145  HEIGHT, LOCATION, AND COLOCATION.
   (A)   Height.
      (1)   Maximum height. The maximum height for telecom facilities and small
cell wireless facilities (SCWFs) is as follows:
         (a)   Telecom facilities (SCWFs). Fifty feet for antennas on
streetlights, traffic control standards, utility distribution poles, or other
similar structures within the public ROW (total height including pole and
antenna). Antennas exceeding 50 feet in height at water tank sites may be
approved provided they are found to be camouflaged or otherwise screened from
view. Antennas may be placed on existing utility poles that exceed 50 feet
where the purpose of the existing utility pole is only to carry electricity,
provided that the top of the antenna shall not exceed six feet above the top of
the pole and shall not exceed the height of the pole where primary or secondary
electrical lines are attached to the pole. For existing legal non-conforming
structures that exceed maximum building heights, telecom facilities may be
installed so long as the addition does not increase the overall height and the
project complies with this chapter in all other respects. For all other telecom
facilities, the maximum height of antennas shall be the upper maximum building
height allowed in the San Joaquin Municipal Code.
         (b)   Small cell wireless facilities. SCWFs must meet the following
mounting conditions:
            1.   Are mounted on structures 50 feet or less in height including
their antennas;
            2.   Are mounted on structures no more than 10% taller than other
adjacent structures; and
            3.   Do not extend existing structures on which they are located to
a height more than 50 feet or by more than 10%, whichever is greater.
      (2)   Over-height antennas. The City Manager or designee may approve
antennas up to 15 feet above the preceding maximum building height limitations
provided it makes findings that are required for special approvals pursuant to
division (B)(2) below.
      (3)   Camouflaged telecommunication installations within structures.
Camouflaged facilities may be installed within structures that are permitted to
exceed the above stated height limits by a conditional use permit.
   (B)   Location.
      (1)   Location or design categories and location priorities. When
reviewing proposed locations for telecom facilities the reviewing authority
shall utilize the following priority order:
         (a)   Existing colocation structure or site (site of an existing
wireless facility);
         (b)   Existing pole, light standard, or utility tower in the ROW;
         (c)   Proposed pole, light standard, or utility tower in the ROW;
         (d)   Private property in the Manufacturing Zoning District;
         (e)   Private property in the Commercial or Main Street Commercial
Zoning Districts;
         (f)   Sign or architectural feature in a manufacturing or commercial
zone;
         (g)   New false tree in a manufacturing or commercial zone; and
         (h)   Public property in a quasi-public zone.
      (2)   Locations requiring special approval. Telecom facilities are
prohibited in the following locations unless given special approval by the
reviewing authority under the provisions of this chapter, after making all the
findings contained in division (B)(3) below:
         (a)   On common area lots, other non-residential lots, and public ROW
within residential districts;
         (b)   Within any required setback established in the San Joaquin
Municipal Code;
         (c)   On multi-family structures; and
         (d)   On public ROW where any portion of the proposed telecom facility
lies adjacent to the property line or within 250 feet of a residential
structure.
      (3)   Special approval findings. In making the following special approval
findings the City Manager or designee shall determine that the applicant has
demonstrated that:
         (a)   There are no other feasible locations that meet the coverage or
data capacity needs of the applicant;
         (b)   Establishment of the facility at the requested location is
necessary to provide service;
         (c)   Lack of such a facility would result in a significant gap of
coverage or data capacity;
         (d)   The proposed site is the least intrusive location which can
close that gap; and
         (e)   If within 250 feet of a residential structure, the wireless
facility is as far as possible from the residential structure.
      (4)   Prohibited locations. Telecom facilities are prohibited on
undeveloped residential lots or residential lots containing single-family
residences.
   (C)   Colocation requirements.
      (1)   Colocation required. To limit the adverse visual effects of a
proliferation of telecom sites in the city, a new telecom facility proposed
within 1,000 feet of an existing facility shall be required to collocate on the
same site as the existing facility unless the reviewing authority determines,
based on evidence submitted by the applicant, that such colocation is not
feasible. For SCWFs, the relevant colocation distance to be utilized is 250
feet.
      (2)   Colocation limitations. No more than three telecom facilities may
collocate at a single site unless the City Manager or designee finds that:
         (a)   The net visual effect of locating an additional facility at a
colocation site will be less than establishing a new location; or
         (b)   Based on evidence submitted by the applicant, there is no
available feasible alternate location for a proposed new facility.
      (3)   Future colocation. In approving a telecom facility, the City
Manager or designee may impose a condition of approval allowing future
colocation of telecom facilities by other carriers at the same site, subject to
numerical limits it deems to be appropriate that are necessary in order to be
consistent with the required finding that the design be the least intrusive.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 12-7-2021)
§ 154.146  DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   General criteria. In addition to the other design standards of this
chapter (including, if applicable, §
154.147), all of the following criteria shall be applied by the City Manager or
designee in connection with the processing of any telecommunication permit.
      (1)   All telecom facilities approved under this chapter shall utilize
the most efficient and diminutive available technology in order to minimize the
number of facilities and reduce their visual impact.
      (2)   Roof-mounted antennas shall be screened from view from adjacent
properties and the public ROW. The screening may include parapets, walls, or
similar architectural elements provided they are designed, colored, and
texturized to integrate with the existing architecture of the building.
      (3)   When located on a building facade, building-mounted antennas shall
be recessed and covered with an RF-transparent and visually opaque material of
a color and texture to match the existing building, or effectively disguised as
may be reasonably determined by the City Manager or designee.
      (4)   The use of compatible materials such as wood, brick, or stucco
shall be required for accessory equipment structures/buildings, which shall be
designed to architecturally blend with the exterior of structures within the
area.
      (5)   For ground-mounted installations, support equipment may be required
to be screened in a security enclosure approved by the City Manager or
designee. Such screened security enclosures may use bricks or masonry or may
consist of an alternate enclosure design approved by the City Manager or
designee. In general, the screening enclosure shall be architecturally
compatible with surrounding materials and colors. Chain link, barbed wire and
razor wire fencing shall be prohibited. Buffer landscaping may also be required
if the City Manager or designee determines that additional screening is
necessary due to the location of the site and that irrigation water is
available.
      (6)   Telecom facilities, including, but not limited to, antennas,
support structures, equipment structures, and related structures and equipment
shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the Uniform
Building, Mechanical, Electrical, and other applicable codes, laws, and
regulations, as enforced by the Division of Building and Safety, to assure that
all such facilities will maintain their structural integrity despite the
effects of the elements.
   (B)   Camouflage. All telecom facilities shall be camouflaged with
architectural integration techniques for buildings and pseudo-natural
integration techniques for those antennas in a natural or landscaped
environment to the greatest extent possible.
      (1)   Architectural integration concealment techniques include, but are
not limited to:
         (a)   Transmission equipment placed completely within existing
architectural features such that the installation causes no visible change to
the underlying structure; and
         (b)   New architectural features that mimic the underlying building in
architectural style, physical proportion, and quality of construction
materials.
      (2)   Architectural features commonly used as architectural integration
concealment include, but are not limited to, church steeples, cupolas, bell
towers, clock towers, pitched faux-roofs and water tanks. Whether a wireless
facility qualifies as an architecturally integrated facility depends on the
context that exists at a given location and is evaluated on a case-by-case
basis during the permit application process.
   (C)   Night lighting. Telecom facilities shall not be lighted except:
      (1)   For city-approved security lighting at the lowest intensity
necessary for that purpose; and
      (2)   As necessary for the illumination of the flag of the United States,
the flag of the State of California, or other similar flags, when such flag(s)
are attached to the telecom facility. Such lighting shall be shielded so that
direct illumination does not shine on nearby properties. The City Manager or
designee shall consult with the police department regarding proposed security
lighting for telecom facilities on a case-by-case basis.
   (D)   Signs and advertising. No advertising signage or identifying logos
shall be displayed on any telecom facility except for small identification,
address, warning, and similar information plates approved by the City Manager
or designee.
   (E)   Noise. Telecom facilities and all accessory equipment and transmission
equipment must comply with all noise regulations, and shall not exceed, either
individually or cumulatively, the applicable ambient noise limit in the subject
zoning district. The City Manager or designee may require the applicant to
incorporate appropriate noise-baffling materials and/or strategies whenever
necessary to avoid any ambient noise from equipment reasonably likely to exceed
the applicable limit.
   (F)   Site security measures. Telecom facilities may incorporate reasonable
and appropriate site security measures, such as fences, walls, and anti-
climbing devices, to prevent unauthorized access, theft, or vandalism. Site
security measures must be designed to enhance concealment to the maximum extent
possible, such as installing equipment within a decorative masonry wall rather
than within a fence. The City Manager or designee may require additional
concealment elements as the City Manager or designee finds necessary to blend
the security measures and other improvements into the natural and/or built
environment. The City Manager or designee shall not approve barbed wire, razor
wire, electrified fences, or any similar security measures visible to the
public.
   (G)   Backup power sources. The City Manager or designee may approve
permanent backup power sources and/or generators on a case-by-case basis. The
city strongly discourages backup power sources mounted on the ground or on
poles within the public ROW. The City Manager or designee shall not approve any
diesel generators or other similarly noisy or noxious generators, in or within
250 feet from any residence; except for permanently installed back-up
generators only used during area-wide loss of power and routine testing, and
when found to be in compliance with the city's General Plan noise element
objectives, at which a smaller setback may be established; and provided,
however, the City Manager or designee may approve sockets or other connections
used for temporary backup generators.
   (H)   Colocation. All new telecom operators shall collocate with other
existing and/or planned telecom facilities whenever feasible. Operators are
encouraged to collocate with other existing facilities such as water tanks,
light standards (SCWFs) and other utility structures where the colocation is
found to minimize the overall visual impact of the new facility. Colocation of
SCWFs on light standards/poles, traffic lights, or other structures located
within the public ROW shall be subject to the requirements of §
154.145.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 12-7-2021)
§ 154.147  SMALL CELL WIRELESS FACILITIES OR SCWFS.
   This section establishes procedural requirements and standards to regulate
the streamlined review of small cell wireless facilities ("SCWFs") within the
public ROW or on public and private property to minimize the potential safety
and aesthetic impacts on neighboring property owners and the community, and to
comply with applicable state and federal laws.

         (b)   Antennas may be concealed in a canister located on top of the
streetlight pole, traffic signal pole, utility pole, or new monopole if all of
the following design criteria are met:
            1.   The canister shall not exceed the width or diameter of the
existing pole by more than six inches;
            2.   Antennas shall be water-tight and shall not alter the wind
loading on the pole;
            3.   Associated cables and wires shall be concealed and flush-
mounted to the pole. All equipment on each pole shall be housed in a suitable
enclosure to conceal components and cabling from public view. The enclosure
shall be coated in a material and color matching that of the pole; and
            4.   Other associated equipment shall be installed underground or
placed in a cabinet outside site distance triangle areas for street corners and

wireless facilities and shall comply with the design standards in §
154.146.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 12-7-2021)
§ 154.148  SECTION 6409(a) ELIGIBLE TELECOM FACILITIES.
   (A)   Background. Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job
Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L 112-96, codified as 47 U.S.C. section 1455(a)
("section 6409"), generally requires that state and local governments "may not
deny, and shall approve" requests to collocate, remove or replace transmission
equipment at an existing tower or base station. Federal Communication
Commission ("FCC") regulations interpret this statute and establish procedural
rules for local review, which generally preempt certain subjective land-use
regulations, limit permit application content requirements and provide the
applicant with a potential "deemed-granted" remedy when the state or local
government fails to approve or deny the request within 60 calendar days after
submittal (accounting for any tolling periods). Moreover, whereas section 704
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, codified as 47 U.S.C.
section 332, applies to only "personal wireless service facilities" (e.g.,
cellular telephone towers and equipment), section 6409 applies to all
"wireless" facilities licensed or authorized by the FCC (e.g., cellular, Wi-Fi,
satellite, microwave backhaul, and the like).
   (B)   Definitions. Abbreviations, phrases, terms, and words used in this
section that are relevant to section 6409(a) facilities are defined in §
154.142.
   (C)   Applicability. This chapter applies to all requests for approval to
collocate, replace or remove transmission equipment at an existing tower or
base station submitted pursuant to section 6409(a).
   (D)   Application review. Under federal law, the city must approve or deny
an application for an eligible facilities request, together with any other city
permits required for a proposed wireless facility modification, within 60 days
after the applicant submits the application for a wireless facility minor
modification permit, unless tolled due to issuance of any notice of incomplete
filing or by mutual agreement between the city and the applicant. Under federal
law, failure to act on a wireless facility minor modification permit
application within the 60-day review period, excluding tolling period, will
result in the permit being deemed granted by operation of law.
   (E)   Prior permit approvals. The following prior permit approvals are
required prior to qualifying for approval of an eligible facilities request
under section 6409.
      (1)   Section 6409 approval. Any request to collocate replace or remove
transmission equipment at an existing tower or base station submitted with a
written request for approval under section 6409 shall require an amendment to
the underlying telecom permit for the tower or base station subject to the
reviewing authority's approval, conditional approval, or denial without
prejudice.
      (2)   Other permits and regulatory approvals. No colocation or
modification approved pursuant to this chapter may occur unless the applicant
also obtains all other permits and regulatory approvals as may be required by
any other federal, state, or local government agencies, which include without
limitation building permits, encroachment permits, electrical permits and any
other permits and/or regulatory approvals issued by other departments or
divisions within the city. Furthermore, any section 6409 approval granted under
this chapter shall remain subject to any and all lawful conditions and/or legal
requirements associated with such other permits or regulatory approvals.
   (F)   Required findings for approval. The City Manager or designee may
approve or conditionally approve any application for a section 6409 eligible
facilities request subject to the following findings:
      (1)   Involves colocation, removal, or replacement of transmission
equipment on an existing tower or base station; and
      (2)   Does not substantially change the physical dimensions of the
existing tower or base station.
   (G)   Criteria for denial without prejudice. The City Manager or designee
may deny without prejudice any application for a section 6409 EFR approval if
the City Manager or designee finds that the proposed project:
      (1)   Does not meet the finding required in division (E);
      (2)   Involves replacement of the entire support structure; or
      (3)   Violates any legally enforceable law, regulation, rule, standard or
permit condition reasonably related to public health and safety, which includes
without limitation laws, regulations, rules, standards, or permit conditions
related to building and electric codes, aviation safety, and flood control.

§ 154.149  DISTRIBUTED ANTENNA SYSTEM (DAS).
   A distributed antenna system, or DAS, is a network of spatially separated
antenna nodes connected to a common source via a transport medium that provides
wireless service within a geographic area or structure. A distributed antenna
system may be deployed indoors (an iDAS) or outdoors (an oDAS). Applications
for DAS telecom facilities shall be submitted as a single application and will
have a single master license agreement if located on public property or in the
ROW. Each individual location within the system shall be processed and
considered for approval separately. Permitting fees will be applied to each
site. Each location will be evaluated and must comply with the installation
design standards for the type of site as defined by this chapter.

Building Code (and all other applicable standards that could limit the size or
number of units).
   (D)   Common interest development conversions. If the existing residential
units to be converted to a common interest development include rental
inclusionary housing units, the inclusionary units shall be sold as ownership
affordable units, or upon approval from the city can be retained as affordable
rental units.
      (1)   If the city authorizes the affordable rental units to be retained,
the owners shall record a covenant guaranteeing the affordability of the rental
units and waiving certain rights granted by state law (Cal. Gov't Code § 7060
et seq.) for the life of the project.
      (2)   If the units are to be sold to targeted income groups, the owners
shall record a covenant restricting future sales prices to levels affordable to
the targeted income group.
   (E)   Affordable unit size, type, and location.
      (1)   Inclusionary and density bonus units shall have the same number and
type of appliances as non-inclusionary units. The exterior of inclusionary
units shall be of the same appearance, finished quality and materials as the
non-inclusionary units and shall be indistinguishable from the non-inclusionary
units.
      (2)   Inclusionary and density bonus units shall be reasonably dispersed
throughout the project, shall contain on average the same number of bedrooms as
the non-inclusionary units in the project, and shall be comparable with the
non-inclusionary units in terms of appearance, finished quality, and materials
as approved by the review authority.
      (3)   While the intent is for inclusionary and density bonus units to be
dispersed throughout the project as much as possible, inclusionary units may be
clustered within a building if the review authority, or City Manager as a minor
administrative modification of an approved development, determines that such
clustering results in the creation of more affordable units than would
otherwise be provided, or provides a documented public benefit, or due to
circumstances unique to the project size, location or design otherwise better
serves the affordable housing needs of the city.
   (F)   When only one affordable dwelling unit is constructed, it may be
allocated for a very low, low, or moderate-income household. When two or more
affordable units are constructed, the units shall be allocated alternately with
the first unit allocated for a low or very low-income household and the second
allocated for a moderate-income household, alternating between low or very low,
and moderate-income until all units are assigned a level of affordability.

§ 154.223  AFFORDABLE HOUSING FEES.
   (A)   In-lieu fee. Developers of residential projects with ten or fewer
units may choose to pay a fee in-lieu of providing the required affordable unit
on-site.
   (B)   Amount of fee. The amount of the in-lieu fee shall be calculated in
compliance with the Council's fee schedule.
   (C)   Timing of payment. The fee required by this section shall be paid
before issuance of a building permit for the approved project.
   (D)   Basis for the fee. Fees paid to fulfill the requirements of this
section shall be computed based on the number and size of the units to be
constructed. Unit size shall be gross livable floor area, including private
balconies, decks, and patios.
   (E)   Affordable Housing Trust Fund. Fees paid to fulfill the requirements
of this chapter shall be placed in the city's Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
The funds shall be used exclusively for projects which have a minimum of 60% of
the dwelling units affordable to low- and moderate-income households, with at
least 20% of the units available to low-income households. Only tax-exempt
nonprofit corporations seeking to create or preserve the housing in the city
shall be eligible to apply to the Council for funding. The funds may, at the
discretion of the Council, be used for predevelopment costs, land or air rights
acquisition, administrative costs, gap financing, or to lower the interest rate
of construction loans or permanent financing. In a project that includes
market-rate units, trust fund monies shall only be provided to assist in the
acquisition and construction of those units affordable to low- and moderate-
income households.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 12-7-2021)
§ 154.224  AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCENTIVES.
   This section provides density bonuses for specified housing projects and
commercial projects that are affiliated with on-site or off-site affordable
housing projects. The provided affordable units qualifying a project for a
bonus shall be made permanently affordable to and reserved for households at
the income levels qualifying the project for the bonus.
   (A)   Basis for bonus. In order to encourage the construction of housing
affordable to very low-, low-, and moderate-income persons, transitional foster
youth, disabled veterans, and homeless persons, and the replacement of
residential rental units lost through new construction, density bonuses shall
be allowed in compliance with this section.
   (B)   Replacement affordable units. Replacement of affordable units through
demolition or renovation of an existing residential structure on the same site
shall be regulated as follows:
      (1)   If any affordable units are occupied at the date of application,
the project shall provide at least the same number of equivalent units of
equivalent size to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing
cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same lower income
category as those households in occupancy.
      (2)   If any affordable dwelling units have been vacated or demolished
within the five-year period preceding the application, the proposed replacement
project shall provide at least the same number of affordable units of
equivalent size as existed at the highpoint of those units in the five-year
period preceding the application to be made available at affordable rent or
affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same
or lower income category as those persons and families in occupancy at that
time, if known.
      (3)   If the income category of the last household in occupancy, or of
the persons or families in occupancy at the high point, is not known, it shall
be presumed that lower-income renter households occupied these units in the
same proportion of lower-income renter households to all renter households
within the jurisdiction, as determined by the most recently available data from
the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's comprehensive
housing affordability strategy database.
      (4)   The replacement affordable units shall be made available at
affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons or
families in the same or lower income category as the occupancy that determines
the replacement requirement.
      (5)   The affordable replacement units shall be subject to a recorded
affordability restriction.
      (6)   The affordable replacement units shall be counted towards the
affordable units provided for purposes of calculating the density bonus.
   (C)   Density bonus. As provided by state law, projects not utilizing the
in-lieu fee may apply for housing density bonuses up to a maximum of 35%.
Density bonuses shall be subject to the following:
      (1)   Density bonus calculations.
         (a)   For the purposes of calculating the permitted housing bonus in
residential zones, "density" shall refer to the maximum limit of dwelling units
allowable in the zone in which the project is located. The density bonus may
result in more market rate units than would otherwise be permitted by the zone.
The base number of units used to calculate the bonus does not include units
added by a density bonus awarded pursuant to this section.
         (b)   For the purposes of calculating the permitted housing bonus in
commercial zones, "density" shall refer to the maximum floor area ratio ("FAR")
permitted in the zone in which the project is located, inclusive of applicable
mixed-use bonuses. Because these projects are in the commercial zone, the FAR
is not translated into a unit count for purposes of calculating the density
bonus. In the commercial zones, the affordable housing density bonus authorized
under this section shall only be used to increase the residential floor area of
the project (unless otherwise authorized by Cal. Gov't Code § 65915.7). In such
event, the base FAR may be combined with any available mixed-use bonus to
determine the density from which the affordable bonus will be calculated. Any
other applicable bonus (e.g,, green building senior housing and the like) shall
be added after the affordable housing density bonus calculation.
         (c)   Any density calculation, including base density and bonus
density, that results in a fractional number shall be separately rounded up to
the next whole number.
      (2)   Density bonuses permitted. The amount of density bonus granted
shall be based on the following table:

require that the City Manager or designee first verify the purchaser as very
low-, low-, or moderate-income. This requirement shall be included in the
recorded covenant.
      (3)   Newly constructed inclusionary units shall first be offered to
eligible very low-, low- and moderate-income households displaced by the
demolition necessary to construct the project; then the offer shall be made to
other very low-, low-, or moderate-income displaced households in the city.
      (4)   In a building undergoing conversion to common interest development,
an equal number of units in the resulting development as the existing project
shall be offered to very low-, low-, and moderate-income households.
      (5)   Lower income inclusionary units shall be sold at a price that is no
more than two and one-half times 65% of the median income of the city and
adjusted by the "bedroom factor." Qualifying income levels shall be established
annually by the City Council.
      (6)   Moderate-income inclusionary units shall be sold at a price that is
no more than two and one-half times the median income of the city. Qualifying
income levels shall be established annually by the City Council.

households displaced by demolition, the developer of a project shall be
required to give right of first refusal to purchase any or all inclusionary
units to the city, or a city-designated agency or organization, for at least 60
days from the date of construction completion.
   (D)   Lottery. If the city chooses not to exercise its right of first
refusal, it shall conduct a lottery to establish a list of eligible purchasers
within that same time period. If the list is not provided, the developer may
select the low- or moderate-income purchasers as long as the city verifies
income eligibility, and the units are sold at a price no more than two and one-
half times the median income for the city.
   (E)   Resale of units. Upon resale, the affordable units shall remain
affordable to the targeted income group. The resale price shall be set as
follows. The price resulting from the total costs, including homeowners'
association fees, shall be:
      (1)   Moderate-income units: a total cost of no more than two and one-
half times the median income for the city, for moderate income households.
      (2)   Lower-income units: a total cost of no more than two and one-half
times 65% of the median income for the city for low income households.

§ 154.256  APPLICABILITY.
   The requirements of this chapter apply to the establishment, alteration,
expansion, or change in any use or structure, as provided in this section.
   (A)   New buildings and land uses. If a new building or land use is
established, parking shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.
   (B)   Building expansions. Should a building be expanded by more than 10%
its total floor area, parking shall be provided in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Change in use or change of occupancy.   
      (1)   If a change in use or change in occupancy occurs, parking shall be
provided in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   When a change in use or change in occupancy creates an increase of
10% or more in the number of required on-site parking or loading spaces, on-
site parking and loading shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter. The change in use or change in occupancy that creates an increase
of 10% or more shall be cumulative from the date of adoption of this chapter.
   (D)   Existing excess parking. If the number of existing parking spaces is
greater than the requirements for such use, the number of spaces in excess of
the prescribed minimum may be counted toward meeting the parking requirements
for the addition, enlargement, or change in use.
   (E)   Reconstruction of non-residential buildings. Should a non-residential
building be damaged and/or demolished due to an act of nature, a building may
be reconstructed and may provide the same number of stalls provided there is no
increase in building floor area.
   (F)   Alterations that increase the number of dwelling units. The creation
of additional dwelling units through the alteration of an existing building or
construction of an additional structure or structures requires the provision of
on-site parking to serve the new dwelling units. If the number of existing
parking spaces is greater than the requirements for the existing units, the
number of spaces in excess of the prescribed minimum may be counted toward
meeting the parking requirements for the new dwelling units.
   (G)   Non-conforming parking or loading. An existing use of land or
structure shall not be deemed to be non-conforming solely because of a lack of
on-site parking and/or loading facilities required by this chapter, provided
that facilities used for on-site parking and/or loading as of the date of
adoption of this chapter are not reduced in number to less than what this
chapter requires.

documentation is necessary to demonstrate that unusual conditions warrant a
parking reduction, such as the multiple use of a parking area by uses having
peak parking demands which occur at different times; floor plans which indicate
that the floor area devoted to customer or employee use is less than typical
for the size building proposed; or that other programs will be implemented by
the developer or tenant(s) which will result in a demand for less parking at
the site.

NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES,
SITE FEATURES, AND LOTS
§ 154.320  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to permit continued utility and economic
viability of uses, structures, site features, and lots that were created
lawfully under a previous zoning code, but do not now conform to this code.
This subchapter only allows the continuation of existing uses while preventing
new non-conformities.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 12-7-2021)
§ 154.321  DETERMINATION OF NON-CONFORMING STATUS.
   A use, structure, site feature, or lot shall be considered non-conforming if
it was created under a previous code, or any amendment thereto, and does not
now conform to this code. The Director shall evaluate all available
documentation to determine that non-conforming uses, structures, and site
features shall have legal non-conforming status or illegal non-conforming
status as follows:
   (A)   Legal non-conforming status. A use, structure, or site feature shall
be designated as having legal non-conforming status if it was lawfully
established under the regulations of the jurisdiction in which it was located
at the time of its establishment and has continuously remained in compliance
with all terms and conditions imposed upon the use, structure, or site feature
upon its establishment or imposed upon it any time thereafter, based on
evidence provided by the property owner, tenant, or applicant. Legal non-
conforming status shall also be assigned if non-conformities were created by a
public improvement, such as a street widening project. A use permit shall be
required for properties on the city's list of historic resources as deemed
necessary by the City Manager or designee.
   (B)   Illegal non-conforming status. A use, structure, site feature, or lot
shall be designated as having illegal non-conforming status if it was not
lawfully established under the regulations of the jurisdiction in which it was
located at the time of its establishment or has not continuously remained in
compliance with all terms and conditions imposed upon the use, structure, or
site feature upon its establishment or imposed upon it any time thereafter.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 12-7-2021)
§ 154.322  ILLEGAL NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND SITE FEATURES.
   Nothing in this subchapter shall be deemed to allow the use, change in use,
repair, alteration, expansion, enlargement, or reconstruction of an illegal
non-conforming use, structure, or site feature. Any such illegal non-conforming
use shall be discontinued, and any such illegal non-conforming structure or
site feature shall be removed.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 12-7-2021)
§ 154.323  LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Continuation of legal non-conforming uses. Except as otherwise
provided in this subchapter, any legal non-conforming use may be continued
indefinitely. No illegal non-conforming use shall be continued unless such use
subsequently comes into conformity with the applicable provisions of this code.
   (B)   Expansion of legal non-conforming uses. A legal non-conforming use
shall not be expanded unless a conditional use permit is granted for such
expansion. Prior to issuance of a conditional use permit, it must be determined
that at least one of the following three circumstances exists:
      (1)   The resultant use and/or project design will reduce current adverse
impacts on adjacent properties and/or the general public;
      (2)   The resultant use and/or project design will aid in the
preservation of a historic resource; or
      (3)   The expansion of the use or the enlargement of a structure housing
a non-conforming use is necessary to comply with a requirement imposed by law
for the operation of the particular use, including, but not limited to,
regulations for disabled access or seismic retrofit.
   (C)   Change of legal non-conforming uses. A legal non-conforming use shall
not be changed to, or substituted for, another non-conforming use unless a
conditional use permit is granted for such change or substitution. To grant
such a conditional use permit the Planning Commission must first find that, in
addition to the findings required by division (B) above, the resultant use will
be more consistent with the uses permitted in the district than the former use.
   (D)   Change of legal non-conforming industrial use. A legal non-conforming
industrial use shall not be changed to, or substituted for, another use other
than to come into compliance with this code.
   (E)   Change to a conforming use. When a legal non-conforming use has been
changed to a conforming use, the non-conforming use shall not be re-established
thereafter, with the following exception: within residential multi-family,
mixed-use, or commercial districts, structures which are determined by the
Director to have been lawfully constructed as single-family dwellings may be
returned to single-family use at any time. The Director shall base such a
determination on evidence including building permits, County Assessor's data,
building design and appearance, or other records which document that the
building was originally constructed as a single-family home.
   (F)   Abandonment of legal non-conforming uses.
      (1)   Residential districts. A legal non-conforming use shall not be re-
established in any structure in a residential district if such legal non-
conforming use has ceased for a consecutive six-month period.
      (2)   Mixed use districts. A legal non-conforming use shall not be re-
established in any structure if such legal non-conforming use has ceased for a
consecutive five-year period.
      (3)   All other districts. A legal non-conforming use shall not be re-
established in any structure if such legal non-conforming use has ceased for a
consecutive 12-month period within five years of January 3, 2016. Once the
five-year period from the effective date of this code has passed, a legal non-
conforming use shall not be re-established in any structure in a non-
residential district if such legal non-conforming use has ceased for a
consecutive period of 90 days or more.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 12-7-2021)
§ 154.324  LEGAL NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES AND SITE FEATURES.
   (A)   Applicability. This section shall apply to all legal non-conforming
buildings, fences, parking, landscaping, and other such physical improvements
to a lot.
   (B)   Continuation of existing structures and site features. Except as
otherwise stated in this article, any legal non-conforming structure or site
feature may be continued indefinitely. Any illegal non-conforming structure or
site feature shall be removed or modified to conform to the provisions of this
code.
   (C)   Completion of structures or site features. The provisions of this
subchapter shall not be construed to preclude the completion of any structure
or site feature upon which lawful construction has begun prior to the time of
enactment of this code or any amendment thereto, or prior to the time of
inclusion in the city.
   (D)   Repair and maintenance of non-conforming structures and site features:
      (1)   Maintenance. A legal non-conforming structure or site feature may
be maintained as necessary to keep it in good working order.
      (2)   Repairs and alterations. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
subchapter, any legal non-conforming structure or site feature may be repaired
and/or altered, provided that such repairs and alterations do not increase any
non-conformity.
      (3)   Repair of unsafe structures or site feature. The provisions of this
subchapter shall not be construed to preclude the repair or alteration of any
part of any structure or site feature declared to be unsafe by the Building
Official when such repairs or alterations are for the purpose of restoring the
structure or site feature to a safe condition.
   (E)   Enlargement of non-conforming structures.
      (1)   Enlargement of single-family residential structures. A legal non-
conforming single-family use or structure in a non-residential district may be
enlarged, provided the addition does not reduce the number of parking spaces,
alter the size of parking spaces, or the location and size of driveways; and
the addition does not change the structure from single-family use to multi-
family use. Such an expansion shall conform to the property development
standards of either the base district (and overlay districts, if applicable)
for the site, or a residential district which is appropriate to the size and
configuration of the site at the discretion of the review authority.
      (2)   Enlargement of other legal non-conforming structures and site
features. A legal non-conforming structure or site feature being used for a
conforming use may be enlarged or structurally altered if the new portion of
the structure or site feature conforms to the regulations of the district in
which it is located. If strict conformance with current setback requirements
would cause unsightly or impractical site layouts, and a deviation from such
requirements shall not cause impacts on neighboring uses, the review authority
may exempt the enlargement of a legal non-conforming structure or site feature
from setback requirements at their discretion. Unaltered portions of such
structures or site features will be allowed to remain non-conforming. A legal
nonconforming structure or site feature housing or associated with a non-
conforming use shall not be enlarged or altered except as put forth in §
154.323(B).
   (F)   Replacement of involuntarily destroyed or damaged non-conforming
structures or site features. Any legal non-conforming structure or site feature
that is destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, explosion, wind, earthquake, war,
riot, or other public calamity or act of nature, may be replaced or
reconstructed to the same size and extent as before the damage occurred,
provided that rebuilding commences not later than one year after destruction,
and so long thereafter as the building permit remains valid.
   (G)   Replacement of voluntarily demolished, destroyed, or damaged non-
conforming structures or site features. Any non-conforming structure or site
feature which is demolished, destroyed, or damaged by means other than those
listed in this subchapter shall not be reconstructed unless it complies with
all provisions of the district in which the structure is located. Exceptions
may be given where all of the following circumstances exist:
      (1)   The structure houses a conforming use;
      (2)   The structure or site feature is replaced or reconstructed to the
same or a lesser size and extent as the original structure or site feature; and
      (3)   A conditional use permit is granted, and the Director finds, in
addition to the findings required by this subchapter, that compliance with
current standards is impractical and that the proposed reconstruction will
conform to current standards to the greatest extent practical.
