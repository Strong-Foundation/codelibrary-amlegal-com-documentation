§ 1.01.001 DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds that it is desirable and in the public interest to
establish a municipal code in order to provide a system of organization for the
classification and grouping of ordinances which the Council may adopt. The
Council intends on adopting ordinances of a general and permanent nature to
provide for their placement in accordance with the scheme of the code. This
will provide the user with a convenient and logical compilation of the
ordinances of the city.

   This code shall be known as the “Menifee Municipal Code”. It shall be
sufficient to refer to this code as the Menifee Municipal Code in any

sufficient to designate any ordinance adding to, amending or repealing
provisions of this code as an addition or amendment to, or a repeal of the
municipal code, or any portion thereof.

permanent nature.

individual an administrative citation: the president or other head of the
corporation, vice-president, a secretary or assistant secretary, a treasurer or
assistant treasurer, a general manager or a person authorized by the
corporation to receive service of process in a civil action. If the office
address of any of the above-listed individuals is known to the city, a copy of
the administrative citation also shall be mailed to one of those individuals by
certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. Simultaneously, the
same notice may be sent by regular mail. If a notice sent by certified mail is

responsible person is a corporation or business, the signature of the person
served with the administrative citation. If a responsible person or persons
served refuses or fails to sign the administrative citation, the failure or
refusal to sign shall not affect the validity of the citation or of subsequent
proceedings.
   (D)   If the Enforcement Officer is unable to locate a responsible person
for the violation, the administrative citation shall be mailed to the
responsible person by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested. Simultaneously, the same notice may be sent by regular mail. If a
notice sent by certified mail is returned unsigned, then service shall be
deemed effective pursuant to regular mail, provided the notice that was sent by
regular mail is not returned.
   (E)   If the Enforcement Officer does not succeed in serving the responsible
party personally, or by certified mail or regular mail, the Enforcement Officer
shall post the administrative citation on any real property within the city in
which the city has knowledge that the responsible party has a legal interest,
and the posting shall be deemed effective service.
   (F)   If the Enforcement Officer does not succeed in serving the responsible
party personally, by certified mail or regular mail, and the city is not aware
that the responsible party has a legal interest in any real property within the
city, the Enforcement Officer shall cause the administrative citation to be

      (3)   Do not engage in prejudicial or discriminatory behavior when making

      (4)   Respect obligations to others and require the same respect from
others for their obligations.
      (5)   No employee, officer or agent of the city may participate in the
selection, award, or administration of a contract if he or she has a real or
apparent conflict. A conflict of interest includes any circumstances under
which the employee, officer or agent or any member of his or her immediate
family, his or her partner, or an organization that employs or is about to
employ any of those parties, has a financial interest in or a tangible personal
benefit from a vendor considered for a contract.
      (6)   No employee, officer or agent of the city may accept gifts,
rebates, kickbacks, personal services, or in any way incur personal gain from a
vendor, or potential vendor, doing business with the city. The purchasing
officer and designees are specifically prohibited from furnishing services or
information not available to all prospective bidders or to the public, or
causing such services or information to be furnished, to any person or entity
bidding on reasonably expected to bid on a contract with the city, or providing
confidential information to persons to whom issuance of such information has

conduct purchasing activities are aware of and thoroughly understand the
ethical standards of conduct in purchasing and the prohibited practices
prescribed in this chapter.
(Ord. 2025-413, passed 5-7-2025)
§ 3.12.050 DETERMINATION OF PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The adopted budget for each department for each fiscal year shall
include funding for the necessary supplies, services, and equipment for that
department during the fiscal year. Except in cases of emergency, the City
Manager shall not issue any purchase order for supplies, services, equipment,
or any other matter unless there exists an unencumbered appropriation in the
department account against which the purchase is to be charged.
   (B)   Each department head or designee shall ensure that sufficient
documentation is submitted to the Purchasing Officer, with a request for
purchase to demonstrate compliance with these policies and procedures and to
justify the acquisition.
   (C)   Departments shall submit requests for supplies, equipment, or services
of estimated value greater than the amounts prescribed by City Council
resolution to the Purchasing Officer or designee by standard requisition
procedure. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no purchase order
shall be issued unless the prior approval of the Purchasing Officer or designee
has been obtained.
   (D)   In addition to administering these policies and procedures and only to
the extent permitted by the procurement procedures of this chapter, the
Purchasing Officer and each department head shall, in awarding contracts or
issuing purchase orders, first consider sources of supplies and equipment
located within the city or those businesses owned by local veterans. The City
Council has encouraged all residents and businesses located within the city to
shop locally at businesses located in the city. In keeping with this policy,
the Purchasing Officer shall make every attempt to purchase supplies and
equipment from city businesses in accordance with this chapter. The Purchasing
Officer shall maintain a list of city vendors offering the types of supplies
and equipment used by the city and shall circulate this list to all city
departments. The Purchasing Officer or City Council may give preference to
local businesses or local veteran-owned businesses when awarding any contract
or issuing any purchase order when the proposal/bid meets any of the following
criteria to the extent allowed by law:
      (1)   The difference between proposal/bid from local bidders or local
veteran-owned businesses and those outside the city is less than 2.5% for local
businesses or 5% for local veteran-owned businesses of the price the city would
receive from other non-local bidders or non-local veterans.
      (2)   The local business or locally-owned veteran business will be able
to provide goods which are equal in quality and meet all bid specifications of
the city and of other competing proposers/bidders.
      (3)   A reasonable condition of the contract performance is expeditious
delivery of goods and it is reasonably believed that the local business or the
veteran-owned business will be able to provide its goods more expeditiously
than a business located outside the city.
      (4)   Any other reason that would factually justify selection of a local
business or local veteran-owned business based upon criteria that do not
illegally discriminate against outside businesses.
      (5)   This division (D) shall not apply to any public project required by
California law to be publicly bid and let to the lowest responsible responsive
bidder.
   (E)   The Purchasing Officer or designee may refer any procurement to the
City Council for review and approval.

purchases shall be awarded to the lowest responsive responsible vendor,
consistent with the quality, quantity and delivery requirements. The lowest
responsive responsible bidder shall be determined by such factors as
reputation, ability, references, quality of supplies and equipment, and price.

   Contracts for public projects shall be awarded consistent with, and pursuant
to, the procedures set forth in the CUPCCAA, and the bidding procedures in §§
3.12.070 and

below:
   (A)   Open market purchases and contracts/small procurements. The City
Manager or designee may award written contracts for public works projects with
a value equivalent or less to the amounts pursuant to open market purchase
limit set forth in Cal. Public Contract Code § 22032(a) as the same may be
legislatively adjusted from time to time. Such work may be performed by city
employees, or by force account, negotiated contract, or purchase order. All
requirements of state law otherwise applicable to public works projects
governed by this division shall apply to such projects.
   (B)   Informal solicitation contracts. The City Manager or designee may use
the procedure set forth in this division for public project contract awards
with a value equivalent to or less than the amounts pursuant to Cal. Public
Contract Code § 22032(b).
      (1)   The city may maintain a list of all qualified contractors,
identified according to categories of work. The criteria for development and
maintenance of the contractors list shall be as determined by the California
Uniform Construction Cost Accounting Commission.
      (2)   Not less than ten calendar days before bids will be due, the City
Manager or his or her designee shall issue a bid invitation notice by mail,
fax, or email to all qualified contractors on the list for the category of work
being solicited or to all trade journals specified pursuant to Cal. Public
Contract Code § 22036, or both, unless the product or service is proprietary.
The notice shall describe the project in general terms and how to obtain more
detailed information about the project and shall state the time and place for
submission of bids.
      (3)   All received bids that are timely shall be evaluated by the city
for responsiveness and responsibility.
      (4)   The City Council may award the contract to the lowest responsive
and responsible bidder or shall reject all bids. If all bids are rejected, then
the City Council may cancel the procurement, or the City Manager may re-bid the
project with or without revisions.
      (5)   If all offers received are in excess of the public works project
informal solicitation limit specified in Cal. Public Contract Code § 22032, as
the same may be amended, then, by adoption of a resolution by four-fifths vote,
and upon determining that the city's cost estimate was reasonable, the City
Council may award the contract to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder
in an amount up to the limits specified in Cal. Public Contract Code § 22034,
as the same may be legislatively adjusted from time to time.
   (C)   Formally bid contracts. The City Manager or designee shall use the
formal solicitation procedure set forth in the CUPCCAA for award of public
works project contracts that exceed the limits specified in Cal. Public
Contract Code § 22032(c) as the same may be legislatively adjusted from time to
time. See Cal. Public Contract Code §§ 22037, 22038, and 22039.
   (D)   Public works split. A public project may not be split into separate
work orders or projects to avoid bidding requirements.
   (E)   Award and execution. The City Manager or designee is authorized to
award and enter into contracts pursuant to divisions (A) and (B) of this
section, provided there exists an unencumbered appropriation in the fund
account against which the expense is to be charged. Except as set forth in
division (A) of this section, all public project contracts shall be
memorialized by both a written contract and a purchase order. Any such purchase
order may be executed by the purchasing officer or designee as applicable. All
other public project contracts shall be awarded by the City Council and may be
executed by the Mayor or City Manager or designee.
   (F)   Administration. Public project contract administration is the
responsibility of the Public Works/Engineering, Community Services or Managing
Department for the specific project.
   (G)   Delegation of design approval authority. The City Manager, designee,
or the Director of Public Works/Engineering is authorized to approve plans or
designs for purposes of design immunity pursuant to Cal. Government Code §
830.6 for all public projects approved by the City Manager or designee. Nothing
in this section is intended to, nor will it, preclude the City Council from
separately or additionally approving plans or designs for purposes of design
immunity pursuant to Cal. Government Code § 830.6.
   (H)   Emergency procurements. In cases of emergency when repair or
replacements are necessary, the city may proceed in compliance with Cal. Public
Contract Code § 22035, or any successor statute.
   (I)   Design-build procurements. Except as otherwise set forth in this
section, the provisions of Cal. Public Contract Code §§ 22160 et seq. and §§
21185 et seq., authorizing cities to utilize design-build procurement and

hereby adopted and incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.
Design-build and progressive design-build contracts may only be used for public
works projects valued equivalent or in excess of the threshold limits pursuant
to Cal. Public Contract Code §§ 22160 et seq. and §§ 21185 et seq., as
applicable, which amounts may be legislatively adjusted from time to time.
Utilization of design-build procurement must be approved by the City Manager

§ 3.12.120 BEST VALUE PURCHASING.
   As an alternative to the competitive process set forth in §§
3.12.070 and
3.12.080 for purchase of supplies, materials, furnishings, equipment, vehicles,
rolling stock, general services and other items when design, performance,
aesthetics and similar factors preclude award of a contract solely on the basis
of lowest responsive responsible bid, and with the exception of the public
projects, which are subject to Cal. Public Contract Code bidding requirements,
the city may utilize a best-value purchasing process. BEST VALUE means a
procurement process based on objective criteria for evaluating the bids with
the resulting selection representing the best combination of price, quality,
suitability and other factors as set forth in the solicitation for bids. Such a
process may be utilized for the purchase of supplies, materials, furnishings,
equipment, vehicles, general/maintenance services, rolling stock and other
items if it meets the following criteria:
   (A)   It is in the best interest of the city;
   (B)   It is to the city's economic advantage; and
   (C)   It was competitively awarded using a process that complies with the
policies, rules and regulations adopted and approved by the Purchasing Officer
or designee.

been determined by the Purchasing Officer that three bids cannot be obtained.

   (A)   Contracts awarded for professional services shall be awarded by the
City Council or Purchasing Officer on the basis of the demonstrated competence
of the consultant, on the consultant's professional qualifications necessary
for the satisfactory performance of the services required, and on the fairness
and reasonableness of the cost of the services to the city, and shall not be
awarded solely on the basis of cost. The competitive formal bidding
requirements set forth in §
3.12.080 are not applicable to the procurement of professional services. The
professional services are classified into several categories based on their
size. The dollar thresholds for these categories will be listed and prescribed
by a City Council resolution.

criteria of this chapter, pertinent resolution(s) and policies and subject to
approval as to form by the City Attorney. Where the amount of any such contract

professional services agreements and subsequent amendments between the city and
the approved environmental firms to provide on-call environmental and planning

established policy. There is no fiscal impact on the city as all associated
costs are recoverable by developers.

§ 3.12.150 AMENDMENTS AND CHANGE ORDERS.
   Following the award of a contract or issuance of a purchase order, the
contract or purchase order may be amended by the issuance of a contract
amendment or change order, provided the change is reasonably related to the
scope of the original contract. The purchasing officer or designee will
maintain control relative to the scoping, estimating and negotiating of the
proposed change(s) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) will certify the
availability of funds for the proposed change in the event that the amendment
or change order increases the contract cost. On a quarterly basis, a report
will be submitted to the City Council outlining all contract amendments and/or
change orders that have been issued to contracts governed by this chapter
during the reporting period. The Purchasing Officer or designee shall authorize
amendments or change orders if the aggregate cost is within the prescribed
thresholds designated by City Council resolution. Any amendment or change order
in an amount greater than those amounts prescribed by resolution shall be
approved by the approval authority for the aggregate cost of the contract as-
amended. Any time extension of the performance deadline up to the number of
days prescribed by the City Council resolution may be approved by the
Purchasing Officer. Amendments or change orders where the total contract
amount, amendments or change orders, including the amendment or change order in
consideration, remain below the City Manager signature authority will be
authorized to be executed by the Purchasing Officer. Any time extension of a
performance deadline that exceeds those limits prescribed by resolution shall
be approved by the City Council. If a proposed contract modification, change
order or request for extra work exceeds the limitations imposed upon the
purchasing officer by this section or by resolution, and any extended delay in
obtaining City Council approval is reasonably determined to subject the city to
liability for damages incurred by a contractor, or to jeopardize the public
health, welfare or safety, or to otherwise result in potential detriment to the
city, then the Purchasing Officer or designee shall have authority to exceed
the dollar amounts or percentage limitations specified herein, and obtain
approval by ratification from the City Council. All contract modifications
shall be subject to approval as to form by the City Attorney.

§ 3.12.170 EMERGENCY PROCUREMENT.
   (A)   While the need for emergency purchases is recognized, the practice

following circumstances:
      (1)   A great public calamity.
      (2)   An immediate need to prepare for national or local defense,

protect the public health welfare, safety, property or personal/confidential
information.
      (4)   A department operation directly affecting the public health,
welfare, safety, the property or personal/confidential information, is so
severely impacted that personal injury or property destruction appears to be
imminent and probable unless goods, services, or construction designed to
mitigate the risks thereof are procured immediately.
      (5)   A department is involved in a city project, which is of such nature
that the needs for particular goods, services, or construction can only be
ascertained as the project progresses and, when ascertained, must be satisfied
immediately for the protection of public health, welfare, safety, property or
personal/confidential information.
   (B)   Emergency purchases may be initiated by a department director or his
or her authorized representative by contacting the Chief Financial Officer or
designee providing the nature of the emergency. If approved, the Chief
Financial Officer or designee shall authorize the procurement and cause an
emergency purchase order to be issued as soon as possible. A purchase
requisition must be prepared and submitted by the respective department no
later than the following business day.
   (C)   Emergency purchases exceeding $50,000 require approval by ratification
of the City Council.
   (D)   This section shall not authorize emergency purchases for public
projects which are not authorized by the Cal. Public Contract Code.

§ 3.12.190 DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS PERSONAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   The head of any city department may declare supplies or equipment
(collectively "personal property") held by the department surplus. The
declaration shall be in writing and the written declaration shall be delivered
to the Chief Financial Officer, who shall maintain a written inventory of
surplus supplies and equipment for circulation to and review by City Manager
and each department. If any department has use for the personal property, the
department head may request reassignment of the personal property from the City
Manager. The City Manager shall have the authority to assign the personal
property to the department best able to make use of the personal property. If
no department head makes a request for use of the personal property after the
inventory report has been circulated for one month or reasonable time
determined by the City Manager, the personal property shall be deemed surplus.
   (B)   The City Manager shall have the authority to dispose of surplus
supplies or equipment by auction or sale or otherwise after receiving bids or
proposals which, in his or her judgment, provide the best return to the city.
The following are the types of sale or auctions:
      (1)   Sale on the open market. The City Manager shall cause to be
published at least three days before the sale, in a locally adjudicated
newspaper or newspaper circulated in the city, and by posting on any city
website, a notice of sale setting forth a general description of the personal
property to be sold, and the day, time and location of the sale. The terms of
all sales shall be cash in the amount of the full purchase price.
      (2)   Sale by sealed bid or auction.As an alternative to the sale on the
open market, the City Manager may, when, in his or her judgment, it is in the
best interest of the city, sell surplus personal property by means of sealed
bid or public auction. In the case of sale by sealed bid or public auction, the
City Manager shall cause to be published at least three days before the sale,
in a locally adjudicated newspaper, and by posting on any city website, a
notice setting forth a general description of the surplus personal property to
be sold, and the day, time and location of the sale. The terms of all sales
shall be cash in the amount of the full purchase price.
         (a)   In conducting an auction, the City Manager may contract with a
professional auctioneer and allow a flat fee, hourly fee or percentage of the
amount of the sale to be paid based upon that which is the common and customary
method and rate for the auctioneering services.
         (b)   A receipt or other proof of disposal from the sale, the
contracted auctioneer, licensed scrap dealer, individual buyer, and the like is
required and is to be forwarded to the Finance Department. The city will return
proceeds of the sale to the appropriate revenue fund.
         (c)   All surplus property is for sale "as is" and "where is," with no
warranty, guarantee, or representation of any kind, express or implied, as to
the condition, utility or usability of the property offered for sale.
      (3)   Selling for scrap. Surplus property may be sold as scrap if it is
deemed that the value of the raw material exceeds the value of the property as
a whole.
      (4)   Negotiated sale. Surplus property may be sold outright if it is
determined that only one known buyer is available or interested in acquiring
the property. Advertisement of the sale must be published in a newspaper for at
least two weeks prior to the negotiated sale to ensure no other interested
buyers are available.
   (C)   The City Manager may, when in his or her judgment, sale or auction of
surplus personal property is infeasible or will result in minimal return to the
city, authorize that the surplus personal property be donated to any other
governmental organization (including those outside the United States) or non-
profit group or corporation exempt from federal taxes pursuant to Internal
Revenue Code § 501(c)(3) located within or serving the city.
   (D)   Personal property declared as surplus may be offered as a trade-in for
credit toward the acquisition of new property.
   (E)   When the cost of locating a buyer exceeds the estimated sales price of
surplus personal property, the personal property may be recycled, destroyed, or
disposed of as junk.
   (F)   K-9 asset surplus may not be disposed of pursuant to this section.
Disposition of K-9 asset surplus shall be governed by an administrative policy
established and approved by the City Manager and Chief of Police or their
respective designees,
   (G)   For the avoidance of doubt, this section applies to personal property
matters only, and not the dispositions of real property.

administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the state’s sales and use taxes; and

manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Cal.

§ 3.26.030 PURPOSE.
   This chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes, and
directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those
purposes:
   (A)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the
provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with § 7251) of Division 2 of the Cal.
Revenue and Taxation Code and § 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which
authorizes the city to adopt this tax ordinance which shall be operative if a
majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition
of the tax at an election called for that purpose;
   (B)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates
provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of
California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the
requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Cal.
Revenue and Taxation Code;
   (C)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a
tax and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by
the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as
practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing
statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of
Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use
Taxes;
   (D)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Cal. Revenue
and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use
taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons
subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2016-199, passed 11-8-2016)
§ 3.26.040 CONTRACT WITH STATE.

(Ord. 2008-02, passed 10-1-2008)
§ 3.28.020 DEFINITIONS.
   The following words and phrases shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be
defined as follows, unless it is clearly apparent from the context that another
meaning is intended.
   HOTEL. Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or
intended or designed for use or occupancy by transients, including, but not
limited to, dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel,
inn, tourist home or house, motel, public campsite or recreational vehicle
site, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment
house, time-share project or facility offered for public use, dormitory, public
or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed located, or other
similar structure or portion thereof, duplex, triplex, single-family dwelling
units except any private dwelling house or other individually owned single-
family dwelling house unit rented only occasionally (infrequently) and
incidentally to the normal occupancy by the owner or his or her family;
provided that the burden of establishing that the housing or facility is a
HOTEL, as defined herein, shall be upon the owner or operator thereof who shall
file with the Tax Administrator the information as the Tax Administrator may
require, to establish and maintain that status.
   OCCUPANCY. The use or possession, or the right or entitlement to the use or
possession, of any hotel, room, rooms or any portion thereof offered for rent
to be used or occupied for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes regardless of
the purpose for which the rooms are rented or provided.
   OPERATOR. The person who is proprietor of the hotel whether in the capacity
of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or in any other
capacity. Where the OPERATOR performs his, her or its functions through a
managing agent of any type or character, the managing agent shall also be
deemed an OPERATOR for the purpose of this chapter, and shall have jointly and
severally the same duties and liabilities as the principal. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall,
however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   PERSON. Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association,
social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate,
trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or
combination acting as a unit.
   RENT. The amount of the consideration charged or chargeable to the tenant or
person entitled to occupancy, for the occupancy of space, valued in money
whether received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including the full value
of receipts, cash, credits, property or services of any kind or nature, without
any deduction whatsoever. RENT may have been, or may be in part, payable or
paid prior to or following (in whole or in part) the occupancy to which it is
attributable, and may have been paid in whole or in part in advance on a long-
term basis, such as in a time-share project or similar arrangement. It is not
the intent of this definition to make the operator liable for the tax on
uncollected rent. However, uncollected rent must be reported.
   TAX ADMINISTRATOR. The City Manager or his or her designated agent, whether
a city employee or county officer or employee.
   TRANSIENT. Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by
reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement of
whatever nature, for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting
portions of calendar days as full days. Any person so occupying space in a
hotel shall be deemed to be a TRANSIENT if his or her actual total period of
occupancy does not exceed 30 days, unless there is a written agreement between
the operator and occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. Unless
days of occupancy or entitlement to occupancy by one person are consecutive

entitlement to occupancy shall not be counted when determining whether a period
exceeds the stated 30 calendar days.

§ 3.28.030 TAX IMPOSED.
   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to,
and shall pay a tax in the amount of 10% of the rent charged by the operator or
otherwise payable by the transient. Insofar as the transient is concerned, the
tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the operator or to the city. If
the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be
paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s
ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If the tax is not paid to the hotel
operator, the Tax Administrator may require payment directly to him or her.
(Ord. 2008-02, passed 10-1-2008)
§ 3.28.040 EXEMPTIONS.
   No tax shall be imposed upon any officer or employee of a foreign government
who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international
treaty. No exemptions shall be granted, except upon written claim therefore
made under penalty of perjury at the time the rent is paid, upon a form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator. Federal, state and local officers and
employees are not exempt.

§ 3.28.050 OPERATOR’S DUTIES.

extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The
amount of the tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent
charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt of payment from the
operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator; or that it will not be added to the rent;
or that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner hereinafter
provided.

§ 3.28.060 REGISTRATION.
   (A)   Within 30 days after commencing business or by 1-1-1991, every person
desiring to engage in or conduct business as operator of a hotel renting to
transients within the city shall file with the Tax Administrator an application
for a transient occupancy registration permit for each place of business. Every
application for a permit shall be made upon a form prescribed by the Tax
Administrator and shall set forth the name under which the applicant transacts
or intends to transact business, the location of his or her place of business

person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of this chapter
by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from
transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting the tax to the Tax
Administrator. This permit does not authorize any person to conduct any
unlawful business in an unlawful manner, nor operate a hotel without strictly
complying with all applicable laws, including, but not limited to, those
requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of the
city. This permit does not apply in lieu of other permits which are otherwise

§ 3.28.070 RETURNS AND REMITTANCES.

3.28.030 is:
   (A)   Due to the Tax Administrator at the time it is collected by the
operator; and
   (B)   Becomes delinquent and subject to penalties if not received by the Tax

shall contain a declaration under penalty of perjury, executed by the operator
or his or her authorized agent, that to the best of the signator’s knowledge,
the statements in the return are true, correct and complete. Amounts claimed on
the return as exempt from the tax pursuant to §§
3.28.040 and

schedule. In determining the amount of “taxable receipts” on the tax return,
“rent” as defined in §
3.28.020, may not be reduced by any business expenses including, but not
limited to, the amount of service charges deducted by credit card companies or
commissions paid to travel agencies. At the time the return is filed, the tax
fixed at the prevailing transient occupancy tax rate for the amount of rentals
charged or chargeable, which are not exempt from tax under §
3.28.040 shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator may
establish other reporting periods and may require a cash deposit or bond or a
separate trust fund bank account for any permit holder if he or she deems it
necessary in order to ensure collection of the tax and he or she may require
further information in the return. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to

required to be collected and remitted to the city including amounts based on
determination made by the Tax Administrator under §
3.28.120, within the time required, shall pay a penalty of 10% of the amount of
the tax in addition to the amount of tax, plus interest at the rate of 0.5% per
month, or fraction thereof, from the date on which the tax or the amount of tax

amount of the tax and penalties shall be added thereto in addition to the
penalties stated in §
3.28.100.
(Ord. 2008-02, passed 10-1-2008)
§ 3.28.120 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX
ADMINISTRATOR.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed
in a manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which
to base his or her estimate on the tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator
procures the facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to
base the assessment of any tax imposed by the chapter payable by any operator
who has failed or refused to collect the same and make the report and
remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and assess against the
operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case
the determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the
amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United
States mail, postage prepared, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or
her last known address. The operator may within ten days after the serving or
mailing of the notice make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for
a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing
is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if
any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable. If the application is made, the Tax Administrator
shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed
herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice
why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for the tax, interest and
penalties. At the hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why the
specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After the
hearing, the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted
and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed
herein of the determination and the amount of the tax, interest and penalties.
The amount determined to be due shall be payable within 15 days unless an
appeal is taken as provided in §
3.28.130.
(Ord. 2008-02, passed 10-1-2008)
§ 3.28.130 APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Administrator with respect
to the amount of any tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
City Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 15 days of
serving of the assessment or determination of tax and penalties, if any, due.
The City Council shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal, and the
City Clerk shall give notice in writing to the operator at his or her last
known address. The findings of the City Council shall be final and conclusive
and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for
service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately
due and payable upon the service of notice.

remittance to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve,
in the city, for a period of three years, records in a form as the Tax
Administrator may require to determine the amount of the tax. The Tax
Administrator shall have the right to inspect the records at all reasonable
times and may subpoena the records of any operator who refuses to make them
available for examination.

received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
divisions (B) and (C) below, provided a claim in writing therefore, stating
under penalty of perjury the specified grounds upon which the claim is founded,
is filed with the Tax Administrator within three years of the date of payment.
The claims shall be on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient; provided, however, that, neither a refund nor a
credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the person or credited to rent subsequently payable by the
person to the operator.
   (C)   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than
once erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a
claim in the manner provided in division (A) above, but only when the tax was

having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax
Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the
operator who collected the tax.

relating to occupancy tax prescribed and adopted under this chapter, the Tax
Administrator upon hearing, after giving the operator ten-days’ notice in
writing specifying the time and place of hearing and requiring him or her to
show cause why his or her permit or permits should not be revoked, may suspend
or revoke any one or more of the permits held by the operator. The Tax
Administrator shall give to the operator written notice of the suspension or
revocation of any of his or her permits. The notices herein required may be
served personally or by mail in the manner prescribed or service of notice of a
deficiency determination. The Tax Administrator shall not issue a new permit
after the revocation of a permit unless he or she is satisfied that the former
holder of the permit will comply with the provisions of this chapter relating
to the occupancy tax and regulations of the Tax Administrator.

after the amount is due, file for record in the office of the County Recorder a
certificate specifying the amount of tax, penalties and interest due, the name
and address as it appears on the records of the Tax Administrator of the
operator liable for the same, and the fact that the Tax Administrator has
complied with all provisions of this chapter in the determination of the amount
required to be remitted and paid. From the time of the filing for record, the
amount required to be remitted together with penalties and interest shall
constitute a lien upon all real property in the county owned by the operator or
afterwards and before the lien expires acquired by him or her. The lien has the
force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for ten years
from the time of filing of the certificate unless sooner released or otherwise
discharged.

following cases:
      (1)   Whenever the person is insolvent;

assets;
      (3)   Whenever the estate of the person in the hands of executors,
administrators or heirs is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the
deceased; and
      (4)   Whenever the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or
absent person required to pay any amount under this chapter are levied upon by
process law. This chapter does not give the city a preference over any recorded
lien which attached prior to the date when the amounts required to be paid
became a lien.
   (B)   The preference given to the city by this section shall be subordinate
to the preferences given to claims for personal services by Cal. Code of Civil
Procedure §§ 1204 and 1206.

remittance or payment of any amount herein required to be remitted or paid or
within three years after the last recording of a certificate under §
3.28.160, the Tax Administrator may issue a warrant for the enforcement of any
liens and for the collection of any amount required to be paid to the city
under this chapter. The warrant shall be directed to any sheriff, marshal or
constable and shall have the same effect as a writ of execution. The warrant

not later than 90 days after receiving the request, the Tax Administrator shall
either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his or her
address as it appears on the records of the Tax Administrator of the amount
that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of the Tax
Administrator to mail the notice will release the purchaser from any further

or until 60 days elapse after the receipt of the notice, whichever expires
earlier. All persons, upon receipt of the notice, shall advise the city
immediately of all credits, other personal property or debts in their
possession, under their control or owing by them. If the notice seeks to
prevent the transfer or other disposition of a deposit in a bank or other
credits or personal property in the possession or under the control of the
bank, to be effective the notice shall be delivered or mailed to the branch or
office of the bank at which the deposit is carried or at which the credits or
personal property is held. If any person so notified makes transfer or
disposition of the property or debts required to be held hereunder during the
effective period of the notice to withhold, he or she shall be liable to the
city to the extent of the value of the release up to the amount of the
indebtedness owed by the taxpayer to the city.

§ 4.2.010 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of California
has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local
governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City
Council of the City of Menifee does hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Menifee are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately
elevated, flood proofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect
of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights
and velocities also contributes to flood losses.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable
regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and
privately- owned land within flood prone, mudslide [i.e. mudflow] or flood
related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted
areas caused by flood damage;
      (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   (D)   Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter includes regulations to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.

to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management
regulations, and open space plans.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This chapter and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as  grading and erosion control) and other application of
police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which
provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
   FLOOD PROOFING. Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to

will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government
responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years.
Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation
are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods,
while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject.to
all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood
damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware
that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very
high flood insurance rates.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The  term

is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public
health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   HARDSHIP. The exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant
the requested variance. The City Council requires that the variance be
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of
one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.
All of these problems can be resolved through-other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:

basement (see “Basement” definition).
      (1)   An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor
that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an
area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor
provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements,
including, but not limited to:
         (a)   The flood openings standard;
         (b)   The anchoring standards;
         (c)   The construction materials and methods standards; and
         (d)   The standards for utilities.

square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating
guide recognized by the building construction industry.
         (b)   The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into
account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional
obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include
economic or other forms of external obsolescence.
      (2)   Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different
from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be

without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
   REMEDY A VIOLATION. To bring the structure or other development into
compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is
not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may
be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from
flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal
financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
   RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.

   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the
permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the

loss.”
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this
chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully

(Ord. 2011-100, passed 12-6-2011)
§ 4.2.030 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city.
   (B)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) in the "Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the City" FIS06065CV001-004
dated April 15, 1980, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM's) and
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFM's), dated April 15, 1980, and all
subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the
minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by
studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which
are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain Administrator. The study,
FIRM's and FBFM's are on file with the City Clerk in City Hall located at 29714
Haun Rd, Menifee, CA.
   (C)   Compliance. As of the effective date of this chapter, no structure or
land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions
and safeguards) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent
the City Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation, including but not limited to by the issuance of
administrative citations. Any violation of this chapter constitutes a public
nuisance which may be addressed or abated pursuant to
Chapter 11.20 hereof.
   (D)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (E)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed
in favor of the city and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers
granted under state statutes.
   (F)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter does not and shall not create liability
on the part of the city, the City Council, any officer or employee thereof, the
State of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made hereunder.
(Ord. 2011-100, passed 12-6-2011; Am. Ord. 2014-150, passed 6-18-2014)
§ 4.2.040 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The City Engineer is
hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting
or denying development permits in accord with its provisions.
   (B)   Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The
duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but
not be limited to the following:
      (1)   Permit review. Review all development permits to determine:
         (a)   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied,
including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of
existing structures;
         (b)   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;
         (c)   The site is reasonably safe from flooding;
         (d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the city; and
         (e)   All Letters of Map Revision (LOMR’s) for flood control projects
are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must
not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR’s). Approved
CLOMR’s allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land
preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.
      (2)   Development of substantial improvement and substantial damage
procedures.
         (a)   Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions About
Substantially Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for identifying
and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial
damage, to include defining “market value.”
         (b)   Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/
divisions and implemented by community staff.
      (3)   Review, use and development of other base flood data.  When base
flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with § 4.2.030. the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or
other source, in order to administer this chapter.
NOTE: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the
FEMA publication, FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate
Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood
Elevations” dated July 1995.
      (4)   Notification of other agencies.
         (a)   Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:
            1.   Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of
Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;
            2.   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency; and
            3.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
         (b)   Base Flood Elevation changes due to physical alterations:
            1.   Within six months of information becoming available or project
completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or
assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA
for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
            2.    All LOMR’s for flood control projects are approved prior to
the issuance of building permits. Building Permits must not be issued based on
Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR’s). Approved CLOMR’s allow
construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as
specified in the “start of construction” definition.
      Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those
physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and
floodplain management requirements are based on current data.
         (c)   Changes in corporate boundaries:
Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by
annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly
delineating the new corporate limits.
      (5)   Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:

         (b)   Certification required for elevation or flood proofing of
nonresidential structures;
         (c)   Certification required for wet flood proofing standard;
         (d)   Certification of elevation required for subdivisions and other
proposed development standards;
         (e)   Certification required for floodway encroachments; and
         (f)   Maintain a record of all variance actions, including
justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its
biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (6)   Map determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in division (D)
below.
      (7)   Remedial action. Take any and all actions to remedy violations of
this chapter.
      (8)   Biennial report. Complete and submit Biennial Report to FEMA.
      (9)   Planning. Assure community’s general plan is consistent with
floodplain management objectives herein.
   (C)   Development permit. A development permit shall be obtained before any
construction or other development, including manufactured homes, within any
area of special flood hazard established under this chapter application for a
development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the city. The applicant
shall provide the following minimum information:
      (1)   Plans in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing:
         (a)   Location, dimensions, and elevation of the area in question,

foundation openings as required in §
4.2.050 detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletins 1-93 and 7-93.
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
      (5)   All appropriate certifications listed in this chapter.
      (6)   To ensure that the areas below the BFE shall be used solely for
parking vehicles, limited storage, or access to the building and not be
finished for use as human habitation without first becoming fully compliant
with the floodplain management ordinance in effect at the time of conversion,
the Floodplain Administrator shall:
         (a)   Determine which applicants for new construction and/or
substantial improvements have fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that
are five feet or higher;
         (b)   Enter into a “Mon-conversion agreement for construction within
flood hazard areas” or equivalent with the County of Riverside. The agreement
shall be recorded with the Riverside County Recorder as a deed restriction. The
non-conversion agreement shall be in a form acceptable to the Floodplain
Administrator and County Counsel; and

      (2)   Construction materials and methods. All new construction and
substantial improvements of structures, including manufactured homes, shall be
constructed:
         (a)   With flood resistant materials, and utility equipment resistant
to flood damage for areas below the base flood elevation;
         (b)   Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
         (c)   With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding; and
         (d)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
      (3)   Elevation and flood proofing.
         (a)   Residential construction.
            1.   All new construction or substantial improvements of
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement:
               a.   In AE, AH, A1-30 Zones, elevated at least 2 feet above the
base flood elevation.
               b.   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to

50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall:
         (a)   Identify the Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) and Base Flood
Elevations (BFE).
         (b)   Identify the elevations of lowest floors of all proposed
structures and pads on the final plans.
         (c)   If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the
following as-built information for each structure shall be certified by a
registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor and provided as part of an
application for a Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) to the
Floodplain Administrator:
            1.   Lowest floor elevation.
            2.   Pad elevation.

      (4)   All subdivisions and other proposed development shall provide
adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes.
      (1)   All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved,
on sites located: (a) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (b)
in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (c) in an expansion to an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (d) in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has
incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood, shall: Within Zones A1-
30, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map, be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is
elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement.
      (2)   All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on
sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30,
AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map that are not subject to
the provisions of subsection (1) above will be securely fastened to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the:
         (a)   Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base
flood elevation; or
         (b)   Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than
36 inches in height above grade.
   Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor
including basement shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or
licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be
properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (E)   Standards for recreational vehicles.

         (c)   Meet the permit requirements of this chapter and the elevation
and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in division (D) above.
   (F)   Floodways.  
      (1)   Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion
potential, the following provisions apply:
         (a)   Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction,
substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be
permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the city.
         (b)   Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city shall prohibit
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and
other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is
provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any
increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         (c)   If divisions (F)(1) and (F)(2) above are satisfied, all new
construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall
comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this
section.
      (2)   To ensure that the areas below the BFE shall be used solely for
parking vehicles, limited storage, or access to the building and not be
finished for use as human habitation without first becoming fully compliant
with the floodplain management ordinance in effect at the time of conversion,
the Floodplain Administrator shall:
         (a)   Determine which applicants for new construction and/or
substantial improvements have fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that
are five feet or higher;
         (b)   Enter into a “Non-conversion agreement for construction within
flood hazard areas” or equivalent with the County of Riverside. The agreement
shall be recorded with the Riverside County Recorder as a deed restriction. The
non-conversion agreement shall be in a form acceptable to the Floodplain
Administrator and County Counsel; and
         (c)   Have the authority to inspect any area of a structure below the
base flood elevation to ensure compliance upon prior notice of at least 72
hours.
      (5)   Non-conversion of enclosed areas below the lowest floor.
         (a)   Non-conversion of enclosed areas below the lowest floor. To
ensure that the areas below the BFE shall be used solely for parking vehicles,
limited storage, or access to the building and not be finished for use as human
habitation without first becoming fully compliant with the floodplain
management ordinance in effect at the time of conversion, the Floodplain
Administrator shall:
            1.   Determine which applicants for new construction and/or
substantial improvements have fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that
are five feet or higher;
            2.   Enter into a “Non-conversion agreement for construction within
flood hazard areas” or equivalent with the County of Riverside. The agreement
shall be recorded with the Riverside County Recorder as a deed restriction. The
non-conversion agreement shall be in a form acceptable to the Floodplain
Administrator and County Counsel; and
            3.   Have the authority to inspect any area of a structure below
the base flood elevation to ensure compliance upon prior notice of at least 72
hours.
(Ord. 2011-100, passed 12-6-2011)
§ 4.2.060 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Nature of variances. The issuance of a variance is for floodplain
management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute
according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a
variance.
   (B)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are
based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece
of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with
the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
   (C)   The need to protect residents from flooding is so compelling and the
implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so
serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in
the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and
reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly
limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more
detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can
be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations
in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (D)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction,
substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a
lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of divisions (D)(4) and (D)(5) of this section have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (2)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
“historic structures” (as defined in §
4.2.020 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (3)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation
from the requirements of this ordinance. For example, in the case of variances
to an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation
the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council
believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local
ordinance.
      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
         (a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
         (b)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be
recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Riverside County
Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of
title of the affected parcel of land.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
   (E)   Appeal Board.
      (1)   In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall act
pursuant to this chapter. It shall consider all technical evaluations, all
relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and
the:
         (a)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (b)   Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
         (c)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
         (d)   Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
         (e)   Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (f)   Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         (g)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
         (h)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
         (i)   Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
         (j)   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
         (k)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a:
         (a)   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional “hardship” to the applicant; and
         (c)   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary
public expense, create a nuisance (see “public safety and nuisance”), cause
“fraud and victimization” of the public, or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
      (3)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of this section are
satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in
additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
      (4)   Upon consideration of the factors in this section and the purposes
of this chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

foreclosed properties, contact information regarding the new owner, information
regarding the condition of the property and inform owners of the maintenance
and security standards applicable to the property.
   (A)   Registration. By 7-1-2009, and thereafter within 15 calendar days of
acquisition of a foreclosed property (which date at the latest shall be that of
recording a deed evidencing the transfer), the new owner of the property or its
agent must inspect the property as set out in division (B) below and thereafter
register the property with the city as set out in this chapter. The city shall
designate a department to administer the registrations.
   (B)   Inspection; re-inspection. The owner or its agent shall perform an
inspection of the property to determine whether it meets the maintenance
standards in this chapter and the city code as a whole or whether it has been
neglected during the foreclosure process and/or abandoned. In the event the
property has not been abandoned, the owner shall re-inspect the property on a
regular basis, but not less than monthly, to determine whether its condition
complies with this chapter and the requirements of the city code.
   (C)   Registration information. The registration shall contain the following
information: address and APN for the foreclosed property; name and current
contact information for the owner, including an emergency contact number; name

of any change to keep it current.
   (D)   Registration fee. At the time of initial registration of the property,
and annually thereafter or until the property is sold to a third party, the
owner shall pay a registration fee in an amount established by City Council
resolution. The fee and registration shall be valid for the fiscal year, or
remaining portion of the fiscal year, in which the registration was initially
required. Subsequent registrations and fees are due July 1 of each year and

property sells the property to a third party, the owner shall notify the city
in writing of the sale in order to terminate the registration requirement. The
notice shall include current contact information for the purchaser.

§ 5.24.010 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The city has a substantial interest in promoting compliance with federal,
state and local laws intended to regulate tobacco sales and use; in
discouraging the illegal purchase of tobacco products by minors; in promoting
compliance with laws prohibiting sales of cigarettes and tobacco products to
minors; and, finally, and most importantly, in protecting children from being
lured into illegal activity through the misconduct of adults. It is the intent
of this chapter to encourage responsible tobacco retailing and to discourage
violations of tobacco-related laws at the local level as allowed by state,
especially those that prohibit or discourage the sale or distribution of
tobacco products to minors, but not to expand or reduce the degree to which the
acts regulated by federal or state law are criminally proscribed or to alter
the penalty provided therefore or to regulate in areas already preempted.
(Ord. 2009-65, passed - -2009)
§ 5.24.020 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and terms shall have
the following meanings.
   ARM’S LENGTH TRANSACTION. A sale in good faith and for valuable
consideration that reflects the fair market value in the open market between
two informed and willing parties, neither under any compulsion to participate
in the transaction. A sale between relatives, related companies or partners or
a sale for the primary purpose of avoiding the effect of the violations of this
chapter is presumed not to be an ARM’S LENGTH TRANSACTION.
   BUSINESS. Any sole proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, corporation
or other business entity formed for profit-making purposes, including retail
establishments where goods or services are sold, as well as professional
corporations and other entities where legal, medical, dental, engineering

and enforcement of this chapter.

An ownership interest shall be deemed to exist when a person has a  10% or
greater interest in the stock, assets or income of a business other than the

tobacco products and accessories; and in which at least 80% of the square

tobacco-related products and accessories. Operation of a hookah lounge, as
defined by city ordinance, does not fall within the definition of a RETAIL
TOBACCO STORE.
   SELF-SERVICE DISPLAY. The open display of tobacco products or tobacco
paraphernalia in a manner that is accessible to the general public without the
assistance of the retailer or employee of the retailer. A vending machine is a

cigarette of any kind), the lighting of a tobacco product, tobacco
paraphernalia or any other weed or plant (including a pipe, cigar or cigarette
of any kind).

to, cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco,

      (2)   Any product or formulation of matter containing biologically active
amounts of nicotine that is manufactured, sold, offered for sale or otherwise
distributed with the expectation that the product or matter will be introduced
into the human body, but does not include any product specifically approved by
the Federal Food and Drug Administration for use in treating nicotine or
tobacco product dependence.
   TOBACCO RETAILER. Any person who sells, offers for sale, or does or offers
to exchange for any form of consideration, tobacco, tobacco products or tobacco
paraphernalia.

paraphernalia sold, offered for sale, exchanged or offered for exchange.
(Ord. 2009-65, passed - -2009)
§ 5.24.030 TOBACCO LICENSE PREREQUISITE; APPLICATION AND RENEWAL PROCESS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person, except for a retail tobacco
store, to act as a tobacco retailer without first obtaining and maintaining a
valid tobacco retailer’s license pursuant to this chapter for each location at
which that activity is to occur and to do so without a valid tobacco retailer’s
license shall constitute a public nuisance. As used herein, LICENSE shall
include any required review of a license.
   (B)   A tobacco retailer (including the proprietor of a tobacco retailer)
without a valid tobacco retailer’s license, including, for example, a revoked
license:
      (1)   Shall keep all tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia from
public view. The public display of tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia in
violation of this provision shall constitute an “offer for sale” for the
purposes of division (C) below; and
      (2)   Shall not display any advertisement relating to tobacco products or
tobacco paraphernalia that promotes the sale or distribution of the products
from the tobacco retailer’s location or that would lead a reasonable consumer
to believe that the products can be obtained at the tobacco retailer’s
location.
   (C)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant any person
obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer’s license any status or right
other than the right to act as a tobacco retailer at the location in the city
identified on the face of the license. For example, nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to render inapplicable, supersede or apply in lieu of any
other provision of applicable law, including, without limitation, any condition
or limitation on smoking in enclosed places of employment made applicable to
business establishments by Cal. Labor Code § 6404.5.
   (D)   Applications for a tobacco retailer’s license or for an annual renewal
of that license shall be submitted to the city or its designee, utilizing a
form provided by the city or its designee, which application shall be in the
name of each proprietor proposing to conduct retail tobacco sales and shall be
signed by each proprietor or an authorized agent thereof. It is the
responsibility of each proprietor to be informed of the laws affecting the
issuance of a tobacco retailer’s license. A license that is issued in error or
on the basis of false or misleading information supplied by a proprietor shall
be revoked pursuant to §
5.24.100 hereof.
   (E)   In addition to any other penalty under this chapter, a person found to
have engaged in tobacco retailing without a valid tobacco retailers license
shall be ineligible to apply for or be issued a tobacco retailing license
according to the following.
      (1)   After a first violation for a person within any 60-month period, no
new license may issue for the person as a proprietor until 30 days have passed
from the date of last violation.
      (2)   After a second violation for a person within any 60-month period,
no new license may issue for the person as a proprietor until 90 days have
passed from the date of last violation.
      (3)   After three or more violations for a person within any 60-month
period, no new license may issue for the person as a proprietor until five
years have passed from the date of last violation.
      (4)   Each day that a person engages in tobacco retailing without a valid
tobacco retailers license shall constitute a separate violation.
   (F)   Tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia offered for sale or
exchange in violation of this chapter are subject to seizure and forfeiture.
Forfeited tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia shall be destroyed.
   (G)   All applications or renewals shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The current name, address and telephone number of each proprietor;
      (2)   The current business name, address and telephone number of the
single fixed location for which a tobacco retailer’s license is sought;
      (3)   The current name and mailing address authorized by each proprietor
to receive all license-related communications and notices; unless a different
mailing address is provided, each proprietor shall be understood to consent to
the provision of notice at the business address specified above;
      (4)   Current proof that the location for which a tobacco retailer’s
license is sought has been issued a valid state tobacco retailer’s license by
the State Board of Equalization;
      (5)   Whether or not any proprietor is a person who has been determined
to have violated this chapter or has been a proprietor at a location that has
been determined to have violated this chapter and, if so, the dates and
locations of all violations;
      (6)   For a renewal, any change in the information listed during the
prior year; and
      (7)   Other information as the city deems necessary for the
administration or enforcement of this chapter.
(Ord. 2009-65, passed - -2009)
§ 5.24.040 LICENSE ISSUANCE OR RENEWAL; STANDARDS.
   (A)   No license (including any renewal) may issue to authorize tobacco
retailing at other than a fixed location (i.e., no license shall issue for
tobacco retailing by persons on foot or from a vehicle of any kind).
   (B)   Upon the receipt of an application (including a renewal) for a tobacco
retailer’s license and the license fee therefor, the city or its designee shall
issue a license or renewal unless substantial record evidence demonstrates that
one of the following bases for denial exists:
      (1)   The application is incomplete or inaccurate;
      (2)   The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing at a
location for which a prohibition on issuing licenses is in effect pursuant to
this chapter. However, this division (B)(2) shall not constitute a basis for
denial of a license if the applicant provides the city with documentation
demonstrating that the applicant has acquired or is acquiring the location or
business in an arm’s length transaction;
      (3)   The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing for a
proprietor for which a prohibition on issuing licenses is in effect pursuant to
this chapter; and
      (4)   The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing that is
prohibited pursuant to this chapter, that is unlawful pursuant to any other
city ordinance or that is unlawful pursuant to any other local, state or
federal law.
(Ord. 2009-65, passed - -2009)
§ 5.24.050 LICENSE NON-TRANSFERABLE.
   (A)   A tobacco retailer’s license (including a renewal license) is non-
transferable. If the information required in the license application changes, a
new tobacco retailer’s license is required before the business may continue to
act as a tobacco retailer. For example, if a proprietor to whom a license has
been issued changes business location, that proprietor must apply for a new
license prior to acting as a tobacco retailer at the new location. Or, if the
business is sold, the new owner must apply for a license for that location
before acting as a tobacco retailer.
   (B)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, violations
accumulated against a location or business shall continue to be counted against
the location or business unless the location or business has been transferred
to a new proprietor and the new proprietor provides the city with documentation
demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the new proprietor has
acquired or is acquiring the location or business in an arm’s length
transaction.
(Ord. 2009-65, passed - -2009)

her tobacco retailer’s license no later than 30 days prior to expiration of the
term.
   (C)   Reinstatement after expiration. A tobacco retailer’s license that is
not timely renewed shall expire at the end of its term. To reinstate a license
that has expired due to the failure to renew, the proprietor shall submit the
renewal fee plus a reinstatement fee of 10% of the renewal fee and submit a
signed declaration stating the reason for the failure to renew the license in a
timely manner. Unless the proprietor can show that he or she has not sold any
tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia during any period that the license was
expired, the proprietor may be subject to additional penalties for violation of
this chapter.
   (D)   Fees. The fees applicable to this chapter shall be determined by
resolution of the City Council. Reinstatement fee shall be at least 10% of
renewal fee.

publicly visible location at the licensed location in a manner and size that it
may be easily read.

is locked at all times and must keep the cabinet locked when not removing
products for sale, restocking, or cleaning or maintaining the cabinet.
   (E)   Violation of tobacco-related laws. It shall be a violation of a
tobacco retailer’s license for a licensee, including his or her agent or
employee, to violate any local, state or federal tobacco-related law,
including, but not limited to, those regarding signage or those restricting the
age of purchase for any product.
(Ord. 2009-65, passed - -2009)

   (A)   Compliance with this chapter shall be monitored by the city or its
designee. Any peace officer may enforce the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Notwithstanding, neither the city nor its designee shall not enforce

by a peace officer or a code enforcement official; or

this chapter or has otherwise admitted to a violation of this chapter.
      (2)   For a first or second alleged violation within any five-year
period, and in order to avoid a hearing, the city or its designee is authorized
to enter into a settlement with the proprietor without additional consent of
the City Counsel, which settlement shall not be confidential and which shall
contain the following minimum terms:

passed from the date of the last revocation or violation, whichever is later.
   (C)   Revocation of license issued in error.
      (1)   A tobacco retailer’s license shall be revoked if the department
finds, after notice and opportunity to be heard, that one or more of the basis
for denial of a license under this chapter existed at the time application was
made or at any time before the license issued.
      (2)   The revocation shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new
application for a license.
   (D)   No contest plea. To the extent allowed by law, a plea of “no contest”

§ 5.70.010 INTENT.
   (A)   The intent of this chapter is to establish regulations for sidewalk
vendors that complies with Senate Bill 946 (Chapter 459, Statutes 2018). The
provisions of this chapter allow the city to encourage small business
activities by removing total prohibitions on portable food and merchandise
stands and certain forms of solicitation while still permitting regulation and
enforcement of unpermitted sidewalk vending activities to protect the public's
health, safety and welfare.
   (B)   The City Council hereby finds that to promote the public's health,
safety and welfare, restrictions on sidewalk vending are necessary to:
      (1)   Ensure no unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or
vehicular traffic including ingress into, or egress from, any residence, public
building, or place of business, or from the street to the sidewalk, by persons
exiting or entering parked or standing vehicles;
      (2)   Provide reasonable access for the use and maintenance of sidewalks,
pathways, poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, firefighting
apparatus, mailboxes, as well as access to locations used for public
transportation services; and
      (3)   Reduce exposure to the city for personal injury or property damage
claims and litigation.
   (C)   The City Council hereby finds that the unique characteristics of the
city require certain restrictions on sidewalk vending as follows:
      (1)   Parks. The city's parks provide recreational opportunities and
restrictions on sidewalk vending are necessary to protect the natural
resources, recreational opportunities, as well as scenic and natural character
of these parks, and the health, safety and welfare of those persons engaged in
active sports activities as well as spectators of sporting activities.
      (2)   Sidewalks. Many of the sidewalks and pathways in the city are under
seven feet wide and sidewalk vending in these areas would unreasonably
interfere with the flow of pedestrians and disrupt access for persons with
disabilities.

5.80.150   Severability
§ 5.80.010 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is as follows:
   (A)   Mobile home owners have a substantial investment in their residences
and appurtenances for which space is rented. Alternate sites for relocation of
mobile homes are difficult to find due to restrictions of age, size, or style
of mobile homes permitted in many mobile home parks, and related to the
installation of mobile homes, including permits, landscaping and site
preparation. Additionally, the cost of moving a mobile home may be substantial,
and the risk of damage in moving is significant.
   (B)   Mobile homes are often occupied by senior citizens, persons on fixed
income and persons of low or moderate income, on whom extreme rent increases
fall with particular harshness. Many mobile home owners have a substantial
portion of their net asset worth invested in their mobile homes. The continuing
possibility of unreasonable mobile home space rental increases threatens to
diminish the value of that investment.
   (C)   It is the goal of the City of Menifee's Housing Element to conserve
and improve existing affordable housing in the city, and to prohibit conversion
of mobile home spaces available for rent or mobile home parks to other uses
unless conditions exist to maintain existing affordability.
   (D)   The economic conditions and recognized housing shortage in Southern
California has the potential to detrimentally impact a substantial number of
residents in the city, and impose a particular hardship on senior citizens,
persons living on fixed incomes, and other vulnerable persons living in mobile
home parks in the city.
   (E)   It is necessary to facilitate and encourage fair bargaining between
tenants and mobile home park owners in order to achieve mutually satisfactory
agreements regarding space rent which preserve the value of a tenants' mobile
home and the value of the mobile home park itself. It is also necessary to
protect the tenants from unreasonable space rent increases while simultaneously
recognizing and providing a fair return to mobile home park owners.
   (F)   Riverside County Ordinance No. 760, as amended, enacted in 1996, and
adopted by the city in 2008 upon incorporation, has been reviewed and evaluated
and found to be inadequate for the needs and purposes of the city as reflected
in the above findings, and the city's adoption thereof is therefore repealed
with the adoption of this chapter.
   (G)   Administration of this chapter shall be under the general direction of
the Community Development Director with general oversight responsibility vested
in the City Manager.
(Ord. 2023-366, passed 3-1-2023)
§ 5.80.020 APPLICABILITY.
   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all mobile home parks located
within the city unless otherwise exempt from the provisions of this chapter.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to supersede any provision of the Cal.
Civil Code §§ 798 et seq., and as it may be amended.
(Ord. 2023-366, passed 3-1-2023)
§ 5.80.030 EXEMPTIONS.
   Pursuant to the Mobile Home Residency Law, the provisions of this chapter
shall not apply to the following:
   (A)   Rental agreements in excess of 12 months duration, entered into before
February 13, 2020 for the personal and actual residence of the tenant which
meet all of the criteria in Cal. Civil Code § 798.17(b), as the same may be
amended from time to time (Cal. Civil Code, § 798.17). However, agreements
entered into on or after February 13, 2020, including agreement or contract
renewals, even when they meet these requirements, do not qualify for this
exemption. Upon expiration of or other termination of an exempt rental
agreement pursuant to this division, this chapter shall apply unless another
exemption applies. Not withstanding the above, the above-described exemption
shall end for all rental agreements regardless of when signed, as of the date
upon which the exemption contained in Cal. Civil Code § 798.17 is repealed.
   (B)   Any newly constructed spaces or new mobile home park construction as
defined in Cal. Civil Code § 798.7, and which are exempt as provided in Cal.
Civil Code § 798.45.
   (C)   Mobile homes not being used as a person's primary residence that are
not being leased to another person (Cal. Civil Code § 798.21). Mobile homes not
being used as a person's primary residence that the tenant is otherwise
permitted to lease or rent to another person, or which are not being actively
held available for sale by the tenant, as set forth in Cal. Civil Code §
798.21.
   (D)   Any other provisions of the Mobile Home Residency Law or other
applicable law addressing exemptions, as applicable.
   (E)   Any space rent increase or other action to which this chapter would
otherwise apply, whereby two-thirds of all mobile home tenants affected by a
space rent increase or other action give their approval in writing as evidenced
by the signature of one tenant for each space or in an election called to
consider the matter with each space casting one vote. These actions include,
but are not limited to, capital improvement projects. The mobile home park
owner shall supply satisfactory proof of such approval to the Director for
verification prior to the date where such space rent increase shall become
effective.

shall be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the City Manager in an
informal manner consistent with due process of law. All parties to the hearing
may have assistance in presenting evidence or in setting forth by argument
their positions from an attorney or such other persons as may be designated by
said party. The hearing may be continued by the hearing officer from time to
time as may be reasonable and necessary. The hearing officer shall have the
authority to administer oaths and affirmations, and to render a final decision
on the merits of the application, subject to the provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   Burden of proof. The decision of the hearing officer must be supported
by the evidence submitted at the hearing. The petitioning party shall have the
burden of establishing its entitlement to the adjusted space rent increase
sought by the petition by a preponderance of the evidence. It shall be presumed
that the net operating income (NOI) produced during the base year provided a
fair return. The petitioner may rebut such presumption by presenting evidence
to the hearing officer that the base year's operating expenses were unusually
high or low, or that the NOI for that year did not provide a fair return.
   (F)   Factors for consideration. The hearing officer shall evaluate any
request for an adjusted space rent increase based upon, but not limited to, the
following factors:
      (1)   Changes in the CPI, to the extent not already encompassed in the
permissive annual increase set forth in § 5.80.080.
      (2)   The rent lawfully charged for comparable mobile home spaces in the
city.
      (3)   The length of time since the last ruling on a petition pursuant to
this section or the last increase in space rent if no previous petition has
been submitted.
      (4)   The completion of any capital improvements or rehabilitation work
related to the mobile home space or spaces identified in the petition and the
cost thereof, including materials, labor, construction interest, permit fees,
and other items the hearing officer deems appropriate.

petitioner, and the extent, if any, of reimbursement from the tenants.
      (8)   Changes in reasonable operating and maintenance expenses.
      (9)   The need for repairs caused by circumstances other than ordinary
wear and tear.
      (10)   The amount and quality of services provided by the applicant to
the affected tenant(s).
      (11)   Any existing rental agreement lawfully entered into between the
petitioner and the affected tenant(s).
      (12)   The applicability of any state law requirement on allowable space
rent increases, including but not limited to Cal. Civil Code § 1947.12, as
amended.
   (G)   Decision. The decision of the hearing officer shall be given in
writing to all parties. The findings and conclusions of the hearing officer
shall be final and there shall be no right of appeal to the City Council.
   (H)   Appeal to court. An appeal of the findings and decision of the hearing
officer may be made to a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Cal. Code
of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5 and 1094.6.
   (I)   Collection pending hearing. Following a mobile home park owners'
submission of a petition, the mobile home park owner may collect the full
amount of the adjusted space rent until the hearing officer makes a final
decision on the merits, unless otherwise agreed upon by the affected tenants
and mobile home park owner in writing. If the hearing officer denies the
petition in whole or in part, any increased space rent collected from tenants
in violation on this chapter, in an amount determined by the hearing officer,
shall be returned to the affected tenants along with the interest thereon
computed at the current legal rate of interest on a judgement. This division
does not authorize a mobile home park owner to collect retroactive increased
space rent if a petition is granted.
(Ord. 2023-366, passed 3-1-2023)
§ 5.80.100 SPACE RENT INCREASE DISPUTE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Dispute petition. In the event any tenant contends that a space rent
increase is unlawful pursuant to this chapter, the tenant may file a dispute
petition pursuant to this section with the City Manager or their designee. The
petition shall include a detailed explanation of the space rent increase, the
name(s) and mailing address(es) of the mobile home park owner(s), and all other
tenants affected by the increase as reasonably known to the petitioner. The
petition shall be accompanied by a processing deposit equal to $1 per space
subject to the chapter to cover the cost of preparing the petition for review.
Any actual cost of review in excess of the deposit shall be invoiced in advance
by the city to the petitioner and shall be paid within 30 days. Until such

   (E)   Decision. The decision of the hearing officer shall be given in
writing to all parties. The findings and conclusions of the hearing officer
shall be final and there shall be no right of appeal to the City Council. If
the hearing officer determines that a space rent increase or any portion
thereof was unlawful pursuant to this chapter, such space rent increase or
portion thereof determined to be contrary to the provisions of this chapter
which have been collected by a mobile home park owner together with the
interest thereon computed at the current legal rate of interest on a judgement
shall be returned to the affected tenant(s) by the mobile home park owner,
together with the cost of the processing fee paid to the city for filing the
dispute petition.
   (F)   Appeal to court. An appeal of the findings and decision of the hearing
officer may be made to a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Cal. Code
of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5 and 1094.6.

§ 5.80.110 UTILITY SERVICE BILLING.
   (A)   Utility billing. If a mobile home park provides in the rent, without
separate charge, utilities or similar services (including, but not limited to,
natural gas, electricity, water, sewer, trash, and/or cable television) and
converts to separate charge for such service by separate metering, separate
charge or other lawful means of transferring to the tenant the obligation for
payment for such services, the cost savings shall be passed through to tenants
by an rent increase equal to the actual cost to the park of such transferred
utility or similar service (less common area usage) based on costs for the 12-
month period prior to notice to the tenants of the change. No hearing shall be
required for utility service billing complying with this section. Where a
rental agreement does not provide otherwise, a mobile home park may charge
mobile home owners for utilities as provided in Cal. Civil Code §§ 798.40 and
798.41.
   (B)   Installation costs. The cost of installation of separate utility
meters, or similar costs shall not be considered for the purpose of separate
utility billing space rent increases under Cal. Code of Civil Procedure §
798.41, provided that this section shall not be construed to prohibit or
prevent the consideration of inclusion of such costs as an increased operating
expense for an adjusted space rent increase petition pursuant to § 5.80.090.

park owner to directly or indirectly require any tenant or tenant-to-be to sign
a rental agreement with a term in excess of 12 months as a condition of
tenancy, or as a condition of approving the replacement of an existing mobile
home.
   (B)   Duress, menace, undue influence. It shall be a violation of this
chapter for any person to perform any act of duress, menace, or undue influence
with the intent of thereby obtaining the consent of any other person to enter
into any rental agreement.

willfully and knowingly violates any of the provisions of this chapter or the
orders of the hearing officer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
   (B)   Civil damages. Any mobile home park owner who demands, accepts,
receives or retains money as space rent to which said mobile home park owner is
not entitled under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable in a civil
action to the tenant from whom such payment is demanded, accepted or retained
for damages in the sum of three times the amount by which the payment or
payments demanded, accepted or retained exceed the maximum rent which could
lawfully be demanded, accepted or retained, together with reasonable attorney's
fees and costs as determined by the court. The tenant shall bear the burden of
proving entitlement to these penalties.
   (C)   Other remedies. The hearing officer, the Director, the city, and/or
the tenants or mobile home park owners may seek relief from the appropriate
court within the jurisdiction within which the mobile home park space is

for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by decision of any court
of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions of this chapter. The City Council hereby declares that it
would have passed this chapter and each section, subsection, clause or phrase
thereof irrespective of the fact that anyone or more other sections,
subsections, clauses or phrases may be declared invalid or unconstitutional.

groundwater and to minimize fly breeding and wind induced pollutants from
stored manure. This chapter also requires all persons in the city who keep
livestock posing a risk to the environment to participate in the city's manure
collection program and pay the associated service fees or follow the self-
hauling provision set forth at §

existing environmental and water quality laws and regulations including the
City of Menifee Municipal Code (
Chapter 15.01), the municipal separate storm sewer system permit (MS4 permit),
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), and the Federal
Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1342).

(Ord. 2013-131U, passed 8-21-2013)
§ 6.20.040 BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR MANURE STORAGE AND DISPOSAL.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to store or dispose of manure except by
best management practices. Best management practices for the proper storage and
disposal of manure must eliminate or minimize the potential of runoff
containing pollutants and leaching of nutrients into groundwater or surface
waters from areas where manure accumulates or is temporarily stored, and are as
follows:
   (A)   Manure storage on private property.
      (1)   Manure shall be removed from stalls, paddocks, arenas, corrals and
other livestock keeping areas on a regular basis, i.e., daily is best but at a
minimum weekly is required.
      (2)   Manure shall be stored in containers which are approved by the city
or in a designated manure waste storage area constructed in conformance with
the minimum guidelines established in this chapter.
      (3)   Manure storage whether in a cart, dumpster bin, roll-off box or
constructed structure shall be stored at least 35 feet from the nearest
neighboring dwelling unit.
      (4)   Approved containers are those supplied by the city's franchise
hauler and include carts, two-yard bins and roll-off boxes or otherwise
approved by the Director of Public Works. All such containers shall be equipped
with working lids to minimize water accumulating within the container.
      (5)   Manure storage areas shall be constructed in such a manner as to
minimize potential runoff. No manure storage structure or container shall be
placed within ten feet of a flood control channel or open storm drain or in any
other location where it could threaten water quality. Storage areas shall be
constructed with a three-walled, fire-proof structure on a concrete base with a
roof or tarp per standards established by the Public Works Director.
      (6)   Manure runoff which discharges onto adjacent property, onto city
streets, horse trails, or into flood control channels is prohibited, and
allowing such to occur, intentionally or negligently, shall be in violation of
this chapter.
   (B)   Manure collection services.
      (1)   Persons who keep livestock shall regularly and legally dispose of
accumulated and stored manure. Manure shall be removed from properties on a
weekly basis unless an approved hauler scheduling allows for a variation.
      (2)   All persons who keep livestock shall participate in the city manure
collection program. The collection and transportation of manure from commercial
and private properties within city boundaries shall be done utilizing the city
designated franchise manure disposal contractor. However, persons who have been
issued a valid self-haul permit may privately haul their manure to an approved
designated disposal facility in lieu of the city's manure collection
contractor. In order to do so, such persons must be issued a self-haul permit
from the city's Public Works Director. Such permits shall be reviewed annually.
   (C)   Manure spreading and composting.
      (1)   Manure spreading over arenas, pastures, corrals or other livestock
areas as an alternative means of disposal is prohibited and shall be in
violation of this chapter.
      (2)   Manure composting may be permitted by issuance of a composting
permit by the Director of Public Works upon submission of an application that
demonstrates that the composting will be done in a manner acceptable to the
Director of Public Works and that will not negatively affect water quality.

(Ord. 2020-294, passed 3-18-2020)
§ 6.40.050 DIVERSION REQUIREMENTS.
   Every applicant shall make a good fair effort to divert 50% of construction
and demolition debris generated from every applicable construction, remodeling,
or demolition project from landfills by using recycling, reuse, and diversion
programs. Separate calculations and reports will be required for the
construction and demolition portions of projects that involve both activities.
(Ord. 2020-294, passed 3-18-2020)
 § 6.40.060 ISSUANCE OF A BUILDING OR DEMOLITION PERMIT.
   (A)   Submission of waste reduction and Recycling plan. Except as provided
in division (B) below, every applicant shall submit a properly completed “waste
reduction and recycling plan” as provided by the city as a requirement of the
building or demolition permit process. The plan shall be submitted as part of
the building permit application packet and shall be accompanied by a fee, as
established by resolution of the City Council, that is sufficient to cover the
city’s costs associated with reviewing and processing the plan. The waste
reduction and recycling plan shall indicate those materials to be recycled and/
or disposed of and such other project information as required by the Compliance
Official including at least all of the following:
      (1)   The estimated volume or weight of the project construction and
demolition debris to be generated, listed by each type of material;
      (2)   Volume or weight of the construction and demolition debris to be
reused, salvaged or recycled listed by each type of material;
      (3)   The estimated volume or weight of construction and demolition
debris that will be landfilled listed by each type of material;
      (4)   The facilities or service providers to be used by the applicant;
and
      (5)   The estimated date on which demolition or construction is to
commence.
   (B)   Approval of waste reduction and recycling plan.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no building
or demolition permit shall be issued for any project as defined in this chapter
unless and until the Compliance Official has approved the waste reduction and
recycling plan.
      (2)   A waste reduction and recycling plan will be approved or denied
within 15 business days after a complete permit application is filed with the
city. Any approval may include conditions reasonably necessary to meet the
standards of this chapter.
      (3)   The Compliance Official shall only approve a waste reduction and
recycling plan if he or she determines that it contains all of the information
required by this chapter and determines that the pan if followed will represent
a good faith effort by the applicant to divert at least 50% by weight of all
construction and demolition debris generated by the project. Volume
calculations converted to weight in a manner reasonably determined by the
Compliance Official may be utilized for this purpose as needed. If the
Compliance Official determines that all of the above conditions have been met,
he or she shall mark the waste reduction and recycling plan “approved”, return
a copy of the plan to the applicant, and notify the Community Development
Department that it has been approved.
   (C)   Denial of waste reduction and recycling plan. If the Compliance
Official determines that the waste reduction and recycling plan is incomplete
he or she shall return it to the applicant marked “Denied, Further Explanation
Required”. The applicant must then submit additional information before the
waste reduction and recycling plan can be reviewed and the building or
demolition permit issued.
   (D)   Evidence of subscription with franchisee. An applicant who provides
evidence to the Compliance Official that the applicant subscribes to solid
waste handling service with the franchisee shall not be required to submit a
waste reduction and recycling plan.
(Ord. 2020-294, passed 3-18-2020)
§ 6.40.070 COMPLIANCE WITH DIVERSION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   During demolition or construction, the Compliance Official may inspect
project sites to determine compliance with the waste reduction and recycling
plan. The applicant, if requested, must supply written proof of compliance with
its waste reduction and recycling plan within five business days. Failure to
comply with the waste reduction and recycling plan during construction or
demolition is a violation of this chapter, and in addition to any other penalty
and/or remedy, shall be grounds for issuance of a “stop work” order and/or
issuance of an administrative citation. Each day that the applicant fails to
comply with the requirements of this chapter constitutes a separate offense.
   (B)   Applicants shall submit proof of compliance with this chapter on a
quarterly basis during construction and/or demolition as well as at the end of
the project to demonstrate compliance with the project’s waste reduction and
recycling plan. If a project involves both demolition and construction, the
report and documentation for the demolition project must be submitted and
approved by the Compliance Official before issuance of a building permit for
the construction project. Quarterly reports shall be submitted each April 30,
July 30, October 30, and January 30 (or as determined by the Compliance
Official) and are to cover the previous three calendar months (January through
March, April through June, July through September, and October through
December). End of project reports are to be submitted at the end of the project
as a precedent to final inspection and certificate of occupancy. Proof of
compliance to be submitted with quarterly and end of project reports shall
include:
      (1)   Submittal of a completed city-provided waste reduction and
recycling report.
      (2)   Receipts from the vendor or facility which collected or received
each material showing the actual weight or volume of that material (recyclables
and solid waste). Each receipt must clearly state the project title and date.
If the receipt provides information for multiple projects, the project titles
and the amounts of material for each project must be clearly identified.
      (3)   Weight slips/count of material salvaged or reused in the project.
Each receipt must clearly state the project title and date. If the receipt
provides information for multiple projects, the project titles and the amounts
of material for each project must be clearly identified.
      (4)   Any additional information the Compliance Official reasonably
determines is needed to demonstrate compliance with the applicant’s approved
waste reduction and recycling plan.

§ 7.15.040 REMEDIES.
   (A)   Any deed of conveyance, sale, or contract to sell real property which
has been divided, or which has resulted from a division in violation of the
provisions of the Map Act or this title, is voidable at the sole option of the
grantee, buyer, or person contracting to purchase, or any heirs, personal
representative, or trustee in insolvency or bankruptcy thereof, within one year
after the date of discovery of such violation in accordance with Cal. Gov’t
Code § 66499.32(a).
   (B)   Any grantee, or successor in interest thereof, of real property which
has been divided, or which has resulted from a division in violation of the
provisions of the Map Act or this title, may, within one year of the date of
discovery of such violation, bring an action in the Superior Court of
California, County of Riverside, to recover any damages suffered by reason of
such division of property. The action may be brought against the person who so
divided the property and against any successors in interest who so divided the
property and against any successors in interest who have actual or constructive
knowledge of such division of property in accordance with Cal. Gov’t Code §
66499.32(b).
   (C)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to the conveyance of
any parcel of real property identified in a certificate of compliance, final
map, or parcel map filed by the County Recorder, from and after the date of
recording.
   (D)   The provisions of this section shall not limit or affect, in any way,
the rights of a grantee or successor in interest under any other provision of
law.
   (E)   This section does not bar any legal, equitable, or summary remedy to
which the city or other public agency, or any person, firm, or corporation may
otherwise be entitled, and the city or other public agency, or such person,
firm, or corporation may file a suit in the Superior Court to restrain or
enjoin any attempted or proposed subdivision or sale.
   (F)   The city shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to
develop any real property which has been divided or which has resulted from a
division in violation of the provisions of the Map Act or this title if it
finds that development of such real property is contrary to the public health
or the public safety. The authority to deny or approve such a permit shall
apply whether the applicant therefor was the owner of record at the time of
such violation or whether the applicant therefor is either the current owner of
record or a vendee thereof with, or without, actual or constructive knowledge
of the violation at the time of the acquisition of an interest in such real
property.
   (G)   If the city issues a permit or grants approval for the development of
any real property illegally subdivided under the provisions of division (A) of
this section, the city may impose those additional conditions which would have
been applicable to the division of the property at the time the current owner
of record acquired the property. If the property has the same owner of record
as at the time of the initial violation, the city may impose conditions
applicable to a current division of the property. If a conditional certificate
of compliance has been filed for recordation in accordance with the provisions
of
Chapter 7.45 (Certificates of Compliance), only those conditions stipulated in
that certificate shall be applicable in accordance with Cal. Gov’t Code §
66499.34.

(Ord. 2019-286, passed 11-20-2019; Am. Ord. 2019-291, passed 12-18-2019)
§ 7.20.020 TENTATIVE MAP FORM AND CONTENT.
   (A)   Before any tentative map, or request for extension of time of a
tentative map, is accepted for filing, the subdivider shall file a completed
application form on a city application designated for the specific request, pay
all applicable fees, and submit the required number of copies of the tentative
map and all supporting materials and documents to the Community Development
Director. The Director may, from time to time, amend the official application
form and the map submittal requirements. Tentative maps shall be prepared in a
size, form, and manner acceptable to the Director and shall be prepared by a
registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor. The tentative map shall be
clearly and legibly drawn using a scale not less than 100 and shall contain all
information required by the official application form.
   (B)   The Director may require other drawings, data, reports, or information
deemed necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Map Act, the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and this title.
   (C)   The applicant shall prepare a conceptual landscape master plan (CLMP)
that delineates proposed landscape improvements to include parks, paseos,
trails, open space, parkways, medians, common areas, and slopes. The CLMP shall
be prepared at a scale suitable to show in detail all proposed improvements in
conceptual form. Sections shall be included as needed to provide additional
detail.
   (D)   Except as provided in §
7.40.050(A), the subdivider shall indicate the intent to submit phased final
maps at the time of application for the tentative map.
   (E)   The subdivider should indicate the intent to request a parcel map
waiver at the time of application
for tentative map.
   (F)   Vesting tentative maps shall conform to
Chapter 7.25 (Vesting Tentative Maps) of this title.
   (G)   For tentative maps for condominium purposes, each sheet of the map
shall clearly state, at a minimum, “For Condominium Purposes”.
(Ord. 2019-286, passed 11-20-2019; Am. Ord. 2019-291, passed 12-18-2019)
§ 7.20.030 COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENERAL PLAN AND THE DEVELOPMENT CODE.
   All divisions of land pursuant to this title shall conform to the City of
Menifee General Plan and to the development standards set forth in the
Development Code for the zone in which the property to be divided is located at
the time the application for the tentative map is determined complete.
(Ord. 2019-286, passed 11-20-2019; Am. Ord. 2019-291, passed 12-18-2019)
§ 7.20.040 GEOTECHNICAL, GEOLOGIC, AND SOILS REPORT.
   (A)   Soils report. The subdivider shall provide a preliminary soils report,
based upon adequate subsurface exploration, test borings, and laboratory tests,
with application of the tentative map or parcel map. In the event the
preliminary soils report indicates the presence of collapsible or expansive
soils, liquefaction, or other soil problems, which if not corrected could
result in structural defects, a geotechnical investigation of each lot or
parcel in the subdivision shall be undertaken, and a report shall be submitted
recommending corrective action which is likely to prevent structural damage to
each structure proposed to be constructed in the area where such soils problems
exist. The subdivision or any portion thereof where such soils problems exist
may be approved if it is determined that the recommended corrective action is
likely to prevent structural damage to each structure to be constructed and
that the issuance of any building permit shall be conditioned to include this
recommended corrective action with the construction of each affected structure.
The report may be waived if, in the exercise of his or her professional
judgment, the City Engineer finds that sufficient knowledge exists as to the
qualities of the soils within the proposed subdivision.
   (B)   Geologic and geotechnical reports shall be required, with application
of the tentative map or parcel map, when a subdivision involves any of the
following:
      (1)   The subdivision is within any zone requiring special study by the
State Geologist or the City Engineer.
      (2)   The subdivision proposes to dispose surface water through the use
of dry wells or other subsurface facilities.
      (3)   The site of the subdivision contains hillside areas where the
existing gradient equals or exceeds 25%.
      (4)   The development of the subdivision requires excavation into
bedrock.
   (C)   Geotechnical, geologic, and soils reports, as required herein, shall
be prepared by an engineer or geologist based on guidelines determined by the
City Engineer, as applicable, who is authorized or licensed to practice and
prepare the reports by the State of California. Such reports shall be reviewed
and approved by the City Engineer. If public improvement plans or grading plans
are required as part of the tentative map approval process, the review and
approval of the geotechnical, geologic, or soils reports shall be required
prior to approval of public improvement plans or grading plans. The City
Engineer may waive these requirements for parcel maps at his or her discretion,
in the exercise of his or her professional judgment. The City Engineer shall
make a copy of all approved reports available to the public.

§ 7.20.050 FLOOD MANAGEMENT.
   Prior to approval of any tentative map or tentative parcel map, the
subdivider shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, that
the design of the subdivision is such that it conforms with
Chapter 4.2 (Floodplain Management for Noncoastal Communities) of the Menifee
Municipal Code. The City Engineer may require studies, mapping, easements,
design, and construction as part of the final map or parcel map processing to
ensure that this requirement is met. Unless otherwise permitted by this title,
no final map shall be recorded if additional studies, engineering design,
acquisition of easements, or construction of flood control facilities is
required for issuance of any building permit for the subdivision. The City
Engineer shall make a copy of all approved studies available to the public.
Such studies shall be prepared under the direction of a registered civil
engineer.

§ 7.20.080 TIME FRAMES FOR ACTION ON TENTATIVE MAPS.
   (A)   The approving authority shall hold a public hearing on the map, and
upon making all findings required in §
7.20.090 (Findings of Approval for Tentative Maps), shall approve or
conditionally approve the tentative map. If such findings are not made, the
approving authority shall deny the tentative map. The approving authority shall
render a decision within 50 days of certification of an environmental impact
report, adoption of a negative declaration, or a determination that the project
is exempt from CEQA, in accordance with Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 66452.1 and 66452.2.
   (B)   The time frames noted above may be extended as provided by prevailing
statutory law or court decisions.
   (C)   In the event that action on a tentative map application is not taken
in a timely manner and the application is deemed approved by operation of law,

   When any area for which a subdivision or proposed subdivision subject to a
tentative map or final map has been filed but a tentative map or final map has
not been approved, or for which a parcel map is required by this title but the
final act required to make the parcel map effective has not been taken, is
annexed to the city, the subdivider shall process all necessary applications
and revise any portion of the map that is not in conformance with the city
standards that were in effect as of the effective date of the annexation. The
subdivider shall submit the required applications and/or make the necessary
revisions within 36 months of the effective date of the annexation, prior to
expiration of the tentative map, or prior to complete and timely filing of a
final map, whichever occurs first. The city may require the subdivider to
attend a pre-application meeting with the Community Development Director to
determine the extent of any required modifications. Any tentative map that is
not brought into conformance with the city’s policies, rules, and regulations
that were in effect as of the effective date of the annexation in accordance
with the time frame specified above will be considered expired, and no final
map shall be processed by the city.

   (A)   The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall
confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance
with the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Cal. Gov’t Code §
66474.2. However, if Cal. Gov’t Code § 66474.2 is repealed, the approval or
conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to
proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances,
policies, and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is
approved or conditionally approved.
   (B)   The above notwithstanding, a permit, approval, extension, or
entitlement may be made conditional or may be denied if either of the following
are determined:
      (1)   Failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or
the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or
safety, or both.
      (2)   The condition(s) or denial is required in order to comply with

§ 7.40.060 FINAL MAP APPROVAL.
   (A)   The date the final map or parcel map is deemed filed with the City
Council shall be the date of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the City
Council following the date on which the City Clerk receives the recommendation
for map approval from the City Engineer. The City Council shall consider
approval of the subdivision improvement agreement and improvement security and

any of the items requiring City Council approval are deemed unacceptable by the
Council, the City Council shall instruct the City Engineer to secure
corrections, according to their direction.
   (B)   The City Council shall approve or disapprove the subdivision
improvement agreement, improvement security, and final map or parcel map at the
meeting at which it receives the map or at the next regular meeting following
the meeting at which it received the map. If the City Council does not approve
or disapprove the map within this time period, or any authorized extension
thereof, and the map conforms to all requirements and rulings, it shall be
deemed approved. The City Clerk shall certify or state its approval thereon.
   (C)   The City Council shall not postpone or refuse approval of a final map
or parcel map because the subdivider has failed to meet a tentative map
condition requiring construction or installation of offsite improvements on
land which neither the subdivider nor the city has sufficient title or interest

map or parcel map approval, the subdivider shall be required to enter into an
agreement with the city to complete such improvements pursuant to Cal. Gov’t
Code § 66462 upon acquisition of such title and interest by the city. Upon
entering into such agreement, the city shall acquire the subject property
interest in accordance with the provisions of Cal. Gov’t Code § 66462.5.
Failure of the subdivider to execute such an agreement shall be cause by the
City Council to refuse approval of the final map or parcel map.

statement on the statement sheet and shall, subject to the provisions of Cal.
Gov’t Code § 66464, transmit the map, or cause the City Engineer to transmit

   (B)   If, for any cause of the subdivider, the final map or parcel map is
not recorded by the Riverside County Recorder’s Office within 180 days from the
date the City Council approved the final or parcel map, then the City Council’s
approval of the final map or parcel map shall be automatically rescinded, and
all bonds or sureties will be returned to the subdivider. If the tentative map
has expired, the unit of land previously affected by the final map or parcel
map will automatically revert to its pre-map configuration. If the tentative
map has not yet expired, the tentative map will be considered in effect, except
that such action shall not alter the expiration date of the tentative map.

forth in Cal. Gov’t Code § 66451.12. If notification cannot be made at the time
of the hearing to the parcel owner in person, notification shall be made by
certified mail. The Commission shall notify the owner of its determination no
later than five working days after the conclusion of the hearing.
   (G)   An appeal of the Planning Commission’s determination to merge
continuous parcels to the City Council shall be made in accordance with the

§ 7.65.030 STREET AND LOT LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The widths, alignments, and geometric designs of streets and highways
shall conform to city standards and to the following requirements, unless
otherwise specified in state or federal standards and requirements:
      (1)   All streets, as far as practicable, shall relate to the alignment
of the existing adjacent streets or their proper projection in the general
conformity with the city’s General Plan.
      (2)   The proposed street plan shall give consideration to the future
division of adjoining and undivided property.
      (3)   All streets shall be designed to serve the proposed use of the
abutting land.
      (4)   On part-width boundary streets abutting undivided land, the
subdivider shall provide the prescribed half-width street and shall acquire
additional dedications as necessary. The minimum overall required right-of-way
shall be determined by the City Engineer based on the applicable road
classification, traffic study, safety study, or other information that is
available in making this determination.
      (5)   Additional right-of-way or easements shall be provided where
necessary to accommodate roadway slopes, drainage facilities, trails, transit
facilities, and other facilities related to land division improvements.
   (B)   Street improvements fronting a proposed development shall extend a
minimum of 12 feet past the centerline unless determined otherwise by the City
Engineer.
   (C)   Special street design.
      (1)   Design of streets shall make provisions as necessary for railroads,
parkways, grade separations, prevailing geological conditions, local drainage
facilities, hillside property, water quality, pedestrian mobility, and
equestrian trails.
      (2)   Cul-de-sacs.
         (a)   The maximum cul-de-sac length in residential, commercial, or
industrial subdivisions shall be 600 feet unless a longer cul-de-sac is
approved by the Fire Department.
         (b)   Cul-de-sacs and knuckles shall be constructed in accordance with
city standard plans and specifications. All lots fronting on a cul-de-sac, a
knuckle, or a curved street shall be designed to meet city standards.
         (c)   A cul-de-sac that does not meet the requirements of this section
shall not be constructed, unless a waiver has been granted by the City Engineer
and the Fire Department.
      (3)   Other than as provided in this section, no dead-end streets shall
be allowed. A dead-end street shall not exceed 600 feet in length and shall
only be permitted as an interim condition to facilitate phased construction of
a final map based on an approved or conditionally approved tentative map. The
Fire Department shall review and comment on all requests for dead-end streets.
      (4)   The approving authority may require greater street widths and
improvements on streets serving multifamily residential, commercial, or
industrial divisions of land.
      (5)   Where a proposed subdivision abuts or contains an existing or
proposed urban arterial or expressway, the approving authority may require
frontage streets or reverse frontage with nonaccess easements along the urban
arterial or expressway, or such other treatment as may be justified for the
protection of residential properties from the nuisance and hazard of high-
volume traffic and to preserve the function of the urban arterial or
expressway.
      (6)   Developments adjacent to existing frontage streets, as determined
by the city, shall provide full street improvements unless determined otherwise
by the City Engineer.
   (D)   Private streets may be used for only those streets serving property
within the subdivision and which access by the public is controlled by the
subdivision design by either posting or gating. Private streets may be used
with the approval and consent of the Planning Commission when the Commission
finds
that:
      (1)   There is adequate provision for their construction and continued
maintenance.
      (2)   The welfare of the occupants of the development will be adequately
served.
      (3)   The public welfare will not be impaired.
   (E)   The grades of highways, streets, and alleys shall not be less than 1%
and shall not exceed the grades established on approved city standard. The
desirable grades are between 1%and 6%. Grades of less than 1% and greater than
the maximum established by approved city standard may be approved only when
conclusive evidence shows that a lesser or steeper grade respectively is
impractical, and that no adverse effects such as excessive ponding will occur
as a result. The high cost of excavating and/or importing borrow fill material,
making the development of a particular parcel of ground uneconomical, shall not
be considered as conclusive evidence nor valid justification for a departure
from the established minimum or maximum grade.
   (F)   Street alignment.
      (1)   Curves in streets shall have as large a centerline radius as
determined by the City Engineer, with a minimum length of curve of 150 feet.
Thedesirable minimum centerline radius for residential streets is 500 feet. The
minimum centerline radius for residential streets on comparatively level
terrain shall be 300 feet and on steep hillside terrain shall be 150 feet.
      (2)   The minimum centerline radius for other types of streets
classifications shall be compatible with the street classification, anticipated
usage, speed, and shall be designed in accordance with the California
Department of Transportation Highway Design Manual.
   (G)   Intersections.
      (1)   All street intersections shall be at 90 degrees measured at the
intersection of the centerlines, unless otherwise approved by the City
Engineer.
      [FIGURE DELETED WITH ORDINANCE 2019-286]
      (2)   Street-to-street centerline offsets shall be less than five feet or
more than 200 feet, except in special design cases and as approved by the City
Engineer.
      (3)   A minimum curb return radius of 25feet shall be provided at
intersecting streets designated as general local roads or a lesser standard
unless determined otherwise by the City Engineer. A minimum curb return radius
of 35 feet shall be provided when one or both of the intersecting streets is
designated as a collector road or greater unless determined otherwise by the
City Engineer. The property line return radius shall be so set as to maintain a
uniform parkway width or provide a uniform transition into the intersecting
parkway. The property line radius shall be designed so as not to reduce the
parkway width below the city standard.
      (4)   Median openings or crossovers between opposing lanes of a divided
highway or street shall be located only at approved intersections at intervals
of not less than 500 feet unless determined otherwise by the City Engineer.
   (H)   Alleys.
      (1)   Alleys shall be required in the rear of all lots used or intended
to be used for business, commercial, or industrial uses, unless adequate off-
street parking areas and service loading and unloading areas to serve such
properties are securely reserved for such use and are shown upon the map and
approved by the city in the manner set forth in this title.
      (2)   Alleys shall be required in the rear of all lots fronting directly
on a street designated as a secondary roadway or greater unless determined
through site plan review procedure that the requirement for alleys does not
exist.
      (3)   The minimum paved width for alleys shall be 25 feet, unless
determined otherwise by the City Engineer.
      (4)   A minimum curb return radius of 15 feet shall be provided at the
alley and intersecting street.
      (5)   Where a dead-end alley is designed, an adequate turning area shall
be provided to accommodate a truck having a 35-foot turning radius. The radius
shall be such that the truck is able to turn around with only one backing
movement. This turnaround shall be eliminated only under the circumstances of a
previously adopted specific plan of record providing for the alley extension.
All turning areas shall be reviewed and approved by the Fire Department.

requirements of the Development Code and the General Plan as adopted by the
city for the particular zone district, use, and classification in which the
development is being constructed.
   (B)   Lot sizes.
      (1)   All lots shall meet the area, frontage, width, depth, and building
setback requirements of the zone district within which the lots are located,
unless otherwise permitted through the provisions of Title 9; provided,
however, that in its consideration of any land division, the approving
authority may determine that a greater than minimum lot size is necessary:
         (a)   For the proper protection of the public health, safety, and
general welfare;
         (b)   To be consistent with the general pattern established in the
vicinity;
         (c)   To maintain the value of property in the vicinity; or
         (d)   To provide sufficient pad area for buildings and usable open
space.
      (2)   When lots or parcels twice the required area or width or more are
shown on a division of land, the approving authority may require such lots or
parcels to be so established as to make practical a further division into
allowable building sites, without injury to adjoining property.
      (3)   Lot sizes and arrangement shall be compatible with lots in the
surrounding area, subject to the preceding two provisions.
   (C)   Side lot lines.
      (1)   Sidelines of lots shall be at approximately right angles to the
street lines, except where terrain or street design makes such lot lines
impractical.
      (2)   Side and rear lot lines shall be located along the top of slopes
instead of at the toe of slopes or at intermediate locations. Exceptions may be
reviewed and approved by the City Engineer or the applicable approval
authority, when not the City Engineer or Community Development Director.
   (D)   Lot frontage.
      (1)   All lots shall have frontage upon a public or private street, which
shall be open to and usable by vehicular traffic. The width of such streets
shall be determined in accordance with this title.
      (2)   Double frontage lots shall be avoided, except where essential to
provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries, or where
required by unusual or excessive topographic conditions. When double frontage
lots are permitted, access rights shall be dedicated to the city along the
street designated by the approving authority.
   (E)   Wherever practicable, subdivisions of property abutting rights-of-way
for freeways, expressways, railroads, transmission lines, and flood control
channels shall be so designed as to create lots that back up to the rights-of-
way or are separated from the rights-of-way by a street or frontage street, as
applicable.
   (F)   No lot shall be divided by a city, county, school district, or other
taxing agency boundary line.
   (G)   Blocks.
      (1)   Blocks shall not be less than 250 feet in length.
      (2)   Blocks shall not be over 1,350 feet in length, except along major
highways or where topographical conditions or previous highway or street
layouts require a different length.

land division for purposes of police and fire protection. The layout of the
tract shall be such that blocks of 35 or more homes shall have access by two or
more streets.
   (B)   Access for lots not fronting on a public street (flag lots). When a
land division is proposed to create any lot(s) other than one(s) fronting
directly on a public street or highway, access shall be provided of a width not
less than as specified below as being the minimum width necessary to serve the
maximum number of lots.
      (1)   Minimum access width per potential number of lots. Minimum access
widths shall be provided in accordance with Table 7.65.050-1.

(Ord. 2019-286, passed 11-20-2019; Am. Ord. 2019-291, passed 12-18-2019)
§ 7.75.020 APPLICABILITY.
   As a condition of approval of a final map or parcel map, the subdivider
shall dedicate land, pay a fee in-lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the
city, for neighborhood and community park or recreational purposes in
accordance with the standards herein, the General Plan, the Trails, Parks, Open
Space and Recreation Master Plan, and the formulas contained in this section.
(Ord. 2019-286, passed 11-20-2019; Am. Ord. 2019-291, passed 12-18-2019)
§ 7.75.030 GENERAL STANDARD.
   The City Council finds that the amount of existing neighborhood and
community park areas exceeds three acres per 1,000 persons residing in the
city, and that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare, and safety
require that five acres of property for each 1,000 persons residing in Menifee
be devoted to neighborhood and community park recreational purposes.
(Ord. 2019-286, passed 11-20-2019; Am. Ord. 2019-291, passed 12-18-2019)
§ 7.75.040 GENERAL DEDICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Whenever a tentative map that is subject to the provisions of this
section is submitted to the city, the developer shall consult with the Director
of Community Services to determine whether parkland, in-lieu fees, or a
combination of both shall be dedicated for parks and recreational purposes.
   (B)   The conditions of approval of a tentative map subject to the
provisions of this section shall require the dedication of land, the payment of
in-lieu fees, or a combination of both for parks and recreational purposes at
the discretion of the city pursuant to §
7.75.020 (Applicability). If the land is to be dedicated, conceptual plans for
the park improvements shall be reviewed by the Director of Community Services,
and the proposed dedication shall be identified on the tentative map as a
separate numbered lot.
   (C)   The amount and location of the property to be dedicated and/or the
amount of any fees to be paid shall be determined by the Director of Community
Services pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Whenever subsequent development occurs on property for which fees have
already been paid or land dedicated, no additional fees or dedications shall be
required except as to any additional lots or dwelling units that were not
subject to a prior fee or dedication requirement.
   (E)   If parkland is to be dedicated, park improvement plans shall be
reviewed and approved by the Director of Community Services and the City
Engineer prior to final map approval. An agreement and securities shall be
posted prior to approval of the final map to guarantee construction of the park
to city standards.
   (F)   Upon completion of the park improvements to city standards and
acceptance by the City Council, land to be dedicated shall be conveyed in fee
to the city by grant deed and accepted by resolution, if not already indicated
for dedication on the final map. Such parkland shall be free and clear of all
encumbrances except those that the city accepts in writing. An environmental
site assessment report shall be required for all park areas to determine that
the land is free from toxic or hazardous materials. The subdivider shall
provide all fees and instruments necessary to convey the land and shall include
a preliminary title report and title insurance in favor of the city in an
amount approved by the city.
   (G)   Unless otherwise specified through conditions or approval or other
agreement, whenever fees are to be paid pursuant to this chapter, the fees
shall be paid prior to recordation of the final map, or in the instance of maps
consisting of four or fewer parcels, prior to issuance of building permits, as
determined by the city. If the payment of fees is deferred to building permit,
the city shall determine whether the fees shall be paid on a pro rata basis for
each dwelling unit prior to the issuance of a building permit, or on a pro rata
basis for certain percentages of the dwelling units prior to the issuance of
building permits.
   (H)   Whenever land has been conveyed or fees paid to the city and a final
map is never recorded or, if recorded, is reverted to acreage, the city shall,
at its option, either reconvey all land dedicated to it, repay all fees paid
pursuant to this chapter without interest, allow the developer a credit for any
land dedicated or fees paid to be applied only to a new subdivision on the same
property, or make other arrangements with the subdivider.

§ 7.75.050 DETERMINATION OF LAND OR FEE.
   In considering whether the city accepts land dedication or elects to require
payment of a fee in-lieu thereof, or a combination of both, the analysis shall
consider the following:
   (A)   The minimum park size acceptable for dedication to the city as a
provision of this section shall be three usable acres, unless approved by the
Director of Community Services. Usable acreage for parklands is defined as
follows: Proposed parkland must have a maximum slope of 3% over 90% of the
total area of the park. The remaining 10% may contain slopes greater than 3% if
approved by the Director of Community Services. The proposed park must have a
length to width ratio no greater than 2:1. A minimum of two sides of the park
must abut public streets. Sewer, water, electricity, and storm drain
connections must be available at the park. The Director of Community Services
must approve any deviation from these standards.
   (B)   The natural features, access, and location of the proposed park site
within the subdivision available for dedication that are compatible with the
location of existing proposed park sites and trail ways and the compatibility
of dedication with the city’s General Plan and the Trails, Parks, Open Space
and Recreation Master Plan.
   (C)   For subdivisions containing 50 parcels or fewer, the city may allow
the subdivider to only pay fees; provided, however, that when a condominium
project, stock cooperative, or community apartment project exceeds 50 dwelling
units, the dedication of land may be required even though the number of parcels
may be fewer than 50. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from accepting the
voluntary dedication of land by a subdivider for a subdivision containing fewer
than 50 parcels if the dedication meets the other requirements of this section.
   (D)   Whenever the actual amount of land to be dedicated is less than the
amount of land required to be dedicated, the subdivider shall pay fees for the
value of any additional land that otherwise would have been required to be
dedicated.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit, or limit in
any manner, the city from determining the location and configuration of land to
be dedicated. The determination of the City Council as to whether land shall be
dedicated, or whether a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof, shall
be final and conclusive.

§ 7.75.060 FORMULA FOR DEDICATION OF LAND.
   Where a park or recreation facility has been designated and is to be located
in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and
future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall dedicate
land for a local park sufficient in size and topography that bears a reasonable
relationship to serve the present and future needs of the residents of the
subdivision. The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to
the following formula:
Average number of persons per unit x 0.005 acre = acreage of parkland required
per unit
Example for a single-family detached dwelling unit (DU): 3.12 x 0.005 = 0.0156
acres/DU
PARKLAND DEDICATION FORMULA*
Type of Dwelling Average Population per Unit
PARKLAND DEDICATION FORMULA*
Type of Dwelling                            Average Population per Unit
Single-family residential (detached garage) 3.12
Single-family residential (attached garage) 2.85
Multifamily attached (two to four units)    2.48
Multifamily attached (five or more units)   2.43
Mobilehomes                                 2.00
*Established pursuant to Cal. Govt Code § 66477(a)
 
The subdivider, in addition to the dedicated land required by this section, may
be conditioned to provide park improvements, as determined by the city. In
return for park improvements, the developer shall receive fee credits against
the overall park land dedication requirements of this section and/or the parks
and recreation component of the city’s development impact fees equal to the
cost of such improvements.
The land to be dedicated and the improvements to be made pursuant to this
section shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Community Services
and shall conform to the city’s guidelines for park dedications.
(Ord. 2019-286, passed 11-20-2019; Am. Ord. 2019-291, passed 12-18-2019)
§ 7.75.070 CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING PAYMENT OF IN-LIEU FEES.
   Whenever a fee is to be paid in lieu of the dedication of land, the
following provisions shall apply:
   (A)   The fee shall be based either on the fair market value of the land
that would otherwise be required or on a fixed in-lieu rate established by the
City Council. If no fixed in-lieu fee rate has been established, the fee shall
be determined by multiplying the number of acres of land required to be
dedicated pursuant to this section by the per acre fair market value of the
improved value of the subdivision.
   (B)   The fair market value shall be determined and agreed to by the city
and the subdivider. However, if an agreement on the fair market value cannot be
reached, the subdivider may, at his or her own expense, obtain an appraisal of
an acre of land within the subdivision based on the value of the land as a
recorded map. If the city does not accept the subdivider’s appraisal, it may
cause an appraisal to be made of the land by an MAI appraiser, for which the
subdivider pays, which appraisal shall be final and conclusive.
   (C)   Whenever fees are paid pursuant to this section, the city shall
deposit the fees into a separate account applicable to the project. Money in
the account, including accrued interest, shall be expended solely for
development of parkland or improvements related thereto or the rehabilitation
of existing park or recreational facilities within the subdivision except as
provided in Cal. Govt Code § 66477(a)(3)(B). If the final map is withdrawn or
rejected, the fees shall be returned without interest to the subdivider.
   (D)   The city shall commit the uses of the collected fees for parks or
recreational purposes to serve residents of the subdivision within five years
upon receipt of payment or within five years after the issuance of building
permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs
later. If the fees are not so committed, they shall be distributed and paid to
the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size
of their lot bears to the total area of all lots in the subdivision.
   (E)   The Director of Community Services shall report to the City Council at
least annually on income, expenditures, and status of the subdivision park
account.
(Ord. 2019-286, passed 11-20-2019; Am. Ord. 2019-291, passed 12-18-2019)
§ 7.75.080 CREDIT FOR PRIVATE PARKS AND RECREATION AREAS.
   Where private park areas for active recreational purposes are proposed
within a subdivision to be privately-owned and -maintained, the subdivider may
receive up to a 50% credit against the requirement of land dedication or
payment of in-lieu fees as follows:
   (A)   Yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open space areas required by
the Community Development Department shall not be included in the computation
of such private open space.
   (B)   Use of the private park or recreational area is restricted for park
and recreation purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor
of the future owners of the property which cannot be eliminated without the
consent of the city and which are submitted to the city prior to the approval
of the final map.
   (C)   The private park or recreation area is reasonably adaptable for use
for park and recreation purposes, taking into consideration such factors as
size, shape, topography, geology, access, and location.
   (D)   The private park and recreation facilities shall be owned by the
developer or a homeowners association composed of all property owners in the
subdivision and incorporated as a nonprofit mutual benefit organization,
operated under recorded land agreements through which each lot owner, renter,
or lessee is automatically a member, and each lot is subject to a charge for a
proportionate share of expenses for maintaining the facilities.
   (E)   Active recreational purposes shall mean, for purposes of this section:
      (1)   Park areas for active recreational pursuits, such as sports fields,
court games, swimming pools, children’s play areas, picnic areas, and open lawn
areas having a maximum 10% slope.
      (2)   Recreational buildings and facilities designed for the recreational
needs of the residents within the development.
   (F)   Active recreational uses do not include natural open space, nature
study areas, open space or buffer areas, steep slopes, riding and hiking
trails, scenic overlooks, water courses, drainage areas, or water bodies.

§ 7.75.090 EXEMPTIONS.
   This chapter shall not apply to the following land divisions:
   (A)   Commercial or industrial subdivisions.
   (B)   Subdivisions containing fewer than five parcels and not used for
residential purposes; provided, however, that a condition shall be placed on
the approval of a tentative parcel map that if a building permit is requested
for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the
parcels within four years after the map is approved, a fee may be required to
be paid by the owner of each parcel as a condition to the issuance of such
building permit.
   (C)   Condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of the
subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building which is more than
five years old when no new dwelling units are added.

§ 7.80.050 SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENT AGREEMENTS AND SECURITY.
   Pursuant to the Map Act, if any public improvement required as part of the
approval of the subdivision will not be completed and accepted in accordance
with §
7.80.060 (Completion of Improvements) prior to approval of the final map, the
subdivider, at his or her expense, shall be required to enter into a
subdivision improvement agreement with the city to complete such public
improvements in accordance with §
7.80.060 (Completion of Improvements). Performance of the agreement shall be
guaranteed by the security specified in this section.
   (A)   The form and content of subdivision improvement agreements shall be
approved by the City Attorney. The agreement shall include, but not be limited
to, the following minimum terms and conditions:
      (1)   Construction of all improvements as set forth in the approved plans
and specifications.
      (2)   The maximum period within which all improvements shall be completed
to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.
      (3)   Provisions for inspection of all improvements by the City Engineer
and payment of fees by the subdivider for the cost of such inspection and all
other incidental costs incurred by the city in enforcing the agreement.
      (4)   A provision that if the subdivider fails to complete the work
within the specified period of time, or any extended period of time that may
have lawfully been granted to the subdivider, the city may, at its option,
complete the required improvement work and the subdivider and his or her surety
shall be firmly bound, under a continuing obligation, for payment of the full
cost and expense incurred or expended by the city in completing such work,
including interest from the date of notice of the cost and expense until paid.
      (5)   A provision that, in the event of litigation occasioned by a
default of the owner or subdivider, his or her successors or assignees, the
owner or subdivider, his or her successors or assignees will pay all costs
involved, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, and that the same may be
recovered as part of a lien against the real property.
      (6)   Additional terms or provisions, as may be necessary, pertaining to
the forfeiture, collection, and disposition of improvement security upon the
failure of the contracting party to comply with the terms and provisions
thereof or with the terms and provisions of this title.
   (B)   Subdivision improvement agreements shall be valid for a period
specified in the agreement, but not to exceed two years from the effective date
of the agreement. The City Engineer may, in his or her discretion, extend the
term of the subdivision improvement agreement. The agreement shall not only
bind the present subdivider, but also his or her heirs, successors, executors,
administrators, and assignees, so that the obligation runs with the real
property. All agreements shall be executed by all those parties executing the
final map or parcel map, with all signatures acknowledged before a notary
public, and shall be transmitted by the City Clerk to the Riverside County
Recorder concurrently with the final map or parcel map. The agreement shall be

improvement securities shall be provided in one of the following forms, subject
to the approval of the City Engineer and the City Attorney:
      (1)   A bond or bonds by one or more duly authorized corporate sureties
substantially in the form prescribed in the Map Act and subject to the approval
and acceptance of the City Attorney and City Council.
      (2)   A deposit with the city of either immediately negotiable bonds or a
letter of credit.
      (3)   Any other form of security, including a lien or other security
interest in real property, which the City Engineer and the City Attorney may,
in their discretion, allow, provided they determine that it is equivalent to
the foregoing forms of security in terms of security and liquidity.
      (4)   Any written contract or document creating security interest
established pursuant to division (C)(3) of this section shall be recorded in
the Office of the County Recorder. From the time of recordation, a lien shall
attach to the real property described therein, which lien shall have the
priority of a judgment lien in the amounts specified.
   (D)   The subdivider shall provide as security to the city:
      (1)   For performance and guarantee: an amount determined by the City
Engineer equal to 100% of the total estimated cost of the improvement to be
performed, including grading monumentation. The estimated cost of improvement
shall include a 10% contingency and a 10% increase for projected inflation
computed to the estimated mid-point of construction.
      (2)   For payment: an amount determined by the City Engineer equal to 50%
of the total estimated cost of the improvement to be performed, excluding
grading and monumentation.
   (E)   Improvement security may be released in whole or in part upon the
completion and acceptance of all or part of the act or work by the City Council
or the authorized official; provided, however, such release shall not apply to
the amount of security deemed necessary by the City Engineer for the guarantee
and warranty period, nor to costs and reasonable expense fees, including
reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by the city in enforcing any improvement
agreement. The subdivider shall not be entitled to any reduction in security
until all improvements have been completed to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer.

§ 7.80.060 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Public improvements required as a condition of approval shall be
completed in accordance with this title, unless they are deferred pursuant to §
7.80.030 (Deferred Improvements). The City Engineer shall review and approve
any improvement agreement, conduct an inspection, and approve any constructed
public improvement necessary to satisfy this provision, with the City Council
providing final approval of any agreement or acceptance of any completed public
improvement.
   (B)   Once begun, public improvements for a final map, or for a parcel map

§ 7.90.010 GENERAL PROVISIONS AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Name. This chapter shall be known as the "Grading Regulations."
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is:
      (1)   To establish standards regulating the design and construction of
building sites and the development of property by grading.
      (2)   To regulate the alteration of the ground surface to protect and
preserve the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (3)   To minimize differential settlement and the slipping or sliding of
earth.
      (4)   To protect adjacent properties from damage caused by blockage or
diversion of natural runoff waters.
      (5)   To require engineering analysis of expansive soil conditions,
erosion control and drainage.
      (6)   To establish criteria for the design of footings and floor slabs
for structures proposed to be erected on parcels of land whose natural
topography has been altered.
      (7)   To establish administrative procedures for the issuance of grading
permits, the approval of plans and the inspection of grading construction.
      (8)   To provide for the enforcement of the requirements contained in
this chapter.
   (C)   Intent. It is the intent of this chapter and the erosion control
procedures contained herein to regulate grading work to protect against
potential slope and wall failure, prevent adverse impacts on the proper use and
enjoyment of property, environmentally sensitive areas, and biological and
wildlife resources within and surrounding the City of Menifee, and promote the
health, safety, and welfare of public. The procedures established by this
chapter and the conditions of approval imposed hereunder through discretionary
approvals and permits are intended to accomplish these purposes.
Notwithstanding the above, in the event the city encounters situations that
endanger any environmentally sensitive area or biological and wildlife
resource, the City Engineer/Public Works Director is authorized to take all
necessary action to protect the environment pursuant to this chapter and other
applicable ordinances and laws.
   (D)   Scope. This chapter sets forth rules and regulations to control
excavation, grading, and earthwork construction, including, but not limited to,
fills and embankments, and to establish administrative requirements for the
issuance of grading permits, the approval of plans and the inspection of
grading construction in accordance with the requirements for grading and
excavation as contained in California Building Code with deletions,
modifications, or amendments to meet local conditions.
   (E)   Applicability. The requirements of this chapter are applicable to all
excavation, fill, clearing, brushing, grubbing, grading activities, and
earthwork construction located within the City of Menifee.
   (F)   Administration and enforcement responsibility. The City Engineer/
Public Works Director shall be responsible for the administration and
enforcement of this chapter. The City Engineer/Public Works Director is
authorized to issue notices and orders that are necessary to ensure compliance
with this chapter.
   (G)   Safety precautions; stop work order.
      (1)   If at any stage of a project the City Engineer/Public Works
Director determines by inspection that further grading as authorized by a
grading permit is likely to endanger any public or private property or result
in the deposition of debris on any public way or interfere with any existing
drainage course, the City Engineer/Public Works Director may order the work
stopped by notice in writing that is personally served to any persons engaged
in doing or causing such work to be done, and any such person shall immediately
stop such work. If the persons conducting the grading operations are not
present at the site, the City Engineer/Public Works Director may post the stop
work order to the property. It is unlawful for any person to violate a stop
work order. The City Engineer/Public Works Director may authorize the work to
proceed in writing if he or she finds adequate safety precautions have been
taken or corrective measures have been incorporated in the work to avoid the
likelihood of such danger, deposition, or interference recurring.
      (2)   A stop work order that is issued pursuant to this section is
appealable; however, a timely appeal under §
7.90.010(K) (Appeals) shall not stay the order. Provided there is a timely
appeal, all work shall remain suspended until the Building Board of Appeals has
rendered its decision.
   (H)   Unpermitted work; stop work order.
      (1)   Whenever the City Engineer/Public Works Director determines
unpermitted work is occurring without all required approvals and permits, he or
she may order the work stopped by notice in writing that is personally served
on any persons engaged in doing or causing such work to be done, and any such
persons shall immediately stop such work. If the persons conducting the
unpermitted work are not present at the site, the City Engineer/Public Works
Director may post the stop work order to the property. It is unlawful for any
person to violate a stop work order. The City Engineer/Public Works Director
shall also serve a copy of the notice on the property owner(s) by first class
mail in the manner set forth in §
7.90.010(J) (Service of Notices).
      (2)   A stop work order that is issued pursuant to this section is
appealable; however, a timely appeal under §
7.90.010(K) (Appeals) shall not stay the order. Provided there is a timely
appeal, all work shall remain suspended until the Building Board of Appeals has
rendered its decision.
   (I)   Protection of adjacent property. Permittees and owners of real
property on which the grading is performed shall be responsible for the
prevention of damage to adjacent property (whether private or public). No
person shall excavate on land sufficiently close to the property line to
endanger any adjoining public street, sidewalk, alley, or other public or
private property without taking adequate measures to support and protect such
property from settling, cracking, or other damage that might result from the
proposed work. Any person performing any grading that involves imported or
exported materials shall take special precautions, as approved by the City
Engineer/Public Works Director in writing, to prevent such materials from being
deposited on adjacent properties, any public way and/or any drainage course.
   (J)   Service of notices.
      (1)   Unless otherwise set forth in this chapter, any notice that is
issued under this chapter may be served by personal delivery or by first class
mail. The date of service shall be the date it is personally delivered or
placed in a U.S. Postal Service receptacle, whichever is earlier.
      (2)   Unless the City Engineer/Public Works Director has specific
information to the contrary concerning a property owner's current address,
notices to property owners shall be sent to the mailing address that is shown
on the last equalized assessment roll of the Riverside County Assessor's
Office. Failure of any property owner to receive a properly addressed notice by
mail shall not extend any appeal period, nor shall it invalidate any actions or
proceedings that are initiated in connection with this chapter.
   (K)   Appeals.
      (1)   Right of appeal. Except as hereafter stated, permit applicants or
owners (if not the applicant) who object to decisions (including the imposition
of conditions or the suspension/revocation of a permit) or determinations made
by the City Engineer/Public Works Director pursuant to this chapter may file an
appeal on a city-approved form in the City Clerk's Office at City Hall within
ten days of the issuance of the City Engineer/Public Works Director's order,
decision, or determination. The person appealing shall concurrently tender the
required fee as established by resolution of the City Council. An untimely
appeal or the absence of the required fee shall constitute a waiver of the
right to appeal and the condition(s), order(s), decision(s), or determination
(s) shall be deemed final.
         (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, permit applicants
or owners (if not the applicant) do not have a right to appeal determinations
of the City Engineer/Public Works Director that they are violating, or failing
to comply with, this chapter.
         (b)   The City Clerk's office must receive an appeal and the required
fee in the required period in order for the appeal to be timely.
      (2)   Limitations on authority. An appeal shall be based on a claim that
the true intent of this chapter has been incorrectly interpreted with regard to
permit conditions or other provisions of this chapter, or that this chapter's
provisions do not fully apply to a project or that an equally good or better
form of work or installation is proposed. The Board does not have the authority
to interpret the administrative provisions of this chapter, nor shall the Board
have any authority to waive requirements of this chapter. The Board does not
have any authority to consider alleged violations of this chapter, except when
they are the basis of a stop work order or permit suspension or revocation.
      (3)   Reviewing authority. Appeals shall be heard by the Planning
Commission, which is established by the California Building Code as adopted by
§
8.04.030(A) of the Menifee Municipal Code. The Board shall adopt rules of
procedure for conducting its business. In the event the City Council fails to
appoint such a Board, the Planning Commission shall function as such. Decisions
of the Board are final and non-appealable to the City Council.
   (L)   Penalties for violation.
      (1)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof in a court of law, shall
be punished accordingly. Each person shall be deemed guilty of a separate
offense for every day during any portion of which any violation of any
provision of this chapter, including any physical condition created in
violation of this chapter, is continued or permitted to continue and shall be
punished as provided for in this chapter.
      (2)   Violations of this chapter constitute a public nuisance that may be
abated by the City Attorney or City Prosecutor in a civil judicial action. The
city's election of any remedy shall not preclude the exercise of the city's
other remedies as provided by law, such as administrative action, criminal
enforcement, or citation.

grading or land development without first obtaining a grading permit. No person
shall maintain land upon which grading without a permit has occurred. A
separate grading permit shall be obtained for each site. One permit may cover
both an excavation and any fill made with the excavated materials on the same
site. A grading permit does not include the construction of retaining walls or
other structures. These additional structures shall require separate permits.
No person shall conduct any grading or clearing, brushing, and grubbing in the
following areas without first obtaining a grading permit:
         (a)   Previously undisturbed land.
         (b)   Land covered by native vegetation.
         (c)   Land which has not been used for agricultural purposes for three
years immediately prior to the initiation of grading for agricultural purposes.
This section shall not prohibit routine landscape maintenance, the removal of
dead or diseased trees or shrubs or the removal of vegetation to eliminate a
potential fire hazard upon order of the Fire Marshal.
      (2)   Responsibility of landowners. No person shall stockpile, deposit,
or allow the placement or removal of earth material on or from any real
property in excess of 50 cubic yards without first obtaining a grading permit.
         (a)   Borrow site permit. A grading permit which authorizes removal of
soil from a site for use elsewhere is subject to conditions which may include,
but are not limited to, the following items: a plan prepared by a registered
civil engineer, an erosion control plan prepared by a registered civil
engineer, and a maintenance requirement plan that outlines project features
such as fencing and restoration activities. Other conditions may be
established, even after the borrow site permit has been issued, in the interest
of public health, safety, or welfare, as determined by the City Engineer/Public
Works Director.
         (b)   Stockpile permit. A grading permit authorizing temporary storage
of soil that is to be used for the future development of the stockpile site
where there is no current project for storage of soil, for current or future
sale, or for some other purpose as stated by the property owner. Each stockpile
permit shall be valid for a maximum of 12 months after issuance. If after 12
months, there has not been sufficient movement toward the development of the
site, the City Engineer/Public Works Director may require the removal of the
stockpile, unless an extension has been granted by the City Engineer/Public
Works Director to allow the stockpile to remain for an extended period. If
after 12 months, there has been sufficient movement toward development of the
site and more time is requested by the property owner, the City Engineer/Public
Works Director may grant an extension to allow the stockpile to remain for an
extended period. Requests for stockpile permits and time extensions shall be
reviewed on a project basis. Initial permit requests may be considered to be
the establishment of a business and may require review by other City
Departments. A stockpile permit is subject to all of the same requirements as a
borrow site permit.
         (c)   BMPs required. In cases where a grading permit is not required,
sediment and erosion control BMPs are still required to ensure the disturbed
area will not discharge any sediment, soil, or other material off-site.

stability. In addition, the soil engineer shall recommend alternate methods of
construction or compaction requirements necessary for surficial slope
stability.
(Ord. 2022-364, passed 11-16-2022)
§ 7.90.190 FILLS.
   (A)   Fill slopes.
      (1)   Fill slopes shall not be constructed steeper than a two to one (2:
1) horizontal to vertical slope ratio, or where the base (toe) of the fill
slope would be within 12 feet horizontally of the top of a cut slope, unless
evidence, such as a geotechnical or soils report, is submitted by the soil
engineer or the engineering geologist which indicates the stability of the
slope is adequate and the proposed slope is approved by the City Engineer/
Public Works Director.
      (2)   In special circumstances where no evidence of previous instability
exists, and when recommended in the soil engineering report and approved by the
City Engineer/Public Works Director, slopes may be constructed steeper than a
two to one (2:1) horizontal to vertical slope ratio.
      (3)   In no case shall slopes exceed those specified in any conditions of
approval for the development project for which the slope is associated.
      (4)   A slope stability analysis shall be included in all soil
engineering reports for all slopes steeper than a two to one (2:1) horizontal
to vertical slope ratio and for all slopes exceeding 20 feet in height
regardless of the slope ratio. The soil engineer shall consider slope stability
(both gross and surficial stability) and provide a written statement approving
the slope stability. In addition, the soil engineer shall recommend alternate
methods of construction or compaction requirements necessary for surficial
slope stability.
   (B)   Preparation of ground.
      (1)   No fill shall be placed on existing ground until the ground has
been cleared of weeds, debris, topsoil, undocumented fill, and other
deleterious material, and such materials have been removed from the site.
      (2)   The ground surface shall be prepared to receive fill by removing
vegetation, noncomplying fill, topsoil and other unsuitable materials and by
scarifying to provide a bond with the new fill. Where existing slopes exceed
five feet in height and/or are steeper than a five to one (5:1) horizontal to
vertical slope ratio, the ground shall be prepared by benching into sound
bedrock or other competent or formational material, as determined by the soil
engineer and approved by the City Engineer/Public Works Director. The lowermost
bench beneath the toe of a fill slope shall be a minimum of ten feet in width.
The ground surface below the toe of fill shall be prepared for sheet flow
runoff or an appropriate drainage system shall be provided. French drains may
also be required at the toe of fill slopes if determined necessary by the City
Engineer/Public Works Director.
      (3)   Where fill is to be placed over a cut slope, the bench under the
toe of the fill shall meet the approval of the soil engineer or the engineering
geologist as suitable foundation for the fill. Unsuitable soil is soil that is
not dense, firm or unyielding, that is highly fractured, or that has a high
organic content; and in the opinion of the soil engineer or the engineering
geologist, is not competent to support other soil or fill, support structures,
or satisfactorily perform the other functions for which the soil is intended.
   (C)   Fill material. Fill material shall only be placed as determined by a
geotechnical or soil engineer. Only soils material free from tree stumps,
organic matter, trash, garbage, sod, peat, and other deleterious materials
shall be permitted. Except as outlined below, no rock or similar irreducible
material with a maximum dimension greater than six inches shall be buried or
placed in fills. The City Engineer/Public Works Director may permit the
placement of larger rock in fill when the geotechnical or soil engineer
properly devises a method of placement, continuously inspects placement, and
approves the fill stability and competency.
   (D)   Compaction. All fills shall be compacted to a minimum of 90% of the
maximum density as determined by ASTM 01557, unless otherwise required by the
City Engineer/Public Works Director. Sufficient maximum density determinations
by test method ASTM 01557 shall be performed during the grading work to verify
that the maximum density curves used are representative of the material placed
throughout the fill. Field density tests shall be performed in accordance with
ASTM 01556, or equivalent, as approved by the City Engineer/Public Works
Director. At least 25% of the total tests shall be by ASTM 01557 to verify the
accuracy of the equivalent method. All such tests shall be uniformly
distributed within the fill area and/or fill slope surface area in order to
obtain representative results. The location of the field density tests shall be
determined by the soil engineer or the testing agency but shall be sufficient
in both horizontal and vertical placement to provide a representative testing
of all fill placed. Testing in areas of a critical nature or special emphasis
shall be in addition to a network of representative sampling. At least 20% of
the field density tests performed during grading shall be located within three
feet of the final slope location, and at least one density test shall be taken
in the outer 12 inches of the finished slope face for every 5,000 square feet
of slope area.
   (E)   Buttress/stabilization fills. Recommendations for buttress/
stabilization fills by the geotechnical or soil engineer shall be included in
the soil engineering report and shall set forth the soil or geologic factors
necessitating the buttress/stabilization fill; stability calculations based on
both static and pseudo-static conditions (analysis of pseudo-static loads are
not normally needed when the bedding planes are flatter than 12 degrees from
horizontal); laboratory test data upon which the calculations are based; a copy
of the approved grading plans showing the location of the buttress/
stabilization fill; a scaled section of the buttress/stabilization fill; and
recommendations with details of sub-drain requirements.
   (F)   Utility line backfill.
      (1)   Backfill for utility line trenches in the public right-of-way,
including, but not limited to, water, sewer, gas, electrical, telephone, and
cable television utility line trenches shall be compacted to meet current
applicable city standards for utility trenches. Backfill for on-site utility
line trenches that affect the stability of foundations or other structures and
are located in parking lots or areas used by the general public or are in
sloping surfaces steeper than a ten to one (10:1) horizontal to vertical ratio
and which utilize on-site material as backfill shall be compacted and tested in
accordance with this section. Alternate materials and methods for utility line
trench backfill may be used provided that the material specification and method
of placement are recommended by the soil engineer and approved by the City
Engineer/Public Works Director prior to backfilling.
      (2)   Utility line trench backfill for on-site areas other than those
stated above do not need specific placement method or compaction criteria but
shall be sufficiently compacted to prevent differential settlement. In no case
shall this division be construed to mean utility line trench backfill within
any public rights-of-way.
      (3)   The final utility line trench backfill report from the project soil
engineer shall include a statement of compliance by the soil engineer that the
tested backfill is suitable for the intended use and that all tested areas meet
the compaction requirements set forth in this section.

§ 7.90.220 DRAINAGE AND TERRACING.
   (A)   General. Unless otherwise noted on the approved plans, drainage
facilities and terracing of graded slopes shall conform to this section.
   (B)   Terraces.
      (1)   Mid-slope terraces at least six feet in width shall be established
at not more than 30-foot vertical intervals on all cut or fill slopes, except
that where only one terrace is required, it shall be at midheight. For cut or
fill slopes greater than 60 feet and up to 90 feet in vertical height, one
terrace at approximately mid-height shall be 12 feet in width. Terrace widths
and spacing for cut and fill slopes greater than 90 feet in vertical height
shall be designed by a professional engineer and approved by the City Engineer/
Public Works Director. Suitable access shall be provided to permit proper
cleaning and maintenance.
      (2)   Terrace drains shall have a minimum gradient of 5% and shall be
paved with concrete not less than three inches in thickness, or other materials
suitable to the application. Terrace drains shall have a minimum depth at the
deepest point of no less than one foot and a minimum paved width of at least
five feet and shall be designed to accommodate all runoff created by the cut or
fill slope as well as any tributary runoff which enters the terrace drain.
   (C)   Subsurface drainage. Cut and fill slopes shall be provided with
subsurface drainage as necessary for stability and as recommended by the soil
engineer or the engineering geologist.
   (D)   Stormwater discharge. All drainage facilities shall be designed to
carry stormwater runoff to the nearest practicable drainage way approved by the
City Engineer/Public Works Director and any other appropriate jurisdiction as
an acceptable and safe location to deposit such runoff. Erosion of the ground
in the area of discharge shall be prevented by installation of non-erosive down
drains, energy dissipaters or other devices approved by the City Engineer/
Public Works Director.
   (E)   Interceptor drains. Concrete interceptor drains (brow ditches) shall
be installed along the top of all cut slopes where the tributary drainage area
above the cut slope drains toward the cut slope, unless waived by the City
Engineer/Public Works Director. The slope gradient for the interceptor drain
shall be 2% minimum.
   (F)   Stormwater runoff. Stormwater runoff shall not be allowed to flow over
cut or fill slopes which are steeper than a five to one (5:1) horizontal to
vertical slope ratio. Drainage shall be provided by the following methods:
      (1)   Wherever practicable, each lot shall be graded so that stormwater
will drain from the backyard through the side yard and front yard directly to
the abutting street or toward approved drainage facilities as required by Cal.
Building Code § 1804.4 and Cal. Residential Code § R401.3. Wherever
practicable, drainage shall not be directed across other lots or over cut or
fill slopes. Cross lot drainage may be permitted provided approved by the City
Engineer/Public Works Director and drainage easements are provided.
      (2)   When the provisions in the above division (F)(2) are not
practicable, as determined by the City Engineer/Public Works Director,
stormwater shall be collected along the top of slopes or at the rear of graded
lots by means of paved gutters and/or French drains and carried to properly
sized outfall or area drains, which shall also serve as erosion control
devices. Such drainage shall not be allowed to drain across the surface of
sidewalks or parkways. Asphalt concrete may not be used for any drainage
device. Down drain ditches shall be a minimum of 18 inches deep.
      (3)   Where slopes are terraced at 30-foot intervals, drainage shall be
provided in paved ditches a minimum of 36 inches wide and 12 inches deep.
Construction of the ditches shall be as described below and shall be located on
the terraces with one side of the ditch two feet from the toe of the slope.
Where a terrace is constructed to conform to slope requirements, but is
intended to be of a temporary nature, the City Engineer/Public Works Director
may waive the drainage ditch requirements, if a satisfactory surety bond or
other means to guarantee the improvement is posted with the city.
      (4)   Down drains, interceptor drains, and terrace drains shall be
connected together to collect and transport all stormwater runoff entering the
drains. They shall be of sufficient depth, as verified by hydraulic
calculations, to allow for unimpeded flow when terraces are crossed. Down
drains, interceptor drains, and terrace drains shall be constructed of Portland
cement concrete or air blown mortar. They shall be reinforced with wire mesh
and/or other appropriate concrete reinforcement as determined by the project
engineer and approved by the City Engineer/Public Works Director. If pipe is
used for down drains to transport runoff from terrace ditches, it shall be
reinforced concrete pipe (RCP), plastic pipe (PVC) or other pipe material
approved by the City Engineer/Public Works Director. Anchor lugs or collars may
be required by the City Engineer/Public Works Director if the pipe slope is
equal to or greater than a two to one (2:1) horizontal to vertical ratio. Pipe
specifications shall be approved by the City Engineer/Public Works Director.
Special design features shall be provided for abrupt changes in direction of
terrace ditches and down drains.
      (5)   The discharge from any down drain, ditch or pipe shall be
controlled so as to prevent erosion of the adjacent grounds. Velocities shall
be reduced by means of adequately sized aprons of rock, grouted rip-rap, box-
type energy dissipaters or other materials approved by the City Engineer/Public
Works Director.
   (G)   Maintenance of drainage facilities. Where the continuous functioning
of a drainage facility is essential to the protection and use of more than one

   (A)   Except as provided in this section, it is unlawful for any person to

   (B)   It is unlawful for any person to own, harbor or keep any dog, four
months of age or older, within the City of Menifee, for a period longer than 30

in this chapter, by a veterinarian of his or her choice and such vaccination
shall be renewed in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations of the

section, in the event a dog has a short-term illness, is pregnant, or suffers
from a long-term debilitating illness which in the opinion of a veterinarian
contraindicates vaccination for rabies, such dog shall not be required to
undergo vaccination during the period of such illness or pregnancy where a
request for vaccination deferral has been approved by the Director. Such
request shall specify the duration of the requested deferral, the reason for
the requested deferral, and shall be signed by a veterinarian. The Director
shall issue a license for such dog upon approval of the request for vaccination
deferral and payment for the applicable license fee specified in subsection F
of this section. The owner or person having custody of such dog shall confine
and shall keep such dog confined, for the duration of the deferral. Within 14

the control of, in the case of a guide dog, a blind person, or in the case of a
signal dog, a deaf or hearing-impaired person, or in the case of a service dog,
a disabled person, or where such dog is in the possession and under the control
of a bona fide organization having as its primary purpose the furnishing and
training of guide dogs for the blind, signal dogs for the deaf or hearing-
impaired, or service dogs for the disabled. However this provision does not
remove the owner's responsibility to vaccinate the dogs against rabies and
attach a current license tag to the dog's collar. Whenever a person applies for
an assistance dog identification tag, the person shall sign an affidavit as
defined in California Food and Agriculture Code, section 30850(b).
   (H)   No fee shall be required for a license for any dog owned by a public
entity.

specified in this section and shall be renewed within 30 days after such period
terminates, except that where the current vaccination for the dog which is the
subject of the license shall expire prior to the expiration date of the license
being applied for, the Director may upon request of the owner or custodian of
such dog, backdate such license so that its expiration date occurs concurrent
with or prior to the expiration date of the vaccination; provided, however,
that where such backdating is performed, there shall be no reduction or
discount of the license fee applicable to the license applied for, and such
license shall be renewed within 30 days after the date of its expiration.

such dog may return the license tag to the Director, accompanied by a statement
signed by a veterinarian or a declaration signed under penalty of perjury by
the owner, indicating that such dog is dead and specifying the date of death.
In such event, the license shall be canceled and a pro-rata credit of the
license fee by full calendar quarters of the original license period remaining
after the death of the dog may be applied during said remaining period to the
license fee for another dog acquired by the same owner.
   (L)   Upon transfer of ownership of any dog validly licensed under this
chapter, the new owner shall notify the Director of such transfer within 30
days of such transfer, on a form prescribed by the Director, accompanied by a
transfer fee as set by the City Council via resolution and which may updated
from time to time.
   (M)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (A) of this section,
where a person moves into the City of Menifee from another community who owns a
dog which is currently vaccinated against rabies and for which dog a license
was issued by such other community, such license shall be deemed valid for a
period of one year from the date such person moves into the City of Menifee or
on the date of expiration of the license issued by such other community,
whichever is earlier. If an application for a license from the Director is made
more than 30 days after such license is required, the applicant shall pay, in
addition to the applicable license fee, a late fee as set by the City Council
via resolution and which may updated from time to time.
   (N)   If a valid license tag is lost or destroyed, a duplicate thereof may
be procured from the Director upon submission to the Director of a statement
signed by the owner of the dog containing the date and circumstances of such
loss or destruction and the payment of a fee as set by the City Council via
resolution and which may updated from time to time.

unauthorized license, tag, certificate or any other document or thing for the
purpose of evading the provisions of this chapter.

§ 10.04.030 CONTROL OF UNSPAYED AND UNALTERED CATS.

   (B)   The Class I Kennel, Class II Kennel, Class III Kennel, Class IV
Kennel, Sentry Dog Kennel and Cattery license fees, and late fees, shall be as

the Director, satisfies the applicable laws and regulations of the state of
California, the applicable ordinances of the city and the applicable conditions
set forth in the standards for kennels and catteries adopted by resolution of
the City Council. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the
Director or the City of Menifee Community Development Director may, in their
respective discretion, limit the numbers of dogs or cats over the age of four
months which are kept or maintained in any kennel or cattery, and such
limitation may be imposed at such time as an application for an initial kennel
or cattery license is considered or at such time as an application for renewal
of a kennel or cattery license is considered.
   (E)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Director is
authorized to enter upon and inspect the premises of any kennel or cattery
located in the city for the purpose of determining whether such kennel or
cattery is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the standards
for kennels and catteries referred to in subsection (C) of this section. As a
condition of the issuance of a kennel or cattery license, each owner and
operator of a kennel or cattery shall agree to allow such entry and inspection
and such agreement shall be made a part of the license application. Such
inspections shall be made during reasonable hours at times when the owner or
operator of the kennel or cattery is present on the kennel or cattery premises,
and with such frequency as the Director shall deem appropriate, and such
inspections may, at the discretion of the Director, be made without prior
notice to the owner or operator of the subject kennel or cattery. Willful
refusal on the part of a kennel or cattery owner or operator to allow such
inspection shall be grounds for summary denial of an application for a kennel
or cattery license or for summary suspension or revocation of a kennel or
cattery license.

      (2)   Any person convicted of a violation of this section shall be guilty
of an infraction offense and punished by a fine as set by the City Council via
resolution which may be updated from time to time. Multiple violations on the
same site shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding an amount set by the City
Council which may be updated from time to time, six months in jail, or both.
      (3)   Notwithstanding the above, a first offense may be charged and
prosecuted as a misdemeanor. Payment of any penalty herein shall not relieve
any person from the responsibility for correcting the violation.

§ 10.04.070 DENIAL, SUSPENSION, REVOCATION AND APPEAL OF KENNEL OR CATTERY
LICENSE.
   (A)   The Director may, in his or her discretion, deny any application for a
kennel or cattery license whether such application is for an original license
or renewal of a license, and may suspend or revoke any kennel or cattery
license if he or she finds that a kennel or cattery fails to meet any or all of
the standards for kennels and catteries referred to in section or under the
City of Code of Menifee or is in violation of any law of the state of
California or any provision of this chapter, any provision of any other city
ordinance or provision of a conditional use permit.
   (B)   When such denial, suspension or revocation occurs, the Director shall
prepare a written notice of such denial, suspension or revocation which shall
contain a brief statement of the reason or reasons for such denial, suspension
or revocation. The Director shall serve such notice upon the applicant or
licensee by hand-delivery or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested. Denial, suspension, or revocation shall be effective
30 days after service of such notice. Where an application for a kennel or
cattery license is denied or where a kennel or cattery license issued pursuant
to this chapter is revoked, no application for a new license for such kennel or
cattery shall be considered for a period of one year from the effective date of
such denial or revocation; provided, however, that for good cause shown the
City Council may direct that there be a lesser period of time before such
application will be considered.
   (C)   Any person whose application has been denied or whose license has not
been renewed, or whose license has been suspended or revoked, may appeal such
denial, nonrenewal, suspension or revocation by filing with the clerk of the
City Council within 15 days after notice of such denial, suspension or
revocation, a written notice of appeal briefly setting forth the reasons why
the appellant alleges such denial, nonrenewal, suspension or revocation is
improper. Within five days of the receipt by the clerk of such notice of
appeal, the clerk shall set a hearing date for the appeal and shall give
written notice of the date, time and place of such hearing to the appellant,
and such notice shall be sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested. The date of hearing shall be not less than 20 days
from the date of mailing of the notice of the date, time and place of the
hearing, and the hearing shall be conducted not later than 45 days from the
date of mailing of the notice of denial, nonrenewal, suspension or revocation;
provided, however, that at the request of the appellant, the clerk of the board
may extend the hearing date for a reasonable period beyond the aforementioned
45 day limit. The appeal shall be heard by the City Council which may affirm,
modify or reverse the denial, nonrenewal, suspension or revocation. In
conducting the hearing, the City Council shall not be limited by the technical
rules relating to evidence and witnesses, as applicable in courts of law. To be
admissible, evidence shall be of the type upon which responsible persons are
accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs.
   (D)   During the pendency of the appeal, there shall be in effect an
automatic stay of the denial, nonrenewal, suspension or revocation; provided,
however, that during the period of pendency the Director may take such action
as he or she deems appropriate under this chapter or any other provision of law
respecting the subject kennel or cattery, including but not limited to the
abatement of public nuisances, inspection of the kennel or cattery premises, or

contract provider.
      (5)   Where the violation would otherwise be an infraction, the
administrative penalty shall not exceed the maximum fine or infraction amount.

      (1)   Notice of appeal. The recipient of an administrative citation may
appeal the citation by filing a written notice of appeal with animal services.
The written notice of appeal must be filed within 20 days of the service of the
administrative citation as set forth in subsection (C) above. Failure to file a
written notice of appeal within this time period shall constitute a waiver of

Director may contract with a qualified provider to conduct the administrative
hearings or to process administrative citations.
         (c)   Conduct of the hearing. The investigating animal control officer
who issued the administrative citation shall not be required to participate in
the administrative hearing regarding the citation. The contents of the
investigating animal control officer's file shall be admitted as prima facie
evidence of the facts stated therein. The hearing officer shall not be limited
by the technical rules of evidence. If the person requesting the appeal of the
administrative citation fails to appear at the administrative hearing, the
hearing officer shall make his or her determination based on the information
contained in the notice of appeal.
         (d)   Hearing Officer's decision. The hearing officer's decision
regarding the administrative citation following the administrative hearing may
be personally delivered to the person requesting the hearing or sent by mail.
The hearing officer may allow payment of the administrative penalty in
installments, if the person provides evidence satisfactory to the hearing
officer of an inability to pay the penalty in full at one time. The hearing
officer's decision shall contain instructions for obtaining review of the
decision by the superior court.
   (F)   Review of Administrative Hearing Officer's decision. If the recipient
of an administrative citation disagrees with the administrative hearing
officer's decision upholding the issuance of the administrative citation and/or
administrative penalty amount assessed, the recipient may appeal the issuance
of the administrative citation to the Superior Court as set forth in this
section.
      (1)   Notice of appeal. Within 20 days of the delivery and mailing of the
hearing officer's decision regarding the administrative citation, the recipient
of the administrative citation may contest that decision by filing an appeal to
be heard by the Superior Court. The fee for filing the notice of appeal shall
be set by the City Council via resolution which may be updated from time to
time. The failure to file the written appeal and to pay the filing fee within
this period shall constitute a waiver of the right to an appeal and the
decision shall be deemed confirmed. A copy of the notice of appeal shall be
served in person or by first class mail upon animal services by the contestant.
      (2)   Conduct of hearing. The conduct of the appeal hearing is a
subordinate judicial duty and may be performed by traffic trial commissioners
and other subordinate judicial officials at the direction of the presiding
judge of the court. The appeal shall be heard de novo, except that the contents
of the issuing agency's file in the case shall be received into evidence. A
copy of the issued administrative citation providing notice of the violation
and imposition of the administrative penalty shall be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. The court shall request that
the issuing agency's file on the case be forwarded to the court, to be received
within 15 days of the request.
      (3)   Judgment. The court shall retain fee regardless of the outcome of
the appeal. If the court finds in favor of the contestant, the amount of the
fee shall be reimbursed to the contestant by animal services. Any deposit of
the fine or penalty shall be refunded by animal services in accordance with the
judgment of the court. If the fine or penalty has not been deposited and the
decision of the court is against the contestant, the issuing agency may proceed
to collect the penalty pursuant to the procedures set forth in this ordinance,
or in any other manner provided by law.
   (G)   Right to hearing. Any violator or property owner, or other person
having possession and control of the property, who receives a summary of costs

or her designee on his or her objections to the proposed costs in accordance
with the procedures set forth herein.

owner's objections, and shall determine the validity thereof.

the Director or his or her designee. These costs shall be recoverable in a
civil action in the name of the city, in any court of competent jurisdiction
within the County of Riverside.
   (J)   Director's decision. In determining the validity of the costs, the
Director or his or her designee shall consider whether the total costs as
charged have been fairly and accurately calculated. Factors to be considered

rate established by the city.

appealed by filing a written notice of appeal with the clerk of the board
within ten days after service by mail on the violator, property owner, or other

   (A)   The possession or maintenance of any dog, cat or other identified
animal or the allowing of any dog, cat or other, identified animal to be in
violation of this chapter, or any county ordinance or state law, is declared to
be a public nuisance. The Director and any Riverside County peace officer are
directed and empowered to abate any such public nuisance independently of any
criminal prosecution or the results thereof, by any means reasonably necessary
to accomplish the abatement including, but not limited to, the destruction of
the dog, cat or other identified animal involved, or by the imposition of
specific reasonable conditions and restrictions for the maintenance of such
dog, cat or other identified animal. Failure to comply with such conditions and
restrictions is a misdemeanor. The owner of such dog, cat or other identified
animal shall reimburse the city for all costs incurred in enforcing compliance
with the provisions of this section. The city, by and through the Animal
Services Director, may also commence and maintain such proceedings in a court
of competent jurisdiction as are appropriate under the laws and regulations of
the state for the abatement and redress of public nuisances.
   (B)   At least ten working days prior to the impoundment or abatement or
both pursuant to subsection A of this section, the owner or custodian of the
subject dog, cat, or other identified animal shall be notified by the Animal
Services Director, in writing, of the right to a hearing to determine whether
grounds exist for such impoundment or abatement or, where applicable, both. The
notice shall be served by hand-delivery or by registered or certified mail,
postage prepaid, return receipt requested. If the owner or custodian requests a
hearing prior to impoundment or abatement, no impoundment or abatement shall
take place until the conclusion of such hearing, except as provided in
subsection (C) of this section.
   (C)   When, in the opinion of the Animal Services Director, immediate
impoundment is necessary for the preservation of animal or public health,
safety or welfare, or if the subject dog, cat or other identified animal has
been impounded under any other provision of this chapter or any law or
regulation of the state of California, the pre-impoundment hearing shall be
deemed waived; provided, however, that the owner or custodian of the subject
dog or cat shall be given notice by the Animal Services Director, in writing,
which would allow five working days to request an abatement hearing. Service of
such notice shall be in accordance with the service methods specified in
subsection (B) of this chapter. Where requested by such owner or custodian, a
hearing shall be held within five days of the request therefor, and the subject
dog, cat or other animal shall not be disposed of prior to the conclusion of
the hearing. If, after five working days from the date of service of the notice
specified in this subsection, no request for a hearing is received from the
owner or custodian of the subject dog, cat or other animal, such dog, cat, or
other animal shall be disposed of pursuant to applicable provisions of law.
   (D)   All hearings pursuant to this section shall be conducted by the
Director personally or by a designee who shall not have been directly involved
in the subject action. Hearings shall be held not more than ten days from the
date of receipt of the request for the hearing and shall be conducted in an
informal manner consistent with due process of law. A hearing may be continued
for a reasonable period of time if the Director deems such continuance to be
necessary and proper or if the owner or custodian shows good cause for such

the health or safety of the animal or the health or safety of others, the

§ 10.06.010 FINDINGS.
   (A)   Because of the increased urbanization of the City of Menifee, the city
has experienced increasing numbers of dogs and other animals being kept in
close proximity to humans including children.
   (B)   The keeping of dogs and other animals in close proximity to adults and
children has resulted in increasing incidents of attacks, biting and menacing
behavior by such dogs and other animals.
   (C)   These incidents now present a public health and safety problem to the
residents of this city and increasing numbers of cases have resulted in painful
and/or serious injuries to adults and children, death and injuries to other
animals, attendant economic losses to city residents, and anxiety to those
bitten by unlicensed animals whose vaccination status is therefore not
established.
   (D)   In an attempt to bring this problem under control, it is necessary to:
(1) increase the total number of animals which are licensed and thus properly
established to have been vaccinated against rabies; (2) encourage the spaying
and neutering of animals, which (a) reduces the number of strays at large and
not safely confined, (b) reduce aggressiveness and animals at large, and (c)
reduces the financial cost to taxpayers of animal control services; and (3)
establish a warning and hearing procedure to put the owners of potentially
dangerous, dangerous dogs and other animals on adequate notice to control such
animals and to bring about the confinement of such animals and the destruction
of those animals where other lesser measures have failed or are inappropriate.

CHAPTER 11.08: PROHIBITION AGAINST CERTAIN FORMS OF SOLICITATION
Section

11.08.020   Definitions
   
11.08.030   Solicitations prohibited at specific locations
   
11.08.040   Aggressive solicitations prohibited
   
11.08.050   Exemptions
   
11.08.060   Penalties
§ 11.08.010 FINDINGS.
   For purposes of this chapter, the City Council finds as follows:
   (A)   The City Council finds "aggressive solicitation" is unsafe and
disruptive to persons in the City of Menifee and is a threat to public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   The City Council finds that solicitation at banks, automatic teller
machines and check cashing businesses, from persons in vehicles, in parking
lots after dark, in public transportation vehicles, at gasoline stations and
fuel pumps, in driveways, on median strips and freeway ramps, in city parks, on
landscaped parkways/trails, and at dining establish ments subjects persons in
the City of Menifee to danger. Soliciting from persons in vehicles results in
the congestion of public streets and can lead to distracted drivers causing
accidents constituting a danger to pedestrian and vehicular traffic safety. The
City Council further finds that soliciting from people in locations where it is
difficult to avoid the solicitation makes persons who will commonly be carrying
money on their persons vulnerable to intimidation and such solicitation
detracts from the rights of persons in the city to quietly enjoy public
facilities.
   (C)   The restrictions of this section are content neutral and are narrowly
tailored to serve a significant governmental interest but still provide
alternative avenues of communication. The reasonable time, place, manner
restrictions of this section avoid the negative effects of aggressive
solicitation and solicitation in unsafe places and will not unreasonably
restrict free speech of people engaged in solicitation.

including, without limitation, by court orders arising from the city's exercise
of its criminal or civil remedies.
(Ord. 2018-254, passed 12-5-2018)
§ 11.20.090 CONSEQUENCE OF AN UNTIMELY APPEAL.
   (A)   If a timely appeal is not received by the City Clerk, the right to
appeal is waived and the notice of abatement is final and binding and shall be
deemed a conclusive admission that: (1) the nuisance activity or condition
described in the notification of nuisance does or did exist, (2) that the
person(s) to whom the notice was directed was, in fact, the person(s)
responsible for creating or maintaining the nuisance condition or activity, and
(3) that the time specified in the notice for the correction or abatement of
the nuisance was, in fact, reasonable under the circumstances. In such
instances, the city may cause the abatement of any or all of the nuisance
conditions or activities stated in the notice of abatement. The city shall
follow the administrative procedures stated in this chapter for recovery of all
abatement costs, fees and expenses (incidental or otherwise). Nothing in this
chapter shall prevent the city from seeking an order of restitution for
abatement costs from a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with a
civil or criminal judicial proceeding.
   (B)   Nothing contained in this chapter shall obligate the city to undertake
abatement actions pursuant to a notice of abatement, whether or not there is a
timely appeal.
(Ord. 2018-254, passed 12-5-2018)
§ 11.20.100 ABATEMENT BY RESPONSIBLE PERSON PRIOR TO HEARING.
   (A)   Any responsible person shall have the right to abate a nuisance in
accordance with the notice of abatement at his or her own expense, provided all
corrective actions are completed with all required city permits, approvals and
inspections, prior to the date the matter is set for a hearing.
   (B)   A hearing shall be cancelled if all nuisance conditions or activities
are, as determined by the city, fully and lawfully abated prior thereto. In
such instances, the city shall nevertheless have the right to seek recovery of
its incurred incidental expenses, code enforcement fees, and attorney's fees as
provided by and pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2018-254, passed 12-5-2018)
§ 11.20.110 REVIEW BY HEARING OFFICER.
   (A)   Any responsible person who contests a notice of abatement shall,
subject to filing a timely and complete appeal, obtain review before a hearing
officer. The hearing officer must not have participated in making the initial
determination that the public nuisance existed on the subject property or
otherwise been involved in the investigative or prosecutorial activities
related to the subject property. The administrative appeal shall be scheduled
no later than 60 calendar days, and no sooner than ten calendar days, after
receipt of a timely filed and complete request for appeal. The appellants
listed on the written request for an appeal shall be notified in writing of the
date, time, and location of the hearing at least ten calendar days prior to the
date of the hearing.
   (B)   Any request by an appellant to continue a hearing must be submitted to
the City Clerk in writing no later than two business days before the date
scheduled for the hearing. The hearing officer may continue a hearing for good
cause or on his/her own motion; however, in no event may the hearing be
continued for more than 30 calendar days without stipulation by all parties.
   (C)   At the place and time set forth in the notification of appeal hearing,
the hearing officer shall hear and consider the testimony of the appealing
person, the issuing officer, and/or their witnesses, as well as any documentary
evidence presented by these persons concerning the alleged public nuisances.
   (D)   Appeal hearings are informal, and formal rules of evidence and
discovery do not apply. The issuance of a notice of abatement shall constitute
prima facie evidence of the violation. The appellant, as well as all other
responsible persons, shall have the opportunity to present evidence and to
present and cross-examine witnesses. The appellant and the enforcement officer
issuing the notice of abatement, or other responsible persons, may represent
themselves or be represented by anyone of their choice. The appellant, or other
interested persons, may bring an interpreter to the hearing at his/her sole
expense. The city may, at its discretion, record the hearing by stenographer or
court reporter, audio recording, or video recording. The hearing officer may
question any person who presents evidence or who testifies at any hearing.
   (E)   If the appellant fails, or other responsible persons fail, to appear
at the appeal hearing and/or to submit any admissible evidence demonstrating
the non-existence of the alleged nuisances, the hearing officer shall cancel
the hearing and send a notice thereof to the responsible persons by first class
mail to the addresses stated on the appeal form. A cancellation of a hearing
due to non-appearance of the appellant shall constitute the appellant's waiver
of the right to appeal and a failure to exhaust all administrative remedies. In
such instances, the notice of abatement is final and binding.
(Ord. 2018-254, passed 12-5-2018)
§ 11.20.120 DECISION OF HEARING OFFICER; ORDER OF ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Not later than 15 calendar days following conclusion of the hearing,
the hearing officer shall determine if any nuisance condition exists at the
subject property. If the hearing officer determines that each nuisance
condition described in the notice of abatement is non-existent, the notice of
abatement shall be deemed cancelled and shall document the same with a written
order. If the hearing officer determines that one or more of the nuisance
conditions described in the notice of abatement exists, he/she shall issue a
written order of abatement which shall contain, to the extent available, the
following:
      (1)   A finding and description of each nuisance condition existing at
the subject property.
      (2)   The name of each responsible person for a nuisance condition or
conditions at the subject property, as well as the name of any person who is

condition.
      (4)   Any other finding, determination or requirement that is relevant or
related to the subject matter of the appeal.
      (5)   The following statement, in substantial form:
   "The decision of the hearing officer is final, conclusive, and binding.
Judicial review of this decision is subject to the provisions and time limits
set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.6 et seq. or
Government Code section 53069.4."
   (B)   Notwithstanding any provision of the code to the contrary, the
decision of the hearing officer is final, conclusive, and binding.
   (C)   A copy of the decision shall be served by first class mail on each
responsible person to whom the notice of abatement was issued. If the property
owner is not an appellant, a copy of the order of abatement shall also be
served on the property owner by first class mail to the address shown on the
last equalized assessment roll. Failure of a person to receive the decision
shall not invalidate any action or proceeding by the city pursuant to this
chapter.
(Ord. 2018-254, passed 12-5-2018)
§ 11.20.130 VOLUNTARY ABATEMENT PRIOR TO CITY ACTIONS.
   (A)   Any responsible person shall have the right to fully abate a nuisance
in accordance with the hearing officer's decision prior to the date of entry of
city upon the subject real property, provided that all corrective actions are
completed with all required City permits, approvals and inspections prior to
said entry date. In such instances, all administrative proceedings shall be
cancelled, with the exception of the city's right to seek recovery of its
incurred incidental expenses, code enforcement fees, and attorney's fees as
provided by and pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   If the responsible person fails to comply with any city notice, order,
or decisions, then the City Council shall consider declaring the property a
public nuisance and order the city to abate the violations.
   (C)   Once the city enters a subject real property to abate a public
nuisance, the City shall have the right to complete all the abatement work

§ 11.20.140 EMERGENCY ACTION TO ABATE AN IMMINENT HAZARD.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any provision of the Menifee Municipal Code to the
contrary, the Police Chief, the Fire Chief, health official, and/or the
Building Official, or any of their designees, may cause a public nuisance to be
summarily abated if it is determined that the nuisance creates an imminent
hazard to a person or persons, or to other real or personal property.
   (B)   Prior to abating a nuisance that creates an imminent hazard, the
official designated in subsection (A) of this section shall attempt to notify a
responsible person by telephone or in writing of the imminent hazard and
request its abatement by said person; provided, however, that the city official
may dispense with any attempt at prior notification of a responsible person if,
in the sole discretion of the city official, the nature, or the severity of the
hazard does not reasonably allow for such prior notification. If notice has
been so given but, in the sole discretion of the city official, the responsible
person fails to take immediate and meaningful steps to abate the imminent
hazard, the city may cause the abatement of the nuisance without further
notice, and charge the costs and fees thereof to the responsible person.
   (C)   Within ten business days following the conclusion of emergency action
by the city to abate an imminent hazard, the city shall serve any responsible
person with a notice of emergency abatement by the same manner set forth in
section
11.20.070.
   (D)   A notice of emergency abatement of an imminent hazard shall contain,
to the extent available, the following provisions:
      (1)   The name of all known responsible persons who are being served with
the notice of emergency abatement by the city of an imminent hazard and the
location or the address of the real property on which the imminent hazard was
present.
      (2)   A brief description of the condition(s) and reasons why it
constituted an imminent hazard.
      (3)   A brief description of the law prohibiting or pertaining to the
imminent hazard.
      (4)   A brief description of the actions the city took to abate the
imminent hazard.
   (E)   The city shall be entitled to recover all of its fees and costs
(incidental or otherwise) for the abatement of an imminent hazard. In such
instances, the city shall follow the procedures set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 2018-254, passed 12-5-2018)
§ 11.20.150 ESTABLISHMENT OF COSTS OF ABATEMENT.
   (A)   The city shall keep an accounting of all abatement costs.
   (B)   The city shall serve a statement of abatement costs on the responsible
persons within 60 calendar days of the city's completion of nuisance abatement
actions. Service of this statement may be made in the manner provided for in

   (C)   Unless a timely contest of the statement of abatement costs is filed,
a responsible person shall tender the abatement costs to the city within 45

costs by filing a written request for contest with the City Clerk's office
within 15 calendar days of service of the statement of abatement costs.

information:
         (a)   Name, address, telephone number, and signature of each

         (d)   Description of the specific abatement costs being contested, and
a statement of the grounds for contest in sufficient detail to enable the City
Council to understand the nature of the controversy.
   (E)   Failure of the City Clerk to receive a timely appeal request to
contest the abatement costs constitutes a waiver of the right to contest a
statement of abatement costs. In this event, the statement of abatement costs
is final and binding upon the City Council's confirmation, and the city may
proceed to collect its abatement costs as contained in a final statement of
abatement costs in any manner allowed by law.
   (F)   If a timely request to contest is received by the City Clerk, a
hearing shall be set before the City Council thereof no later than 60 calendar
days, and no sooner than 10 calendar days of receipt of the request to contest.
A notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing shall be served on all
responsible persons who contested the statement of abatement costs by first
class mail to the addresses stated on the request form at least ten calendar
days prior to the hearing.
   (G)   Any request by an appellant to continue a hearing must be submitted to
the City Clerk in writing no later than five business days before the date

continued for more 60 calendar days without written stipulation by all parties.
   (H)   At the time and place fixed for receiving and considering the request
to contest the statement of abatement costs, the City Council shall hear and
consider the evidence submitted by the City, together with any objections or
protests raised by responsible persons liable for said costs. Testimony and
evidence shall be limited to issues related to the abatement costs, and no
person shall be permitted to present evidence or testimony challenging the
existence of a public nuisance or the manner of abatement as described in the
notice of abatement. Thereupon, the City Council may make such revision,
correction or modification to the statement as it deems just, after which the
statement, as it is submitted, or as revised, corrected, or modified, shall be
confirmed. The hearing may be continued from time to time at the discretion of
the City Council.
   (I)   Notwithstanding any provisions of the code to the contrary, the
decision of the City Council is final, conclusive, and binding.
   (J)   The City Clerk shall cause a confirmed statement of abatement costs to
be served upon all persons who contested the original statement by first class
mail to the addresses stated on the request form. The City Clerk shall cause a
confirmed statement of abatement costs to be served on the owner of the
property on which the city abated a public nuisance in the same manner as in
section
11.20.070 (irrespective of whether the owner contested the statement of
abatement costs). This document shall also contain the following statement:
   "The determination of the City Council is final and binding. Judicial review
of the this decision is subject to the provisions and time limits set forth in
California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.6 et seq."
   (K)   A responsible person shall tender the abatement costs to the city
within 45 calendar days of the date of service of the confirmed statement of
abatement costs. If unpaid for more than 45 days, the city may proceed to
collect its abatement costs as contained in the confirmed statement of
abatement costs in any manner allowed by law.

   (A)   The city may cause a special assessment to be made upon real property
upon which a public nuisance was abated pursuant to Government Code section
38773.5, and future amendments thereto, in the event a statement of abatement
costs or a confirmed statement of abatement costs is not paid in a timely
manner.
   (B)   A notice of special assessment shall be sent to the owners of the
subject real property by certified mail at the time the assessment is imposed
which shall contain the following recitals:
   "The property may be sold by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent
assessments. The tax collector's power of sale shall not be affected by the
failure of the property owner to receive notice. The assessment may be
collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes
are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same
procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal
taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal
taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real
property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or
conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide
encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date
on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the
cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property but
instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection."
   (C)   The amount of a special assessment shall also constitute a personal
obligation of the property owners of land upon which the nuisance was abated.
(Ord. 2018-254, passed 12-5-2018)
§ 11.20.170 NUISANCE ABATEMENT LIEN.

11.20.160, the city may cause a nuisance abatement lien to be recorded upon
real property upon which a public nuisance was abated pursuant to Government
Code section 38773.1, and future amendments thereto, in the event a statement
of abatement costs or a confirmed statement of abatement costs is not paid in a
timely manner.
   (B)   A lien shall not be recorded prior to serving a notice on the owner of
record of the parcel of land on which the public nuisance is maintained. This
document shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action in
accordance with article 3 (commencing with section 415.10) of Chapter 4 of
Title 5 of part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If the owner of record, after
diligent search cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy
thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten days and
publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in
Riverside County pursuant to Government Code section 6062.
   (C)   The nuisance abatement lien shall be recorded in the Riverside County
Recorder's office and from the date of recording shall have the force, effect,
and priority of a judgment lien.
   (D)   A nuisance abatement lien authorized by this section shall specify the
amount of the lien for the City of Menifee, the name of the city department or
division on whose behalf the lien is imposed, the date of the abatement
actions, the street address, legal description and assessor's parcel number of
the parcel on which the lien is imposed, and the name and address of the
recorded owner of the parcel.
   (E)   In the event that the lien is discharged, released, or satisfied,
either through payment or other legal means, notice of the discharge containing
the information specified in subsection (D) of this section shall be recorded
by the city.
   (F)   A nuisance abatement lien may be foreclosed by an action brought by
the city for a money judgment or may be collected by any other legal means.
   (G)   The city may recover from the property owner any costs incurred
regarding the processing and recording of the lien and providing notice to the
property owner as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien.
   (H)   The amount of a nuisance abatement lien shall also constitute a
personal obligation of the property owners of land upon which the nuisance was
abated.
(Ord. 2018-254, passed 12-5-2018)
§ 11.20.180 RESTITUTION OF ABATEMENT COSTS.
   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the city from seeking an order of
restitution for abatement costs from a court of competent jurisdiction in
connection with a civil or criminal judicial proceeding seeking the abatement
of a public nuisance.
(Ord. 2018-254, passed 12-5-2018)
§ 11.20.190 TREBLE THE COSTS OF ABATEMENT.
   Pursuant to Government Code section 38773.7 (or any subsequent amendment
thereto), upon entry of a second or subsequent civil or criminal judgment
within a two-year period finding that an owner of property is responsible for a
public nuisance except for public nuisance conditions abated pursuant to Health
and Safety Code section 17980 et seq. ("State Housing Law"), the court may
order that person to pay treble the costs of the abatement.

other method described in said notice as follows:
      (1)   A 100 foot wide strip of land at the boundary of a vacant property

   (G)   All appeal and hearing procedures for a Notice of Abatement for
Hazardous Vegetation shall be governed by the provisions of Section
11.20.080 for a Notice of Abatement. Failure to file a timely and proper
written appeal shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal and a failure
to exhaust administrative remedies.

Vegetation was issued the nuisance upon the property has not been abated and no
written appeal has been filed, city personnel and/or contractors may enter the

11.21.030   Unlawful camping
11.21.040   Permitted camping

§ 11.21.010 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The public parks, public streets and alleys, public parking lots, public
rights-of-way, parkways, public sidewalks, recreational areas and other
publicly owned or controlled property within the city (collectively "public
property") should be readily accessible and available to residents, businesses
and the public at large for their intended purposes. The use of public property
for camping purposes and/or for the storage of personal property interferes
with the rights of others to use and enjoy these public areas as they are
intended. Such activity can constitute a public health and safety hazard which
adversely impacts neighborhoods and commercial areas. The purpose of this
chapter is to maintain these public areas within the city in a clean, sanitary,
safe, and accessible condition, to adequately protect the health, safety,
environment and general welfare of the community, and to ensure that public
property is used for its intended purpose and remains accessible to all
citizens, businesses and visitors in the city. Nothing in this chapter is
intended to interfere with otherwise lawful and ordinary uses of public
property. This chapter shall be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with
applicable state and federal law.

§ 11.21.030 UNLAWFUL CAMPING.
   (A)   Unlawful camping. It shall be unlawful and a public nuisance for any

      (2)   Absent exigent circumstances relating to immediate threats to the

holding in Martin v. City of Boise 902 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir. 2018), and only
during the timeframe that the case of Martin v. City of Boise 902 F.3d 1031
(9th Cir. 2018) is applicable law within the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit,
unless the following procedures are followed:
         (a)   Definition. For the purpose of this §
11.21.030 (B)(2), the following definition applies:
            OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT (O&E) PERSONNEL. Includes, but is not
limited to, any organization that the city has contracted with for homeless
outreach and engagement services (e.g., Riverside University Health System or
RUHS). OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT PERSONNEL may include city employees, homeless
liaisons and police officers.
         (b)   Procedures. Prior to any citation or arrest for unlawfully
camping, occupying camp facilities or using camp paraphernalia, storing
personal property in public areas, a person shall be referred to O&E personnel
to determine potential shelter placement or available services.
            1.   If the homeless person declines the offered placement, or
available services, then this exception under §
11.21.030(B)(2) shall not apply and the city may proceed with enforcement of
this section after giving such person a warning and an opportunity to
immediately leave the location where unauthorized camping is occurring, or an
opportunity to voluntarily decide to relocate outside of the jurisdiction of
the city, before engaging in citation and/or arrest. If such person relocates
upon warning, he or she will not be cited or arrested for violating this
section. If the homeless person fails to relocate as directed, then he or she
may be issued a citation, or placed under custodial arrest for such violations.
            2.   If any alleged violation arises from the homeless person's
presence in a city or valley-wide park outside of the established operational
hours of the park and there is no appropriate and immediately available shelter
placement for such person, then such person will be advised to move and
referred to O&E personnel so that he or she may avoid citation or arrest for a
violation of this section until an appropriate and immediately available bed is
made available to such person.
            3.   These procedures under §
11.21.030(B)(2) are only mandatory during the timeframe that the case of Martin
v. City of Boise 902 F.3d 1031 (9th Cir. 2018) is applicable law within the
jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit.
         (c)   This exception shall not apply where a homeless person and/or
their personal property obstructs and actually interferes with a public area or
the intended use of the public area, provided that, absent exigent
circumstances relating to immediate threats to the public health, safety, or
welfare, the homeless person is first advised to cease the interference and/or
to move the personal property causing the obstruction and they decline to do
so. However, this §
11.21.030(B)(2)(c) shall not apply if such personal property is unattended.

   (A)   Upon request by the owner of the vehicle or owner of the land received
by the City’s Vehicle Abatement Officer within ten days after the mailing of
the notices of intention to abate and remove, a public hearing shall be held by
a city official designated by the City Manager who is not the enforcement
official or a member of the enforcement official’s department, on the question
of abatement and removal of the vehicle, or parts thereof, as an abandoned,
wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle, and the assessment of the
administrative costs and cost of removal of the vehicle, or parts thereof,
against the property on which it is located.
   (B)   If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying
responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his or her land within the
ten-day period, the statement shall be construed as a request for a hearing,
which does not require his or her presence. Notice of the hearing shall be
mailed, by registered mail, at least ten days before the hearing to the owner
of the land and to the owner of the vehicle, unless the vehicle is in a
condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership.

to abate and remove the vehicle or parts thereof, as a public nuisance without

§ 12.01.110 PUBLIC HEARING; PROCEDURE, ACTION.
   (A)   All hearings under this chapter shall be held before the City Council,
which shall hear all facts and testimony deemed pertinent. The facts and
testimony may include testimony on the condition of the vehicle, or part
thereof, and the circumstances concerning the vehicle’s location on the private
property or public property. The City Council shall not be limited by the
technical rules of evidence. The owner of the land on which the vehicle is
located may appear in person at the hearing or present a written statement in
time for consideration at the hearing, and deny responsibility for the presence
of the vehicle on the land, with reasons for the denial.
   (B)   The City Council may impose conditions and take other action as it
deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purpose of this
chapter. This may delay the time for removal of the vehicle, or part thereof,
if, in the opinion of the hearing officer, the circumstances justify the delay.
At the conclusion of the public hearing, the City Council may find that a
vehicle, or part thereof, has been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or is
inoperative on private or public property and, by resolution, order the same
removed from the property as a public nuisance and disposed of as provided in
this chapter and determine the administrative costs and the cost of removal to
be charged against the owner of the parcel of land on which the vehicle, or
part thereof, is located. The order requiring removal shall include a
description of the vehicle, or part thereof, and the correct identification
number and license number of the vehicle, if available at the site.
   (C)   If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the
land without the consent of the land owner and that he or she has not
subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the City Council shall not assess
costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon
which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect the costs from the
land owner.
   (D)   If an interested party makes a written presentation to the City
Council, but does not appear, he or she shall be notified in writing of the
decision.

§ 12.04.010 ESTABLISHMENT.
   (A)   (1)   The prima facie speed limits provided in §

facilitate the orderly development of vehicular traffic and are reasonable and
safe for those street segments.
      (2)   The Public Works Department is hereby authorized and directed to
install and/or upgrade any or all immediately appropriate signs giving notice
of said speed limits.
   (B)   This chapter shall not be effective as to any designated portion of a
street, roadway or highway which lies outside the city limits of the city.

reasonable and safe because of increased vehicular traffic and a reduced speed
zone is warranted and necessary, he or she may temporarily fix the appropriate
lower rate as provided in Cal. Vehicle Code § 22358 which will facilitate the
orderly movement of traffic and will be reasonable and safe upon that portion
of the highway for the period the highway is used as a detour route. Thereupon,
the prima facie speed limit so fixed shall be effective during the period
appropriate signs are erected and maintained along that portion of the highway
by the Director of Public Works.

time and place has been received, and a permit has been or will be granted to a

            7.   The use or activity intended by the applicant would conflict
with previously planned programs organized and conducted by the city and

            8.   The use or activity intended by the applicant would present an
unreasonable danger to the health or safety of the applicant, or other users of
the park, or city employees or the public;

implement a program, within the authority of the city under the powers granted
to the city by law, that will provide economic incentives to businesses and
property owners to encourage commercial and industrial development on vacant
land that is currently zoned for such uses in order to create an inventory of
commercial and industrial sites. It is also the purpose of
Chapters 16.01,
16.02 and
16.03 to encourage retention and expansion of businesses in the city that are
already established, as well as to encourage other as yet unrecognized
opportunities for economic development as they arise.

will require the construction of infrastructure requiring capacity which exceed
the needs of the project, and where the cost of the infrastructure, in
aggregate, may make the project economically unfeasible;
      (3)   Production of jobs. The development of the project will result in:
         (a)   The establishment of a new business or businesses on the
property producing a significant number of new and additional jobs; or

      (4)   Fiscal impact on city. The development of the project will create
significant new on-going revenues to the city, considering all revenue sources;
      (5)   Special amenities. The development of the project will produce
community amenities either due to the construction of needed public facilities,
or due to the fact that the project itself provides special private facilities
available to the public which do not otherwise exist in the community and which
would be significant to the community character and quality of life of those
who work or live in the community.
   (B)   The project must meet one or more of the above conditions and the City
Council must find that the project taken as a whole is beneficial to the
community.

§ 17.01.010 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   This chapter establishes the program for the adoption and administration of
development impact fees. It is the intent of the city to require every person
who develops land to mitigate the impacts of that development on the city's

development impact fee that will assist in meeting the demand for public
facilities caused by development. The public facilities will be constructed in
accordance with a capital improvement plan adopted by resolution of the City
Council. The amount of the development impact fees collected pursuant to this
chapter shall be limited to the cost of public facilities attributable to new
development. The amount of the development impact fees collected shall not
include the cost of public facilities that serve existing development.

§ 17.02.010 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Authorizing legislation. This chapter is adopted to implement the
provisions of §§ 66000 et seq. of the Cal. Gov't Code (sometimes referred to
hereinafter as the "Mitigation Fee Act"), which authorizes a city to impose
mitigation fees as a condition of approval on a development project for the
purpose of defraying all or a portion of the cost of public facilities related
to the development project.
   (B)   Purpose. Additional park facilities are needed to accommodate future
growth and maintain an acceptable level of the existing park and recreation
facilities for all areas of the City of Menifee. New development within the
City of Menifee results in increased usage of the existing park and recreation
facilities throughout the city, which thereby increases the service
requirements and the capital equipment requirements of the city's parks and
recreation facilities. Such increased usage is not limited to new residential
subdivisions.
   (C)   Use. Park and recreation mitigation fees are hereby established on new
residential development within the City of Menifee to pay a proportionate share
of public facilities related to parks and recreation. The mitigation fees
authorized by this section will be used only for defraying costs associated
with providing parks and recreation facilities resulting from new development
projects and shall not exceed the estimated cost associated with providing
those facilities. The mitigation fees are for the purpose of developing new or
rehabilitating existing park or recreational facilities, although no such fees
will be used to overcome any current deficiency in park and recreation
facilities. A reasonable relationship exists between the mitigation fees' use,
amount, and need and the residential development project upon which the
mitigation fees are imposed.
   (D)   Findings. The amount of existing park area in the city exceeds three
acres of park area per 1,000 city residents. The enactment of this chapter
shall prevent new residential development from reducing the quality and
availability of public services provided to residents of the city by requiring
new residential development to contribute to the cost of expanding the
availability of park and recreational facilities and amenities in the city.

mobile home units shall be defined according to the latest decennial U.S. or
state Department of Finance census. Dwelling unit, for this chapter, does not
include a guest dwelling that does not have cooking facilities.
   LAND ACQUISITION COST PER ACRE. The estimated per acre value of vacant
residential land costs in the city as determined by the City Council based upon
receipt sale records or appraisal. The most recent land acquisition cost per
acre may be reflected  in a City Council resolution. If the developer objects
to such a valuation, the developer, at its own expense, may obtain an appraisal
of the property by a qualified appraiser approved by the city, whose appraisal
may be accepted by the city if found reasonable.

§ 17.03.010 FINDINGS.
   The City Council finds and determines as follows:
   (A)   The preservation of vegetation communities and natural areas within
the city and western Riverside County which support species covered by the
Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP) is necessary to protect and
promote the health, safety, and welfare of all the citizens of the city by
reducing the adverse direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of urbanization
and development and providing for permanent conservation of habitat for species
covered by the MSHCP.
   (B)   It is necessary to update certain development impact fees to ensure
that all new developments within the city pay their fair share of the costs of
acquiring and preserving vegetation communities and natural areas within the
city and the region known to support plant and wildlife species covered by the
MSHCP.
   (C)   A proper funding source to pay the costs associated with mitigating
the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of development to the natural
ecosystems within the city and the region, as identified in the MSHCP, is a
development impact fee for residential, commercial, and industrial development.
The amount of the fee is determined by the nature and extent of the impacts
from the development to the identified natural ecosystems and/or the relative
cost of mitigating such impacts.
   (D)   The MSHCP and the 2020 Nexus Study, a copy of which is on file in the
City Clerk's Office, provides a basis for the imposition of development impact
fees on new construction.
   (E)   The use of the development impact fees to mitigate the impacts to the
city's and the region's natural ecosystems is reasonably related to the type
and extent of impacts caused by development within the city.
   (F)   The costs of funding the proper mitigation of natural ecosystems and
biological resources impacted by development within the city and the region are
apportioned relative to the type and extent of impacts caused by the
development.
   (G)   The facts and evidence provided to the city establish that there is a
reasonable relationship between the need for preserving the natural ecosystems
in the city and the region, as defined in the MSHCP, and the direct, indirect,
and cumulative impacts to such natural ecosystems and biological resources
created by the types of development on which the fee will be imposed, and that
there is a reasonable relationship between the fee's use and the types of
development for which the fee is charged. This reasonable relationship is
described in more detail in the MSHCP and the 2020 Nexus Study.
   (H)   The cost estimates for mitigating the impact of development on the
city's and the region's natural ecosystem and biological resources, as set
forth in the MSHCP, are reasonable and will not exceed the reasonably estimated
total of these costs.
   (I)   The fee set forth herein does not reflect the entire cost of the lands
which need to be acquired in order to implement the MSHCP and mitigate the
impact caused by new development. Additional revenues will be required from
other sources. The City Council finds that the benefit to each development
project is greater than the amount of the fee to be paid by the project.
   (J)   The fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used to finance
the acquisition and perpetual conservation of the natural ecosystems and
certain improvements necessary to implement the goals and objectives of the
MSHCP.
(Ord. 2022-364, passed 11-16-2022)
§ 17.03.020 ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY.
   The Western Riverside County Regional Conservation Authority (RCA) is hereby

Implementation Manual. The detailed administrative procedures concerning the
implementation of this chapter shall be contained in the MSHCP Mitigation Fee
Implementation Manual adopted December 7,2020, and as may be amended from time

to authorize the RCA to calculate the fees due and collect those amounts
directly from property owners. If such a policy is adopted, it will be included
in the MSHCP Mitigation Fee Implementation Manual.

   Under certain circumstances, such as double payment, expiration of a

be entitled to a refund. Refunds will be reimbursed by the end of the fiscal
year on a first come, first served basis, depending upon the net revenue
stream. Refunds will only be considered reimbursable if requested within three
years of the original LDMF payment. In all cases, the applicant must promptly

shall be submitted to that local jurisdiction, which will subsequently forward
the request to RCA for verification, review, and possible action.

methods agreed to by the RCA Executive Committee. If first approved through RCA
staff in writing, the calculation is not subject to additional review.
