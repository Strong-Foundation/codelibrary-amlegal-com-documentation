   The City Council finds that it is desirable and in the public interest to
establish a municipal code in order to provide a scheme of organization for the
classification and grouping of ordinances which the Council may adopt. The
Council intends in adopting ordinances of a general and permanent nature to
provide for their placement in accordance with the scheme of the code. This
will provide the user with a convenient and logical compilation of the
ordinances of the City.
(3-12/90 § 1.01.001)
1.01.002 Establishment of Municipal Code.
   This code shall be known as the “City of Canyon Lake Municipal Code.” It
shall be sufficient to refer to this Code as the City of Canyon Lake Municipal
Code in any prosecution for the violation of any provision of this Code. It
shall also be sufficient to designate any ordinance adding to, amending,
correcting, or repealing provisions of this Code as an addition or amendment
to, or a repeal of, the City of Canyon Lake Municipal Code, or a portion
thereof.
(3-12/90 § 1.01.002)
1.01.003 Contents of Code.
   The City of Canyon Lake Municipal Code shall consist of all ordinances
adopted by the City Council which are of a general and permanent nature. An

general and permanent nature.

1.01.0035 Other ordinances not part of Code.
   Other ordinances adopted by the City Council on December 1, 1990, the date

Municipal Code, and any future amendments to said other ordinances will not be
included as part of the Municipal Code unless otherwise expressly stated in
said future amendments.

1.01.010 Interpretation of Code and other ordinances.
   The provisions of this Code and all proceedings under it are to be construed
to effect its objects and to promote justice.
   All the provisions of this Code and all other City ordinances shall be
interpreted to refer to the appropriate or designated officer or office of the
City, and whether an ordinance, uniform code, statute, or other matter which is
adopted by reference refers to any department, officer, employee, inspection,
police, or other function, unless the context requires otherwise, all
references shall be to the appropriate or designated office, officer,
department, agency, employee, or function of the City, or to the person or
agency performing the function for the City.
(3-12/90 § 1.01.010)
1.01.020 Effect of Code on past actions and obligations.
   Neither the adoption of this Code nor the repeal or amendment by this Code
of any ordinance or part or portion of any ordinance previously in effect in
the City or within the territory currently comprising the City, shall in any
manner affect the prosecution for the violation of any ordinance, which
violation was committed prior to the effective date of this Code, nor be
construed as a waiver of any license, fee or penalty on such effective date due
and unpaid under such ordinances, nor be construed as affecting any of the
provisions of such ordinances relating to the collection of any such license,
fee or penalty or the penal provisions applicable to any violation of such
ordinances, nor to affect the validity of any bond or cash deposit required to
be posted, filed, or deposited pursuant to any ordinance, and all vested rights

such ordinance or revive any ordinance which has been repealed thereby.

1.01.030 Partial invalidity.
   If any chapter, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of
this Code is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct
and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions thereof. The City Council hereby declares that it would have
passed this Code, and each section, subsection, sentence, clause and phrase
thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections,
sentences, clauses or phrases had been declared invalid or unconstitutional;
and if for any reason the Code should be declared invalid or unconstitutional,

applicable to this City, whether the City is mentioned in each particular
section or not. Portions of this Code have been adopted from or relate to the
same subject as is set forth in the Riverside County Code. To the extent that
any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this Code is in conflict
with the Riverside County Code provisions so adopted, the later-adopted portion
of this Code shall control and shall take precedence over the inconsistent
portions of the Riverside County Code.

or other ordinance or regulation, has been given notice, by or on behalf of the
City Attorney or by any other City officer, employee or policing agent
authorized to give such notice, to abate such nuisance or cease and desist from
continuing such nuisance or violation of law, and such person who was given
notice fails, refuses, or neglects to comply with the notice within the time
specified therein, or if such a time is not specified, then within a time

   (d)   The liability of any person for the payment of the costs and expenses,
provided for in Subsection (a) of this Section may be waived in whole or in
part in an amount not to exceed $100, by the City Attorney in any case wherein
he determines, in his sole discretion, that the failure or refusal of such
person to comply with the notice therein involved was based upon a good faith
and bona fide issue of law or fact specially involved in the circumstances of
the case. Any determination or decision of the City Attorney in this regard
shall be final and conclusive.
   (e)   Moneys due to the City pursuant to this Section may be recovered in an
appropriate civil action. Alternatively, such liability may be enforced by
special assessment proceedings against the parcel of land upon which the
nuisance existed, which proceedings may be conducted in a manner substantively
similar to proceedings described in Sections 39574 et seq. of the Government
Code of the State relating to weed abatement assessments.

failure to perform the duties or to observe the rules or regulations of the
department, office, commission or board within the meaning of the rules and
regulations of the City, or of the civil service or other personnel regulations
of the City if applicable.

employee’s presence which he or she has the discretionary duty to enforce, and
to issue a notice to appear, and to release such person on his or her written
promise to appear in court, pursuant to Section 853.6 of the Penal Code. No
officer or employee shall be allowed by his or her superior to exercise the
arrest and citation authority conferred in this Section unless such officer or
employee is within a classification of City officers and employees designated

authority as to specified violations. The City Manager shall establish and
cause to be administered a special enforcement training program designated to
instruct each officer or employee who will exercise such arrest and citation

(3-12/90 § 2.04.040)
2.01.050 Compensation.
   (a)   Purpose. The ordinance codified in this Section is enacted pursuant to
Section 36516 of the Government Code, which authorizes a City Council to
provide by ordinance that each member of the Council may receive a compensation
based upon the population of the City.
   (b)   Population.
      (1)   Section 36516(a)(3) of the Government Code states that “... the
population of a city shall be determined by the last preceding federal census
...”
      (2)   On April 1, 2020, the federal census determined that the population
of the City of Canyon Lake is 11,082.
   (c)   Compensation. The compensation for each member of the City Council

2.01.100 Appeals to Council.
   (a)   Except when an appeals procedure is otherwise specifically set forth
in this Code, any person excepting to the denial, suspension, or revocation of
a permit applied for or held by him pursuant to any of the provisions of this
Code or other City ordinance, or to any administrative decision made by any
official of the City, if the denial, suspension, or revocation of such permit
or the determination of such administrative decision involves the exercise of
administrative discretion or personal judgment exercised pursuant to any of the
provisions of this Code or other City ordinance, may appeal in writing to the
Council by filing with the City Clerk a written notice of such appeal.
   (b)   No appeal may be taken to any such administrative decision made by an
official of the City pursuant to any of the provisions of this Chapter unless
such decision to appeal has been first taken up with the department head
concerned and with the City Manager, and each such official has not adjusted
the matter to the appellant's satisfaction.
   (c)   No right of appeal to the Council from any administrative decision
made by an official of the City pursuant to any of the provisions of this Code
or other City ordinance shall exist when such decision is ministerial and thus
does not involve the exercise of administrative discretion or personal
judgement exercised pursuant to any of the provisions of this Code or other
City ordinance, whether the administrative decision involves the denial,
suspension, or revocation of a permit or any other administrative decision.
Also, there shall be no such right of appeal with regard to law enforcement
activities involving State law.
(3-12/90 § 2.04.100)
2.01.110 Notice of appeal: Time limit--Contents.
   (a)   Any notice of appeal to the City Council must be filed within 15 days
of the date of service of notice of the decision or action pursuant to Section
1.01.300 of this Code, or within 15 days of the decision or action if no notice
of the decision or action is required to be given.
   (b)   The notice of appeal shall set forth (1) the specific action appealed
from; (2) the specific grounds of the appeal; and (3) the relief or action
sought from the City Council. In the event any notice of appeal fails to set
forth any information required by this Section, the City Clerk shall return the
same to the appellant with a statement of the respects in which it is
deficient, and the appellant shall thereafter be allowed five days in which to
perfect and refile the notice of appeal.
   (c)   Except in those instances where an appeal is filed by the City Manager
or other public official in pursuance of official duties, the written notice of
appeal from the action of an administrative official or from an administrative
body of the City, as the case may be, shall be accompanied by a fee of $50 or
such other fee as may be required by other enactment of the City Council.
(3-12/90 § 2.04.110)
2.01.120 Appeals: Hearings-Notices.
   Upon the timely filing of a notice of appeal in proper form, the City Clerk
shall schedule the matter promptly upon the City Council agenda at a subsequent
regular meeting and shall cause notice thereof to be given the appellant not
less than five days prior to such hearing, unless such notice is waived in
writing by the appellant. The City Clerk shall also cause a copy of the notice
of appeal to be transmitted to the official or body whose action has been
appealed from.
(3-12/90 § 2.04.120)
2.01.130 Appeals: Hearings.
   (a)   The City Council at the hearing may limit participation in the hearing
to the directly interested parties, or may allow participation by the public.
Such public participation, however, shall only be appropriate when the Council
deems the same necessary in the public interest. If a hearing is ordered open
to public participation, notice thereof shall be given by posting notice of the
same in the public places designated by the City Council not less than five
days prior to the date of such hearing, and by such other means as the City
Council deems necessary.
   (b)   At the time of consideration of the appeal by the City Council the
appellant shall be limited to a presentation on the specific grounds of appeal
and matters set forth in the notice of appeal and shall have the burden of
establishing cause why the action appealed from should be altered, reversed or
modified. The Council may continue the matter from time to time, and at the
conclusion of its consideration may affirm, reverse or modify the action
appealed from and may take any action which might have been legally taken in
the first instance by the official or body from whose action the appeal has
been taken. In ruling on the appeal the findings and action of the Council
shall be final and conclusive in the matter.
(3-12/90 § 2.04.130)
2.01.140 Vacancies.
   Consistent with state law, the preference of the City Council of the City of
Canyon Lake is to fill any vacancy that may occur on the City Council by
appointment rather than incur the costs of calling a special election.
Therefore, to ensure that the City Council has adequate time to receive and
consider applications for appointment, the following actions shall be taken in
the event a vacancy occurs on the City Council:
   (a)   The City Manager shall immediately notify the remaining members of the
City Council of any vacancy that occurs.
   (b)   The City Clerk shall publish a notice of City Council vacancy in a
newspaper of local jurisdiction stating that the City Council of the City of
Canyon Lake is seeking applications for appointment to fill a vacancy on the
City Council. The notice shall state the length of the term to be filled, the
deadline by which applications must be received, and the date by which an
appointment must be made. The deadline for receiving applications shall be no
later than 30 days after the vacancy occurs.
   (c)   The application may request the applicant provide such information as
the City Council may desire, and amend from time to time, but shall include the
age of the applicant, the address of the applicant's primary residence for the
previous 30 days, whether applicant is a registered voter, and a certification
from the applicant that all information contained in the application is true
and correct.
   (d)   The Mayor shall appoint an ad hoc committee to review the
applications. The committee shall have seven days from the deadline to receive
applications to recommend the most qualified applicants to the City Council by
submitting the recommendations to the City Manager.
   (e)   The Mayor shall call a special meeting of the City Council for
consideration of appointing an applicant to fill the vacancy where the City
Council may consider the recommendation of the ad hoc committee, if any, as
well as any other applicant the City Council determines qualified. Once an
applicant is appointed by majority vote of the City Council, the applicant
shall immediately take the oath of office.
   (f)   The City Council may by resolution establish other processes for the
appointment to vacant offices that are not inconsistent with this section.

2.34.010   Declaration of purpose and intent.
   The City has struggled with structural budget deficits for many years due
primarily to sharply rising costs associated with its contracts with the County
of Riverside for police and fire services. Revenue generated by property taxes,
sales tax, and the utility users’ tax have become insufficient to cover
skyrocketing public safety costs. The City Council and City staff have explored
numerous alternatives for providing quality public safety services at a cost
that is sustainable for the City, including contracting with another agency
other than the County, forming a fire department under a joint powers authority
(JPA) with neighboring cities, closing Station 60 and paying a reduced fee to
be serviced by fire stations located in surrounding jurisdictions, and starting
a municipal fire department.
   After receiving a Feasibility Analysis from Emergency Services Consulting
International (ESCI) for the start-up and ongoing operation of a City of Canyon
Lake Fire Department, the City Council determined it would be in the public’s
best interest to establish a municipal fire department, owned and operated by
the City of Canyon Lake. On November 4, 2020, the City Council further directed
the City Manager to establish a municipal fire department that would take over
services from the County of Riverside on January 1, 2022.
   The purposes and intent of this chapter are to establish in the manner
provided by State law a municipal fire department, to outline the organizations
of ranking and non-ranking positions within that fire department and to clarify
the powers and duties of the Fire Chief.
   The further purpose of this chapter is to best protect the health, safety,
and welfare of those who live, visit, work, and invest in the City and to
provide the maximum legal protection available to the Fire Chief and
firefighters.
   This chapter is enacted pursuant to California Government Code Sections
38600-38611.

procurement requirements in Sections

3.08.050:
   (a)   Emergencies. Upon determining that an emergency exists, City Manager
may dispense with otherwise applicable competitive procurement procedures and
signature authority requirements to authorize a procurement necessary to
address, avoid, or ameliorate the circumstances creating the emergency or the
resulting damage or potential damage, up to an amount not to exceed $250,000.
An emergency procurement will be limited in scope and duration to the extent
necessary to satisfy the emergency need. The City Manager must report to the
City Council any emergency purchase made and the basis therefore at the next
City Council meeting following the emergency procurement.
   (b)   Small value procurement. Competitive procurement shall not be required
when the value of the goods, professional services, or nonprofessional services
is equal to or less than $5,000.
   (c)   Sole source. Procurement may be made or contract awarded by the City
Council without a competitive procurement process when there is only one
reasonable and practicable source for the required goods or services because of
the unique quality of the goods or services; availability; compatibility with
existing City programs, equipment or systems; or fitness for a particular use.
   (d)   Piggyback. Procurement may be made or contract awarded without a
competitive procurement process by the City Council when competitive
procurement has been conducted by another public agency and the price to the
City is equal or better than the price to that public agency.
   (e)   Cooperative purchasing. Procurement may be made or contract awarded
without a competitive procurement process by the City Council when goods or
services may be obtained through cooperative purchasing.
   (f)   Interagency. Formal and/or informal bidding is not required when the
contract and/or purchase is able to be performed by another governmental
agency.
   (g)   Used, leasing or renting equipment. Formal and/or informal bidding is
not required when the contract and/or purchase is for used, leased or renting
equipment.
   (h)   The procurement of services from the following specified professional
classifications, without regard to the dollar amount of the contract, is exempt
from the competitive process, but shall be selected based on qualifications:
financial services, actuaries, psychologists, medical doctors, entertainers and
performers, claims consultants, insurance brokers, attorneys-at-law and
consultants and experts used during the ongoing course of litigation in which
the City, or any boards, commissions, officers or employees are involved.
   (i)   Purchases not supported by competitive bidding process. Except where
otherwise required by law or by applicable funding conditions, goods and
services may be procured without a competitive procurement process by the City
Council for procurements which are not readily adaptable to the open market and
bidding processes. Such procurements include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Utility services (telephone, gas, water, sewer and electricity)
provided to City buildings and facilities;
      (2)   Franchises awarded by the City Council;
      (3)   Insurance or bond premiums;

the City Council may waive procurement requirements for goods and services by a
four-fifths vote upon making written findings that it is in the City's best
interest to do so.
   (l)   Exemption from competitive procurement. Agreements for professional
services may be executed without observing the bidding procedures provided if
the City Council or City Manager determines that an informal or formal
competitive process is unnecessary because a professional services provider is
the best provider for a particular agreement based on some or all of these
factors: demonstrated competence; qualifications for the types of services to
be performed; experience; knowledge of the City due to a long-standing
relationship; reasonableness of cost to perform work; or other similar relevant
criteria.
   (m)   City Council-approved on-call panels for professional and general
services. The City Manager, or their designee, may maintain a City Council-
approved on-call panel of pre-approved firms qualified to perform the type of
professional or general services required. When such an on-call panel is
maintained, the competitive selection procedures are waived. Award of tasks
under on-call contracts shall be rotated among the pre-approved firms with no
single firm receiving a substantial majority of similar work during the fiscal
year. Recognizing that certain firms on an on-call panel may have particular
expertise for certain types of projects, the rotation of firms may be limited
in these cases based on the professional judgment of City staff. Each on-call
firm, unless otherwise stated at the time of contract award by the City
Council, shall be eligible to receive work in an amount up to $50,000 per
fiscal year without the need for additional City Council approval. Whenever the
work awarded to a single on call panel firm exceeds $50,000 in a fiscal year,
City Council approval of the additional work is required.

statement in their bid requesting to be considered a qualifying local vendor
and certifying that they meet the criteria in the definition of qualifying
local vendor set forth in Section
3.08.020.
   (b)   False certifications. False certifications shall be immediate grounds
for rejection of any bid or if the contract is awarded, grounds for voiding the
bid, terminating any agreement, and seeking damages thereto. Failure to certify
the above information shall result in the bid being considered by the City
without any adjustment for the vendor as described in Subsection (c) below.
   (c)   Application of local vendor preference.
      (1)   If the award criteria is lowest responsive bidder, a qualified
local vendor shall be given a five percent reduction in price for evaluation
purposes.
      (2)   If the award criteria is best value to the City, the City shall
include criteria that gives qualifying local vendors preference in the
evaluation process. The equivalent of a five percent preference will be added
to the final evaluated score of each qualifying local vendor. If the five
percent preference causes a qualifying local vendor to have the best overall
score, the qualifying local vendor may be deemed the vendor that provides the
best value to the City, provided, said qualifying local vendor must elect to
reduce the price portion of its submission to match the price portion of the
lowest bid.

payment and performance bond are required from the successful bidder in an

methodology being used, and if the public interest will not permit the delay or
re-advertising for bids, the City may award the bid to either bidder.
   (g)   Failure to contract. If a successful bidder refuses or fails to
execute a contract within ten business days of award, the City may choose not
to award the contract and either reject all bids or award the contract to the
second-place bidder.
   (h)   Use of electronic means. Consistent with the stated policy of
promoting efficient public contract law, consistent with the best of modern
practice and research, and pursuant to the authority granted by Public Contract
Code Sections 1600 and 160l, the City shall be authorized to use an electronic
bidding system, so long as the purpose and intent of applicable state law, this
Chapter, and any supplemental rules or regulations are met. In using an
electronic bidding system, the City shall provide bidders with an electronic
receipt showing the date and time the submitted bid was received.

any emergency purchase made and the basis therefor at the next City Council
meeting following the emergency procurement.
   (j)   No competitive advantage. The City Council may dispense with otherwise
applicable competitive procurement procedures if the advertisement for bids
would be undesirable, impractical, or impossible, and if competitive
procurement would not result in any advantage to the City in efforts to
contract for the greatest public benefit. In such instances, the City Council
may procure public projects through negotiated contract, cooperative
purchasing, or by piggybacking off a competitive procurement that has been
conducted by another public agency when the price to the City is equal to or
better than the price to the public agency.
   (k)   Procurement and signature authority. Notwithstanding the provisions of

   This chapter shall be known as the “Canyon Lake Utility Users' Tax.” The
purpose of this chapter is as follows:
   (a)   The City of Canyon Lake must maintain its status as a viable,
independent City to protect the interests of its constituents and maintain
local authority and control over land use issues;
   (b)   Unless the City continues its status as an independent, self-governing
City, the residents could lose local authority over land use issues and the
residents do not wish to cede these important policy decisions to County
officials who may not be as familiar with these issues;
   (c)   Residents prefer that the Canyon Lake Fire Station remain open with
some level of service;
   (d)   The City of Canyon Lake wishes to maintain services the community has
identified as priorities, including effective 911 services, maintaining sheriff
deputy staffing levels, and keeping Railroad Canyon Road in good condition;
   (e)   The City requires locally-controlled funds for local needs—the funds
generated by the Canyon Lake Public Safety and Local Control Continuation
Measure cannot be seized by Sacramento politicians and can be only spent on our
community's needs; and
   (f)   The continued utility user tax will include published, independent
annual audits, no tax increase without voter approval, and expires when
terminated by voters.

3.26.030 Exemptions.
   (a)   Consistency with State and Federal law. Nothing in this chapter shall
be construed as imposing a tax upon any person or service when the imposition
of such tax upon such person or service would be in violation of a Federal or
State statute, the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the
State of California. Any service user who has been exempted under this
subsection shall comply with the notification requirements of subsection (k) of
this section if any change in fact or circumstance disqualifies the individual
from receiving this exemption.
   (b)   The City. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as imposing a tax
upon the City.
   (c)   Exemption application. Any service user that is exempt pursuant to
subsection (a) of this section from any tax imposed by this chapter shall file
an application with the Tax Administrator for an exemption; provided, however,
this requirement shall not apply to a service user that is a State or Federal
agency. Said application shall be made upon a form approved by the Tax
Administrator and shall state those facts, declared under penalty of perjury,
which qualify the applicant for an exemption, and shall include the names of
all service suppliers serving that service user.
   (d)   Application processing. The application shall be approved or denied by
the Tax Administrator within 75 days of receipt.
   (e)   Notice to service supplier. If the application is approved, the Tax
Administrator shall promptly notify the service user's service suppliers,
stating the name of the service user, the address to which such exempt service
is being supplied, the account number, if any, and such other information as
may be necessary for the service supplier to remove the exempt service user
from its tax billing procedure.
   (f)   Discontinuance of tax. Upon receipt of the notice of service user
exemption, the service supplier shall within 60 days discontinue billing the
service user for taxes imposed by this chapter.
   (g)   Duration of exemption. All exemptions under this section shall
continue and be renewed automatically by the Tax Administrator for as long as
the requisite facts supporting the initial qualification for exemption shall
continue. The exemption shall automatically terminate with any change in
service address or residence of the exempt individual. The individual may apply
for a new exemption with each change of service address or residence. The Tax
Administrator shall have the power and right to demand evidence of continued
eligibility. Failure to provide such evidence as is within the control of a
service user to provide may be the basis for immediate discontinuance of the
service user's eligibility for exemption under this section.
   (h)   Denial–Appeal. If the Tax Administrator determines that an application
for exemption is faulty, that the applicant has failed to truthfully set forth
facts, or that the facts do not support the application for exemption, the
application shall be denied in writing to the applicant. The applicant shall
thereafter have a right to file an amended application, or to appeal the Tax
Administrator's decision to the City Council within a ten-day period after the
mailing date of the Tax Administrator's notification.
   (i)   Duty to disclose disqualification– Investigation. Any service user who
has been exempted under this section shall notify the City within ten days of
any change in facts or circumstances that might disqualify the person from
receiving such exemption. Any service supplier that determines by any means
that a new or nonexempt service user is receiving service through a meter or
connection exempt by virtue of an exemption issued to a previous user or exempt
user of the same meter or connection, shall immediately notify the Tax
Administrator of such fact, and the Tax Administrator shall conduct an
investigation to ascertain whether or not the provisions of this section have
been complied with, and when appropriate, order the service supplier to
commence collecting the tax from the nonexempt service user.
   (j)   Penalty. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly receive
the benefit of the exemption provided by this section when the basis for such
exemption does not exist or ceases to exist.
   (k)   Exemption list. Upon request of the Tax Administrator, a service
supplier, or its billing agent, shall provide a list of the names and addresses
of those service users that, according to its billing records, are deemed
exempt from the taxes imposed by this chapter.
(Ord. 177, passed 11-6-2018)
3.26.040 Telecommunications users' tax.
   (a)   Establishment of telecommunications users' tax. There is hereby
imposed a tax upon every person in the City using telecommunication services.
The tax imposed by this section shall be at the rate of 3.95% of the charges
made for such services and shall be collected from the service user by the
telecommunication services supplier or its billing agent. There is a rebuttable
presumption that telecommunication services, which are billed to a billing or
service address in the City, are used, in whole or in part, within the City's
boundaries, and such services are subject to taxation under this chapter. If
the billing address of the service user is different from the service address,
the service address of the service user shall be used for purposes of imposing
the tax. As used in this section, the term “charges” shall include the value of
any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other
consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the
telecommunication services.
   (b)   Substantial nexus and minimum contacts. For purposes of imposing a tax
or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax under this section,
“substantial nexus” and “minimum contacts” shall be construed broadly in favor
of the imposition, collection and/or remittance of the tax to the fullest
extent permitted by State and Federal law, and as it may change from time to
time by judicial interpretation or by statutory enactment.
   (c)   Sourcing rules. Mobile telecommunications service shall be sourced in
accordance with the sourcing rules set forth in the Mobile Telecommunications
Sourcing Act (4 U.S.C. Section 124). The Tax Administrator may issue and
disseminate to telecommunication service suppliers that are subject to the tax
collection requirements of this chapter, sourcing rules for the taxation of
other telecommunication services, including but not limited to post-paid
telecommunication services, prepaid telecommunication services, and private
tele- communication services, provided that such rules are based upon custom
and common practice that further administrative efficiency and minimize multi-
jurisdictional taxation.
   (d)   Authority for administrative rulings. The Tax Administrator may, from
time to time, issue and disseminate to telecommunication service suppliers that
are subject to the tax collection requirements of this section an
administrative ruling identifying those communication services that are subject
to the tax of subsection (a) above. This administrative ruling shall be
consistent with legal nexus rules, regulations, and laws pertaining to
telecommunication services. To the extent that the Tax Administrator determines
that the tax imposed under this section shall not be collected in full for any
period of time, such a determination falls within the Tax Administrator's
discretion to settle disputes. The Tax Administrator's exercise of forbearance
under this subsection does not constitute a change in taxing methodology for
purposes of Government Code Section 53750, and the City does not waive or
abrogate its ability to impose the telecommunication users' tax in full.
   (e)   Specific inclusions in telecommunication services. As used in this
section, the term “telecommunication services” shall include, but are not
limited to, charges for the following: connection, reconnection, termination,
movement, or change of telecommunication services; late payment fees; detailed
billing; central office and custom calling features (including but not limited
to call waiting, call forwarding, caller identification and three-way calling);

service user, upon proof to the Tax Administrator that the service user has
previously paid the same tax in another state or local jurisdiction on such
telecommunication services, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed
to the extent of the amount of such tax legally imposed in such other state or
local jurisdiction; provided, however, the amount of credit shall not exceed
the tax owed to the City under this section.
   (i)   Collection of telecommunication users' tax. The telecommunication
users' tax imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by

agent. There is a rebuttable presumption that video services that are billed to
a billing or service address in the City are used, in whole or in part, within
the City's boundaries, and such services are subject to taxation under this

service address, the service address of the service user shall be used for
purposes of imposing the tax.
   (b)   Video charges. As used in this section, the term “charges” shall
include, but is not limited to, charges for the following:
      (1)   Regulatory fees and surcharges, franchise fees, and access fees

programming or communications over the leased channel; provided that, in the
absence of evidence of direct payment by the service user, the indirect payment
of the service user(s), which is subject to the utility users’ tax, shall be
deemed to be the lease payment to the video service supplier by the party
leasing the channel access.
   (c)   Charges further defined. As used in this section, the term “charges”
shall include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kind
or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for

rulings. The Tax Administrator shall, from time to time, survey the video
service suppliers in the City to identify the various components of the video
service that are being offered to customers within the City, and the charges
therefor. The Tax Administrator may, thereafter, issue and disseminate to such
video service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components:
(1) that are necessary or common to the receipt, use and enjoyment of video
services; or (2) which currently are, or historically have been, included in a
bundled rate for video service by a local distribution company. Charges for
such components shall be subject to the tax of subsection (a) above.
   (e)   Collection of video users' tax. The tax imposed by this section shall
be collected from the service user by the video service supplier, its billing
agent, or a reseller of such services. In the case of video service, the

(e.g., an apartment owner), unless such service is resold to individual users,
in which case the service user shall be theultimate purchaser of the video
service. The amount of tax collected in one month shall be remitted to the Tax
Administrator, and must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the
twentieth day of the following month.

suppliers to collect and remit the taxes imposed by the provisions of this
chapter shall be performed as follows:
      (1)   The tax shall be collected by service suppliers insofar as
practicable at the same time as, and along with, the collection of the charges
made in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier.
Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the
full amount of the charge and tax which was accrued for the billing period, a
proportionate share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been
paid. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of
refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges, Section 3.26.160 shall apply.
      (2)   The duty of a service supplier to collect the tax from a service
user shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period
applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such
regular billing are subject to the provisions of this chapter. Where a service
user receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods
than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing
period.
   (b)   Filing return and payment. Each person required by this chapter to
remit a tax shall file a return to the Tax Administrator, on forms approved by
the Tax Administrator, on or before the due date. The full amount of the tax
collected shall be included with the return and filed with the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator is authorized to require such additional
information as he or she deems necessary to determine if the tax is being
levied, collected, and remitted in accordance with this chapter. Returns are
due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. Pursuant to Revenue
and Tax Code Section 7284.6, the Tax Administrator, and its agents, shall
maintain such filing returns as confidential information that is exempt from
the disclosure provisions of the Public Records Act.

are delinquent if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before the due
date. Should the due date occur on a weekend or legal holiday, the return must

the weekend or legal holiday. A direct deposit, including electronic fund
transfers and other similar methods of electronically exchanging monies between
financial accounts, made by a service supplier in satisfaction of its
obligations under this subsection, shall be considered timely if the transfer
is initiated on or before the due date, and the transfer settles into the
City's account on the following business day.
   (b)   Failure to collect or remit. If the person required to collect and/or
remit a tax imposed pursuant to this chapter fails to collect the tax (by
failing to properly assess the tax on one or more services or charges on the
customer's billing) or fails to remit the tax collected on or before the due
date, the Tax Administrator shall attach a penalty for such delinquencies or
deficiencies at the rate of 15% of the total tax that is delinquent or
deficient in the remittance, and shall charge simple interest at the rate of 9%
per year, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of
penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent, until
paid.
   (c)   Penalties for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or remitting. The
Tax Administrator shall have the power to impose additional penalties upon
persons required to collect and remit taxes pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or remitting at the

remitted, or as recomputed by the Tax Administrator.
   (d)   Penalties due as tax. For collection purposes only, every penalty
imposed and such interest that is accrued under the provisions of this section
shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid.
   (e)   Authority to modify due dates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tax
Administrator may, in his or her discretion, modify the due dates of this
chapter to be consistent with any uniform standards or procedures that are
mutually agreed upon by other public agencies imposing a utility user's tax, or
otherwise legally established, to create a central payment location or
mechanism.

3.26.140 Actions to collect.
   Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this
chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the City. Any such
tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the Tax
Administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the City by the person required to
collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person
owing money to the City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable in
an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount,
including penalties and interest as provided for in this chapter, along with
any collection costs incurred by the City as a result of the person's
noncompliance with this chapter, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys' fees. Any tax required to be collected by a service supplier or owed
by a service user is an unsecured priority excise tax obligation under 11

deficiency determination if he or she determines that any service user or
service supplier required to pay or collect taxes pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter has failed to pay, collect, and/or remit the proper amount of tax
by improperly applying or by failing to apply the tax to one or more taxable
services or charges. Nothing herein shall require that the Tax Administrator
institute proceedings under this section if, in the opinion of the Tax
Administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement likely outweighs the tax
benefit.
   (b)   Notice of deficiency. The Tax Administrator shall mail a notice of
such deficiency determination to the person or entity allegedly owing the tax,
which notice shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus simple
interest at the rate of 9% per year, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of
the tax from the date on which the tax should have been received by the City.
Within 14 days after the date of service of such notice, the person or entity
allegedly owing the tax may request in writing to the Tax Administrator a
hearing on the matter.
   (c)   Hearing on deficiency. If the person or entity allegedly owing the tax
fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time period, the amount of the
deficiency determination shall become a final assessment, and shall immediately
be due and owing to the City. If such person or entity requests a hearing, the
Tax Administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing, which shall be
scheduled within 30 days after receipt of the written request for hearing.
Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed by the Tax
Administrator to such person at least ten days prior to the hearing, and, if
the Tax Administrator desires said person to produce specific records at such
hearing, such notice may designate the records requested to be produced.
   (d)   Determination after hearing. At the time fixed for the hearing, the
Tax Administrator shall hear all relevant testimony and evidence, including
that of any other interested parties. At the discretion of the Tax
Administrator, the hearing may be continued from time to time for the purpose
of allowing the presentation of additional evidence. Within a reasonable time
following the conclusion of the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall issue a
final assessment (or non-assessment), thereafter, by confirming, modifying or
rejecting the original deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such
final assessment to the person or entity owing the tax. The decision of the Tax
Administrator may be appealed pursuant to Section 3.26.200, and such an appeal
and a final decision thereon is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.
   (e)   Delinquencies. Payment of the final assessment shall become delinquent
if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before the thirtieth day
following the date of receipt of the notice of final assessment. The penalty
for delinquency shall be 15% on the total amount of the assessment, along with
simple interest at the rate of 9% per year, or any fraction thereof, on the
amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date of delinquency, until
paid. The applicable statute of limitations regarding a claim by the City
seeking payment of a tax assessed under this chapter shall commence from the
date of delinquency as provided in this subsection.
   (f)   Notice of delinquency. All notices under this section may be sent by
regular mail, first class, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the
third calendar day following the date of mailing, as established by a proof of
mailing.
(Ord. 177, passed 11-6-2018)
3.26.160 Administrative remedy–Non-paying service users.
   (a)   Administrative remedies for the obligation to collect tax. Whenever
the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld
the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the amounts remitted to a
person required to collect the tax, or whenever the Tax Administrator deems it
in the best interest of the City, he or she may relieve such person of the
obligation to collect the taxes due under this chapter from certain named
service users for specific billing periods. To the extent the service user has
failed to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two or more billing
periods, the service supplier may be so relieved of the obligation to collect
taxes due. The service supplier shall provide the City with the names and
addresses of such service users and the amounts of taxes owed under the
provisions of this chapter. Nothing herein shall require that the Tax
Administrator institute proceedings under this section if, in the opinion of
the Tax Administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement likely outweighs
the tax benefit.
   (b)   Delinquency penalty. In addition to the tax owed, the service user
shall pay all penalties and interest due under Section
3.26.130(b), as well as the delinquency penalty set out in Section
3.26.130(c), on the amount of the tax, from the due date, until paid, as well
as any and all costs of collection.
   (c)   Notice to non-paying service user. The Tax Administrator shall notify
the non-paying service user that the Tax Administrator has assumed the
responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand
payment of such taxes, including penalties and interest. The notice shall be
served on the service user by personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in
the United States mail, first class, postage prepaid, addressed to the service
user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect
the tax; should the service user have a change of address, notice shall be sent
to his or her last known address.
   (d)   Additional penalties. If the service user fails to remit the tax to
the Tax Administrator within 30 days from the date of the service of the notice
upon him or her, the Tax Administrator may impose an additional penalty of 15%
of the amount of the total tax that is owed.
(Ord. 177, passed 11-6-2018)
3.26.170 Additional powers and duties of the Tax Administrator.
   (a)   Enforcement by Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall have the
power and duty, and is hereby directed, to enforce each and all of the
provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   Administrative regulations regarding payment. The Tax Administrator
may adopt administrative rules and regulations consistent with provisions of
this chapter for the purpose of interpreting, clarifying, carrying out and
enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes herein imposed.
The administrative ruling shall not impose a new tax, revise an existing tax
methodology as stated in this section, or increase an existing tax, except as
allowed by California Government Code Section 53750. A copy of such
administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in the Tax
Administrator's office. To the extent that the Tax Administrator determines
that the tax imposed under this chapter shall not be collected in full for any
period of time from any particular service supplier or service user, that
determination shall be considered an exercise of the Tax Administrator's
discretion to settle disputes and shall not constitute a change in taxing
methodology for purposes of Government Code Section 53750 or otherwise. The Tax
Administrator is not authorized to amend the City's methodology for purposes of
Government Code Section 53750 and the City does not waive or abrogate its
ability to impose any tax established by this chapter in full as a result of
promulgating administrative rulings or entering into agreements.
   (c)   Administrative agreements regarding billing procedures. Upon a proper
showing of good cause, the Tax Administrator may make administrative
agreements, with appropriate conditions, to vary from the strict requirements
of this chapter and thereby: (1) conform to the billing procedures of a
particular service supplier so long as said agreements result in the collection
of the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this chapter;
or (2) to avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection and
remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such agreement
shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office, and are voidable by the Tax
Administrator or the City Council at any time.
   (d)   Compliance audits. The Tax Administrator may conduct an audit, to
ensure proper compliance with the requirements of this chapter, of any person
required to collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this chapter. The Tax
Administrator shall notify said person of the initiation of an audit in
writing. In the absence of fraud or other intentional misconduct, the audit
period of review shall not exceed a period of three years next preceding the
date of receipt of the written notice by said person from the Tax
Administrator. Upon completion of the audit, the Tax Administrator may make a
deficiency determination pursuant to Section
3.26.150(a) for all taxes (and applicable penalties and interest) owed and not
paid, as evidenced by information provided by such person to the Tax
Administrator. If said person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient
records to enable the Tax Administrator to verify compliance with this chapter,
the Tax Administrator is authorized to make a reasonable estimate of the
deficiency. Said reasonable estimate shall be entitled to a rebuttable
presumption of correctness.
   (e)   Extension of time. Upon receipt of a written request of a taxpayer,
and for good cause, the Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing any
statement required pursuant to this chapter for a period of not to exceed 45
days, provided that the time for filing the required statement has not already
passed when the request is received. No penalty for delinquent payment shall
accrue by reason of such extension. Interest shall accrue during said extension
at the rate of 9% per year, prorated for any portion thereof.
   (f)   Eligibility for exemption. The Tax Administrator shall determine the
eligibility of any person who asserts a right to exemption from, or a refund
of, the tax imposed by this chapter.
   (g)   Waiver of penalties and interest. Notwithstanding any provision in
this chapter to the contrary, the Tax Administrator may waive any penalty or
interest imposed upon a person required to collect and/or remit for failure to
collect the tax imposed by this chapter, if the non-collection occurred in good
faith. In determining whether the non-collection was in good faith, the Tax
Administrator shall take into consideration industry practice or other
precedence.
(Ord. 177, passed 11-6-2018)
3.26.180 Records.
   (a)   Retention of necessary tax records. It shall be the duty of every
person required to collect and/or remit to the City any tax imposed by this
chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of at least three years, all records
as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he/she may have been
liable for the collection of and remittance to the Tax Administrator, which
records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at a reasonable
time.
   (b)   Administrative subpoenas. The City may issue an administrative
subpoena to compel a person to deliver to the Tax Administrator copies of all
records deemed necessary by the Tax Administrator to establish compliance with
this chapter, including the delivery of records in a common electronic format
on readily available media if such records are kept electronically by the
person in the usual and ordinary course of business. As an alternative to
delivering the subpoenaed records to the Tax Administrator on or before the due
date provided in the administrative subpoena, such person may provide access to
such records outside the City on or before the due date, provided that such
person shall reimburse the City for all reasonable travel expenses incurred by
the City to inspect those records, including travel, lodging, meals, and other
similar expenses, but excluding the normal salary or hourly wages of those
persons designated by the City to conduct the inspection.
   (c)   Non-disclosure agreements. The Tax Administrator is authorized to
execute a non-disclosure agreement approved by the City Attorney to protect the
confidentiality of customer information pursuant to California Revenue and Tax
Code Sections 7284.6 and 7284.7.
   (d)   Use of billing agents. If a service supplier uses a billing agent or
billing aggregator to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax, the service supplier
shall: (1) provide to the Tax Administrator the name, address and telephone
number of each billing agent and billing aggregator currently authorized by the
service supplier to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax to the City; and (2)
upon request of the Tax Administrator, deliver, or effect the delivery of, any
information or records in the possession of such billing agent or billing
aggregator that, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, is necessary to
verify the proper application, calculation, collection and/or remittance of
such tax to the City.
   (e)   Access to necessary records. If any person subject to record-keeping
under this section unreasonably denies the Tax Administrator access to such
records, or fails to produce the information requested in an administrative
subpoena within the time specified, then the Tax Administrator may impose a
penalty of $500 on such person for each day following: (1) the initial date
that the person refuses to provide such access; or (2) the due date for
production of records as set forth in the administrative subpoena. This penalty
shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed under this chapter.
(Ord. 177, passed 11-6-2018)
3.26.190 Refunds.
   Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid, paid more than once, or
erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax Administrator under
this chapter from a person or service supplier, it may be refunded as provided
in this section as follows:
   (a)   Refund application. Any individual entitled to be exempt from the
taxes imposed by this chapter, who paid more than $3 in such taxes, may, during
the 12-month period following such payment, apply for a refund thereof, on
forms provided by the Tax Administrator. Refund applications shall contain a
declaration of those facts, under oath, which qualify the applicant for a
refund, and shall be accompanied by the customer's bills showing the amount of
such taxes billed by the service supplier during the preceding calendar year.
Refund claims may be filed by an individual who used the services and paid the
taxes prescribed by this chapter, either directly or indirectly, to the service
user rather than to the service supplier. In the event the applicant has lost
or destroyed any relevant billings or statements showing the amount of tax
paid, or if the applicant indirectly paid such taxes in conjunction with the
occupation of premises without receiving a specific billing therefor from the
service user, the maximum refund shall be $25, or $2 for each full month of
services received by the applicant, whichever is less.
   (b)   Written claim for refund. No refund shall be paid under the provisions
of this section unless the claimant, or his or her guardian, conservator,
executor, or administrator, has submitted a written claim to the Tax
Administrator within one year of the overpayment or erroneous or illegal
collection of said tax. To be timely, such claim must clearly establish
claimant's right to the refund by written records showing entitlement thereto.
Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a claim on behalf of a class or group
of taxpayers, unless each member of the class has submitted a written claim
under penalty of perjury as provided by this subsection or as otherwise allowed
by law.
   (c)   Compliance with claims act. The filing of a written claim pursuant to
Government Code Section 935 is a prerequisite to any suit thereon. Any action
brought against the City pursuant to this section shall be subject to the
provisions of Government Code Sections 945.6 and 946. The City Manager or City
Council shall act upon the refund claim within the time period set forth in
Government Code Sections 912.4 et seq. If the City Manager or City Council
fails or refuses to act on a refund claim within the time prescribed by
Government Section 912.4, the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected by
the City Council on the last day of the period within which the City Council
was required to act upon the claim as provided in Government Code Section
912.4. The Tax Administrator shall give notice of the action in a form which
substantially complies with that set forth in Government Code Section 913.
   (d)   Refunds to service suppliers. The Tax Administrator may, at his or her
discretion, give written permission to a service supplier, who has collected
and remitted any amount of tax in excess of the amount of tax imposed by this
chapter, to claim credit for such overpayment against the amount of tax which
is due the City upon a subsequent monthly return to the Tax Administrator,
provided that: (1) such credit is claimed in a return dated no later than one
year from the date of overpayment or erroneous collection of said tax; (2) the
Tax Administrator is satisfied that the underlying basis and amount of such
credit has been reasonably established; and (3) in the case of an overpayment
by a service user to the service supplier that has been remitted to the City,
the Tax Administrator has received proof, to his or her satisfaction, that the
overpayment has been refunded by the service supplier to the service user in an
amount equal to the requested credit.
   (e)   Overpayments as credits. Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (c)
above, a service supplier shall be entitled to take any overpayment as a credit
against an underpayment whenever such overpayment has been received by the City
within the three years next preceding a deficiency determination or assessment
by the Tax Administrator in connection with an audit instituted by the Tax
Administrator pursuant to Section
3.26.170(d). A service supplier shall not be entitled to such credit unless it
clearly establishes the right to the credit by written records showing
entitlement thereto. Under no circumstances shall an overpayment taken as a
credit against an underpayment pursuant to this subsection qualify a service
supplier for a refund to which it would not otherwise be entitled under the
one-year written claim requirement of this section.
(Ord. 177, passed 11-6-2018)
3.26.200 Appeals.
   (a)   Administrative appeals. The provisions of this section apply to any
decision (other than a decision related to an exemption determination pursuant
to Section
3.26.030 or a decision relating to a refund pursuant to Section
3.26.190). Any person otherwise aggrieved by any decision, deficiency
determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator,
shall be required to comply with the appeals procedure of this section.
Compliance with this section shall be a prerequisite to a suit thereon. (See
Government Code Section 935(b).) Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a
claim or action on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers except as otherwise
provided by law.
   (b)   Appeal of Tax Administrator's decision. If any person is aggrieved by
any such decision, deficiency determination, assessment, or administrative
ruling of the Tax Administrator, he or she may appeal by filing a notice of
appeal with the City Clerk within 14 days of the date of the decision,
deficiency determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of the Tax
Administrator which aggrieved said person.
   (c)   Scheduling of administrative appeal hearing. The matter shall be
scheduled for hearing before an independent hearing officer selected by the
City Manager, no more than 30 days from the receipt of the appeal. The
appellant shall be served with notice of the time and place of the hearing, as
well as any relevant materials, at least five calendar days prior to the
hearing. The hearing may be continued from time to time upon mutual consent. At
the time of the hearing, the appealing party, the Tax Administrator, and any
other interested person may present such relevant evidence as he or she may
have relating to the determination from which the appeal is taken.
   (d)   Notice of decision. Based upon the submission of such evidence and the
review of the City's files, the hearing officer shall issue a written notice
and order upholding, modifying or reversing the determination from which the
appeal is taken. The notice shall be given within 14 days after the conclusion
of the hearing and shall state the reasons for the decision. The notice shall
specify that the decision is final and that any petition for judicial review
shall be filed within 90 days from the date of the decision in accordance with
Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6.
   (e)   Manner of notice. All notices under this section may be sent by
regular first class mail, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the
third calendar day following the date of mailing, as established by a proof of
mailing.
(Ord. 177, passed 11-6-2018)
3.26.210 Notice of changes to chapter.
   If a tax under this chapter is added, repealed, increased, reduced, or the
tax base is changed, the Tax Administrator shall follow the notice requirements
of California Public Utilities Code Section 799 for notification to service
providers.
(Ord. 177, passed 11-6-2018)
3.26.220 Effect of State and Federal reference–Authorization.
   (a)   Unless specifically provided otherwise, any reference to a State or
Federal statute in this chapter shall mean such statute as it may be amended
from time to time, provided that such reference to a statute herein shall not
include any subsequent amendment thereto, or to any subsequent change of
interpretation thereto by a State or Federal agency or court of law with the
duty to interpret such law, to the extent that such amendment or change of
interpretation would require voter approval under California law, or to the
extent that such change would result in a tax decrease (as a result of
excluding all or a part of a communication service, or charge therefor, from
taxation). Only to the extent voter approval would otherwise be required or a
tax decrease would result, the prior version of the statute (or interpretation)
shall remain applicable; for any application or situation that would not
require voter approval or result in a decrease of a tax, provisions of the
amended statute (or new interpretation) shall be applicable to the maximum
possible extent.
   (b)   To the extent that the City's authorization to collect or impose any
tax imposed under this chapter is expanded or limited as a result of changes in
State or Federal law, no amendment or modification of this chapter shall be
required to conform the tax to those changes, and the tax shall be imposed and
collected to the full extent of the authorization, up to the full amount of the
tax imposed under this chapter.
(Ord. 177, passed 11-6-2018)
3.26.230 Independent audit.
   The City shall annually verify that the taxes owed under this chapter have
been properly applied, exempted, collected, and remitted in accordance with
this chapter, and properly expended according to applicable law. The annual
verification shall be performed by a qualified, independent third party, and
the review shall employ reasonable, cost-effective steps to assure compliance,
including the use of sampling audits.
(Ord. 177, passed 11-6-2018)
3.26.240 Effective date.
   Service providers shall begin to collect the tax imposed by this chapter as
soon as feasible after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
chapter, but in no event later than January 1, 2021.
(Ord. 177, passed 11-6-2018)
3.26.250 Remedies cumulative.
   All remedies and penalties prescribed by this chapter or which are available
under any other provision of law or equity, including but not limited to the
City's Municipal Code, the California False Claims Act (Government Code Section
12650 et seq.) and the California Unfair Practices Act (Business and
Professions Code Section 17070 et seq.), are cumulative. The use of one or more
remedies by the City shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose
of enforcing the provisions of this chapter.

(3-12/90 § 3.24.010)
3.28.020 Definitions.
   The following words and phrases shall, for the purposes of this Chapter, be
defined as follows, unless it is clearly apparent from the context that another
meaning is intended.
   (a)   “Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is
occupied or intended or designed for use or occupancy by transients, including
but not limited to dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any
hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, public campsite or recreational
vehicle site, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house,
apartment house, time-share project or facility offered for public use,
dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed
location, or other similar structure or portion thereof, duplex, triplex,
singlefamily dwelling units except any private dwelling house or other
individually owned single-family dwelling house unit rented only occasionally
(infrequently) and incidentally to the normal occupancy by the owner or his
family; provided that the burden of establishing that the housing or facility
is a hotel as defined herein shall be upon the owner or operator thereof who
shall file with the Tax Administrator such information as the Tax Administrator
may require, to establish and maintain such status.
   (b)   “Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right or entitlement
to the use or possession, of any hotel, room, rooms or any portion thereof
offered for rent to be used or occupied for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes regardless of the purpose for which such rooms are rented or provided.
   (c)   “Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel whether in
the capacity of owner, lessee, sub-lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee,
or in any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or its functions
through a managing agent of any type or character, the managing agent shall
also be deemed an operator for the purpose of this Chapter, and shall have
jointly and severally the same duties and liabilities as the principal.
Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter by either the principal or the
managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   (d)   “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or
any other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (e)   “Rent” means the amount of the consideration charged or chargeable to
the tenant or person entitled to occupancy, for the occupancy of space, valued
in money whether received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including the
full value of receipts, cash, credits, property or services of any kind or
nature, without any deduction whatsoever. “Rent” may have been, or may be in
part, payable or paid prior to or following (in whole or in part) the occupancy
to which it is attributable, and may have been paid in whole or in part in
advance on a long-term basis, such as in a time-share project or similar
arrangement. It is not the intent of this Subsection to make the operator
liable for the tax on uncollected rent. However, uncollected rent must be
reported.
   (f)   “Tax Administrator” means the City Manager or his designated agent,
whether a City employee or County officer or employee.
   (g)   “Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to
occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, or other
agreement of whatever nature, for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or
less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any person so occupying
space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient if his actual total period
of occupancy does not exceed 30 days, unless there is a written agreement
between the operator and occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy.
Unless days of occupancy or entitlement to occupancy by one person are
consecutive without any break, then prior or subsequent periods of such
occupancy or entitlement to occupancy shall not be counted when determining
whether a period exceeds the stated 30 calendar days.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.020)
3.28.030 Tax imposed.
   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to,
and shall pay a tax in the amount of 10% of the rent charged by the operator or
otherwise payable by the transient. Insofar as the transient is concerned, said
tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the operator or to the City. If
the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be
paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s
ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If the tax is not paid to the hotel
operator, the Tax Administrator may require payment directly to him.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.030)
3.28.040 Exemptions.
   No tax shall be imposed upon any officer or employee of a foreign government
who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international
treaty. No exemptions shall be granted except upon written claim therefor made
under penalty of perjury at the time the rent is paid, upon a form prescribed
by the Tax Administrator. Federal, State and local officers and employees are
not exempt.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.040)
3.28.050 Operator’s duties.
   Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this Chapter to the same
extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The
amount of the tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent
charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt of payment from the
operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator; or that it will not be added to the rent;
or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter
provided.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.050)
3.28.060 Registration.
   (a)   Within 30 days after commencing business or by January 1, 1991, every
person desiring to engage in or conduct business as operator of a hotel renting
to transients within the City shall file with the Tax Administrator an
application for a transient occupancy registration permit for each place of
business. Every application for such a permit shall be made upon a form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator and shall set forth the name under which
the applicant transacts or intends to transact business, the location of his
place of business and such other information as the Tax Administrator may
require. The application shall be signed by the owner if a natural person, if a
member or partner, if an association or partnership, by an executive officer or
some person specifically authorized by the corporation to sign the application
in the case of a corporation. The transient occupancy registration permit must
be in effect at all times while the business is in operation and shall be at
all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Said permit shall,
among other things, state the following:
      (1)   Name of hotel;
      (2)   Name of operator;
      (3)   Hotel address;
      (4)   The date upon which the permit was issued; and
      (5)   “This Transient Occupancy Registration Permit signifies that the
person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient
Occupancy Tax Chapter by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose

to the amount of tax, plus interest at the rate of 0.5% per month, or fraction

penalties stated in Section
3.28.100.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.110)
3.28.120 Failure to collect and report tax--Determination of Tax Administrator.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect said tax and to make, within the
time provided in this Chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any
portion thereof required by this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed
in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to
base his estimate on the tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator procures
such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the
assessment of any tax imposed by the Chapter payable by any operator who has
failed or refused to collect the same and make such report and remittance, he
shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest
and penalties provided for by this Chapter. In case such determination is made,
the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving
it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepared,
addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known address. Such operator
may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make
application in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the amount
assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the
time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax
Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and
payable. If such application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give not less
than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator
to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount
specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At
such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified
tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Tax
Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall
thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of
the determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The
amount determined to be due shall be payable within fifteen days unless an
appeal is taken as provided in Section
3.28.130.

City Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 15 days of
serving of the assessment or determination of tax and penalties, if any, due.
The City Council shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal, and the
City Clerk shall give notice in writing to the operator at his last known
address. The findings of the City Council shall be final and conclusive and
shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service
of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and
payable upon the service of notice.

Administrator shall have the right to inspect such records at all reasonable
times and may subpoena the records of any operator who refuses to make them
available for examination.

stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is
founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator within three years of the date of
payment. The claims shall be on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a
credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the person or credited to rent subsequently payable by the
person to the operator.
   (c)   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than
once erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by filing a
claim in the manner provided in Subsection (a) of this Section, but only when
the tax was paid by the transient directly to the Tax Administrator, or when
the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the
satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that the transient has been unable to
obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records.

Administrator shall give to the operator written notice of the suspension or
revocation of any of his permits. The notices herein required may be served
personally or by mail in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a
deficiency determination. The Tax Administrator shall not issue a new permit
after the revocation of a permit unless he is satisfied that the former holder
of the permit will comply with the provisions of this Chapter relating to the
occupancy tax and regulations of the Tax Administrator.

Administrator has complied with all provisions of this Chapter in the
determination of the amount required to be remitted and paid. From the time of
the filing for record, the amount required to be remitted together with
penalties and interest shall constitute a lien upon all real property in the

administrators, or heirs is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the
deceased;
      (4)   Whenever the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or
absent person required to pay any amount under this Chapter are levied upon by
process law. This Chapter does not give the City a preference over any recorded
lien which attached prior to the date when the amounts required to be paid
became a lien.
   (b)   The preference given to the City by this Section shall be subordinate
to the preferences given to claims for personal services by Sections 1204 and
1206 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

liens and for the collection of any amount required to be paid to the City
under this Chapter. The warrant shall be directed to any sheriff, marshal, or
constable and shall have the

purchase.

deposit in a bank or other credits or personal property in the possession or
under the control of the bank, to be effective the notice shall be delivered or
mailed to the branch or office of such bank at which such deposit is carried or
at which such credits or personal property is held. If any person so notified

hereunder during the effective period of the notice to withhold, he shall be

month the time for making any return or paying any amount required to be paid
under this Chapter. The extension may be granted at any time, provided a
request therefore is filed with the Tax Administrator within or prior to the
period for which the extension may be granted. Any person to whom an extension
is granted shall pay, in addition to the tax, interest at the rate of one
percent per month or fraction thereof, from the date on which the tax would

3.39.010 Findings.
   (a)   The preservation of vegetation communities and natural areas within
the City and western Riverside County which support species covered by the
MSHCP is necessary to protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of
all the citizens of the City by reducing the adverse direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects of urbanization and development and providing for permanent
conservation of habitat for species covered by the MSHCP.
   (b)   It is necessary to update certain development impact fees to ensure
that all new development within the City pays its fair share of the costs of
acquiring and preserving vegetation communities and natural areas within the
City and the region which are known to support plant and wildlife species
covered by the MSHCP.
   (c)   A proper funding source to pay the costs associated with mitigating
the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of development to the natural
ecosystems within the City and the region, as identified in the MSHCP, is a
development impact fee for residential, commercial, and industrial development.
The amount of the fee is determined by the nature and extent of the impacts
from the development to the identified natural ecosystems and or the relative
cost of mitigating such impacts.
   (d)   The MSHCP and the 2020 Nexus Study, a copy of which is on file in the
City Clerk's office, provides a basis for the imposition of development impact
fees on new construction.
   (e)   The use of the development impact fees to mitigate the impacts to the
City's and the region's natural ecosystems is reasonably related to the type
and extent of impacts caused by development within the City.
   (f)   The costs of funding the proper mitigation of natural ecosystems and
biological resources impacted by development within the City and the region are
apportioned relative to the type and extent of impacts caused by the
development.
   (g)   The facts and evidence provided to the City establish that there is a
reasonable relationship between the need for preserving the natural ecosystems
in the City and the region, as defined in the MSHCP, and the direct, indirect,
and cumulative impacts to such natural ecosystems and biological resources
created by the types of development on which the fee will be imposed, and that
there is a reasonable relationship between the fee's use and the types of
development for which the fee is charged. This reasonable relationship is
described in more detail in the MSHCP and the 2020 Nexus Study.
   (h)   The cost estimates for mitigating the impact of development on the
City's and the region's natural ecosystem and biological resources, as set
forth in the MSHCP, are reasonable and will not exceed the reasonably estimated
total of these costs.
   (i)   The fee set forth herein does not reflect the entire cost of the lands
which need to be acquired in order to implement the MSHCP and mitigate the
impact caused by new development. Additional revenues will be required from
other sources. The City Council finds that the benefit to each development
project is greater than the amount of the fee to be paid by the project.
   (j)   The fees collected pursuant to this Chapter shall be used to finance
the acquisition and perpetual conservation of the natural ecosystems and
certain improvements necessary to implement the goals and objectives of the
MSHCP.
(Ord. 207, passed 6-2-2021)
3.39.020 Administrative responsibility.
   The RCA is hereby reaffirmed as the administrator of this Chapter. The RCA
is hereby authorized to receive all fees generated from the Local Development
Mitigation Fee within the City, and to invest, account for, and expend such
fees in accordance with the provisions of the MSHCP, MSHCP Implementing
Ordinance, this Chapter, and the MSHCP Mitigation Fee Implementation Manual.
The detailed administrative procedures concerning the implementation of this
Chapter shall be contained in the MSHCP Mitigation Fee Implementation Manual
adopted December 7, 2020 and as may be amended from time to time. The RCA Board
of Directors may adopt a policy that will allow the City to authorize the RCA
to calculate the fees due and collect those amounts directly from property
owners. If such a policy is adopted, it will be included in the MSHCP
Mitigation Fee Implementation Manual.

procedures, including sale in case of delinquency, as provided for such taxes.
All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of ad valorem
property taxes shall be applicable to such assessments, except that, if any
real property to which such fees or charges relate has been transferred or
conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide
encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date
on which the first installment of such taxes would become delinquent, then the

penalties, and/or costs of collection associated with the original amount.
Notwithstanding the collection methods described above, any debt owing to the
City is subject to recovery using any procedure for debt collection permitted
by law. The procedures set forth in this Chapter are in addition to and not in
derogation of any other provision for collection of a debt owing to the City.
The City Manager may contract for the services of a collection agency to
recover amounts due as a debt owing to the City. If the election is made to use
a collection agency, such use shall be consistent with the provisions set forth
herein. Employment of a collection agency shall not include the services of a
licensed attorney and shall not include participation in any court proceeding
by the collection agency on behalf of the City except with the prior written
approval of the City Attorney. Prior to transfer of the account to a collection
agency, the City Manager or their designee shall notify the debtor in writing,
at the address of record, that the alleged debt owing to the City will be
turned over for private collection unless the account is paid or appealed
within a designated time period. Assignment or other legal transfer of the
rights in an account to the collection agency may be made by the City Manager
with the approval of the City Attorney. No debt owing to the City shall be
transferred to a collection agency if the account has been contested.

advance deposit of the fee as required may file a request for an advance
deposit hardship waiver at the same time as filing the appeal. The failure of

person's administrative remedies with regard to the advance deposit hardship
waiver.

writing and describe with particularity the person's actual financial inability
demonstrating why all or a part of the fee cannot be paid. Further, the written
request for an advance deposit hardship waiver must be accompanied by a sworn
affidavit, together with any supporting documents or materials, demonstrating
to the satisfaction of the City Manager, or his or her designee, the person's
actual financial inability that necessitates an advance deposit hardship
waiver. The City Manager, or his or her designee, is entitled to request
additional documentation and information from the person in order to fully
assess the waiver request. The failure of any person to timely submit all
requested additional documentation and information to the City Manager, or his
or her designee, as requested shall be deemed a failure to exhaust the person's
administrative remedies with regard to the advance deposit hardship waiver.
      (3)   Once a complete written request for an advance deposit hardship
waiver is filed with the City Clerk, or his or her designee, the requirement of
depositing the full amount of the fine shall be stayed until the City Manager,
or his or her designee, determines whether to grant, grant in part, or deny the
request. The written determination of the City Manager, or his or her designee,
shall be final. If the City Manager, or his or her designee, grants the advance
deposit hardship waiver, the person shall not be required to deposit the fine
in advance of the appeal. If the City Manager, or his or her designee, grants
the advance deposit hardship waiver in part, or denies the advance deposit
hardship waiver, then the person shall remit the amount specified in the
decision on the advance deposit hardship waiver within ten calendar days.
   (c)   The City Manager, or their designee, shall not consider the appeal of
the charge of an EMS Subscription Fee or EMS response fee unless and until a
request for appeal has been filed in conformity with Section
3.44.060(b) has been submitted, and, if applicable, the fee has been deposited
or an advance deposit hardship waiver has been filed. After considering the
written appeal setting forth the reasons and any relevant documentation or
other evidence showing why the person is not responsible for payment of the
fee, the City Manager, or their designee, shall issue a written decision within
60 days and shall include the reasons for that decision. The decision of the
City Manager, or their designee, shall be final. If the City Manager, or their
designee, determines that the charge of the fee should be upheld, then the fee
amount on deposit with the City shall be retained by the City. If the City
Manager, or their designee, determines that the fee was improperly charged,
then the City shall promptly refund the amount of the deposited fee.
   (d)   In exceptional or unusual circumstances, the City Manager or their
designee may elect not to charge an otherwise applicable EMS Response Fee.
"Exceptional or unusual circumstances" include, but are not limited to, the
following: (i) cases in which the patient dies before EMS personnel arrive; or
(ii) cases in which the patient dies while EMS personnel are providing
emergency medical services. The City Manager or their designee may also waive
the EMS Response Fee for any patient who demonstrates that the combined gross
income of all members of the patient's residence is less than the amount
established for Riverside County by the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development for low income or very low-income families for the applicable
household size. The income exemption limit provided herein shall be revised
annually by the City to conform to the most current low income and very low-
income limits for Riverside County for applicable household sizes, as
determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) with regard to the Public Housing and Section 8 Program. The City Manager
or their designee may not waive an otherwise applicable EMS Response Fee by
virtue of a patient's relationship or friendship with any City official or
employee, or by virtue of a patient's employment by the City if the service
received occurs while the City employee is off duty/not working. The City
Manager or their designee shall create a written record for each instance in
which an EMS response fee is waived, documenting the circumstances involved and
the reason for the EMS response fee waiver. Each such record shall be
maintained by the City for a period of at least five years.

4.20.010 Purpose and intent.
   It is the purpose and intent of this Chapter to implement the provisions of
the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act ("MAUCRSA") to
accommodate the needs of medically-ill persons in need of cannabis for
medicinal purposes as recommended by their health care provider(s), and to
provide access to same. It is also the purpose and intent of this Chapter to
provide access to adult-use cannabis for persons aged 21 and over as authorized
by the Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act ("AUMA" or
"Proposition 64" approved by California voters in 2016), while imposing
sensible regulations on the conduct of business and use of land to protect the
City's residents, neighborhoods, and businesses from disproportionately
negative impacts. As such, it is the purpose and intent of this Chapter to
regulate the sale and delivery of cannabis and cannabis products in a
responsible manner to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents
of the City of Canyon Lake and to enforce rules and regulations consistent with
state law. It is the further purpose and intent of this Chapter to require all
commercial cannabis operators to obtain and renew annually a permit to operate
within the City of Canyon Lake. Nothing in this Chapter is intended to
authorize the possession, use, or provision of cannabis in a manner that
violates state law. The provisions of this Chapter are in addition to any other
permits, licenses and approvals which may be required to conduct business in
the City, and are in addition to any permits, licenses and approval required
under City, state, or other law.
(Ord. 215, passed 10-6-2021)
4.20.020 Legal authority.
   Pursuant to Sections 5 and 7 of Chapter XI of the California Constitution,
the provisions of the MAUCRSA, any subsequent state legislation and/or
regulations regarding same, the City of Canyon Lake is authorized to adopt
ordinances that establish standards, requirements and regulations for the
licensing and permitting of commercial cannabis activity. Any standards,
requirements, and regulations regarding health and safety, security, and worker
protections established by the State of California, or any of its departments
or divisions, shall be the minimum standards applicable in the City of Canyon
Lake to all commercial cannabis activity.
(Ord. 215, passed 10-6-2021)

cannabis product is expressly prohibited in the City of Canyon Lake.
(Ord. 215, passed 10-6-2021)
4.20.040 Compliance with state and local laws and regulations.
   It is the responsibility of the owners and operators of the commercial
cannabis business to ensure that it is always operating in a manner compliant
with all applicable state and local laws, and any regulations promulgated
thereunder. In the event of a conflict between applicable state and local laws
and regulations, the more stringent provision shall control. Nothing in this
Chapter shall be construed as authorizing any actions that violate state law or
local law with respect to the operation of a commercial cannabis business. It
shall be the responsibility of the owners and the operators of the commercial
cannabis business to ensure that the commercial cannabis business is, at all
times, operating in a manner compliant with all applicable state and local
laws, including the MAUCRSA, and any subsequently enacted state law or
regulatory, licensing, or certification requirements, and any specific,
additional operating procedures or requirements which may be imposed as
conditions of approval of the commercial cannabis business permit. Nothing in
this Chapter shall be construed as authorizing any actions that violate City or
state law regarding the operation of a commercial cannabis business. It is the
stated intent of this Chapter to regulate commercial cannabis activity in the
City of Canyon Lake in compliance with all provisions of the MAUCRSA and any
subsequent state legislation and implementing regulations.

4.20.050 Definitions.
   For purposes of this Chapter, all definitions pertaining to cannabis
regulation that appear in Business and Professions Code Section 26001, as it
may be amended from time to time, are hereby incorporated by reference. In

by the City of Canyon Lake pursuant to this Chapter, to a commercial cannabis
business and is required before any commercial cannabis activity may be
conducted in the City. The initial permit and annual renewal of a commercial
cannabis business is made expressly contingent upon the business' ongoing
compliance with all of the requirements of this Chapter and any regulations
adopted by the City governing the commercial cannabis activity at issue.
   (e)   "Dispensing" means any activity involving the retail sale of cannabis
or cannabis products from a retailer.

any or all of the commercial cannabis business permits if it is determined that
the applicants do not meet the standards which are established in the
application requirements or further amendments to the application process or
that the City Council upon further deliberation determines that the issuance of
any or all commercial cannabis business permits will impact the public safety,
welfare or other policy concerns which may be detrimental in the issuance of
these permits.
   (c)   At any time in the City Council's discretion the City Council may
reassess the number of commercial cannabis business permits which are
authorized for issuance.
(Ord. 215, passed 10-6-2021)

qualified based on meeting a threshold minimum points or equivalent
quantitative evaluation established by the City Council by resolution.

those applications determined to be qualified by the City Manager.
      (4)   A final determination on the issuance of commercial cannabis

necessary forms, adopt any necessary rules to the application, regulations and
processes, solicit applications, conduct initial evaluations of the applicants,
hold public meetings, and issue commercial cannabis business permits as
authorized by this Chapter.
   (c)   At the time of filing, each applicant shall pay an application fee
established by resolution of the City Council, to cover all costs incurred by
the City in the application process and enter into a credit and reimbursement
agreement with the City for the costs of establishing the commercial cannabis
business program.
   (d)   The City's reservation of rights. The City reserves the right to
reject any or all applications. Prior to permit issuance, the City may also
modify, postpone, or cancel any application process, or the entire program
under this Chapter, at any time without liability, obligation, or commitment to
any party, firm, or organization, to the extent permitted under California
state law. Persons submitting applications assume the risk that all or any part
of the program, or any particular category of permit potentially authorized
under this Chapter, may be cancelled at any time prior to permit issuance. The
City further reserves the right to request and obtain additional information
from any candidate submitting an application. In addition to a failure to
comply with other requirements in this Chapter, an application RISKS BEING
REJECTED for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   The application was received after the designated time and date of
the deadline.
      (2)   The application did not contain the required elements, exhibits, or
was not organized in the required format.
      (3)   The application was considered not fully responsive to the request
for a permit application, i.e. was substantially incomplete.
   (e)   The City reserves the right for the City Manager to waive minor
informalities or irregularities, which are merely a matter of form and not of
substance, or immaterial defect in an application or variation of an
application from the exact requirements of the process that can be corrected or
waived without being prejudicial to other applicants. The City Manager shall
give the applicant an opportunity to cure any deficiency resulting from a minor
informality or irregularity in an application or waive the deficiency.
(Ord. 215, passed 10-6-2021)
4.20.110 Permittee selection process.
   (a)   The applicants shall be evaluated utilizing the review criteria by the
City Manager or their designee.
   (b)   After the initial review and scoring under the review criteria, the
City Manager or their designee will make a final determination whether an
applicant has met the minimum threshold established by the City Council based
on the points awarded. The City Manager shall notify each applicant of the
determination on their application.
   (c)   Each application and the determination on qualification shall be
published on the City's website following the determination on qualification.
The City Clerk shall also make available as a public record each application
and determination on qualification to any person requesting the same.
   (d)   A public meeting shall then be set before the City Manager, or their
designee, where the concerns of residents and affected businesses alike may be
brought before the City Manager or their designee regarding the applicants
determined to be qualified. At least ten days prior to the public meeting,
notice of the public meeting shall be:
      (1)   Sent to all property owners located within 300 feet of the proposed
business locations;
      (2)   Posted on the City's website; and
      (3)   Published in a local newspaper.
   (e)   The City Manager shall thereafter enter into negotiations with each
qualified applicant on a community benefit agreement, which shall ensure that
the private benefits received by an applicant who is awarded a commercial
cannabis business permit are balanced by commensurate public benefits to the
community. In addition, the City Manager shall negotiate with each qualified
applicant on additional conditions to ensure neighborhood compatibility based
on the public input at the public meeting. Both the community benefits and any
additional provisions regarding neighborhood compatibility shall be
memorialized in an agreement and incorporated into the terms and conditions
under which the commercial cannabis business will operate with the City's
approval, if and when a commercial cannabis business permit is issued. Such
terms and conditions shall be in addition to the requirements of this Chapter.
   (f)   Following the negotiations, the City Manager shall rank the qualified
applicants in order beginning with the applicant proposing the highest and best
community benefits for the City. The City Manager shall notify each qualified
applicant of the ranks assigned as well as the final terms agreed to during
negotiations. The City Clerk shall post the same to the City's website.
   (g)   The City Manager shall then issue the number of commercial cannabis
business permits authorized by the City Council under this Chapter, beginning
with the qualified applicant proposing the highest and best community benefits,
and continuing down the ranked list until the maximum number of permits has
been issued. In making the decision, the City Manager is authorized to impose
additional conditions to a permit, if it is determined to be necessary to
ensure compliance with state or local laws and regulations or to preserve the
public health, safety or welfare.
   (h)   City Manager shall prepare a report regarding the application process
and selection for issuance of the commercial cannabis business permits which
shall be transmitted to the City Council for their information only.
   (i)   Issuance of a commercial cannabis business permit shall be conditioned
upon the prevailing applicant obtaining all required land use approvals. After
the awarding of the permit the City Manager shall transmit the list of
permittees to the Planning Department. Following the City Manager's selection,
the prevailing applicant(s) shall apply to the City's Planning Department to
obtain any required land use approvals or entitlements for the permittee's
location, if any. Land use approvals shall include compliance with all
applicable provisions of CEQA. The City Manager or their designee(s) shall
formally issue the commercial cannabis business permit(s) once the Planning
Director or their designee(s) affirms that all of the required land use
approvals have been obtained.
   (j)   Issuance of a commercial cannabis business permit does not create a
land use entitlement. The commercial cannabis business permit shall only be for
a term of 12 months and shall expire at the end of the 12 month period unless
it is renewed as provided herein. Furthermore, no permittee may begin
operations, notwithstanding the issuance of a permit, unless all of the state
and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to the requirements
of this Chapter and of the permit, have been complied with, until a state
license is available and obtained by the permitted operator as set forth in
this Chapter.
   (k)   Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter to the contrary, the City
Manager may reject any or all applications if the City Manager determines it
would be in the best interest of the City, taking into account any health,

Manager or their designee in accordance with all provisions of this Chapter (as
though the transferee were applying for a new original cannabis business
permit). The proposed transferee's application shall be accompanied by a

Chapter. This will require a complete evaluation of the application and an
interview of the applicant prior to the hearing. Following the hearing, the

substantial change in the ownership of a permittee business entity (changes
that result in a change of more than 51% of the original ownership), must be
approved by the City Manager or his/her designee through the transfer process
contained in this Chapter. Failure to comply with this provision is grounds for
permit revocation.
   (e)   (1)   A permittee may change the form of business entity without
applying to the City Manager or their designee for a transfer of permit,
provided that either:
         (A)   The membership of the new business entity is substantially
similar to original permit holder business entity (at least 51 % of the
membership is identical); or
         (B)   If the original permittee is an unincorporated association,
mutual or public benefit corporation, agricultural or consumer cooperative
corporation and subsequently transitions to or forms a new business entity as
allowed under the MAUCRSA and in compliance with this Chapter, provided that
the Board of Directors (or in the case of an unincorporated association, the
individual(s) listed on the City permit application) of the original permittee
entity are the same as the new business entity.
      (2)   Although a transfer is not required in these two circumstances, the
permit holder is required to notify the City Manager in writing of the change
within ten days of the change. Failure to comply with this provision is grounds
for permit revocation.
   (f)   No commercial cannabis business permit may be transferred when the
City Manager or his/her designee has notified the permittee that the permit has
been or may be suspended or revoked.
   (g)   Any attempt to transfer a commercial cannabis business permit either
directly or indirectly in violation of this section is hereby declared void,
and such a purported transfer shall be deemed a ground for revocation of the
permit.

5.20.040 Security requirements.

of, or failure to comply with, any provision or requirement of this Chapter is
committed, continued, or permitted by any person.

description of the conditions which constitute such violation, and notice of
the City's intent to impose at fine of up to $1,000/day if the correction of
the violation does not commence within 14 days and is not completed within 30
days from the date of the notice or the notice provides for a specific shorter
time based upon the determination, as stated in the notice, that the specific
property condition listed threatens public health and safety.

manager shall be served on the agent or property manager at the address posted

violation and to protest the fine; such provisions shall be those set out in
Canyon Lake Municipal Code Chapter 11.20. The City shall take no further action

City Council has determined that requiring that all single-family residential
rental dwelling units be registered with the City and inspected and requiring
that landlords use a crime-free rental housing addendum, serves these
legitimate governmental interests.

5.24.020   Definitions.
   
5.24.030   Tobacco license prerequisite; application and renewal process.
   
5.24.040   License issuance or renewal; standards.
   
5.24.050   License non-transferable.
   
5.24.060   License term, renewal and reinstatement after expiration; fees.

5.24.090   Revocation of license.
   
5.24.100   Enforcement.
5.24.010 Purpose and intent.
   The City of Canyon Lake has a substantial interest in promoting compliance
with Federal, State, and local laws intended to regulate tobacco sales and use;
in discouraging the illegal purchase of tobacco products by minors; in
promoting compliance with laws prohibiting sales of cigarettes and tobacco
products to minors; and finally, and most importantly, in protecting children
from being lured into illegal activity through the misconduct of adults. It is
the intent of this chapter to encourage responsible tobacco retailing and to
discourage violations of tobacco-related laws at the local level as allowed by
State, especially those that prohibit or discourage the sale or distribution of
tobacco products to minors, but not to expand or reduce the degree to which the
acts regulated by Federal or State law are criminally proscribed or to alter
the penalty provided therefore or to regulate in areas already preempted.
(Ord. 99, passed 6-3-2009)
5.24.020 Definitions.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and terms shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   “Arm's length transaction” means a sale in good faith and for valuable
consideration that reflects the fair market value in the open market between
two informed and willing, parties, neither under any compulsion to participate
in the transaction. A sale between relatives, related companies or partners, or
a sale for the primary purpose of avoiding the effect of the violations of this
chapter is presumed not to be an arm's length transaction.
   (b)   “Business” means any sole proprietorship, partnership, joint venture,
corporation or other business entity formed for profit-making purposes,
including retail establishments where goods or services are sold, as well as
professional corporations and other entities where legal, medical, dental,
engineering architectural or other professional services are delivered.
   (c)   “City” shall mean the City of Canyon Lake or its designee hereunder
for the administration and enforcement of this chapter.
   (d)   “Department” shall mean the Riverside County Department of Health and
Human Services or other county department, if so designated by the City Council
by written contract, or any City department designated to administer and/or
enforce the provisions of this chapter.
   (e)   “Proprietor” shall mean a person with an ownership or managerial
interest in a business. An ownership interest shall be deemed to exist when a
person has a 10% or greater interest in the stock, assets, or income of a
business other than the sole interest of security for debt. A managerial
interest shall be deemed to exist when a person can or does have, or can or
does share ultimate control over the day-to-day operations of a business.
   (f)   “Retail tobacco store” means a retail store utilized primarily for the
sale of tobacco products and accessories; and in which at least 80% of the
square footage of the available retail floor and shelf space is devoted to the
sale of tobacco-related products and accessories. Operation of a hookah lounge
as defined by City ordinance does not fall within the definition of a “retail
tobacco store.”
   (g)   “Self-service display” shall mean the open display of tobacco products
or tobacco paraphernalia in a manner that is accessible to the general public
without the assistance of the retailer or employee of the retailer. A vending
machine is a form of self-service display.
   (h)   “Smoking” shall mean possessing a lighted tobacco product, tobacco
paraphernalia, or any other weed or plant (including a lighted pipe, lighted
cigar, or lighted cigarette of any kind), the lighting of a tobacco product,
tobacco paraphernalia, or any other weed or plant (including a pipe, cigar, or
cigarette of any kind).
   (i)   “Tobacco paraphernalia” shall mean cigarette papers or wrappers,
pipes, holders of smoking materials of all types, cigarette rolling machines,
and any other item designed for the smoking, preparation, storing, or
consumption of tobacco products.
   (j)   “Tobacco product” shall mean (1) any substance containing tobacco
leaf, including but not limited to cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff,
chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, bidis, or any other preparation of tobacco;
and (2) any product or formulation of matter containing biologically active
amounts of nicotine that is manufactured, sold, offered for sale, or otherwise
distributed with the expectation that the product or matter will be introduced
into the human body but does not include any product specifically approved by
the Federal Food and Drug Administration for use in treating nicotine or
tobacco product dependence.
   (k)   “Tobacco retailer” shall mean any person who sells, offers for sale,
or does or offers to exchange for any form of consideration, tobacco, tobacco
products, or tobacco paraphernalia; “tobacco retailing” shall mean the doing of
any of these things. This definition is without regard to the quantity of
tobacco, tobacco products, or tobacco paraphernalia sold, offered for sale,
exchanged, or offered for exchange.
   (l)   Notwithstanding, as used herein, this chapter shall not be applicable
to tobacco products either i) offered for sale in a golf shop operated by a
private homeowners association whose purpose is not the sale of tobacco
products; or ii) made available only to members or guests of such private
homeowners association, in a private bar or restaurant or private club operated
by such homeowners association.

store, to act as a tobacco retailer without first obtaining and maintaining a
valid tobacco retailer's license pursuant to this chapter for each location at
which that activity is to occur and to do so without a valid tobacco retailer's
license shall constitute a public nuisance. As used herein, “license” shall
include any required review of a license.
   (b)   A tobacco retailer (including the proprietor of a tobacco retailer)
without a valid tobacco retailer's license, including, for example, a revoked
license:
      (1)   Shall keep all tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia from
public view. The public display of tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia in
violation of this provision shall constitute an “offer for sale” for the
purposes of Section
5.24.040(c) hereof.
      (2)   Shall not display any advertisement relating to tobacco products or
tobacco paraphernalia that promotes the sale or distribution of such products
from the tobacco retailer's location or that would lead a reasonable consumer
to believe that such products can be obtained at the tobacco retailer's
location.
   (c)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant any person
obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer's license any status or right
other than the right to act as a tobacco retailer at the location in the City
identified on the face of the license. For example, nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to render inapplicable, supersede, or apply in lieu of any
other provision of applicable law, including, without limitation, any condition
or limitation on smoking in enclosed places of employment made applicable to
business establishments by California Labor Code Section 6404.5.
   (d)   Applications for a tobacco retailer's license or for an annual renewal
of that license shall be submitted to the City or its designee, utilizing a
form provided by the City or its designee, which application shall be in the
name of each proprietor proposing to conduct retail tobacco sales and shall be
signed by each proprietor or an authorized agent thereof. It is the
responsibility of each proprietor to be informed of the laws affecting the
issuance of a tobacco retailer's license. A license that is issued in error or
on the basis of false or misleading information supplied by a proprietor shall
be revoked pursuant to Section
5.24.100 hereof.
   (e)   In addition to any other penalty under this chapter, a person found to
have engaged in tobacco retailing without a valid tobacco retailers license
shall be ineligible to apply for or be issued a tobacco retailing license
according to the following:
      (1)   After a first violation for a person within any 60-month period, no
new license may issue for the person as a proprietor until 30 days have passed
from the date of last violation.
      (2)   After a second violation for a person within any 60-month period,
no new license may issue for the person as a proprietor until 90 days have
passed from the date of last violation.
      (3)   After three or more violations for a person within any 60-month
period, no new license may issue for the person as a proprietor until five
years have passed from the date of last violation.
      (4)   Each day that a person engages in tobacco retailing without a valid
tobacco retailers license shall constitute a separate violation.
   (f)   Tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia offered for sale or
exchange in violation of this chapter are subject to seizure and forfeiture.
Forfeited tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia shall be destroyed.
   (g)   All applications or renewals shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The current name, address, and telephone number of each proprietor.
      (2)   The current business name, address, and telephone number of the
single fixed location for which a tobacco retailer's license is sought.
      (3)   The current name and mailing address authorized by each proprietor
to receive all license-related communications and notices; unless a different
mailing address is provided, each proprietor shall be understood to consent to
the provision of notice at the business address specified above.
      (4)   Current proof that the location for which a tobacco retailer's
license is sought has been issued a valid state tobacco retailer's license by
the California Board of Equalization.
      (5)   Whether or not any proprietor is a person who has been determined
to have violated this chapter or has been a proprietor at a location that has
been determined to have violated this chapter and, if so, the dates and
locations of all such violations.
      (6)   For a renewal, any change in the information listed during the
prior year.
      (7)   Such other information as the City deems necessary for the
administration or enforcement of this chapter.
(Ord. 99, passed 6-3-2009)
5.24.040 License issuance or renewal; standards.
   (a)   No license (including any renewal) may issue to authorize tobacco
retailing at other than a fixed location, i.e. no license shall issue for
tobacco retailing by persons on foot or from a vehicle of any kind.
   (b)   Upon the receipt of an application (including a renewal) for a tobacco
retailer's license and the license fee therefor, the City or its designee shall
issue a license or renewal unless substantial record evidence demonstrates that
one of the following bases for denial exists:
      (1)   The application is incomplete or inaccurate.
      (2)   The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing at a
location for which a prohibition on issuing licenses is in effect pursuant to
this chapter. However, this subsection shall not constitute a basis for denial
of a license if the applicant provides the City with documentation
demonstrating that the applicant has acquired or is acquiring the location or
business in an arm's length transaction.
      (3)   The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing for a
proprietor for which a prohibition on issuing licenses is in effect pursuant to
this chapter.
      (4)   The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing that is
prohibited pursuant to this chapter, that is unlawful pursuant to any other
City ordinance, or that is unlawful pursuant to any other local, State, or
Federal law.
(Ord. 99, passed 6-3-2009)
5.24.050 License non-transferable.
   (a)   A tobacco retailer's license (including a renewal license) is
nontransferable. If the information required in the license application
changes, a new tobacco retailer's license is required before the business may
continue to act as a tobacco retailer. For example, if a proprietor to whom a
license has been issued changes business location, that proprietor must apply
for a new license prior to acting as a tobacco retailer at the new location. Or
if the business is sold, the new owner must apply for a license for that
location before acting as a tobacco retailer.
   (b)   Notwithstanding, any other provision of this chapter, violations
accumulated against a location or business shall continue to be counted against
the location or business unless the location or business has been transferred
to a new proprietor and the new proprietor provides the City with documentation
demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the new proprietor has
acquired or is acquiring the location or business in an arm's length
transaction.
(Ord. 99, passed 6-3-2009)
5.24.060 License term, renewal and reinstatement after expiration; fees.
   (a)   Term. The term of a tobacco retailer license is one year from the date
of issuance or renewal. A tobacco retailer's license is invalid unless the
appropriate fee has been paid in full and the term of the license has not
expired.
   (b)   Renewal. Each tobacco retailer shall apply for the renewal of his or
her tobacco retailer's license no later than 30 days prior to expiration of the
term.
   (c)   Reinstatement after expiration. A tobacco retailer's license that is
not timely renewed shall expire at the end of its term. To reinstate a license
that has expired due to the failure to renew, the proprietor shall submit the
renewal fee plus a reinstatement fee of 10% of the renewal fee and submit a
signed declaration stating the reason for the failure to renew the license in a
timely manner. Unless the proprietor can show that he has not sold any tobacco
product or tobacco paraphernalia during any period that the license was
expired, the proprietor may be subject to additional penalties for violation of
this chapter.
   (d)   Fees. The fees applicable to this chapter shall be determined by
resolution of the City Council. Reinstatement fee shall be at least 10% of
renewal fee.
(Ord. 99, passed 6-3-2009)
5.24.070 Other licensing requirements and prohibitions.
   (a)   Display of license. Each license shall be prominently displayed in a
publicly visible location at the licensed location in such a manner and size
that it may be easily read.
   (b)   Positive identification required. If the purchaser reasonably appears
to be under the age of 30, the person engaging in tobacco retailing shall
examine the identification of the purchaser to confirm that the proposed sale
is to a purchaser who is at least the minimum age under State law for
purchasing the tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia.
   (c)   Minimum age for persons selling tobacco. No person shall engage in
tobacco retailing if the person is younger than the minimum age under State law
for being sold or for possessing any tobacco product.
   (d)   Self-service displays prohibited. No person shall display tobacco
products or tobacco paraphernalia by means of a self-service display or engage
in tobacco retailing by means of a self-service display. A tobacco retailer who
chooses to display tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia in a locked
cabinet, case or similar structure shall post a clear and conspicuous sign on
or within five feet of the display stating that the cabinet, case or structure
is locked at all times and must keep the cabinet locked when not removing
products for sale, restocking, or cleaning or maintaining the cabinet.
   (e)   Violation of tobacco-related laws. It shall be a violation of a
tobacco retailer's license for a licensee, including his or her agent or
employee, to violate any local, State, or Federal tobacco-related law,
including but not limited to those regarding signage or those restricting the

5.25.020 Definition.
   “Short-term vacation rental” means a dwelling unit or portion of a dwelling
unit that is rented for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes by the owner to

form of monetary or non-monetary consideration, such as, but not limited to,
trade, fee, swap, or any other in-lieu- of-cash payments.
(Ord. 200, passed 9-2-2020)
5.25.030 Short-term vacation rentals prohibited.
   The establishment and operation of a short-term vacation rental, as defined
in Section
5.25.020, is prohibited anywhere within the City. No permit or any other
applicable license or entitlement for use, including, but not limited to, the
issuance of a business license, shall be approved or issued for the
establishment and operation of a short-term vacation rental within the City
limits.
(Ord. 200, passed 9-2-2020)
5.25.040 Violation.
   (a)   Violations Declared a Public Nuisance. Each and every violation of the
provisions of this Chapter is hereby deemed unlawful and a public nuisance and
may be summarily abated by the City Manager or designee. The City may recover
any nuisance abatement costs and/or administrative fines relating to such
violations in accordance with Government Code Sections 38773.1 and 38773.5.
   (b)   Each Violation a Separate Offense. Each and every violation of this
Chapter shall constitute a separate violation and shall be subject to all
remedies and enforcement measures authorized by this Code. Additionally, as a
nuisance per se, any violation of this Chapter shall be subject to injunctive
relief, any permit issued pursuant to this Chapter being deemed null and void,
disgorgement and payment to the City for any monies unlawfully obtained, costs
of abatement, costs of investigation, attorney fees, and any other relief or
remedy available at law or in equity. The City may also pursue any and all
remedies and actions available and applicable under state and local laws for
any violations.
   (c)   Criminal Penalties. Any person causing, permitting, aiding, abetting,
suffering or concealing a violation of this Chapter shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor, and may, in the discretion of the City Attorney, be prosecuted as
a misdemeanor and upon conviction be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000 or
imprisonment in the City or County jail for a period of not more than six
months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. The City Attorney, in his or her
sound discretion, may prosecute a violation of this Chapter as an infraction,
rather than a misdemeanor, or reduce or agree to the reduction of a previously
filed misdemeanor to an infraction. Any person convicted of an infraction under
the provisions of this Chapter shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,500
for the first violation, a fine not exceeding $3,000 for a second violation
within one year, and a fine not exceeding $5,000 for a third violation within
one year. A fourth violation of this Chapter within one year shall be charged
as a misdemeanor and may not be reduced to an infraction. Each day a violation
is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate offense. The
City Manager may grant a hardship waiver to reduce the amount of the fine upon
a showing by the responsible party that the responsible party has made a bona
fide effort to comply after the first violation and that payment of the full
amount of the fine would impose an undue financial burden on the responsible
party.
   (d)   Remedies Cumulative and Not Exclusive. The remedies provided herein
are not to be construed as exclusive remedies. The City is authorized to pursue
any proceedings or remedies provided by law.

long as the City provides such service, either through its own employees or by
contract or franchise, it shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the
business of collecting solid waste or recyclables within the City unless such
person has a valid franchise or contract with the City to do so. The City

not limited to, level of services, times of collection, frequency of collection
and waste diversion requirements.
   (b)   The approved contractor awarded a franchise or contract by the City
shall comply with all local governmental licenses, permits, or written approval

material, hazardous waste or other waste, as agreed between the City and
approved contractor. The contractor also may be required to assist in meeting
the requirements of AB 939, AB 32, AB 341, AB 1826, AB 1594 and other laws and
regulations that have been or will be imposed upon the City.
   (c)   No franchise contract or subscription shall be required for: (I) the

from his or her premises; (iv) any person removing infectious or hazardous
waste from his or her premises. All solid or hazardous waste self-hauled shall
be contained, tied or enclosed to prevent leaking, spilling or blowing, and
shall be deposited only in a duly authorized location.
   (d)   In accordance with state regulations, the following items are required

and property damage, $5,000,000 vehicle liability insurance, and workers
compensation in an amount as required by law. Such insurance shall remain in

2017)
6.01.080 Mandatory subscription.
   (a)   Except as set out in Section
6.01.070(c), it shall be unlawful for any occupant or person in possession,
charge or control of any residential premises within the City from which
ordinary household garbage, solid waste, organic waste or recyclables are or
may be created, accumulated or produced, to fail to subscribe for the
collection service provided by the City. When the joint or multiple use of
garbage containers is provided on the residential premises, it shall be
unlawful for the person in possession, charge or control of such containers, to
fail to subscribe to the City’s collection service.
   (b)   It shall be unlawful for any occupant and/or any contractor doing
business on any premises or any person in possession, charge, or control of any
nonresidential premises within the City from which solid waste, recyclables or
organic waste are or may be created, accumulated or produced to fail to
subscribe for collection of solid waste, recyclable material or organic waste
with anyone other than the City's collection service, except as set out in
Section
6.01.070(c).
   (c)   It is the duty of the approved collection agent to collect all solid
waste, recyclable material or organic waste from premises within the City that
subscribe to such service and to deposit such materials at the appropriate
facility.

6.01.130 hereof, should conditions warrant at any residential, commercial,
industrial or multi-residential unit, the City or the Health Officer may
require increased frequency of collection. No accumulation of solid waste shall

nuisance where detrimental to public health and safety.
   (e)   The owner or occupant of any premises may contract for additional
collection services in excess of those required or provided by contractor
hereunder.
(15-9/91 § 6.06.08) (Am. Ord. 172, passed 7-12-2017; Am. Ord. 173, passed 8-2-
2017)
6.01.090 Collection of fees.
   (a)   Every person in the City who has the occupancy, charge or control of
any place or premises, within the City where any ordinary household garbage,
solid waste, recyclables or organic waste accumulate or may accumulate, shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to the City or its agent a charge in such amounts and
in such manner as shall be established by the City for the service of having
such ordinary household garbage, solid waste, recyclables or organic waste,
collected and removed from the place or premises by the exclusive contractor.
In the case of residential and commercial rental units, the property owner of
record ultimately shall be responsible for such charge.
   (b)   Nothing in this Section is intended to prevent an arrangement, or the
continuance of an existing arrangement, under which payments of refuse
collection fees are made by a tenant or tenants, or any agent, on behalf of the
owner. However, any such arrangement will not affect the property owner’s
obligation to the contractor.
   (c)   All fees for service shall be proposed by the contractor and approved
by the City Council by resolution. Fees shall be based on the type of occupancy
or use of the place or premises.
   (d)   All fees (and any penalty) for collection services shall be billed and
collected in accordance with rules and regulations proposed by the contractor
and established and adopted by the City Council. The City Council may collect
residential fees on the tax roll pursuant to Section
6.01.110.
(Am. Ord. 172, passed 7-12-2017; Am. Ord. 173, passed 8-2-2017)
6.01.100 Refuse collection fee a debt.
   The refuse collection fee shall be a civil debt owing the contractor and the
City from the owner, occupant or person in possession, charge or control of the
premises. A penalty may be charged for late payment. Should any person fail,
refuse or neglect to pay a collection bill within 30 days after received,
without a valid dispute therefor, the contractor may refuse to collect solid
waste, organic waste or recyclables from the premises until the bill is paid or
the matter otherwise is resolved.

2017)
6.01.110 Collection procedure for delinquent accounts; creation of lien.
   Fees authorized pursuant to this Chapter, including those owing
prospectively as well as those which remain unpaid as of April 1 of any year,
may be collected on the property tax roll by the City as provided in this
Section.
   (a)   Annually, on or before July 1, of each year, the City shall cause a
written report to be prepared and filed with the City Clerk. The report shall
describe each parcel in the city receiving solid waste collection services and
the charge for such services for the next fiscal year. For collection of
delinquent accounts, the contractor shall cause a report of delinquent fees or
charges to be prepared annually after April 1. The report may contain both
prospective and delinquent charges. Charges may be placed on the tax rolls for
residential and/or commercial property.
   (b)   The Council shall fix a time, date and place for a hearing on the
report and any objections or protests thereto.
   (c)   The City Council shall cause written notice of such hearing to be
mailed to the landowners listed on the report not less than 15 days prior to
the date of the hearing.
   (d)   At the hearing, the City Council shall hear any objections or protests
of landowners liable to be assessed for fees and may make such revisions or
corrections to the report as it deems just, after which, by resolution, the
report may be confirmed. The City Clerk shall file the report with the County
Auditor before August 10 of each year.
   (e)   The fees set forth in the report as confirmed shall constitute special
assessments against the respective parcels of land, and are a lien on the
property for the amount of such delinquent fees plus administrative costs. A
certified copy of the confirmed report shall be filed with the County Auditor
for amounts of the respective parcels of land as they appear on the current
assessment roll. The lien created attaches upon recordation, in the office of
the County recorder, of a certified copy of the resolution of confirmation. The
assessment may be collected at the same time and subject to the same
procedures, including sale in case of delinquency, as provided for such taxes.
All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of ad valorem
property taxes shall be applicable to such assessments, except that, if any
real property to which such fees or charges relate has been transferred or
conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide
encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date
on which the first installment of such taxes would become delinquent, then the
lien which would otherwise be imposed shall not attach to such real property
and the fees or charges and interest shall be transferred to the unsecured roll
for collection.
(Am. Ord. 172, passed 7-12-2017; Am. Ord. 173, passed 8-2-2017)
6.01.120 Standby assessment on vacant parcels.
   Pursuant to the authority set out in Health & Safety Code Sections 5470 et
seq., the City may by 4/5ths vote adopt an ordinance, levy and collect an
annual standby charge on unimproved property for solid waste capacity and
collection and to meet obligations under AB 939, as it may be revised from time
to time. By resolution approved by 4/5ths vote of the City Council, such
charges may be collected in the same manner, by the same persons and at the
same time and together with real property general taxes. In such event, the
City Council shall:
   (a)   Annually cause a written report to be filed with the City Clerk,
describing each parcel and the amount of the charge;
   (b)   Give notice of the charge and a hearing thereon shall be given as set
out in Health & Safety Code Section 5473.1;
   (c)   At the time of the hearing, hear and consider any and all protests to
the report. In the event of a protest by the owners of a majority of separate
parcels, the report shall not be approved;
   (d)   Absent a majority protest, approve the report and file it with the
County Auditor as set out in Section 5473.4 of the Health & Safety Code; and
   (e)   The charges set out in the report shall constitute a lien on the
property in the same manner as real property taxes.
   All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of general taxes
of the entity, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to the matters
of delinquency, correction, cancellation, refund and redemption, are applicable
to such charges, except that if any real property to which such charges relate
has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a
lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches
thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of such taxes would
become delinquent, then the lien which would otherwise be imposed shall not
attach to such real property and the charges relating to such property shall be
transferred to the unsecured roll of collection.

2017)
6.01.130 Solid waste collection schedules.
   (a)   Residential, industrial and commercial solid waste and recyclable
material shall be collected at least once weekly. Collections shall not be made
between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m. unless otherwise agreed in advance in writing by the
City Manager. Organic waste shall be collected on the same schedule or as
determined to be necessary by the City and the contractor. Collections of
discarded automobile or truck bodies or other bulky or heavy objects, dirt,
sod, rock, manure or waste from any stable, and material resulting from
building or construction charges shall occur within seven days from receipt of
request for such collection unless needed sooner for health and safety reasons.
Subject to such limitations as may be agreed to by the City and waste hauler,

2017)
6.01.140 Placement of containers.
   (a)   Residential. Unless other appropriate arrangements are made between an
owner/agent and the approved collector, due to special circumstances, all
containers shall be placed for collection along the curb or paved alley as

the parkway, but not in the local flowline. No person shall place any solid
waste, organic waste or recyclable material, or any container containing such

      (7)   When any refuse is not collected by the approved collection agent,
he shall leave a tag, provided at its cost, at least 2" x 6" in size, on which
is specifically stated the reason for the refusal to collect, and the City
regulation or provision of the agreement that has been violated. The tag shall
contain thereon the name, address and telephone number of the approved
collection agent, and shall be securely fastened to the container or article.
The approved collection agent shall maintain a record of the location where all
and any such tags have been placed. In the event the reason for non-collection
is not remedied or cured by the date of the next regular pickup for the
location, the approved collection agent shall provide the City with written
notice thereof, stating the full particulars of the reason for no collection
and location thereof.
   (c)   Recyclables in containers. All recyclable materials shall be placed in
containers provided by the approved collection agent specifically for that
purpose. In the event that such containers are filled, additional recyclable
material may be placed adjacent to the recycling container in another
container, bag or box.
   (d)   The approved collection agent agrees to assist and cooperate, at least
twice per year, at no additional cost, in a clean-up operation on dates to be
mutually determined.
(15-9/91 § 6.06.12) (Am. Ord. 172, passed 7-12-2017; Am. Ord. 173, passed 8-2-
2017)
6.01.160. Ownership of waste materials.
   Solid wastes subject to collection by the approved collection agent shall
become the property of that agent. Recyclable materials and organic waste shall
become property of the City. No person other than the person generating the
materials, City employees or the contractor acting within the scope of his or
her agency or employment shall remove such materials once placed for
collection.
(15-9/91 § 6.06.13) (Am. Ord. 172, passed 7-12-2017; Am. Ord. 173, passed 8-2-

6.01.170 Solid waste and recyclable containers.
   (a)   Care of all containers. All containers shall be returned upright to
the curb where found. Containers or lids shall not be deposited in the street
or on adjoining property. Collectors shall not in any way throw or roughly
handle any container so as to cause damage. The approved collection agent shall
return all bins, roll-off boxes and the like utilized for business
establishments hereunder, to the enclosure(s) provided therefor on the
property. In the event that a business establishment fails to utilize such
enclosures, or if the enclosures are rendered unusable, the approved collection
agent shall request the business establishment to make the enclosure usable for
bins, roll-off boxes and the like. If the business establishment fails or
refuses to correct the situation, the approved collection agent shall notify
the City thereof. The contractor immediately shall remove any and all material
that is spilled.
   (b)   Replacement of faulty containers. Where the property owner or occupant
provides the container, any container that leaks and is not watertight shall be
replaced by the owner within ten (10) days after notice from the collector,
stating the condition of that container. Notice from the collector shall be
made by attaching a tag to the container indicating its defective condition.
   (c)   Operator responsibility. Where the approved collection agent furnishes
containers (whether for solid waste or recyclables), he is responsible for
maintaining the containers in good condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted,
unless they are furnished under other terms, conditions or agreements.

deposit recyclables, solid wastes or organic waste in any container that has
not been provided for his use without the permission of the container owner.

   The City Council finds and declares:
   (a)   State recycling law, Assembly Bill 939 of 1989, the California
Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (California Public Resources Code
Section 40000, et seq., as amended, supplemented, superseded, and replaced from
time to time), requires cities and counties to reduce, reuse, and recycle
(including composting) solid waste generated in their jurisdictions to the
maximum extent feasible before any incineration or landfill disposal of waste,
to conserve water, energy, and other natural resources, and to protect the
environment.
   (b)   State recycling law, Assembly Bill 341 of 2011 (approved by the
Governor of the State of California on October 5, 2011, which amended Sections
41730, 41731, 41734, 41735, 41736, 41800, 42926, 44004, and 50001 of, and added
Sections 40004, 41734.5, and 41780.01 and Chapter 12.8 (commencing with Section
42649) to Part 3 of Division 30 of, and added and repealed Section 41780.02 of,
the Public Resources Code, as amended, supplemented, superseded and replaced
from time to time), places requirements on businesses and multi-family property
owners that generate a specified threshold amount of solid waste to arrange for
recycling services and requires jurisdictions to implement a mandatory
commercial recycling program.
   (c)   State organics recycling law, Assembly Bill 1826 of 2014 (approved by
the Governor of the State of California on September 28, 2014, which added
Chapter 12.9 (commencing with Section 42649.8) to Part 3 of Division 30 of the
Public Resources Code, relating to solid waste, as amended, supplemented,
superseded, and replaced from time to time), requires businesses and multi-
family property owners that generate a specified threshold amount of solid
waste, recycling, and organic waste per week to arrange for recycling services
for that waste, requires jurisdictions to implement a recycling program to
divert organic waste from businesses subject to the law, and requires
jurisdictions to implement a mandatory commercial organics recycling program.
   (d)   SB 1383, the Short-lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Act of 2016,
requires CalRecycle to develop regulations to reduce organics in landfills as a
source of methane. The regulations place requirements on multiple entities
including jurisdictions, residential households, commercial businesses and
business owners, commercial edible food generators, haulers, self-haulers, food
recovery organizations, and food recovery services to support achievement of
statewide organic waste disposal reduction targets.
   (e)   SB 1383, the Short-lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Act of 2016,
requires jurisdictions to adopt and enforce an ordinance or enforceable
mechanism to implement relevant provisions of SB 1383 Regulations. This Chapter
will also help reduce food insecurity by requiring commercial edible food
generators to arrange to have the maximum amount of their edible food, that
would otherwise be disposed, be recovered for human consumption.

containing a penalty for an uncorrected violation may request a hearing to
appeal the citation. A hearing will be held only if it is requested within the
time prescribed and consistent with jurisdiction's procedures in the
jurisdiction's codes for appeals of administrative citations. Evidence may be
presented at the hearing. The jurisdiction will appoint a hearing officer who
shall conduct the hearing and issue a final written order.
   (i)   Education period for non-compliance. Beginning January 1, 2022 and
through December 31, 2023, jurisdiction will conduct inspections, remote
monitoring, route reviews or waste evaluations, and compliance reviews,
depending upon the type of regulated entity, to determine compliance, and if
jurisdiction determines that organic waste generator, self-hauler, hauler, tier
one commercial edible food generator, food recovery organization, food recovery
service, or other entity is not in compliance, it shall provide educational
materials to the entity describing its obligations under this Chapter and a
notice that compliance is required by January 1, 2022, and that violations may

      (1)   All docks shall be maintained in good repair and free of debris.
      (2)   No dock shall pose a hazard to the public welfare, navigation, or

flammable and other hazardous substances is prohibited.
   (b)   Super structures prohibited. Super structures are prohibited on all
docks.

within 20 feet of the dock and be of sufficient durability to withstand the
environment. Any dock classified “not electrically wired” will not have any
permanent electrical supply installed without first applying for a

8.03.040 Violations.
   (a)   Violations declared a public nuisance. Each and every violation of the
provisions of this Chapter is hereby deemed unlawful and a public nuisance and
may be summarily abated by the City Manager or designee. The City may recover
any nuisance abatement costs and/or administrative fines relating to such
violations in accordance with Government Code Sections 38773.1 and 38773.5.
   (b)   Each violation a separate offense. Each and every violation of this
Chapter shall constitute a separate violation and shall be subject to all
remedies and enforcement measures authorized by this Code. Additionally, as a
nuisance per se, any violation of this Chapter shall be subject to injunctive
relief, any permit issued pursuant to this Chapter being deemed null and void,
disgorgement and payment to the City for any monies unlawfully obtained, costs
of abatement, costs of investigation, attorney fees, and any other relief or
remedy available at law or in equity. The City may also pursue any and all
remedies and actions available and applicable under state and local laws for
any violations.
   (c)   Criminal penalties. Any person causing, permitting, aiding, abetting,
suffering or concealing a violation of this Chapter shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor, and may, in the discretion of the City Attorney, be prosecuted as
a misdemeanor and upon conviction be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000 or
imprisonment in the City or County jail for a period of not more than six
months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. The City Attorney, in his or her
sound discretion, may prosecute a violation of this Chapter as an infraction,
rather than a misdemeanor, or reduce or agree to the reduction of a previously
filed misdemeanor to an infraction. A fourth violation of this Chapter within
one year shall be charged as a misdemeanor and may not be reduced to an
infraction. Each day a violation is committed or permitted to continue shall
constitute a separate offense. The City Manager may grant a hardship waiver to
reduce the amount of the fine upon a showing by the responsible party that the
responsible party has made a bona fide effort to comply after the first
violation and that payment of the full amount of the fine would impose an undue
financial burden on the responsible party.
   (d)   Remedies cumulative and not exclusive. The remedies provided herein
are not to be construed as exclusive remedies. The City is authorized to pursue
any proceedings or remedies provided by law.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
8.35.010 Statutory authorization.
   The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections
65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Canyon Lake does
hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. This Chapter
meets and exceeds the minimum standards for the State of California, as
recommended by FEMA, and as requested in coordination with the Engineer for the
Property Owner’s Association.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.020 Findings of fact.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of Canyon Lake are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (b)   These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated,
flood-proofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities also contributes to flood losses.
   (c)   This Chapter meets and exceeds the minimum standards for the State of
California, as recommended by FEMA, and as requested in coordination with the
Engineer for the Property Owner’s Association. Community adoption of higher
standards can be applied towards credit under the Community Rating System (CRS)
program and result in reduced premiums for all flood insurance policy holders
within the entire community.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.030 Statement of purpose.
   It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied
uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land
within flood-prone, mudslide [i.e., mudflow] or flood related erosion areas.
These regulations are designed to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted
areas caused by flood damage;
   (g)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
   (h)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter includes regulations to:
   (a)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   (d)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.

   “Base flood” means a flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year (also called the “100-year flood”). Base flood is
the term used throughout this Chapter.
   “Base flood elevation” (BFE) means the elevation shown on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1-V30 that indicates the
water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a 1% or greater chance
of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before January
7, 1998.
   “Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site

      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and
      (2)   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.
   “Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)” means the official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.
   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones
applicable to the community.
   “Flood Insurance Study” means the official report provided by the Federal
Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate
Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of
the base flood.
   “Floodplain or flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being
inundated by water from any source. See “Flooding.”
   “Floodplain Administrator” is the community official designated by title to
administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations, in this case the
City Engineer.
   “Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and
enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but
not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain
management regulations, and open space plans.
   “Floodplain management regulations” means this Chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other
application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes Federal, State or local regulations in any combination
thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and
damage.
   “Flood-proofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet
flood-proofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.
   “Flood-related erosion” means the collapse or subsidence of land along the
shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by
waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical level or suddenly
caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied
by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash
flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusually and
unforeseeable event which results in flooding.
   “Flood-related erosion area” or “Flood-related erosion-prone area” means a
land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which due to
the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven
currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage.
   “Flood-related erosion area management” means the operation of an overall
program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related
erosion
   ALP S-6
   Floodplain Management Regulations   31
damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood-
related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations.
   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
Also referred to as “regulatory floodway.”
   “Floodway fringe” is that area of the floodplain on either side of the
“regulatory floodway” where encroachment may be permitted.
   “Fraud and victimization” as related to Sections 8.35.500 through 8.35.520,
means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the
public. In examining this requirement, the City Council will consider the fact
that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and
remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are
permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during
all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of
the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs,
inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring.
In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is
subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood
insurance rates.
   “Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot perform its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The
term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for
the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship
repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related
manufacturing facilities.
   “Governing body” is the local governing unit (the City) that is empowered to
adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and
general welfare of its citizenry.
   “Hardship” as related to Sections 8.35.500 through 8.35.520 means the
exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested
variance. The City Council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual,
and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship
alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical
handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise
cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems
can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   “Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a State inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved State program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or
directly by the Secretary of the Interior in States without approved programs.
   “Levee” means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed
and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain,
control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   “Levee system” means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including
basement. (See “Basement” definition).
      (1)   An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor
that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an
area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor
provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements,
including, but not limited to:
         (A)   The flood openings standard in Section
8.35.300(c)(3);
         (B)   The anchoring standards in Section
8.35.300(a);
         (C)   The construction materials and methods standards in Section
8.35.300(b); and
         (D)   The standards for utilities in Section
8.35.310.
   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”
   “Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous
parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or
sale.
   “Market value” shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the
structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of
depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed.
      (1)   The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square
foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide
recognized by the building construction industry.
      (2)   The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into
account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional
obsolescence as approved by the Floodplain Administrator, but shall not include
economic or other forms of external obsolescence.
         Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different
from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be
considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an
independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of
the differences.
   “Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance
Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations
shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
   “Mudslide” describes a condition where there is a river, flow or inundation
of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss
of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded
by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain.
   “Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone area” means an area with land surfaces and
slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate
indicate a potential for mudflow.
   “New construction,” for floodplain management purposes, means structures for
which the “start of construction” commenced on or after January 7, 1998, and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   “New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after January 7,
1998.
   “Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation,
channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel,
refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or
projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.
   “One-hundred-year flood” or “100-year flood.” See “Base flood.”
   “Program deficiency” means a defect in a community’s floodplain management
regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation
of those floodplain management regulations.
   “Public safety and nuisance” as related to Sections
8.35.500 through
8.35.520, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything
which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood,
or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage
or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream,
canal, or basin.
   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   “Regulatory floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one
foot.
   “Remedy a violation” means to bring the structure or other development into
compliance with State or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this
is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts
may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development
from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this Chapter or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing State or Federal
financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
   “Riverine” means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including
tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
   “Sheet flow area.” See “Area of shallow flooding.”
   “Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area in the floodplain subject
to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM
or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or, AH.
   “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement and other proposed
new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the
permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of seawalls, streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages, shade
structures or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building that is principally above
ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home, and
excludes shade structures, boat shade structures, and boat docks that are
exempt from the CLOMR/LOMR process.
   “Substantial damage” means:
      (1)   Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed
50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred; or
      (2)   Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate
occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of
each such event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of the market value of
the structure before the damage occurred. This is also known as “repetitive
loss.”
   “Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter
which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by
this Chapter.
   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with this Chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance
required in this Chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
   “Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of
1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the
floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
   “Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or
other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.

ADMINISTRATION
8.35.200 Designation of the Floodplain Administrator.
   The City Engineer is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce
this Chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its
provisions and is the Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.210 Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator.
   The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall
include, but not be limited to the following:
   (a)   Permit review. Review all development permits to determine:
      (1)   Permit requirements of this Chapter have been satisfied, including
determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing
structures;
      (2)   All other required State and Federal permits have been obtained;
      (3)   The site is reasonably safe from flooding;
      (4)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the City of Canyon Lake; and
      (5)   All Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are
approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not
be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs). Approved
CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land
preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.
   (b)   Development of substantial improvement and substantial damage
procedures.
      (1)   Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions About
Substantially Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for identifying
and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial
damage, to include defining “market value.”
      (2)   Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions
and implemented by community staff.
   (c)   Review, use and development of other base flood data.
      (1)   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance
with Section 8.35.070, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
Federal or State agency, or other source, in order to administer Sections
8.35.300 through 8.35.370.
      (2)   NOTE: Based on locally accepted information, Canyon Lake has
established a Base Flood Elevation (BFE) of 1395.3.
   (d)   Notification of other agencies.
      (1)   Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:
         (A)   Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of
Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;
         (B)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency; and
         (C)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
      (2)   Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations.
         (A)   Within six months of information becoming available or project
completion, whichever comes first, the Floodplain Administrator shall submit or
assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA
for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
         (B)   All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the
issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on
Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow
construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as
specified in the “start of construction” definition.
         Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those
physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and
floodplain management requirements are based on current data.

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
8.35.300 Standards of construction.
   In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:
   (a)   Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements of
structures, including manufactured homes, shall be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
   (b)   Construction materials and methods. All new construction and
substantial improvements of structures, including manufactured homes, shall be
constructed:
      (1)   With flood resistant materials, and utility equipment resistant to
flood damage for areas below the base flood elevation;
      (2)   Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
      (3)   With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding; and
      (4)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (c)   Elevation and flood-proofing.
      (1)   Residential construction. All new construction or substantial
improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including
basement:
         (A)   In AE, AH, A1-30 Zones, elevated at least two feet above the
base flood elevation.
         (B)   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a
height two feet above the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least four feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number
is specified.
         (C)   In an A zone, without BFEs specified on the FIRM [unnumbered A
zone], elevated to at least two feet above the base flood elevation; as
determined under Section 8.35.210(c).
         Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or
licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be
properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   Nonresidential construction. All new construction or substantial
improvements of nonresidential structures shall either be elevated to conform
with Section
8.35.300(c)(1) or:
         (A)   Be flood-proofed, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the elevation recommended under Section
8.35.300(c)(1), so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water;
         (B)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
         (C)   Be certified by a registered civil engineer or architect that
the standards of Section
8.35.300(c)(2)(A) and (B) are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided
to the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Flood openings. All new construction and substantial improvements
of structures with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding
basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must meet the
following minimum criteria:
         (A)   For non-engineered openings:
            1.   Have a minimum of two openings on different sides having a
total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding;
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade;
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwater; and
            4.   Buildings with more than one enclosed area must have openings
on exterior walls for each area to allow flood water to directly enter; or
         (B)   Be certified by a registered civil engineer or architect.
      (4)   Manufactured homes. See Section 8.35.330.
      (5)   Garages and low cost accessory structures.
         (A)   Attached garages.
            1.   A garage attached to a residential structure, constructed with
the garage floor slab below the BFE, must be designed to allow for the
automatic entry of floodwaters. See Section
8.35.300(c)(3). Areas of the garage below the BFE must be constructed with
flood resistant materials. See Section
8.35.300(b).
            2.   A garage attached to a nonresidential structure must meet the
above requirements or be dry flood-proofed. For guidance on below grade parking
areas, see FEMA Technical Bulletin TB-6.
         (B)   Detached garages and accessory structures.
            1.   “Accessory structures” used solely for parking (two car
detached garages or smaller) or limited storage (small, low-cost sheds), as
defined in Section
8.35.050, may be constructed such that its floor is below the base flood
elevation (BFE), provided the structure is designed and constructed in
accordance with the following requirements:
               a.   Use of the accessory structure must be limited to parking
or limited storage;
               b.   The portions of the accessory structure located below the
BFE must be built using flood-resistant materials;
               c.   The accessory structure must be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement;
               d.   Any mechanical and utility equipment in the accessory
structure must be elevated or flood-proofed to or above the BFE;
               e.   The accessory structure must comply with floodplain
encroachment provisions in Section
8.35.350; and
               f.   The accessory structure must be designed to allow for the
automatic entry of floodwaters in accordance with Section
8.35.300(c)(3).
            2.   Detached garages and accessory structures not meeting the
above standards must be constructed in accordance with all applicable standards
in Section
8.35.300.
      (6)   Crawlspace construction. This subsection applies to buildings with
crawl spaces up to two feet below grade. Below-grade crawl space construction
in accordance with the requirements listed below will not be considered
basements.
         (A)   The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Crawl
space construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than
five feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design
professional, such as a registered architect or professional engineer;
         (B)   The crawl space is an enclosed area below the BFE and, as such,
must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. For guidance on flood openings, see
FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-93;
         (C)   Crawl space construction is not permitted in V zones. Open pile
or column foundations that withstand storm surge and wave forces are required
in V zones;
         (D)   Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with
materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation
walls of the crawl space used to elevate the building, but also any joists,
insulation, or other materials that extend below the BFE; and
         (E)   Any building utility systems within the crawl space must be
elevated above BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate
within the system components during flood conditions.
         (F)   Requirements for all below-grade crawl space construction, in
addition to the above requirements, to include the following:
            1.   The interior grade of a crawl space below the BFE must not be
more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG), shown as in
figure 3 of Technical Bulletin 11-01;
            2.   The height of the below-grade crawl space, measured from the
interior grade of the crawl space to the top of the crawl space foundation wall
must not exceed four feet (shown as L in figure 3 of Technical Bulletin 11-01)
at any point;
            3.   There must be an adequate drainage system that removes
floodwaters from the interior area of the crawl space within a reasonable
period of time after a flood event, not to exceed 72 hours; and
            4.   The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five
feet per second for any crawl space. For velocities in excess of five feet per
second, other foundation types should be used.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.310 Standards for utilities.
   (a)   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall
be designed to minimize or eliminate:

      (1)   Identify the Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) and Base Flood
Elevations (BFE).
      (2)   Identify the elevations of lowest floors of all proposed structures
and pads on the final plans.
      (3)   If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the following
as-built information for each structure shall be certified by a registered
civil engineer or licensed land surveyor and provided as part of an application
for a Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) to the Floodplain
Administrator:
         (A)   Lowest floor elevation.
         (B)   Pad elevation.
         (C)   Lowest adjacent grade.
   (b)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall be

public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
   (d)   All subdivisions and other proposed development shall provide adequate
drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.330 Standards for manufactured homes.
   (a)   All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, on
sites located: (1) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (2) in a
new manufactured home park or subdivision; (3) in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or (4) in an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial
damage” as the result of a flood, shall:
      (1)   Within Zones Al-30, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance
Rate Map, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of
the manufactured home is elevated at least two feet above the base flood
elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
   (b)   All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH,
and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map that are not subject to the
provisions of Section 8.35.330(a) will be securely fastened to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement,
and be elevated so that either the:
      (1)   Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at least two feet above
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36
inches in height above grade.
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor
including basement shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or
licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be
properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.340 Standards for recreational vehicles.
   (a)   All recreational vehicles placed in Zones A1-30, AH, and AE will
either:
      (1)   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or

and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 8.35.330(a).
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.350 Floodways.
   Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential,
the following provisions apply:
   (a)   Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction,
substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be
permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the City.
   (b)   Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the City shall prohibit
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and
other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is
provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any
increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (c)   If Section
8.35.350(a) and (b) are satisfied, all new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this Subchapter.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.360 Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone areas.
   (a)   The Floodplain Administrator shall review permits for proposed
construction of other development to determine if it is proposed within a
mudslide area.
   (b)   Permits shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed site and
improvement will be reasonably safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be
considered in making this determination include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   The type and quality of soils;
      (2)   Evidence of ground water or surface water problems;
      (3)   Depth and quality of any fill;
      (4)   Overall slope of the site; and
      (5)   Weight that any proposed development will impose on the slope.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.370 Flood-related erosion-prone areas.
   (a)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require permits for proposed
construction and other development within all flood-related erosion-prone areas
known to the community.
   (b)   Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the
proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-
related erosion, and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise
aggravate the existing hazard.
   (c)   If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related
erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement shall be
relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating
the existing erosion hazard.
   (d)   Within Zone E on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, a setback is required
for all new development from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront or other body of
water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour
strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related erosion
hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated “useful life” of
structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and
climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open
space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and
wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable
structures only.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
VARIANCE PROCEDURE
8.35.500 Nature of variances.
   (a)   The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only.
Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk
and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.
   (b)   The variance criteria set forth in this Subchapter are based on the
general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property
and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of
property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this Chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
   (c)   The City Council shall help protect its citizens from flooding. This
need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure
built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation
or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long term
goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if
variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in
this Subchapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be
met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to
screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are
more appropriate.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.510 Conditions for variances.
   (a)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-
half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of Sections
8.35.300 through
8.35.370 and this Subchapter have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
   (b)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures” (as defined in Section
8.35.050) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (c)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (d)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the “minimum necessary” considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
“Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this Chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission
for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the
applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
   (e)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be
recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Riverside County
Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of
title of the affected parcel of land.
   (f)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.520 Appeal Board.
   (a)   In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this Chapter, and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
      (4)   Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
      (5)   Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.
   (b)   Variances shall only be issued upon a:
      (1)   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional “hardship” to the applicant; and
      (3)   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary
public expense, create a nuisance (see “Public safety and nuisance”), cause
“fraud and victimization” of the public, or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
   (c)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement,
and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally

APPENDIX
ALLUVIAL FAN ADVISORY
1.   Hazards of Alluvial Fan Development.
Alluvial fans present a unique flood hazard environment where the combination
of sediment, slope, and topography create an ultra hazardous condition for
which elevation on fill will not provide reliable protection. Active alluvial
fan flooding is characterized by flow path uncertainty combined with abrupt
deposition and erosion. As a result, any area of an alluvial fan may be subject
to intense flood hazards.
The technology of mathematically modeling the hydrodynamics of water and debris
flows for alluvial fans is still in the early development stage. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has formulated a mapping procedure for the
purpose of defining the likelihood of flood hazards on inundated alluvial fan
zones to be used for flood insurance purposes and general floodplain
regulation, referred to as the FEMA alluvial fan methodology.
An active alluvial fan flooding hazard is indicated by three related criteria:
   a.   Flow path uncertainty below the hydrographic apex;
   b.   Abrupt deposition and ensuing erosion of sediment as a stream or debris
flow loses its competence to carry material eroded from a steeper, upstream
source area; and
   c.   An environment where the combination of sediment availability, slope,
and topography creates an ultra hazardous condition for which elevation on fill
will not reliably mitigate the risk.
Inactive alluvial fan flooding is similar to traditional riverine flood
hazards, but occurs only on alluvial fans. It is characterized by flow paths
with a higher degree of certainty in realistic assessments of flood risk or in
the reliable mitigation of the hazard. Counter to active alluvial fan flooding
hazards, an inactive alluvial fan flooding hazard is characterized by
relatively stable flow paths. However, areas of inactive alluvial fan flooding,
as with active alluvial fan flooding, may be subject to sediment deposition and
erosion, but to a degree that does not cause flow path instability and
uncertainly.
An alluvial fan may exhibit both active alluvial fan flooding and inactive
alluvial fan flooding hazards. The hazards may vary spatially or vary at the
same location, contingent on the level of flow discharge. Spatially, for
example, upstream inactive portions of the alluvial fan may distribute flood
flow to active areas at the distal part of the alluvial fan. Hazards may vary
at the same location, for example, with a flow path that may be stable for
lower flows, but become unstable at higher flows.
More detailed information can be found at FEMA’s website: “Guidelines for
Determining Flood Hazards on Alluvial Fans” at http://www.fema.gov/fhm/
ft_afgd2.shtm#1.
2.   Alluvial Fans and LOMRs.
The NFIP does not allow for the removal of land from the floodplain based on
the placement of fill (LOMR-F) in alluvial fan flood hazard areas. The NFIP
will credit a major structural flood control project, through the LOMR process,
that will effectively eliminate alluvial fan flood hazards from the protected
area. Details about map revisions for alluvial fan areas can be found in the
Code of Federal Regulations at Title 44, Part 65.13.
3.   Alluvial Fan Task Force.
As stated in AB 2141 (Longville, Chapter 878, Statutes of 2004), the State of
California Department of Water Resources will convene an Alluvial Fan Task
Force (AFTF). The AFTF will produce an alluvial fan model ordinance for local
communities and a recommendations report to the legislature. As of March 2006,
the model ordinance and report are projected to be completed by 2007.

9.06.090   Prohibition on possession and smoking of marijuana in City
buildings.
9.06.010 Purpose and intent.
   The City Council finds as follows:
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose and intent of this Chapter is to regulate the
cultivation of marijuana in a manner that protects the health, safety and
welfare of the community consistent with Proposition 64, also known as the
Control, Regulate, and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act ("AUMA"). This Chapter is
not intended to interfere with a patient’s right to medical marijuana, as
provided for in California Health & Safety Code Section 11362.5, nor does it
criminalize medical marijuana possession or cultivation by specifically defined
classifications of persons, pursuant to state law. This Chapter is not intended
to give any person unfettered legal authority to grow marijuana; it is intended
simply to impose zoning restrictions on the personal indoor cultivation of
marijuana permitted under AUMA, when it is authorized by California state law
for medical or other lawful purposes under the state law.
   (b)   Applicability. As set out in Canyon Lake Municipal Code Chapter 9.03,
and authorized by AB 243 (Section 11362.777 of the Health & Safety Code),
marijuana cultivation, as defined in Section 17.114.02, remains prohibited in
all zones and districts of the City of Canyon Lake until and unless AUMA is
passed at the November 8, 2016, statewide general election. Upon the passage of
AUMA at that election, the cultivation of non-medical marijuana in the City
shall be controlled and regulated by the provisions of this Chapter, which is
an uncodified portion of the Zoning Code.
   (c)   Non-conflicting enactment. No part of this Chapter shall be deemed to
conflict with federal law as contained in the Controlled Substances Act, 21
U.S.C. §§ 800 et seq., nor to otherwise permit any activity that is prohibited
under that Act or any other local, state or federal law, statute, rule or
regulation.
(Ord. 168, passed 11-2-2016; Am. Ord. 171, passed 12-14-2016)

   (a)   "Authorized Grower" means a person, 21 years old or older, who is
authorized by, and in compliance with, federal or state law to cultivate
marijuana indoors for personal use. There may be only one authorized grower per
private residence who can present written evidence that any and all other
persons, 21 years old or older, have authorized that person to obtain the
permit referenced below.
   (b)   "City" means the City of Canyon Lake, California.
   (c)   "Cultivation" means any activity involving the planting, growing,

floor is secured by bolts or similar attachments, is secure against
unauthorized entry, is accessible only through one or more lockable doors, and
is not visible from a public right-of-way. Walls and roofs must be constructed
of solid materials that cannot be easily broken through, such as two-inch-by-
four-inch nominal or thicker studs overlaid with three-eighths-inch or thicker
plywood or the equivalent. Plastic sheeting, regardless of gauge, or similar
products do not satisfy this requirement. If indoor grow lights or air
filtration systems are used, they must comply with the California building,
electrical, and fire codes as adopted in the City of Canyon Lake.
   (e)   "Immature marijuana plant" means a marijuana plant, whether male or
female, that has not yet flowered and that does not yet have buds that are
readily observed by unaided visual examination.
   (f)   "Indoors" means within a fully enclosed and secure structure as that
structure is defined above.
   (g)   "Mature marijuana plant" means a marijuana plant, whether male or
female, that has flowered and that has buds that are readily observed by

9.15.010 Purpose.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to provide regulations for the development of
areas in the City that, because of their topography, require special
consideration to ensure that they are developed in a way that substantially
maintains their natural character and environmental and aesthetic values to
implement the general plan, and to provide for the safety, health, and welfare
of the public by:
   (a)   Providing guidelines and standards for development in visually
sensitive hillside areas to minimize the adverse impacts of grading and to
promote the following goals and objectives of the general plan:
      (1)   Open Space Goal OS-1: Maintain an open space system that conserves
remaining natural resources, enhances aesthetic values, and promotes the
health, safety and general welfare;
      (2)   Open Space Policy OSP-2: Cooperate with regional and subregional
planning agencies in matters of mutual open space concerns;
      (3)   Open Space Strategy OSS-6: Require sensitive ecological areas,
steep slopes, and special land form features to be preserved as open space;
   (b)   To preserve and enhance the visual and aesthetic quality of hillsides
for the surrounding community;
   (c)   To encourage the characteristics and qualities that promote a “sense
of place” within a hillside setting;
   (d)   Maintaining an environment consistent with existing vegetation,
wildlife, soils, geology, slopes, and drainage patterns, and to preserve
natural topography and scenic character, including canyons, creeks, knolls,
rock outcrops, and ridgelines whenever feasible;
   (e)   Encouraging development that is limited to the more gently sloping
portions of the site;
   (f)   Encouraging developments that preserve desirable existing features of
land (e.g., natural appearing slopes, significant ridgelines, natural
vegetation, viewsheds, topographic features);
   (g)   Limiting the impact of cut and fill slopes on adjacent developed and
undeveloped properties;
   (h)   Preserving the regional view corridor located along Railroad Canyon
Road and the aesthetics of the region which further are preserved by similar
ordinances, policies and practices in surrounding cities; and
   (i)   Preserving the community's existing natural significant ridgelines
visible from Canyon Lake.
(Ord. 112, passed 3-4-2009)
9.15.20 Definitions.
   For the purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions shall apply:
   (a)   “Clearing” means the removal of vegetation (grass, brush, trees, and
similar plant types) by mechanical means (also known as brushing and/or
grubbing).
   (b)   “Cluster development” is a concept where structures are grouped on
certain portions of a site, frequently of different shapes and sizes,
surrounded by large expanses of open space.
   (c)   “Contour” is a line drawn on a plan that connects points of equal
elevation.
   (d)   “Contour grading” means a grading concept designed to result in earth
forms that resemble natural terrain characteristics. Horizontal and vertical
curve variations are often used for slope banks.
   (e)   “Conventional grading” is a grading concept that results in simple,
straight forward cut and fill lines and even planed slopes. This is the most
basic type of grading often resulting in an “engineered or man-made” appearance
attributable to a lack of curvilinear or natural-appearing shapes.
   (f)   “Cut” means the mechanical removal of earth material.
   (g)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (h)   “Finished grade” means the final elevation of the ground surface after
development, that is in conformance with the approved plan.
   (i)   “Grading” means to bring an existing surface to a designed form by
excavating, filling, or landforming operations in excess of 50 cubic yards.
   (j)   “Hillside” or “Hillside areas” refers to those portions of land
displaying slopes, ridgelines, hills, knolls, canyons or similar topographic
features with a slope (as defined herein) of 25% or greater and are identified
on the Hillside Overlay and Significant Ridgeline Map.
   (k)   “Hillside Overlay and Significant Ridgeline Map” is an exhibit which
is incorporated herein by reference and attached to Ordinance No. 112, passed
March 4, 2009 and which shall be maintained on file in the Planning Department,
showing the areas subject to this Chapter.
   (l)   “Landform grading” is a grading method that replicates the irregular
shapes of natural slopes. Landform graded slopes are characterized by
continuous series of concave and convex forms interspersed with mounds that
blend into profiles, nonlinearity in plan view, varying slope gradients, and
significant transition zones, between man-made and natural slopes.
   (m)   “Minimal grading” is a grading concept designed to minimize excavation
and filling. Allows the movement of earth for projects (e.g., as individual
building foundations, driveways, local roads, and utility excavation). The
concept is associated with roads conforming closely to natural contours and
with structures being built on natural terrain.
   (n)   “Pad” is a level area created by grading to accommodate development.
   (o)   “Plot plan” is an application filed with the Planning Division,
including all information required by forms available at the Planning Division
and Section 18.30 of Ordinance 348 of the City of Canyon Lake.
   (p)   “Project” means a project which is subject to this Chapter, includes
subdivisions, permits, uses, structures, specific plans, master development
plans, conditional use permits and associated plot plans for development review
except as specifically exempted by Section 9.15.040.
   (q)   “Significant ridgeline(s)” means natural ridgeline(s) that are
generally within or surrounding the City of Canyon Lake that are visible from
Canyon Lake or Railroad Canyon Road that form part of the skyline or are seen
as a distinct edge. All significant ridgelines are identified within the
Hillside Overlay and Significant Ridgeline Map and are included with Ordinance
No. 112, passed March 4, 2009.
   (r)   “Slope” is an inclined ground surface, the inclination of which is
expressed as a ratio of the vertical distance (rise), or change in elevation,
to the horizontal distance (run). The percent of a given slope is determined by
dividing the rise by the run, multiplied by 100.
    Change in Elevation (rise)
    Horizontal Distance (run)
   (s)   “Slope ratio” is the relationship of a slope's horizontal length to
vertical height, with the height specified as one (e.g. 2:1).
(Ord. 112, passed 3-4-2009)
9.15.030 Applicability.

(Ord. 112, passed 3-4-2009)
9.15.060 Hillside development standards.
   The hillside development standards are intended to illustrate and amplify
the appropriate development concepts for hillside areas. The standards are
intended to encourage flexibility and creativity to design projects which
exceed the standards in order to respect the natural character of each
hillside. The following are minimum standards and shall apply to hillside or
hillside area as defined in Section 9.15.020.
   (a)   Hillside Slope Categories. The following descriptions serve as general
standards for hillside slope categories to ensure that development will
compliment the overall character of the landform.
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
 
% Natural Slope Category Standards
Up to 25%                This is not considered a hillside condition and is not
                         subject to this Chapter.
                         This is a hillside condition and is subject to this
                         Chapter. Development within this slope category shall
                         minimize impacts to grading, vegetation removal,
                         safety and environmental and aesthetic impacts. Impact
                         of access and roadways shall be minimized by following
                         natural contours or using grade separations.
                         Structures shall blend with the natural landform
                         through their shape, material, and color. Special
25% up to 50%            hillside design techniques are required, which may
                         include the use of larger lots, variable setbacks, and
                         variable building structural techniques and
                         clustering. Padded building sites may be considered in
                         some instances. Where this occurs, the City may
                         consider padded building sites adjacent to special
                         features when it is found that grading of padded
                         building sites will create a better relationship
                         between the special feature(s) and the building sites.
                         In addition to the requirements of the above slope
35% up to 50%            category, projects with an average slope in excess of
                         35% may not exceed 50% of the maximum allowable
                         density as identified within the General Plan.
50% and over             This is an excessive slope condition and development
                         is prohibited.
 
   (b)   Site Design.
      (1)   Grading shall not take place on natural slopes that exceed 50%.
      (2)   Driveway grades above 14% may only be considered when driveways are
aligned with the natural contours of the land, are necessary to achieve
effective site design, and safety considerations are met to the satisfaction of
the Building Official, City Engineer, and the Fire Department. Proper design
considerations shall be employed, including the use of vertical curves. On
driveways that may be approved with a slope greater than 14%, a coarse, all-
weather paving material, or grooves for traction, shall be incorporated into
the construction.
      (3)   Roadways shall conform to the natural landform. Significant
alterations to the physical and visual character of a hillside shall be avoided
by eliminating large notches in ridgelines and wide straight alignments.
Modified or reduced width road sections and split sections shall be considered
in the layout of hillside streets to reduce grading and cuts in topography
while allowing access for fire trucks and other emergency vehicles.
      (4)   Slopes in excess of 2:1 shall not be allowed and slopes shall not
exceed 30 feet in height between terraces or benches.
      (5)   Fill slopes shall not be placed perpendicular across a canyon.
Straight line cut-off fill slopes shall not be made to appear like a dam. The
terminus of the fill shall, instead, be concave in shape to restore the canyon
appearance. This concave configuration shall be in combination with the use of
substantially flatter slope ratios (4:1, 3.5:1, 3:1) at or near the center of
this indentation. Symmetrical or unsymmetrical concave configurations shall be
used depending upon the adjoining or underlying topographic characteristics.
      (6)   Grading shall be phased so that prompt renegotiation or
construction will control erosion. Where possible, only those areas that will
be built on, resurfaced, or landscaped within the next 120 days shall be
disturbed. Top soil shall be stockpiled during rough grading and used on pads
or revegetated habitat areas, upon the recommendation of the soils engineer. A
100% grading bond shall be submitted to the City to ensure erosion control is
in place throughout all phases and stages of the grading project, subject to
the approval of the City Building Official.
      (7)   Applicable requirements of the City and State shall be complied
with in conjunction with a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit prior to the issuance of a grading permit, which may include,
but is not limited to, an Erosion Control Plan, Best Management Plan (including
Notice of Intent to be filed with the State Water Resources Control Board) and
Construction Monitoring Program.
(Ord. 112, passed 3-4-2009)
9.15.070 Significant ridgelines.
   (a)   Structures. New structures shall not visually impair significant
ridgeline silhouettes as identified within the Hillside Overlay and Significant
Ridgeline Map. Structures are not permitted closer to a significant ridgeline
than 50 feet measured vertically on a cross-section or 100 feet horizontally on
a topographic map from the highest pad elevation, whichever is more
restrictive.
   (b)   Grading. Grading is prohibited within 50 feet measured vertically on a
cross-section or 100 feet horizontally on a topographic map from the crest of a
ridgeline or significant ridgeline.
(Ord. 112, passed 3-4-2009)
9.15.080 Hillside grading guidelines.
   The implementation of the Hillside Grading Guidelines is essential to affect
continued quality community development. The City of Canyon Lake desires to
encourage planning, engineering, and development that results in minimal site
grading in addressing the varying terrain and highly visible hillside areas.
This can be accomplished by following the natural contours as much as possible.
From large scale subdivision design to individual lot grading plans, graded
slopes should be rounded and contoured to blend with the existing terrain.
Significant natural vegetation should be retained and incorporated into
projects whenever possible.
   The guidelines shall apply unless specifically modified by the approving
authority and findings are made that the modification is consistent with the
findings listed in Subsection (k) hereof.
   (a)   Grading must minimize the disturbance to the natural landform, not
destroy visual quality and community character, nor create conditions that may
result in landslides, flooding, or erosion.
   (b)   No grading shall take place in known or suspected hazardous areas as
determined by the City without a geological survey and/or other data and tests
as requested by the City.
   (c)   Projects located in hillside areas shall incorporate clustering,
varying setbacks, multiple orientations, and other site planning techniques to
preserve open spaces, protect natural features, and offer views to residents.
   (d)   Transitioning Slopes. Minimal radius rounding at edges of cut and fill
slopes is not acceptable. Proper transitioning from manufactured slopes to
natural slopes shall be achieved gradually and naturally using radii or
irregular curvilinear shapes that will blend into the adjoining topography
tangentially and not create abrupt changes.
   (e)   Good grading design must be exercised for safety as well as aesthetics
and should incorporate the following measures:
      (1)   Utilization of landform or contour measures to produce cut-and-fill
slopes compatible with existing land character. Continuous unbroken slope
surfaces that are visible from offsite are discouraged. Linear or straight
slopes shall not exceed 100-feet in distance before next rounded contoured
edge. Edges and exposed tops and toes of slopes shall be rounded with a minimum
five-foot radius where there are linear slopes up to 50 feet in length and ten-
foot radius where linear slopes are greater than 50 feet. The parallel planes
of adjacent linear slopes shall be offset by minimum distance of ten-foot
measured perpendicular to the planes.
      (2)   Grading slopes contoured by varying slope increments and undulating
banks vertically and horizontally.
      (3)   Varied cut-and-fill banks and drainage terrace spacing to alleviate
monotony and to allow informal landscaping.
      (4)   Berms at top of slopes and other locations used to screen, vary
profile, and ensure drainage away from slopes.
      (5)   Varied pad levels to avoid appearance of monotonous slope banks and
flat level lots.
   (f)   Minimal Grading. This is typically used for large lot single-family
homes, custom homes with variable foundations that conform to the existing
slopes and other uses such as golf courses that utilize the least amount of
grading in order to get the facility and structures built, but is also
acceptable for commercial uses. This technique embraces the following concepts:
      (1)   Grading should be limited to individual flat graded pad areas for
residential building sites. Grading should be limited to only the required
building areas and adjacent outdoor amenities in steep hillside areas.
      (2)   Foundation systems that require little or no grading are
encouraged, forcing the architecture to conform to the land rather than the
land to conform to the dwelling.
      (3)   Roadways, driveways, and individual building pads should be
designed to conform with contours and to attempt to daylight in the center of
the road or building pad to ensure a minimum cut and fill situation.
   (g)   All manufactured cut and fill slopes exceeding ten-feet in height
which will be either exposed to permanent public view or are adjacent to
environmentally sensitive areas, should be designed with features
characteristic of natural slopes where physically feasible so that their
ultimate appearance will resemble a natural slope. This will include slopes
along streets and highways, slopes adjacent to parks, schools, or open spaces
and other public facilities and other prominent and visible slopes.
   (h)   Clustering of development is encouraged within the allowable density
identified in the General Plan. This is particularly important in
environmentally sensitive areas in order to reduce the potential for fire
hazard, erosion and excess runoff, and to preserve existing natural features
and open space.
   (I)   In the planning, design, and development of public utilities and
infrastructure, every reasonable effort shall be made to minimize grading
impacts and harmonize with natural contours and character of the landform
design applied.
   (j)   The City Council or its designee may modify or waive any of the
hillside/grading guidelines when an improved design will result or where it can
be demonstrated that imposing hillside grading guidelines would either render a
parcel of land unbuildable, create a loss of all its reasonable economic use,
or place an undue restriction on the improvement of the property, the City
Council may allow development consistent with the General Plan, only when all
of the following findings can be made:
      (1)   The site is physically suitable for the design and siting of the
proposed development. The proposed development will result in minimum
disturbance of sensitive areas;
      (2)   The grading proposed in connection with the development will not
result in soil erosion, silting of lower slopes, flooding, severe scarring or
any other geological instability or fire hazard which would affect health,
safety and general welfare as determined by the City Engineer and all other
requirements of applicable law and regulation are met;
      (3)   The proposed development retains the natural character and visual
quality of the site and the aesthetic qualities of the area; and
      (4)   The proposed development is in conformance with the qualitative
development standards and guidelines as established in this Chapter and is in

9.25.010 Purpose and intent.
   (a)   The purpose of this Chapter is to establish standards for the
fabrication, erection, and use of signs, and to regulate the location, type,
size, and height of signage for all properties within the City of Canyon Lake.
The adoption of this Chapter reflects the formal finding of fact by the City
Council of the City of Canyon Lake that regulation of signage advances the
following compelling governmental interests:
      (1)   Reducing signage that the City has determined to be a cause of
unsafe traffic and visibility conditions for pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers,
and passengers.
      (2)   Protecting pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers, and passengers from
injury caused by the faulty and uncontrolled construction and use of signs
within the City.
      (3)   Protecting pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers, and passengers from
injury caused by distractions, obstructions, and hazards created by certain
signs or by cluttered, distracting, or illegible signage.
      (4)   Promoting the public welfare, health, and safety of all persons
using public thoroughfares and rights-of way within the City of Canyon Lake in
relation to the signage displayed thereon, or overhanging, or projecting into
such public spaces.
      (5)   Preserving the value of private property by assuring the
compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses.
      (6)   Assuring that those public benefits derived from expenditures of
public funds for the improvement and beautification of public streets and other
public structures and spaces are protected by exercising reasonable controls
over character and design of signage.
      (7)   Advancing the aesthetic goals of the City throughout the community
and ensure the effectiveness and flexibility in the design, creativity, or use
of signage without creating a detriment to the general public.
   (b)   The provisions of this Chapter are not intended to abrogate any
easements, covenants, conditions, restrictions, or agreements which are more
restrictive than the provisions hereof. The provisions of this Chapter are in
addition to the Canyon Lake Property Owners Association (POA) requirements
which are enforced separately.
   (c)   Furthermore, this Chapter leaves ample and adequate alternative
channels of commercial speech communication for the messages portrayed on
advertising signs - namely, distributed print media, broadcast media, and
point-of-purchase display - and is narrowly defined so as to limit said
prohibition to commercial speech on exterior signage and signage intended to be
viewed from beyond the boundaries of a site.
   (d)   The penalties of the City of Canyon Lake Municipal Code may be
applicable to violations of the provisions of this title.
   (e)   Any sign authorized by this Chapter may contain a noncommercial
message.

structure, do not exceed 16 square feet for each face, and do not rotate. Any
monument sign which incorporates a time and temperature element may be
permitted up to 50% additional height. A sign with a time and temperature
element may not be located within 4,000 lineal feet of another such sign along
the same roadway. Any clock shall keep accurate time; if this condition is not

9.30.030   Zones established.
   
9.30.040   Specific Plan requirements.
   
9.30.050   Planned Unit Development land use permit.
9.30.010 Purpose.
   (a)   To provide general criteria for the development of a mixture of
commercial and residential land uses;
   (b)   To increase the land area available for residential development and
provide alternative types of housing;
   (c)   To encourage medium- and high-density residential development to occur
in close proximity to employment and services;
   (d)   To provide appropriate locations for a broad range of live and/or work
activities to occur;
   (e)   To encourage a mixture of compatible and synergistic land uses, such
as residential with compatible nonresidential uses including office, retail,
personal services, public spaces and other community amenities;
   (f)   To strengthen the interaction between residential, commercial and
employment uses in order to reduce dependency on automobiles, improve air
quality, decrease urban sprawl, facilitate use of transit and encourage
conservation of land resources;
   (g)   To revitalize commercial areas by integrating residential uses and
compatible nonresidential land uses into the commercial fabric to enhance the
vitality of businesses;
   (h)   To foster pedestrian-oriented activity nodes by providing a mix of
uses in compact, walkable areas;
   (i)   To allow for a greater variety of land uses and structures, including
adaptive reuse of existing structures and flexibility in site planning.
(Ord. 196, passed 3-4-2020)
9.30.020 Uses permitted.
   The following uses are permitted within the Mixed Use Zone:
   (a)   Singular, stand-alone uses that contribute to an overall mixture of
residential and commercial uses within the zone or combined uses in one project
as a mixed-use development.
   (b)   Supportive housing by right as defined in Government Code Section
65651(a) through (d).
   (c)   Commercial uses as listed in the C-1 General Commercial Zone, unless
otherwise referenced or modified in an adopted Specific Plan or other
applicable document.
(Ord. 196, passed 3-4-2020; Am. Ord. 235, passed 5-10-2023)
9.30.030 Zones established.
   (a)   Mixed Use land use designations have been established in the General
Plan to provide development opportunities for integrated and complementary
residential and commercial development on the same parcel or a contiguous group
of parcels. Singular, stand-alone uses are permitted when they foster an
overall mixture of uses in the zone. A wide range of residential and commercial
uses are permitted and it is the intent of this zoning category to foster a
mixture of product types. Development that includes solely commercial or
residential uses is strongly discouraged. However, the Mixed Use zoning
category is not the sole means of implementing this General Plan land use
category, since the existing Zoning Ordinance currently provides various
residential and commercial zoning standards for these locations and properties
can be subdivided to provide different land uses on separate parcels within
this General Plan category. To utilize the Mixed Use zoning category, a zone
change in conjunction with a development plan is required.
   (b)   Several of the General Plan Mixed Use land use locations have a
variety of unique physical and design features that are discussed in the
following Subsections.
   (c)   Village Overlay.
      (1)   The Village Overlay area is currently undeveloped land within an
existing hillside. The General Plan Land Use Element designates this area for
Mixed Use Development. The Housing Element of the General Plan requires that a
portion of land within this area be developed for a mixture of housing types at
a minimum of 20 dwelling units per acre in order to accommodate the City's
share of the regional housing need for the 2013-2021 time period. The balance
of the land can be developed for nonresidential and other types of residential
land uses.
      (2)   Development in the Village Overlay area is already subject to the
approval of a Specific Plan, as described in the provisions of
Chapter 9.20 of the Canyon Lake Municipal Code. The Municipal Code currently
provides detailed residential development requirements for this location. The
General Plan Land Use Element also requires the use of a Specific Plan in
particular circumstances. Due to the detailed requirements that exist for this
particular location and potential administrative conflicts that would arise if
the existing development standards are modified, it is unlikely the use of the
Mixed Use Zone would be applicable to this location.
   (d)   Towne Center. The Canyon Lake Towne Center is currently a fully
developed commercial shopping center. The purpose of utilizing Mixed Use Zone
within the shopping center is to: (1) incorporate multifamily residential
development within the existing or any future development design of the Center;
(2) enhance the Center's commercial viability and attractiveness; and (3)
provide upgraded amenities and design features. Mixed Use development in the
Towne Center is subject to the approval of a Specific Plan as described in
Section
9.30.040 and rezoning of the property to Mixed Use.
   (e)   Additional Mixed Use Locations.
      (1)   The General Plan Mixed Use land use designations established
throughout the City are intended to provide development opportunities for a
mixture of multifamily residential and commercial development and to
incorporate unique design requirements and features that are tailored to the
site specific needs of each location. The Village Overlay and Towne Center are
either specifically referenced in the Housing Element for multiple family
development or currently operate an existing use without residential
development.
      (2)   The other potential locations for mixed use currently include an
existing church and vacant hillside land. Due to the existence of the church
and the site constraints of the vacant parcel exhibited by significant hillside
topography, it may not be appropriate to maintain Mixed Use land use
designations on these properties. However, in order to properly address and
regulate future development in these areas as they currently exist, it may be
appropriate to utilize the Specific Plan process to enumerate appropriate
development standards for each location, as described in Section
9.30.040.
(Ord. 196, passed 3-4-2020)
9.30.040 Specific Plan requirements.
   (a)   A Specific Plan prepared as part of a Mixed Use zone change
application must include the following information:
      (1)   The distribution, location, and extent of the uses of land,
including open space, within the area covered by the plan;
      (2)   The proposed distribution, location, and extent and intensity of
major components of public and private transportation, sewage, water, drainage,
solid waste disposal, energy, and other essential facilities proposed to be
located within the area covered by the plan and needed to support the land uses
described in the plan;
      (3)   Standards and criteria by which development will proceed, and
standards for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural
resources, where applicable;
      (4)   A program of implementation measures including regulations,
programs, public works projects, and financing measures necessary to carry out
paragraphs (1) through (3) above;
      (5)   A statement of the relationship of the specific plan to the General
Plan.
      (6)   Prior to the transmittal of the Specific Plan to the City Council,
the City Planner may request additional information from the applicant.
   (b)   The Specific Plan shall be adopted as a resolution.
(Ord. 196, passed 3-4-2020)
9.30.050 Planned Unit Development land use permit.
   The General Plan Land Use Element allows Mixed Use development subject to a
Planned Development land use permit. In addition, the Mixed Use land use
category also allows a residential density of 24 or more units per acre upon
approval of a comprehensive specific plan. Provisions for a Planned Development
land use permit do not exist within the Zoning Ordinance. A Planned Development
typically includes common areas or facilities for use by residents or
businesses. Due to the probability that new Mixed Use development will have
common areas and the mixture of residential and commercial uses are best
addressed utilizing a Specific Plan format that can create design standards
applicable to the unique circumstances of each site, for the purposes of this
Section a Planned Development land use permit shall have the same meaning as a
Specific Plan or associated conditional use permit, depending upon the types of
uses proposed.

conditions that require that the City regulate the existence of weeds,
flammable vegetation and other combustible matter and establish a year-round
weed abatement program.
   (b)   Weeds, flammable vegetation, and other combustible matter constitute a
fire hazard and are a danger to the public health, safety and welfare. The City
Council declares that weeds, flammable vegetation, and other combustible matter
are public nuisances and may be abated as provided in this Chapter.

(Ord. 240, passed 12-13-2023)
11.12.030 Duty to abate weeds, flammable vegetation and other combustible
matter.
   It shall be the duty of every owner, occupant and person in control of any
private land or interest in private real property within the City of Canyon
Lake to abate therefrom, and from all sidewalks, trails, easements, and
parkways on such property, all weeds, flammable vegetation, and other
combustible matter. The procedures for abatement set forth herein are not
exclusive but are in addition to other procedures set forth in this Code for
the abatement of nuisances. The obligation to abate all weeds, flammable
vegetation, and other combustible matter shall comply with the following:
   (a)   Any parcel, or contiguous parcels under the same ownership, of five
acres or less, shall be free of all weeds, flammable vegetation, and
combustible matter. Removal of weeds, flammable vegetation, and combustible
matter shall be provided by either of the following methods:
      (1)   The entire parcel or contiguous parcels shall be mowed so that the
parcel is free of flammable vegetation and combustible matter and weeds are no
higher than three inches above the soil; or
      (2)   Where fire hazard conditions, rocks or other physical obstructions
make mowing impractical, the Fire Chief or his or her designee may authorize
abatement by discing or any similar operation that cuts into and disturbs the
soil. This type of abatement shall only occur after receipt of written
authorization from the Fire Chief or his or her designee. Prior to any such
abatement, the property must be watered in accordance with any Rule of the
South Coast Air Quality Management District’s regarding the minimization of
particulate matter in the ambient air and must be free of combustible matter.
   (b)   Any parcel, or contiguous parcels under the same ownership, of more
than five acres shall have a firebreak of not less than 100 feet wide at the
outside boundaries of the parcel, or the outside boundaries of the whole of the
contiguous parcels. The creation of the firebreak shall comply with the methods
described in Subsection (a) of this section. In addition, firebreaks shall be
maintained such that no portion of the parcel or contiguous parcels shall be
larger than two and one-half acres in area without a firebreak. For land that
is used primarily for the grazing of livestock or planted for the harvesting of
agricultural crops, firebreaks shall be not less than ten feet wide (instead of
100 feet wide). The Fire Chief or his or her designee may require firebreaks
exceeding 100 feet in width when he or she deems it necessary for the
protection of the public safety and welfare.
   (c)   The roof of every structure shall be free of leaves, pine needles, and
flammable vegetation.
   (d)   No portion of any tree shall be within ten feet of the outlet of a
chimney or stovepipe.
   (e)   Any plant, tree, or shrub adjacent to or overhanging a building shall
be free of dead or dying wood.
   (f)   Where any parcel or contiguous parcels under the same ownership are
improved in a manner that prevents abatement in accordance with the
requirements of this Section, the Fire Chief or his or her may authorize, or
require, other means of abatement.

to abate shall not affect the City’s power to proceed as provided in this part,
nor shall it invalidate any subsequent special assessment or lien against the
subject property.
   (e)   The notice to abate required by this Section shall be in the form
described in Sections 39563-39567.1 of the Government Code.
(Ord. 240, passed 12-13-2023)

CHAPTER 11.13: UNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF A CATALYTIC CONVERTER
Section
   
11.13.010      Finding and purpose.
   
11.13.020      Definitions.
   
11.13.030      Unlawful possession of a catalytic converter.
   
11.13.040      Violation and enforcement.
11.13.010 Findings and purpose.
   The City Council of Canyon Lake finds that the theft of catalytic converters
has been an increasing problem in Canyon Lake in recent years. In Riverside
County, there were at least 200 reports of catalytic converter thefts in 2022
and, as of July 1, 2023, there were at least 316 reports by victims. The
external location of catalytic converters and the use of valuable precious
metals, including rhodium, palladium and platinum, in catalytic converters
makes these devices a target for thieves. Individuals in possession of stolen
catalytic converters often recycle them for substantial profit, while victims
of these thefts suffer the consequences of paying thousands of dollars in
repairs, the inconvenience of repairing their vehicles, and feeling unsafe in
the community. Finding the victim of these crimes is extremely difficult due to
the manner in which the catalytic converter thefts occur and lack of
identifying markers on catalytic converters to link a stolen catalytic
converter to the victim. The inability to identify the victims of catalytic
converter thefts can inhibit the ability to successfully prosecute individuals
for the thefts. This Chapter is necessary to provide the City, in conjunction
with the County of Riverside and other surrounding cities, a means to protect
the public, deter this criminal activity and promote a more productive use of
Canyon Lake resources. The purpose and intent of this Chapter is to curb the
theft of catalytic converters throughout the City and to provide the City with
reasonable means to address the impact on the community and the victims posed
by increasing catalytic converter thefts.

limit any of the penalties provided for under California law, including but not
limited to the Penal Code, with regard to the sale, use, possession, delivery,
and/or receipt of catalytic converters.
   (c)   Administrative citations. In addition to any other penalties provided
by law, whenever an Enforcement Officer determines a violation of this Chapter
has occurred, the Enforcement Officer shall have the authority to issue an
administrative citation in the manner described in
Chapter 11.26 of this Code.

for the violation, the administrative citation shall be mailed to the

person personally, or by certified mail or regular mail, the Enforcement
Officer shall post the administrative citation on any real property within the
City in which the City has knowledge that the responsible person has a legal
interest, and such posting shall be deemed effective service.

11.90.040 Penalties and enforcement.
   (a)    Any person who violates this Chapter shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor; provided, however, that any such offense may be charged as an
infraction in the discretion of the City Attorney or District Attorney. The
City Attorney is authorized to prosecute any other civil or criminal remedies
available in law or in equity for violations of this Chapter, including, but
not limited to, seeking an order or warrant to confiscate psychoactive bath
salts or psychoactive herbal incense.
   (b)   Any person who violates this Chapter shall be guilty of a separate
offense for each day or part of a day during which the violation is committed,

the person consuming the synthetic drug, but also to the public at large. If
the Code Enforcement Officer, based on the facts then known, determines that a
violation of this Chapter presents an imminent danger or hazard or is
imminently injurious to the public health or safety, then that violation is
punishable by the summary abatement procedures set forth in Chapter 11.20
hereof.

create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health,
safety and general welfare; and
   (b)   Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or

or
      (5)   Sit, lie, sleep, or store, use, maintain, or place personal

CHAPTER 14.50: SOLICITATION
Section
   
14.50.010      Findings.
   
14.50.020      Authority and purpose.
   
14.50.030      Applicability.
   
14.50.040      Definitions.
   
14.50.050      Aggressive solicitations prohibited.
   
14.50.060      All solicitations prohibited at specified locations.
   
14.50.070      Exemptions.
   
14.50.080      Penalty.
14.50.010 Findings.
   The City Council hereby finds, determines and declares that:
   (a)   Solicitations made in an aggressive manner are unsafe and disruptive
to persons in the City of Canyon Lake and are a threat to public health,
safety, and general welfare. Aggressive solicitations typically include
approaching or following pedestrians, the use of abusive language, unwanted
physical contact, or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular
traffic.
   (b)   An increase in aggressive solicitation throughout the city has become
extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses, and has
contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places,
but also to an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation and disorder.
   (c)   Aggressive solicitation from people in places where they are a
"captive audience" in which it is impossible or difficult for them to exercise
their own right to decline to listen to or to avoid solicitation from others,
is problematic, detracts from the rights of persons in the city to quietly
enjoy public facilities and presents a risk to the health, safety and welfare
of the public.
   (d)   The presence of individuals who solicit money from persons at or near
banks or automated teller machines is especially threatening and dangerous.
Such activity often carries with it an implicit threat to both person and
property. Restricting solicitation in such places will provide a balance
between the rights of solicitors and the rights of persons who wish to decline
or avoid such solicitations, and will help avoid or diminish the threat of
violence in such unwarranted and unavoidable confrontations.
   (e)   Aggressive solicitation on roadway median strips, at traffic
intersections, in public parking lots and in the public roadway and lingering
and loitering on a median are unsafe and hazardous for solicitors, drivers,
pedestrians, and the general public. Aggressive soliciting on roadway median
strips, at traffic intersections, in public parking lots and in the public
roadway increases the risk of drivers becoming distracted from their primary
duty to watch traffic, which may result in automobile accidents, congestion and
blockage of streets, and delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel, all
of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems.
   (f)   The Council's intent in enacting this chapter is not to interfere with
the exercise of First Amendment rights of those engaged in solicitation on
roadway median strips, at traffic intersections, in public parking lots and in
the public roadway and lingering and loitering on the medians, but only to
minimize the safety hazards of those in such areas as well as the drivers and
passengers in vehicles near these areas and in a manner to minimize those
safety hazards.
   (g)   The practice of aggressive solicitation near driveways accessing
shopping centers, retail, and business establishments is unsafe and hazardous
for solicitors, drivers, pedestrians and the general public. The location of
the solicitor near the driveway compromises the solicitor's safety, impedes
visibility, and impairs a driver's ability to safely enter and exit. Drivers
also become distracted from their duty to watch traffic, which may result in
automobile accidents, congestion and blockage of streets, and delay and
obstruction of the free flow of travel, all of which constitute substantial
traffic safety problems.
   (h)   The restrictions of this Chapter are content neutral and are narrowly
tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, but still provide
alternative avenues of communication.
   (i)   The reasonable time, place, manner restrictions in this Chapter avoid
the negative effects of aggressive solicitation and solicitation in unsafe
places and will not unreasonably restrict free speech of people engaged in
solicitation.
(Ord. 211, passed 10-6-2021)
14.50.020 Authority and purpose.
   (a)   This Chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to the City
of Canyon Lake in Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution.
   (b)   The purpose and intent of this Chapter is to protect public health,
safety and the general welfare of people in the City of Canyon Lake and improve
the quality of life and economic vitality of the City of Canyon Lake by
imposing reasonable time, place, manner, restrictions on certain forms of
solicitation while respecting the constitutional rights of free speech for all
citizens as further described in the findings set forth in Section
14.50.010.
(Ord. 211, passed 10-6-2021)
14.50.030 Applicability.
