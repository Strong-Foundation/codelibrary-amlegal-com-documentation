PREFACE
      The La Puente Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing
Company in 1960, has been kept current by regular supplementation. Supplements
for this Municipal Code are now published by American Legal Publishing
Corporation.
      During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and
indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction
of the city attorney.
      The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor
decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation
without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number
designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus,
Section 5.12.050 is Section .050, located in Chapter 5.12 of Title 5. In most
instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine
vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions.
Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion.
      In parentheses following each section is a legislative history
identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This
legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table,
following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their
subjects, and where they appear in the codification.
      A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific
code provisions by individual section numbers.
      This supplement brings the code up to date through Ordinance 986, passed
May 14, 2024.

1.12.050 Procedure for serving administrative citation.
   An enforcement official may issue an administrative citation, on a form
approved by the city manager, to a responsible person, as follows:
   (a)   If the responsible person is a corporation, the enforcement official
shall attempt to locate any one of the following individuals and issue to that
individual an administrative citation: the president or other head of the
corporation, a vice president, a secretary or assistant secretary, a treasurer
or assistant treasurer, a general manager, or a person authorized by the
corporation to receive service of process in a civil action. If the office
address of any of the above-listed individuals is known to the city, a copy of
the administrative citation also shall be mailed to one of those individuals by
certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. Simultaneously, the
same notice may be sent by regular mail. If a notice sent by certified mail is
returned unsigned, then service shall be deemed effective pursuant to regular
mail, provided the notice that was sent by regular mail is not returned.
   (b)   If the responsible person is a business other than a corporation, the
enforcement official shall attempt to locate the business owner and issue the
business owner an administrative citation. If the enforcement official can
locate only the manager of the business, the administrative citation may be
given to the manager of the business. If the address of the business is known,
a copy of the administrative citation also shall be mailed to that address to
the attention of the business owner or a responsible person. The mailing shall
be sent by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested.
Simultaneously, the same notice may be sent by regular mail. If a notice sent
by certified mail is returned unsigned, then service shall be deemed effective
pursuant to regular mail, provided the notice that was sent by regular mail is
not returned.
   (c)   The enforcement official shall attempt to obtain on the administrative
citation the signature of the responsible person, or in cases in which the
responsible person is a corporation or business, the signature of the person
served with the administrative citation. If a responsible person or person
served refuses or fails to sign the administrative citation, the failure or
refusal to sign shall not affect the validity of the citation or of subsequent
proceedings.
   (d)   If the enforcement official is unable to locate a responsible person
for the violation, the administrative citation shall be mailed to the
responsible person by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested. Simultaneously, the same notice may be sent by regular mail. If a
notice sent by certified mail is returned unsigned, then service shall be
deemed effective pursuant to regular mail, provided the notice that was sent by
regular mail is not returned.
   (e)   If the enforcement official does not succeed in serving the
responsible party personally, or by certified mail or regular mail, the
enforcement official shall post the administrative citation on any real
property within the city in which the city has knowledge that the responsible
party has a legal interest, and such posting shall be deemed effective service.
   (f)   If the enforcement official does not succeed in serving the
responsible party personally, by certified mail or regular mail, and the city
is not aware that the responsible party has a legal interest in any real
property within the city, the enforcement official shall cause the
administrative citation to be published once a week for four successive weeks
in a local newspaper published at least once a week.

1.12.080 Request for administrative hearing.
   Any responsible person to whom an administrative citation is issued may
contest the citation no later than thirty days from the date of service of the
administrative citation by: (a) completing a request for hearing form and
returning it to the city; and (b) either depositing the administrative fine
with the city or providing notice that a request for an advance deposit
hardship waiver has been filed pursuant to Section
1.12.090. A request for hearing form may be obtained from the department
specified on the administrative citation. The person requesting the hearing
shall be notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the time and
place of the hearing at least ten days before the date of the hearing. Any
documentation, other than the administrative citation, which the enforcement
official has submitted or will submit to the hearing officer shall be served on
the person requesting the hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested,
at least five days before the date of the hearing.
(Ord. 762 § 1 (part), 1998)
1.12.090 Advance hardship waiver deposit.
   Any responsible person who requests a hearing to contest an administrative
citation and who is financially unable to deposit the administrative fine as
required in Section
1.12.070 may file a request for an advance deposit hardship waiver. The request
shall be filed with the department of finance on an advance deposit hardship
waiver application form, available from the department, no later than thirty
days after service of the administrative citation. The director of finance may
issue an advance deposit hardship waiver only if the person requesting the
waiver submits to the director a sworn affidavit, together with any supporting
documents, demonstrating to the satisfaction of the director the person’s
financial inability to deposit with the city the full amount of the fine in
advance of the hearing. The director shall issue a written decision specifying
the reasons for issuing or not issuing the waiver. The decision shall be served
upon the person requesting the waiver by certified mail return receipt
requested. If the director determines that the waiver is not warranted, the
person shall remit the full amount of the fine to the city within ten days of
receipt of the director’s written decision.
(Ord. 762 § 1 (part), 1998)
1.12.100 Time for administrative hearing.

requesting the hearing has either deposited the administrative fine in full or
obtained an advance deposit hardship waiver, shall the city set the date and
time for the administrative hearing. The hearing shall be set for a date not
less than fifteen days nor more than sixty days after the request for hearing
form is filed, and the administrative fine is deposited with the city or an
advance deposit hardship waiver is issued. The city shall sent notice of the
date, time, and place of the hearing to the person requesting the hearing by
certified mail return receipt requested at least ten days before the date of
the hearing.
(Ord. 762 § 1 (part), 1998)

issued, or his or her designee, shall select an administrative hearing officer.

staff of the department through which the administrative citation was issued.
In no event, however, shall the enforcement official who issued the
administrative citation be the administrative hearing officer.
(Ord. 762 § 1 (part), 1998)
1.12.130 Procedures at administrative hearing.
   Administrative hearings are informal, and formal rules of evidence and
discovery do not apply. Each party shall have the opportunity to present
evidence in support of his or her case and to cross-examine witnesses. The city
bears the burden of proof at an administrative hearing to establish a violation
of the city code. The administrative citation and any additional reports
submitted by the enforcement official shall constitute prima facie evidence of
the facts contained in those documents. The administrative hearing officer must
use preponderance of evidence as the standard of evidence in deciding the
issues.
(Ord. 762 § 1 (part), 1998)
1.12.140 Failure to attend administrative hearing.
   If the responsible person fails to attend the scheduled hearing, the hearing
will proceed without the responsible person, and he or she will be deemed to
have waived his or her right to an administrative hearing. Notwithstanding this
waiver and the time limits set forth in Section
1.12.100, if service of the administrative citation is made by posting the
citation on real property within the city in which the responsible person has a
legal interest, and the responsible person provides verifiable and substantial
evidence that removal of the administrative citation from the property by a
third party caused the responsible person’s failure to attend the scheduled
hearing, the responsible person shall be entitled to an administrative hearing.
(Ord. 762 § 1 (part), 1998)
1.12.150 Decision of administrative hearing officer.
   No later than thirty days after the date on which the administrative hearing
concludes, the administrative hearing officer shall issue a written decision to
uphold or cancel the administrative citation. The administrative hearing
officer shall set forth the reasons for the decision. The decision shall be
served upon the responsible person by the applicable method set forth in
Section
1.12.050. If the administrative hearing officer upholds the administrative
citation, the city shall retain the fine deposited by the responsible person.
If the administrative hearing officer upholds the administrative citation and
the fine has not been deposited, pursuant to an advance deposit hardship
waiver, the administrative hearing officer shall specify in the decision a
payment schedule for the fine. If the administrative hearing officer cancels
the administrative citation, any fine deposited with the city shall be promptly
refunded, together with interest for the period of time that the city held the
fine, calculated at the average annual rate of return earned by the city’s
investments for the prior fiscal year. The administrative hearing officer’s
written decision is final, and shall notify the responsible person of his right
to appeal as provided in Section
1.12.180.
(Ord. 762 § 1 (part), 1998)
1.12.160 Late payment charges.
   Any person who fails to pay to the city on or before the due date any
administrative fine imposed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be
liable for the payment of any applicable late payment charges set forth in the
administrative citation penalty schedule established by resolution adopted by
the city council.
(Ord. 762 § 1 (part), 1998)
1.12.170 Collection of administrative fine.
   The city may collect any past-due administrative fine or late payment
charges by use of any available legal means, including but not limited to
special assessment or lien on the property or referring the matter to the small
claims court, The city may also recover its collection costs according to
proof.
(Ord. 06-858 § 2, 2006; Ord. 762 § 1 (part), 1998)
1.12.180 Appeal of decision of administrative hearing officer.
   Within twenty days after service of the decision of the administrative
hearing officer upon the responsible person, he or she may seek review of the
decision by filing a notice of appeal with the municipal court. The responsible
person shall serve upon the city clerk either in person or by first class mail
a copy of the notice of appeal. If the responsible person fails to timely file
a notice of appeal, the administrative hearing officer’s decision shall be
deemed confirmed.
(Ord. 762 § 1 (part), 1998)
1.12.190 Failure to pay administrative fine.
   Failure to pay an administrative fine is a misdemeanor. Filing a criminal
misdemeanor action does not preclude the city from using any other legal remedy
available to gain compliance with the administrative order.

(Ord. 17-949 § 2, 2018; Ord. 941 § 4, 2016; Ord. 10-894 § 1, 2010; Ord. 09-982

   (b)   The compensation set forth above in subsection (a) of this section is
exclusive of any amounts payable to members of the city council as
reimbursement for actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of
official duties on behalf of the city. Procedures for such reimbursement may be
specified by resolution adopted by the city council.
(Ord. 767 § 1 (part), 1998)
2.04.120 Rules of decorum for meetings.
   (a)   Decorum. Meetings of the city council must be conducted in an orderly
manner to ensure that the public has an opportunity to be heard and that the
council’s deliberative process is not disrupted. The presiding officer of the
council, whether the mayor, mayor pro tem or, in their absence, another member
so designated by the council, is responsible for maintaining the order and
decorum of meetings.
   (b)   Rules of Decorum. While any meeting of the city council is in session
the following rules of order and decorum must be observed:
      (1)   Persons Addressing the Council. Public oral communications at city
council meetings should not be a substitute for addressing any item that can be
handled during the city’s normal business hours. The primary purpose of oral
communications is to allow citizens the opportunity to formally comment to the
city council, as a body, on matters that are within the subject matter
jurisdiction of the city council and that cannot be handled during the regular
business hours of the city government.
   A person wishing to address the council during the period set aside for oral
communications must submit a request on a form provided by the city clerk;
these requests may be submitted at any time before or during the portion of the
meeting that is devoted to oral communications; provided, however, that these
requests must be submitted prior to the conclusion of the first speaker’s
remarks. Speakers shall be heard by the city council in the order that the
request forms are submitted to the city clerk; provided, however, that the city
council, by motion, may approve a request by a speaker to be heard at the
beginning of oral communications.
   Each person who addresses the council must do so in an orderly manner and
must not make personal, impertinent, slanderous, or profane remarks to any
member of the council, staff, or general public. Any person who makes such
remarks, or who utters loud, threatening, personal, or abusive language, or who
engages in any other disorderly conduct that disrupts, disturbs, or otherwise
impedes the orderly conduct of any council meeting will, at the discretion of
the presiding officer or a majority of the council, be barred from further
audience before the council during that meeting.
      (2)   Members of the Audience. No person in the audience at a council
meeting may engage in disorderly or boisterous conduct, including the utterance
of loud, threatening, or abusive language, whistling, stamping of feet or other
acts that disturb, disrupt, or otherwise impede the orderly conduct of the
council meeting. Any person who behaves in this manner may, at the discretion
of the presiding officer or a majority of the council, be barred from further
audience before the council during that meeting.
   (c)   Addressing the Council. No person may address the council without
first being recognized by the presiding officer. The following procedures must
be observed by persons addressing the council:
      (1)   Each person will step up to the podium provided for the use of the
public and state his or her name and the organization, if any, that he or she
represents.
      (2)   Any subject that is deemed by the council to be irrelevant may be
precluded.
      (3)   With regard to items that are listed on the council agenda, the
remarks of the speaker must be confined to the subject that is being discussed.
      (4)   The remarks of each person must be limited to a combined total of
three minutes unless additional time is granted by the presiding officer of the
council, in conjunction with oral communication presented by that person to the
council and La Puente Successor Agency oral communication.
      (5)   The council may either increase or decrease the total allotted time
set forth in subsection (4) by resolution.
      (6)   All remarks must be addressed to the presiding officer and not to
any single member of the council unless in response to a question from that
member.
   (d)   Rules of Debate and Decorum among Councilmembers. The following rules
apply to all councilmembers at meetings:
      (1)   By Councilmembers. While the council is in session, the members
must preserve order and decorum, and a member must not, by conversation or
otherwise, delay or interrupt the proceedings of the council, nor disturb any
member while speaking, nor refuse to obey the orders of the council or its
presiding officer, except as otherwise provided in this section.
      (2)   Getting the Floor—Improper References to be Avoided. Every member
desiring to speak must address the chair and, upon recognition by the presiding
officer, must confine all remarks to the question under debate.
      (3)   Interruptions. Once recognized, a member must not be interrupted
when speaking unless it is to call that member to order, or as otherwise
provided in this section. If a member is called to order while speaking, that
member must cease speaking until the question of order is determined and, if in
order, the member will be permitted to proceed.
      (4)   Appeals. Any ruling of the mayor may be appealed at the request of
a councilmember. The mayor must call for a roll call vote to determine whether
the council concurs with the ruling.
      (5)   Motion to Reconsider. A motion to reconsider any action taken by
the council may be made only on the same day that such action was taken. It may
be made immediately during the same session or at a recessed or adjourned
session. The motion must be made by one on the prevailing side, but it may be
seconded by any member. It may be made at any time, it has precedence over all
other motions, and it is debatable.
      (6)   Precedence of Motions. When a motion is pending before the council,
no additional motion may be entertained except:
         (A)   Motion to Amend. This motion is debatable only as it relates to
the amendment. Amendments are voted on first, and the vote on the main motion
is last. A motion may be amended more than once with each amendment being voted
on separately. There may be only one amending motion on the floor at any one
time. A new main motion is in order if the intent of the original motion is
changed fundamentally.
         (B)   Motion to Postpone. A motion to postpone indefinitely is
debatable. If this motion is adopted, the principal question is lost. A motion
to postpone to a definite time is subject to debate and amendment as it relates
to the propriety of the postponement and the time that is set to consider the
matter.
         (C)   Motion to Table. This motion is not debatable and not subject to
amendment. The purpose of a motion to table is to suspend consideration of an
item until such time as it is removed from the table. If a motion to table is
adopted, the item will remain tabled through all subsequent meetings of the
city council. An item that has been tabled may be removed from the table only
by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the city council.
      (7)   Effect of Abstention. Unless an abstention from a vote is declared,
a councilmember’s silence will be recorded as an affirmative vote. An
abstention is not counted as either an affirmative or a negative vote, but it
is counted for purposes of a quorum, unless the abstention is due to a conflict
of interest.
      (8)   Time Limits on Debate. Discussion by any councilmember who makes a
motion will be limited to five minutes of debate at the time of making the
motion and an additional five minutes after debate by all other councilmembers
has been completed. Each councilmember not making a motion is limited to five
minutes’ debate on that motion. The time limits delineated in this subsection
may not be divided or allocated so as to permit any councilmember to speak more
than once on a particular matter.
      (9)   Removal of Items from the Consent Calendar. One or more items may
be removed from the consent calendar so that those items may be considered
individually by the city council, if a motion to remove the item or items is
approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the city
council.
   (e)   Enforcement of Decorum. The rules of decorum set forth above will be
enforced in the following manner:
      (1)   Warning. The presiding officer may request that a person who is
breaching the rules of decorum be orderly and silent. After receiving a warning
from the presiding officer, if a person persists in disturbing the meeting, the
presiding officer may order that person to leave the council meeting. If that
person does not leave, then the presiding officer may order any law enforcement
officer who is on duty at the meeting as sergeant-at-arms to remove that person
from the council chambers.
      (2)   Removal. Any law enforcement officer who is serving as sergeant-at-
arms at the council meeting must carry out all orders and instructions given by
the presiding officer for the purpose of maintaining order and decorum at the
council meeting. Upon direction from the presiding officer, it is the duty of
the sergeant-at-arms to remove from the council meeting any person who is
disturbing the proceedings of the council.
      (3)   Resisting Removal. Any person who resists removal by the sergeant-
at-arms may be charged with a violation of this section.
      (4)   Penalty. Any person who violates any provision of this section
will, pursuant to Section
1.08.040 of this code, be guilty of a misdemeanor.
      (5)   Motion to Enforce. If the presiding officer of the council fails to
enforce the rules set forth above, any member of the council may move to
require such enforcement, and an affirmative vote of a majority of the council
will require that action. If the presiding officer of the council fails to
carry out the will of a majority of the council, the majority may designate
another member of the council to act as presiding officer for the limited
purpose of enforcing any rule of this section that it wishes enforced.
      (6)   Adjournment. If a meeting of the council is disturbed or disrupted
in such a manner as to make infeasible or improbable the restoration of order,
the meeting may be adjourned or continued by the presiding officer or by a
majority of the council, and any remaining council business may be considered
at the next meeting.

2.06.010 Declaration of intent.
   In enacting this chapter, the city council finds, determines and declares as
follows:
   (a)   State law acknowledges that there are limited circumstances in which
the protection of the confidentiality of written or verbal communications is
deemed to be more important than the right of the people to be informed.
   (b)   Maintaining the confidentiality of communications between the city and
its legal counsel promotes and protects the candor that is essential to the
delivery and receipt of legal advice regarding matters as to which such advice
is requested.
   (c)   If communications that take place in closed sessions of the
legislative body, as authorized by the Ralph M. Brown Act (Government Code
Sections 54950 et seq.), do not remain confidential, then the purpose of those
closed sessions is thwarted, effective governmental operations are compromised,
and legitimate privacy interests of the city, and of its officers and
employees, are impaired.
(Ord. 767 § 1 (part), 1998)
2.06.020 Prohibited acts.
   (a)   An officer, official, employee or agent of the city is guilty of a
misdemeanor if that person intentionally and without proper authorization
discloses the contents of a confidential communication, as defined in Section
2.06.030, to anyone other than the person or persons to whom the communication
was directed, a member of the city council, the city attorney, assistant city
attorney, legal counsel performing special services for the city, city manager,
or employees of the city whom the city manager has designated to implement any
decision or direction made as a result of the confidential communication.
   (b)   The prohibition set forth above in subsection (a) of this section may
not be construed as prohibiting disclosures of confidential communications that
are required to be made in accordance with the Ralph M. Brown Act, or any other
applicable statute, or pursuant to court order.
(Ord. 767 § 1 (part), 1998)
2.06.030 Definitions.
   In construing the provisions of this chapter, the following definitions are

materials, supplies, and equipment, when an emergency is deemed to exist and it
is determined that service involving the public health, safety, or welfare
would be interrupted if the normal procedure were followed. A declaration of
emergency as set forth in this code is conclusive evidence of such an event.

through the competitive bidding process of that entity. Under such
circumstances, the city may join into an existing written purchase contract
obtained within the last thirty-six (36) months;
   (f)   Professional services. Agreements for professional may be executed
without observing the bidding procedures provided in this chapter if the city
manager determines that an informal or formal competitive process is
unnecessary because a professional services provider is the best provider for a
particular agreement based on some or all of these factors: demonstrated
competence; qualifications for the types of services to be performed;
experience; knowledge of the city due to a long-standing relationship;
reasonableness of cost to perform work; or other similar relevant criteria.
   (g)   Public works projects. Public works projects of forty-five thousand
dollars ($45,000) or less may be performed by the employees of the city by
force account, by negotiated contract or by purchase order. In addition, the

(Ord. 18-954 § 3 (part), 2018)
2.21.040 Informal bidding procedure.
   The following procedures shall apply to informal bids for public projects:
   (a)   Notice inviting informal bids.
      (1)   Required noticing. When a public project is permitted to be let to
contract by informal bidding pursuant to this chapter, a notice inviting
informal bids shall be mailed and/or emailed to all contractors on the list
created pursuant to Section
2.21.030 for the category of work being bid, and to all the construction trade
journals specified by the Commission in accordance with Public Contract Code
Section 22036.
      (2)   Optional noticing. Notice may be also provided to any additional
contractors, publications and/or construction trade journals identified by the
city manager or the city manager’s designee.
   (b)   Exception. If the product or service to be procured for a public
project is proprietary in nature such that it can be obtained only from a
certain contractor or contractors, the notice inviting informal bids may be
sent exclusively to such contractor or contractors.
   (c)   Time of giving notice. All mailing of notices to contractors and
construction trade journals pursuant to this Section shall be completed not
less than ten calendar days before bids are due.
   (d)   Description of project. The notice inviting informal bids shall
describe the project in general terms and how to obtain more detailed
information about the project, and state the time and place for the submission
of bids.
   (e)   Authority to award contracts. The city manager is authorized to award
a contract for a public project pursuant to the process set forth in this
Section if the lowest bid received is twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) or
less. Contracts valued at more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) require
City Council approval.
   (f)   Bids exceeding one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000).
If all bids received pursuant to the informal process are in excess of one
hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000), the City Council may adopt a
resolution by a four-fifths vote to award the contract to the lowest
responsible bidder at one hundred eighty-seven thousand five hundred dollars
($187,500) or less, if it determines the city’s cost estimate was reasonable.
   (g)   Award of contract. Any contract awarded pursuant to this section shall
be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. If two or more bids received are
for the same total amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, the
approving entity may accept either bid.
   (h)   No bids. If no bids are received, the project may be performed by city
employees by force account, or negotiated contract without further complying
with this chapter.
(Ord. 18-954 § 3 (part), 2018)
2.21.050 Formal bidding procedures.
   For those projects requiring formal bidding under Section
2.21.020, the following procedures shall be used:
   (a)   Notice. A notice shall be published, at least once, fourteen (14)
calendar days before the date of opening the bids in a newspaper of general
circulation printed and published in the jurisdiction of the city. The notice
inviting formal bids shall also be sent electronically if available by either
facsimile or email, and mailed to all construction trade journals specified by
the Commission in accordance with Public Contract Code Section 22036. The
notice shall be mailed at least fifteen (15) calendar days before the date of
opening the bids. The notice inviting formal bids shall state the time and
place for the receiving and opening of sealed bids and distinctly describe the
project. In addition to notice required by this section, the city may give such
other notice as it deems proper.
   (b)   Bidder’s security/failure to sign contract. Bidder’s security shall be
prescribed in the notice inviting bids in an amount equal to ten (10%) percent
of the amount bid. Bidder’s security shall be either a cash deposit with the
city, a cashier’s or certified check payable to the city, or a bidder’s bond.
Unsuccessful bidders shall be entitled to the return of bid security within
sixty (60) days of the date of the award. However, the lowest responsive and
responsible bidder shall forfeit all or part of his/her bid security, as may be
determined by the city council, upon the bidder’s refusal or failure to execute
the contract within ten (10) days after the date of the award of the contract.
On the refusal or failure of the lowest responsive and responsible bidder to
execute the contract, the city council may award the contract to the next
lowest responsive and responsible bidder. All bids must be signed by person
authorized to bind company to bid terms.
   (c)   Bid opening procedure. Sealed bids shall be submitted to the city
clerk’s office and shall be identified as to bidder, project, and “bid” on the
envelope. Bids shall be opened by the city clerk’s staff in public at the time
and place stated in the notice inviting bids. A written record and tabulation
shall be made at that time of all bids received by the deadline. Bids that are
received after the submittal deadline shall be marked as “Late” and shall not
be opened at the bid opening and shall not be considered for award. Bids shall
be open for public inspection in accordance to the California Public Records
Act during regular business hours for a period of one year after the bid
opening.
   (d)   Award of contracts/minor irregularities. Contracts shall be awarded by
the city council to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder whose bid
fulfills the purpose intended, according to criteria designated in the
solicitation, and provided the award amount is within the unencumbered
appropriation for that item. The city council may waive minor bid
irregularities.
   (e)   Change orders. A “change order” shall be used to modify the contract
documents regarding contract price, schedule of payments, completion date,
plans and specifications, and for unit price overruns and under runs, as
specified in the contract. Work description and justification must relate to
the original project and must be work necessary to achieve original scope of
project. After a determination that costs are merited by developments in a
specific project, the city manager is authorized to issue change orders up to
the contract contingency approved by the city council.
   (f)   Tie bids. If two or more bids received are for the same total amount
or unit price, quality and service being equal, and if the public interest will
not permit the delay or re-advertising for bids, the city council may accept
either bid.
   (g)   Performance/labor/materials bonds. A labor and materials bond, plus a
performance bond shall be required, from an acceptable surety, in such amounts
and in such a form as the city finds reasonably necessary to protect the public
interest.
   (h)   No bids. If no bids are received, the project may be performed by city
employees by force account, informal bidding procedures, or negotiated
contract, without further complying with this chapter.
(Ord. 18-954 § 3 (part), 2018)
2.21.060 Rejecting formal bids.
   The following rules apply to rejecting formal bids for public projects:
   (a)   Rejecting formal bids. In its discretion, the city council may reject
any bids presented, if the city, prior to rejecting all bids and declaring that
the project can be more economically performed by employees of the agency,
furnishes a written notice to an apparent low bidder. The notice shall inform
the bidder of the city’s intention to reject the bid and shall be mailed at
least two business days prior to the city council meeting at which the city
intends to reject the bid. If after the first invitation of bids all bids are
rejected, after reevaluating its cost estimates of the project, the city shall
have the option of either of the following:
      (1)   Abandoning the project or re-advertising for bids in the manner
described by this chapter.
      (2)   After adopting a resolution by a four-fifths vote of the city
council declaring that the project can be performed more economically by city
employees, have the public project done by force account without further
complying with this chapter.
(Ord. 18-954 § 3 (part), 2018)
2.21.070 Plans and specifications.
   The city council shall adopt plans, specifications, and working details for
all public projects exceeding the amount specified in Section
2.21.020(b)(3). Any person may examine the plans, specifications, or working
details, or all of these, adopted by the city for any public project.
(Ord. 18-954 § 3 (part), 2018)
2.21.080 Emergencies.
   (a)   In cases of emergency when repair or replacements are necessary, the
city council may proceed at once to replace or repair any public facility
without adopting plans, specifications, strain sheets, or working details, or
giving notice for bids to let contracts. The work may be done by day labor
under the direction of the city manager, by contractor, or by a combination of
the two.
   (b)   In case of an emergency, if notice for bids to let contracts will not
be given, the city shall comply with Chapter 2.5 of Part 3 of Division 2 of the
Public Contract Code (commencing with Section 22050).
(Ord. 18-954 § 3 (part), 2018)
2.21.090 Cooperative or piggyback awards.
   In all public works projects, whether requiring formal or informal bidding
procedures, the city council or the City Manager (when appropriate) may use
cooperative competitive bidding procedure or a "piggyback" contract prepared by
and processed through another local, state, or federal governmental agency or a
cooperative purchasing entity established or utilized by such governments or
public agencies. To be eligible, the piggyback contract must have been the
result of the competitive bidding process of that entity. Under such
circumstances, the city may join into an existing awarded contract obtained
within thirty-six (36) months of the contemplated joinder by the city.

purposes:
   (a)   To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the
provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which

requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code.
   (c)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a
tax and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by

practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing
statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of
Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use

   (d)   To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be
administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible,
consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes,
and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons
subject to taxation under the provisions of this Chapter.
(Ord. 958 § 1 (part), 2018)
2.34.040 Contract with state.

   (a)   This chapter shall be known as the “public nuisance ordinance”, and is
adopted pursuant to the authority contained in Section 38771 et seq. of the
California Government Code.
   (b)   It is the intent of the city council of the city of La Puente in
adopting this chapter to provide a comprehensive method for the identification
and abatement of certain public nuisances within the city. The provisions of
this chapter are to be supplementary and complimentary to all of the provisions
of the La Puente Municipal Code, state law and any law cognizable at common law
or in equity, and nothing herein shall be read, interpreted or construed in a
manner so as to limit any existing right or power of the city to abate any and
all nuisances.

3.20.020 Findings.
   The city council finds and determines as follows:
   (a)   The city is interested in the appearance and maintenance of private
properties because adequate maintenance and appearance promote property values
and improve the general welfare of its citizens.
   (b)   There exists a need for further emphasis, than currently exists, on
property maintenance and sanitation, in that certain conditions, as described
in Section
3.20.070, have been found frequently in different locations throughout the
city.
   (c)   The existence of the prohibited activities and unlawful, public
nuisance conditions set forth in Section
3.20.070 is injurious and inimical to the public health, safety, and welfare of
the residents of the city and results in detrimental effects on the community
including creating unsightly appearances of and blighted residential
neighborhoods, contributes to deterioration of neighborhoods and lower property
values, discourages potential buyers from purchasing homes in, adjacent to, or
in the neighborhood with residences with public nuisance conditions, endangers
children unprotected from unsecured pools and other attractive nuisances and
endangers neighborhoods affected by the resulting squatting, vandalism,
burglaries and other crimes.
   (d)   Unless corrective measures are undertaken to alleviate such conditions
and assure the avoidance of future problems in this regard, the public health,
safety and general welfare, including the social and economic conditions of the
community, will be adversely affected.
   (e)   The abatement procedures set forth in this chapter are reasonable and
afford due process to all affected persons.
   (f)   The regulation of the uses and abuses of property as described in this
chapter reasonably relates to the proper exercise of the police power to
protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public.

3.20.080 Procedures for abatement of public nuisances.
   (a)   Whenever the code enforcement officer has inspected or caused to be
inspected any property and has determined that an unlawful condition or
unlawful activities constituting a public nuisance, as provided in Section
3.20.070, exists thereon, the code enforcement officer may use the procedures
set forth in this section for the abatement of such public nuisance; provided,
however, that if the public nuisance is determined to be imminently dangerous
to life or adjacent property and to require immediate removal, repair or
isolation, the procedures set forth in Section
3.20.110 hereof may be used by the code enforcement officer.
   (b)   Notice of violation.
      (1)   The code enforcement officer shall issue a notice of violation,
including an order to abate the public nuisance conditions existing on the
property. The notice of violation shall be served on the owner, occupant (if
any) and/or responsible party in the manner described in Subsection (2) of this
section. The code enforcement officer shall include the following information
in the notice of violation:
         (A)   The date and location of the violation, including the address or
other description of the location where the violation occurred or is occurring
and a brief description of conditions observed that constitute a violation;
         (B)   The name(s) of the responsible party(s), if known;
         (C)   The code section(s) violated and description of the section(s);
         (D)   Action required to correct, abate or mitigate the public
nuisance condition(s) or code violation, and a period of time during which
action(s) shall be commenced and completed;
         (E)   An order prohibiting the continuation or repeated occurrence of
public nuisance condition(s) or violation (s) of this code described in the
notice of violation;
         (F)   A statement that the person upon whom the notice of violation is
served may appeal the determination that there is/are violation(s) or public
nuisance condition(s) as alleged or that the person who was served with the
notice of violation is the responsible party;
         (G)   If applicable, notice that failure to correct or abate the
listed violation(s) or public nuisance condition(s) in the notice of violation
within the time specified will subject the owner, occupant and/or responsible
party to an administrative fine pursuant to Section
1.12.030. If an administrative fine will be imposed, the notice of violation
shall include the amount of administrative fine and a statement that the person
upon whom the notice of violation is served may appeal the imposition of the
administrative fine pursuant to Section
1.12.080 of this code; and
         (H)   The signature of the issuing code enforcement officer and city
contact information (address and telephone number) for additional information.
      (2)   The notice of violation shall be served upon the responsible party
owner, occupant and/or owner personally or by United States mail, first-class
postage prepared, and if such mail, it shall be sent to the last known address
listed on the last equalized assessment roll of the Los Angeles County or as
may otherwise be known to code enforcement officer. The address of the owner as
it appears on the last equalized assessment roll Los Angeles County shall be
conclusively deemed to be the property address for the mailing of the notice of
violation. In the case of personal service, service shall be deemed complete at
the time of such delivery. In the case of service by first-class mail, service
shall be deemed complete at the time of deposit into the United States mail. If
mailed, notice shall also be posted conspicuously on the affected property. The
failure to receive a notice of violation sent via first-class mail shall not
affect the validity of any enforcement proceedings under this chapter.
      (3)   Proof of service of the notice shall be documented at the time of
service by a declaration under penalty of perjury executed by the person
effecting service, declaring the date, time, and manner of services, and the
date and place of posting, if applicable. The declaration shall be affixed to a
copy of the notice of violation and retained by the code enforcement officer.
      (4)   The failure of a notice of violation to satisfy all of the
requirements of this provision shall not affect the validity of any other
enforcement proceedings under this code.
   (c)   Extension of time to perform work. Upon receipt of a written request
from a responsible party, owner, occupant and/or the code enforcement officer
may grant an extension of time within which to complete the abatement, if the
code enforcement officer determines that such an extension of time will not
create a situation imminently dangerous to life or property. The code
enforcement officer shall have the authority to place reasonable conditions on
any such extension.
   (d)   Appeal of notice of violation.
      (1)   Request for appeal hearing:
         (A)   A person or entity named as the responsible party, the owner or
occupant in a notice of violation may appeal the determination that there is/
are violation(s) or public nuisance condition(s) as alleged in the notice of
violation or that the person or entity who was served with the notice of
violation is the responsible party.
         (B)   Any person appealing a notice of violation must obtain a
“request for appeal hearing” form from the city clerk located at city of La
Puente City Hall, 15900 East Main Street, La Puente , California 91744-4719,
and return it to the city clerk fully completed within ten days from the date
of service of the notice of violation.
         (C)   At the time of returning the request for hearing form to the
city clerk, the person or entity requesting the appeal hearing shall pay an
appeal processing fee as set forth by a resolution of the city council, and
shall deposit in advance the amount of any penalty. No appeal shall proceed
without payment of the fee and deposit of the penalty with the city clerk at
the time the appeal is filed; provided, however, that any person or entity
requesting an appeal and who is financially unable to deposit the appeal fee
may file a request for an appeal fee hardship waiver. The request shall be
filed with the director of finance on an appeal fee hardship waiver form, no
later than ten days after service of the notice of violation. The director of
finance may issue an appeal fee hardship waiver only if the person or entity
requesting the waiver submits to the director a sworn affidavit, together with
any supporting documents, demonstrating to the satisfaction of the director the
person's or entity's financial inability to pay the full amount of the appeal
fee deposit in advance of the hearing. The director of finance shall issue a
written decision specifying the reasons for issuing or not issuing the appeal
fee waiver. The decision shall be served upon the person requesting the waiver
by first-class mail, postage prepaid. If the director of finance determines
that the waiver is not warranted, the person or entity requesting the appeal
shall remit the full amount of the appeal fee within ten days of receipt of the
director's written decision.
         (D)   Failure to timely submit a completed request for hearing form or
to pay the appeal processing fee, unless waiver is granted, constitutes a
waiver of the right to appeal and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
      (2)   Enforcement stayed during appeal. Enforcement of a notice of
violation shall be stayed during the pendency of an appeal therefore which is
properly and timely filed, unless the city obtains an order from a court of
competent jurisdiction requiring or authorizing the abatement of the condition
(s) subject of the city's enforcement efforts.
      (3)   Appeal hearings.
         (A)   An appeal hearing based on a request for appeal hearing shall be
set before the planning commission for a date not less than fifteen days nor
more than sixty days from the date the request for hearing form is filed and
appeal processing fee is paid, or if appeal waiver requested, from the date of
director of finance's decision, unless the code enforcement officer determines
that the matter is urgent or that good cause exists for an extension of time,
in which case the hearing date may be shortened or extended, as warranted by
the circumstances.
         (B)   An appeal hearing under authority of this section shall be
conducted according to the procedures set forth herein. The failure of the
responsible party or other interested party to appear at the hearing following
proper notice shall constitute a waiver of the right to be heard and a failure
by such party to exhaust his/her administrative remedies.
         (C)   When a request for hearing is filed, the city clerk shall set
the time and place for hearing pursuant to Subsection (3)(A) of this section,
and shall serve a notice of hearing either personally or by United States mail,
first-class postage prepaid, to the appellant at the address provided in the
request for appeal hearing form. The time for such hearing shall be no sooner
than fifteen days from the date of service of the notice of appeal hearing. If
the code enforcement officer submits a written report concerning the notice of
violation to the planning commission for consideration at the hearing, then a
copy of the report shall be served on the person requesting the hearing at
least five days before the hearing.
         (D)   At the place and time set forth in the notice of hearing, the
planning commission shall conduct a hearing on the alleged violation(s). Any
responsible party or other interested person(s) may appear and offer evidence
as to whether violation has occurred, whether the violation continues to exist
and/or whether the person cited in the notice of violation is the responsible
party for any such violation, or any other matter pertaining thereto. Evidence
presented by the Code enforcement officer or other official of the city tending
to show that a violation(s) occurred and that the person or entity named on the
notice of violation is the responsible party shall establish a prima facie case
that a violation(s), as charged, actually existed and that the person named in
the notice of violation is the responsible party for the violation(s). The
burden of proof shall then be on the responsible party to refute such evidence.
The standard to be applied for meeting such burden shall be a preponderance of
evidence.
         (E)   The planning commission shall consider written or oral testimony
or other evidence regarding the violation presented by the responsible party,
the owner, the occupant, any officer, employee, or agent of the city, and any
other interested party. Evidence offered during a hearing must be credible and
relevant in the estimation of the planning commission, but formal rules
governing the presentation and consideration of evidence shall not apply.
         (F)   The planning commission shall conduct the hearing, order the
presentation of evidence, and make any rulings necessary to address procedural
issues presented during the course of the hearing.
         (G)   After receiving all of the evidence presented, the planning
commission may then deliberate and consider what action, if any, should be
taken, or may adjourn the hearing and take the matter under consideration.
      (4)   The planning commission's decision and abatement order.
         (A)   At the conclusion of the hearing or when such hearing is
continued for period not to exceed thirty days, the planning commission shall
make a decision regarding the issues presented during the course of the
hearing, and the decision shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence.
After making a decision, the planning commission may issue an abatement order.
If the planning commission finds that no violation occurred, that the violation
was corrected within the specified time period, or that the person or entity
cited is not the responsible party, the planning commission shall issue an
administrative order to reflect those facts. Within forty-five days following
the release of the administrative order, the city clerk shall reimburse the
appeals processing fee paid by the person or entity that requested the appeal.
         (B)   The responsible party and any interested party requesting a copy
of an abatement order or administrative order shall be served with a copy of
said order in the same manner as used for service of a notice of hearing as
described in Section
3.20.080(d)(3)(C) of this chapter. Proof of service of the abatement order or
administrative order shall be certified by a written declaration under penalty
of perjury executed by the person effecting service, declaring the date, time,
and manner that service was made.
         (C)   An abatement order shall become effective and enforceable
immediately after announcement or service of such order unless the order
includes a later effective date. It shall include a statement of the right to
have the order judicially reviewed in the manner and in the time frames
specified in Section
3.20.090. Unless otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction,
enforcement of the abatement order shall not be stayed pending judicial review
thereof.
         (D)   An abatement order may include any combination of the following
remedies:
            i.   Issue a “cease and desist” order requiring the responsible
party, or any agent, representative, employee, or contractor of the responsible
party, to immediately stop any act, conduct, or condition, that is a violation
of this Code. A cease and desist order issued pursuant to this section shall be
effective upon issuance and shall be served on the responsible party in the
manner specified in Section
3.20.080(d)(3)(C) of this chapter.
            ii.   Require the responsible party to correct or eliminate any
violation, including a proposed schedule for correction or elimination of said
violation within a reasonable time.
            iii.   Require the responsible party, or authorize the city, to
restore a site or location that has been damaged or disturbed as a result of a
violation of this code to a pre-violation condition. Any order authorizing the
city to undertake restoration efforts shall include provisions for the city to
recover all restoration costs and expenses, including administrative costs,
from the responsible party.
            iv.   Authorize the city to abate or cause the abatement of a
nuisance condition where the responsible party has refused or has otherwise
neglected or is unable to take steps to correct or eliminate said conditions.
The abatement order shall specify that if the city undertakes to abate or
eliminate any nuisance condition as provided in Section
3.20.100, the city shall be entitled to recover all costs of abatement incurred
in performing such work and other costs necessary to enforce the order. Such
costs may be recovered by the city as a personal obligation and/or through a
lien or a special assessment on the affected property as provided in Sections
3.20.130 or
3.20.140.
            v.   Sustain, modify, or overrule the notice of violation issued by
a code enforcement officer.
            vi.   Any other order or remedy that serves the interests of
justice.
         (E)   The city may seek to enforce any abatement order by confirmation
from a court of competent jurisdiction. Any abatement order that is judicially
confirmed may be enforced through all applicable judicial enforcement measures,
including without limitation, contempt proceedings upon a subsequent violation
of such order.
   (e)    Recordation of certificate notice of violation of public nuisance.
Subsequent to service of a notice of violation and responsible party's failure
to take actions to correct or abate public nuisance condition(s) within the
time period provided in the notice of violation, the code enforcement officer
may file in the office of the Los Angeles county recorder a certificate
containing a legal description of the subject property and certifying that a
public nuisance exists on the property and that the owner, responsible party or
the occupant has been so notified. The Code enforcement officer shall file a
new certificate in the office of the Los Angeles county recorder, stating that
the public nuisance has been abated, whenever any of the following has
occurred:
      (1)   The corrections ordered have been completed so that a public
nuisance condition(s), as set forth in Section
3.20.070 no longer exists on the property described in the certificate; or
      (2)   The city has caused the public nuisance to be abated and the costs
of abatement have been paid.

   (a)   It is the purpose and intent of the city council of the city of La
Puente, through the adoption of this chapter, to establish an abandoned and
distressed residential property registration program as a mechanism to protect
residential neighborhoods from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate
maintenance and security of abandoned properties and to establish uniform and
reasonable regulations to prevent immediate risk and detrimental effects
associated with abandoned and distressed properties.
   (b)   The city council of the city of La Puente finds that abandoned and
distressed residential properties pose risk to the public peace, health and
safety of citizens in that the detrimental effects from the lack of security
and maintenance of abandoned and distressed residential properties endangers
children unprotected from unsecured pools and other attractive nuisances, lead
to neighborhood decline, contribute to lower property values, discourage
potential buyers from purchasing a home adjacent to or in the neighborhoods
with abandoned and distressed residences, and further endangers neighborhoods
affected by the resulting squatting, vandalism, burglaries and other crimes.
   (c)   The city council of the city of La Puente further finds that the city
will incur additional costs in administering and implementing the abandoned and
distressed residential properties registration program and that it is in the
best interests of the public for the city to recover the said costs through
imposition of a registration fee.

satisfactory to the city.
   (d)   Preservation Procedures Adopted Pursuant to California Government Code
Section 53069.3(c)(2). Prior to or during removal, the city will follow any

be subject to additional punishment imposed by the court at the request of the
Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department to pay for law enforcement costs, in an amount
not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars, provided the defendant has the ability

   The law enforcement costs authorized to be paid pursuant to California Penal
Code Section 594(c)(2)(A) are in addition to any other costs incurred or

the burden of establishing the reasonableness of, such costs.
   (b)   The law enforcement costs authorized in subsection (a) of this section
are in addition to any other costs incurred or recovered by the law enforcement
agency, and payment of these costs does not in any way limit, preclude, or
restrict any other right, remedy, or action otherwise available to the law
enforcement agency.
(Ord. 790 § 19 (part), 1999)
3.44.090 Nuisance abatement.

may recover this cost by making the expense of abatement a lien against the
property of the minor or the minor’s parent, in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this chapter.
      (1)   For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
         “Minor” means: (1) a minor who has confessed to, admitted to, or pled
guilty or nolo contendere to a violation of Section 594, 594.3, 640.5, 640.6,
or 640.7 of the California Penal Code; or (2) a minor convicted by final
judgment of a violation of Section 594, 594.3, 640.5, 640.6, or 640.7 of the

commission of an act prohibited by Section 594, 594.3, 640.5, 640.6, or 640.7
of the Penal Code.
         “Parent” means the parent or legal guardian having custody and control
of a minor.
   (b)   Procedures.
      (1)   To recover the expense of abatement, the city will give notice to
the minor prior to the recordation of a lien on the parcel of land owned by the
minor and notice to the parent prior to the recordation of a lien on the parcel
of land owned by the parent. This notice will be served in the same manner as a
summons in a civil action pursuant to Article 3 (commencing with Section
415.10) of Chapter 4 of Title 5 of Part 2 of the California Code of Civil
Procedure.
      (2)   Notice when minor or parent cannot be found.
         (A)   If the minor, after diligent search, cannot be found, the notice
may be served by posting a copy of the notice upon the property owned by the
minor, in a conspicuous place, for a period of ten days. The notice must also
be published pursuant to Government Code Section 6062 in a newspaper of general
circulation that is published in the county in which the property is located.
         (B)   If a minor’s parent, after diligent search, cannot be found, the
notice may be served by posting a copy of the notice upon the property owned by
the parent in a conspicuous place for a period of ten days. The notice must
also be published pursuant to Government Code Section 6062 in a newspaper of
general circulation that is published in the county in which the property is
located.
      (3)   A graffiti nuisance abatement lien will be recorded in the county
recorder’s office in the county in which the parcel of land is located. From
the date of recording, the lien shall have the force, effect, and priority of a
judgment lien.
      (4)   A graffiti nuisance abatement lien authorized by this section will
specify the amount of the lien; the name of the agency on whose behalf the lien
is imposed; the date of the abatement order; the street address, legal
description, and assessor’s parcel number of the parcel on which the lien is
imposed; and the name and address of the recorded owner of the parcel.
      (5)   A graffiti nuisance abatement lien may be satisfied through
foreclosure in an action brought by the city.
      (6)   If the lien is discharged, released, or satisfied, either through
payment or foreclosure, notice of the discharge containing the information
specified in subsection (b)(4) of this section shall be recorded by the city. A
graffiti nuisance abatement lien and the release of the lien shall be indexed
in the grantor-grantee index.
      (7)   If the county recorder imposes a fee on the city to reimburse the
costs of processing and recording the lien and providing notice to the property
owner, the city may recover from the property owner any costs incurred for
processing and recording of the lien and providing notice to the property owner
as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien.
   (c)   Alternative procedure for assessment. As an alternative to the lien in
subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the city may make the abatement and
related administrative costs a special assessment against a parcel of land
owned by the minor or by the parent, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section
3.20.130 of this code. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in
the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and are subject to
the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as
provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy,
collection, and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the
special assessment. However, if any real property to which the abatement and
related administrative costs relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona
fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value
has been created and attaches thereon prior to the date on which the first
installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the abatement and
related administrative costs will not result in a lien against the real
property but will instead be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.
Notices or instruments relating to the abatement proceeding or special
assessment may be recorded.
(Ord. 790 § 19 (part), 1999)
3.44.100 Additional remedies.

*Prior ordinance history: Ord. 434.
3.48.010 Findings.
   The city council finds:
   (a)   The majority of burglar and holdup alarms to which law enforcement
responds are false. Such false alarms result in an enormous waste of manpower.
There are such a large percentage of false alarms as may lull law enforcement
officers into a sense of false security. In responding to an alarm, they will
probably assume it is a false alarm and may be wounded or killed by criminals
at the location.
   (b)   Alarm systems which automatically and directly dial any emergency
phone number are very prone to be activated by current failures or other events
having no connection with criminal activity and tie up such emergency phones
making them unavailable to receive genuine emergency calls.
   (c)   The danger to citizens through emergency response created by false
alarms is unnecessary and hazardous.
   (d)   The unnecessary waste of tax dollars through responses to false alarms
must be eliminated.
   (e)   False burglar and holdup alarms have created conditions causing danger
and annoyance to the general public.
(Ord. 790 § 21 (part), 1999)
3.48.020 Definitions.
   For purposes of this chapter, unless it is plainly evident from the context
that a different meaning is intended, the following definitions shall apply:
   “Alarm owner” means the person who owns, leases, rents, uses or makes
available for use by his agents, employees, representatives or family, any
alarm system.
   “Alarm system” means any device, whether known as a burglary, robbery or
intrusion alarm, direct-dial telephone device, audible or silent alarm or by
any other name, which is used for the detection of an unauthorized entry into a
building, structure or facility, or to signal the commission of an unlawful
act. “Alarm system” includes those devices known as “proprietary alarm systems”
which emit a signal within the protected premises only and are supervised by
the proprietor of the premises where located. “Alarm system” does not include
auxiliary devices installed by a telephone company to protect telephone company
systems which might be damaged or disrupted by the use of an alarm system.
   “Audible alarm” means a device designed to notify persons in the immediate
vicinity of the protected premises by emission of an audible sound of an
unauthorized entry on the premises or of the commission of an unlawful act.
   “Direct-dial device” means a device which is connected to a telephone line
and upon activation of an alarm system, automatically dials a predetermined
telephone number and transmits a message or signal indicating a need for
emergency response.
   “False alarm” means an alarm signal activated by causes other than the
commission or attempted commission of an unlawful act which the alarm system is
designed to detect. An alarm signal activated by violent conditions of nature
or other extraordinary circumstances not subject to the control of the alarm
owner does not constitute a false alarm.

3.48.040 Audible alarm requirement.
   For every audible alarm, the alarm owner thereof must post the names and
telephone number of persons to be notified to render repairs or service during
any hour of the day or night during which the audible alarm is operated. An
audible alarm must terminate its operation or automatically reset within thirty
minutes of its being activated.
(Ord. 790 § 21 (part), 1999)
3.48.050 False alarm.
   It is unlawful for a person to knowingly turn in a false alarm. This section
does not prohibit a test of an alarm system as permitted in advance by the
sheriff’s department.
(Ord. 790 § 21 (part), 1999)
3.48.060 Repair.
   After any false alarm, the alarm owner must, upon request by the Los Angeles
County sheriff’s department, submit a written report to the sheriff’s
department describing actions taken or to be taken to eliminate the cause of
the false alarm. This report must be submitted within ten days of the request
by the sheriff’s department.
(Ord. 790 § 21 (part), 1999)
3.48.070 Maintaining a public nuisance alarm.

alarm system:
   (a)   Which is operated or operates in such a manner as to violate any
provision in this chapter;
   (b)   Which is operated or operates in such a manner as to violate any other
provision in this code, including Section
4.34.020(h); or

   The provisions of this chapter do not apply to audible alarms affixed to
motor vehicles or to a public telephone utility whose only duty is to furnish
telephone service pursuant to tariffs on file with the California Public
Utilities Commission.
(Ord. 790 § 21 (part), 1999)
3.48.090 Violations.
   A violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a misdemeanor which
is punishable by the general penalty of Section
1.08.040 of this code. Violations of this chapter may be prosecuted in the same
manner as any other misdemeanor. However, upon the first violation of Section
3.48.050, the Los Angeles County sheriff’s department will serve a written
notice on the violator describing the violation and specifying that the causes
of the violation must be corrected within ten days of the date of service of
the written notice. No further action will be taken provided that the sheriff’s
department determines that the causes of the violation have been removed or
fully corrected within the time period specified in this section.
(Ord. 790 § 21 (part), 1999)
3.48.100 Additional remedies.
   The remedies set forth in this chapter are not exclusive and may be used in
addition to those set forth elsewhere in this code or by law. As additional
remedies, any violation of the provisions of this chapter may be abated in
accordance with the provisions in
Chapter 3.20 or
4.34 of this code.

(Ord. 06-850, 2006)
4.10.050 Collection on tax roll.
   The city elects to have sewer charges for each fiscal year collected on the
Los Angeles County tax roll in the same manner, by the same persons, and at the
same time as, together with and not separately from, the ad valorem property
tax. Except as provided for in Section 5473.8 of the California Health and
Safety Code, the sewer charge shall constitute a lien against each parcel with
respect to which it has been charged as of noon on the first Monday in March
immediately preceding the date of levy.
(Ord. 06-850, 2006)
4.10.060 Determination of charges.
   (a)   The Director of Finance, or his or her designee, shall cause a written
report to be prepared each year and filed with the City Clerk, which shall
contain a description of each parcel subject to the sewer charge and the amount
of the sewer charge for each parcel for the year, computed in conformity with
the method set forth in Section
4.10.040. The written report shall contain all information required by Section
5473 of the California Health and Safety Code.
   (b)   The City Clerk shall give notice of the filing of said report pursuant
to Section 5473.1 of the California Health and Safety Code and of the date for
a public hearing before the City Council with respect to the report.
   (c)   At the time stated in the notice, the City Council shall hear and
consider all objections or protests, if any, to said report. The City Council
may continue the hearing from time to time. If the City Council finds that
protest is made by the owners of a majority of separate parcels of property
described in the report, then the report shall not be adopted and the charges
shall be collected separately from the tax roll and shall not constitute a lien
against any parcel land.
   (d)   Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the City Council may adopt,
revise, change, reduce or modify any charge or overrule any or all objections
and shall make its determination upon each charge as described in said report.
The determination of the City Council shall be final.
   (e)   On or before August 10 of each year, the City Clerk shall file with
the Los Angeles County Auditor a copy of the report approved by the City
Council. The City Clerk shall endorse upon the report a statement over his or
her signature that the report has been finally adopted by the legislative body
of the entity.
(Ord. 06-850, 2006)
4.10.070 Certification of qualified senior residences.
   (a)   A "qualified senior residence" is a single family residential parcel
that is owned, either in whole or as a joint tenant by a record owner who meets
all three of the following criteria:
      (1)   The person must occupy the parcel as his or her primary residence.
      (2)   The person must be at least 62 years of age.
      (3)   The person must be a "low" to "extremely low" income person, as
those terms are defined by the United States Department of Housing and
Community Development's most current version of the current income guides.
      (4)   The person must submit to the city their respective water bills to
determine whether the person is a low flow water user. A low flow user is
defined as a person whose annual average water use does not exceed 200 gallons
per day.
   (b)   In order to have his or her parcel certified as a qualified senior
residence for any fiscal year, the owner of a parcel must, on or before May 1
of the prior fiscal year, submit to the Director an application setting forth
the owner's qualifications pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section. The
Director shall prepare a form for such application, may require that all
applications be submitted on the designated form, and may request supporting
data to be provided by the applicant.
   (c)   Upon receiving an application pursuant to this section, the Director
shall conduct an investigation and determine whether the applicant qualifies
for the discount as provided in this section. The decision of the Director
shall be final.
(Ord. 06-850, 2006)
4.10.080 Sewer Charge Fund.
   (a)   Proceeds of the sewer charge shall be segregated in a fund titled
"Sewer Charge Fund."
   (b)   Monies in the Sewer Charge Fund shall be expended solely on operating,
maintenance, and capital costs associated with the city's sewer system,
including any debt service and incidental expenses associated with the
financing of capitol improvements to the city's sewer system.
   (c)   Each fiscal year, the Director shall transfer from the city's general
fund to the Sewer Charge Fund an amount equal to the total charge reductions
granted pursuant to Section
4.10.040(b) with respect to that fiscal year.
(Ord. 06-850, 2006)
4.10.090 Administrative appeal.
   (a)   The procedure set forth in this section shall be available to any
record owner of property who temporarily ceases use of the sewer system or, for
any other reason, believes that the amount determined and charged pursuant to
Section
4.10.060 does not accurately reflect his or her land use classification during
the period for which the charge is imposed.
   (b)   Any user may apply to the Director for an adjustment of his or her
sewer charge if the charge is above the minimum rate for the user's land use
classification. An application must show the amount of the charge the user
believes accurately reflects his or her land use classification and the means
by which the user calculated that amount. The Director may require that appeals
be made in specific format (or on a specific form) and may request supporting
data to be provided by the applicant.
   (c)   Upon receiving an application pursuant to this section, the Director
shall conduct an investigation, and shall fix as the charge the amount he or
she finds to be appropriate, based upon examination of the evidence provided by
the applicant and such additional evidence as the Director may obtain.
   (d)   Any adjustment shall be retroactive to the year challenged only. In no
event shall an adjustment be retroactive more than one year. If, given the
nature of the evidence provided by the applicant, the Director finds it
equitable to do so, an adjustment may extend to future years.
   (e)   Any increased charge resulting from the procedure set forth in this
section shall be collected in conformance with this chapter.
   (f)   Any decreased charge resulting from the procedure set forth in this
section shall be returned to the user as a cash refund.
(Ord. 06-850, 2006)
4.10.100 Appeal to City Council.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided herein, when any person desires to apply
for relief from any charge levied pursuant to any provision of this chapter,
following an exhaustion of the administrative appeal procedures available
pursuant to Section
4.10.090, he or she may make an application to the City Council on a form
provided by the City Clerk.
   (b)   The Council shall review the matter at a hearing and, if the Council
shall find sufficient justification, may grant the relief requested or make
whatever determination it deems appropriate.
   (c)   The City Clerk may periodically schedule such hearings for the
convenience of the Council; provided, however, not more than ninety (90) days
shall elapse from the time an application for relief is filed to the time a
determination is made.
(Ord. 06-850, 2006)
4.10.110 Remedies for collection and enforcement of charges.
   The remedies for collecting and enforcing the sewer charges set forth in
this chapter shall be cumulative and may be pursued alternatively, or any
thereof may be used consecutively when the Council so determines. If any one of
such remedies is, or may be, invalid, all valid remedies shall remain
effectual. The costs of collection and of the enforcement of the remedies for
the collection of sewer charges may be from the revenues from such charges. Any
holder of any bond outstanding at any time, which bond is payable from sewer
charge revenues, may compel the use of any or all of the remedies provided in
this chapter. The holder of any bond payable from sewer charge revenues, by
mandamus, may compel the Council to increase the sewer charges to the extent
which will make them sufficient to provide enough moneys for the payment of the
bonds.
(Ord. 06-850, 2006)
4.10.120 Compensation of county.
   The county shall be compensated for services rendered in connection with the
levy, collection, and enforcement of sewer charges for the city in accordance
with an agreement between the Council and the Board of Supervisors of the
county for the collection of taxes for the city.

4.12.010 Title for citation.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Solid Waste Handling and
Recycling Services Ordinance of the city of La Puente.
(Ord. 671 § 1 (part), 1992)
4.12.020 Findings and intent.
   (a)   The city council finds and determines as follows:
      (1)   In order to meet the requirements of the California Integrated
Waste Management Act of 1989 [Public Resources Code Section 40000, et seq.],
including source reduction of the solid waste stream, diversion of solid waste
from landfills, and conservation of natural resources, it is necessary to
regulate the collection of solid waste from commercial/industrial and
residential premises, and to encourage recycling of solid waste materials.
      (2)   The mandates of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Southern
California Air Quality Management District, and other regulatory agencies,
concerning air pollution and traffic congestion management, require the
regulation and, where possible, reduction in the number of waste collection
vehicles and vehicle trips which cause the discharge of air contaminants and
create air pollution.
      (3)   A reduction in the number of waste collection vehicles using the
city streets daily will reduce traffic hazards and congestion and promote
safety.
      (4)   The storage, accumulation, collection and disposal of solid waste,
including without limitation garbage, trash, debris and other discarded
materials is a matter of substantial public concern in that improper control of
these matters may create a public nuisance, air pollution, fire hazard, rat and
insect infestation and other problems adversely affecting the public health,
safety and welfare.
      (5)   Regulation of the collection of garbage, refuse and other discarded
materials from all residential, commercial and industrial properties within the
city will provide the most orderly and efficient solution to these problems and
will promote the public health, safety and welfare.
      (6)   The regulation of solid waste handling services in the city will
also promote the public health, safety and welfare by requiring the use of
newer and safer vehicles, the regular maintenance of those vehicles, and the
reduction of spillage and litter on the public streets, by establishing
responsibility for the cleaning of refuse bins and containers, and by providing
for accountability to the public.
      (7)   The public health, safety and welfare will best be served by
providing for one or more exclusive franchises for residential refuse
collection services, and for commercial and industrial refuse collection
services, subject to the limited continuation rights of certain existing
collectors which are providing solid waste handling services pursuant to
permits previously authorized by the city and which are qualified, under Public
Resources Code Sections 49520 and 49521, to continue those services for up to
five years following notice given pursuant to Section 49520. The five-year
period expires on November 30, 1996.
      (8)   State recycling law, Assembly Bill 939 of 1989, the California
Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (approved by the Governor of the State
of California on September 29, 1989, which amended Section 11553, of and
repealed Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 66700) of, Chapter 2 (commencing
with Section 667770) of Article 1 (commencing with Section 66795), Article 2
(commencing with Section 66796.30) Article 3 (commencing with Section
66796.45), Article 4 (commencing with Section 66796.50) Article 5 (commencing
with Section 66796.55) Article 6 (commencing with Section 66796.64), Article 7
(commencing with Section 66796.70, Article 8 (commencing with Section

below.
   (b)   No person, firm, corporation or solid waste enterprise, other than
those referenced in subsection A above, shall negotiate or contract for,
undertake to receive, collect or transport solid waste from within the city for
a fee, service charge or other consideration therefor, except as specifically
provided herein.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each residential owner
and commercial/industrial business owner shall utilize the services of the

commercial/industrial business owner shall enter into an agreement for solid
waste handling services with any person, firm or corporation other than the
franchised collector, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
   (d)   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a commercial/industrial business
which has its own recycling or resource recovery program for recyclables

from continuing such recycling or resource recovery program, and the
recyclables included in such program are excepted from the exclusive franchise

   (e)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection B above, certain solid
waste enterprises that have been authorized by permit or by a nonexclusive

preclude the owner of a residential or commercial/industrial premises served by
an excepted collector from continuing to use the solid waste handling services
of that excepted collector until the rights of that excepted collector to
operate in the city are terminated or revoked or have expired; provided,
however, if the rights of an excepted collector provide services are terminated

collector other than the exclusive franchised collector.

shall be held under his direction, subject to the right of the owner thereof to
take it upon payment of a sum, as provided in a fee schedule approved by the

removal, storage and overhead charges. Within two business days after the city
has removed and impounded the bin and its contents, if any, the city manager
shall mail, postage prepaid, written notice to the owner of the bin, advising
the owner that the bin has been removed and is in the possession of the city
and that, if said bin is not redeemed by the owner and any applicable charges
paid, within thirty (30) days, said bin will be subject to sale at a public
auction. The proceeds of any such sale shall be applied to the cost of such
sale, and to the cost of removal and holding of such bin and the disposal of
its contents, if any, plus twenty-five percent (25%) of such costs for the
overhead expenses of the city in causing such sale. Any balance of such
proceeds shall be paid upon demand to the person who owns such bin at the time

bin does not generate sufficient money to pay for the costs of removal,
storage, disposal fees, if any, and overhead charges, the city manager shall
submit an invoice to the bin owner for payment in an amount equal to the
deficiency. The bin may be redeemed by the owner at any time prior to the sale

for appeals of administrative citations. Evidence may be presented at the
hearing. The city will appoint a hearing officer who shall conduct the hearing
and issue a final written order.
   (9)   Education period for non-compliance. Beginning January 1, 2022 and
through December 31, 2023, the city will conduct inspections, remote
monitoring, route reviews or waste evaluations, and compliance reviews,
depending upon the type of regulated entity, to determine compliance, and if
the city determines that organic waste generator, self-hauler, hauler, tier one
commercial edible food generator, food recovery organization, food recovery
service, or other entity is not in compliance, it shall provide educational
materials to the entity describing its obligations under this ordinance and a
notice that compliance is required by January 1, 2022, and that violations may
be subject to administrative civil penalties starting on January 1, 2024.

   (a)   Applicants for any covered project shall complete and submit a WMP on
a form approved by the City of as part of the application submittal
requirements for a building, grading, demolition or similar permit. The WMP
shall include an acknowledgement of responsibility that the Applicant
understands the consequences of not meeting the 65% diversion requirement and
that the Applicant is responsible for the actions of its contractors and other
agents with regard to the diversion requirement. The Applicant will acknowledge
this responsibility and indicate so by their signature on the WMP.
   (b)   In preparing the WMP, applicants for permits involving the removal of
all or part of an existing facility, structure or improvement shall
deconstruct, to the maximum extent feasible, and shall make the materials
generated thereby available for salvage. Reuse will be considered as diversion
for the purposes of complying with this Chapter. Applicants shall specify
materials designated for reuse, whether on-site or at another site, in the
WRAP, and shall specify the proposed method of reuse.
   (c)   Review of a WMP at Permit Issuance. No building, grading, demolition
or similar permit shall be issued for any covered project, nor shall any
demolition, construction or renovation take place on any covered project,
unless and until the Compliance Official approves the WMP. Approval shall not
be required, however, when the City determines an emergency demolition is
required to protect public health or safety. A WMP shall receive approval only
when the Compliance Official determines that the following conditions have been
met:
      (1)   The WMP provides all of the information requested on the form; and
      (2)   The WMP indicates how 65% or more of all C&D debris generated by
the project will be diverted.
   If the Compliance Official determines that these two conditions have been
met, the WMP shall be marked as "Approved" and a copy of the WMP returned to
the Applicant.
   (d)   Review - "Further Explanation Required". If the Compliance Official
determines that the WMP does not comply with the provisions this Section the
Compliance Official shall return the WMP to the applicant marked "Further
Explanation Required."
(Ord. 957 § 3 (part), 2018)
4.13.070 Diversion security deposit required.
   Each applicant of a covered project shall submit as part of the WMP a
diversion security deposit, in cash or a bond, in the amount of 1% of the total
costs for the project or $500, whichever is greater. The deposit shall be
returned, without interest, in total or in proportion, upon the Compliance
Official's determination, in accordance with Section
4.13.080 that the applicant has satisfied, or failed to satisfy, the diversion
requirement approved as part of the WMP.
(Ord. 957 § 3 (part), 2018)
4.13.080 Compliance with a waste management plan.
   (a)   Documentation. Within 30 days after the completion of construction for
any covered project, the applicant shall submit documentation demonstrating
achievement of the diversion requirement for the project to the Compliance
Official. This documentation shall include the following:
      (1)   A copy of the previously approved project WMP with the addition of
recyclable and/or reusable C&D and refuse waste volume or weight data entered
on the form;
      (2)   Original receipts, tickets, or any other documentation from
Designated C&D Recovery Facilities that documents disposal for each C&D debris
material type by weight or volume and clearly indicates whether each material
was landfilled or recycled; and
      (3)   Any additional information that the applicant believes is relevant
to determining its efforts to comply in good faith with this Chapter.
   (b)   Weighing of Wastes. Applicant shall make reasonable efforts to ensure
that all C&D debris diverted or landfilled is measured and recorded using the
most accurate method of measurement available. To the extent practical, all C&D
debris shall be weighed by measurement on scales. Such scales shall be in
compliance with all regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For
C&D debris for which weighing is not practical due to small size or to other
considerations as determined by the Compliance Official, a volumetric
measurement shall be used. For conversion of volumetric measurements to weight,
the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the City
for this purpose.
   (c)   Determination of compliance. The Compliance Official shall consider
the information submitted pursuant to subsection
4.13.080(a) above, in order to determine whether the applicant has complied
with the diversion requirement as follows:
      (1)   Full compliance. If the reviewing Compliance Official determines
that the applicant has fully complied with the diversion requirement of this
Chapter, such compliance shall be indicated on the WMP.
      (2)   Less Than Full Compliance. If the WMP Compliance Official finds
that the applicant has not satisfied the diversion requirement for the project,
the Official shall calculate the applicant's percentage rate of compliance. The
Compliance Official shall then determine whether the applicant has made a good
faith effort to comply with the diversion requirement. In making this
determination, the Official shall consider the availability of markets for the
C&D debris, the size of the project and the documented efforts of the applicant
to divert the C&D debris. The Official shall then authorize the release of some
or all of the deposit to the applicant. At a minimum, the applicant shall be
entitled to a release of that portion of the diversion security deposit which
equals the applicant's percentage rate of compliance. Therefore, if the
applicant has achieved 60% of the diversion requirement for the project, the
Official shall release at least 60% of the diversion security deposit. The
Official shall furnish the applicant in writing with the method by which the
Official calculated the applicant's percentage of compliance and the reasons
for the Official's determination of the amount of the deposit to be released to
the applicant.
      (3)   Non-compliance. If the Compliance Official determines that the
applicant has not made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter, or if
the applicant fails to submit the documentation required by subsection (a) of
this Section within the required time period, then the applicant shall be in
violation of this Chapter and the entire diversion security deposit shall be
deemed forfeited.
(Ord. 957 § 3 (part), 2018)
4.13.090 Infeasibility exemption.
   (a)   Application. Prior to commencing demolition or construction for a
covered project, an applicant desiring relief from the requirements of this
Chapter may seek an exemption from the requirements herein. Said request for an
exemption shall be made at the time that the WMP is submitted as required under
Section
4.13.060 (a). The applicant shall indicate on the WMP the minimum rate of
diversion that is feasible for each material and the specific circumstances
that makes it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement. "Infeasible"
means that there is no Designated C&D Recycling Facility within a 50 mile
radius of the project area, the location(s) from which the applicant regularly
operates its business, or stores its construction or demolition equipment or
the applicant will reuse all of the debris from the project onsite. Granting
the exemption will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent
with limitations imposed on like projects.
   (b)   Meeting with the Compliance Official. The Compliance Official shall
review the information supplied by the applicant and may meet with the
applicant to discuss possible ways of meeting the diversion requirement. The
Compliance Official may request staff from the Designated C&D Recovery Facility
to attend this meeting. Based on the information supplied by the applicant and,
if applicable, the Designated C&D Recovery Facility staff, the Compliance
Official shall determine whether it is possible for the applicant to meet the
diversion requirement.
   (c)   Granting of exemption. If the Compliance Official determines that it
is infeasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement due to unique
circumstances as set forth in subsection (a) above, the Compliance Official
shall determine the minimum feasible diversion rate for each material, if any,
and shall indicate this rate on the WMP submitted by the applicant. The
Compliance Official shall return a copy of the WMP to the applicant marked
"Approved for Infeasibility Exemption."
   (d)   Denial of exemption. If the Compliance Official determines that the
requirements of this subsection (a) are not met, he/she shall furnish the
decision to the applicant in writing.
(Ord. 957 § 3 (part), 2018)
4.13.100 Appeal.
   (a)   Within 10 days after service of a decision of the Compliance Official
upon the applicant, he or she may seek review of the decision by filing an
appeal with the Director of Development Services. The appeal shall be submitted
in writing, and shall include all of the following:
      (1)   The name and address of the appellant(s)
      (2)   The decision that is being appealed, and the date of the decision
      (3)   A summary of the reasons appellant is seeking appeal
   (b)   The Director of Development Services may either affirm or reverse the
decision of the Compliance Official. Said decision shall be made in writing,
within 15 days of receipt of the appeal. A decision by the Development Services
Director is final, and shall be effective on the date the decision is rendered.
(Ord. 957 § 3 (part), 2018)
4.13.110 Administrative fee.
   As a condition precedent to the issuance of any building or demolition
permit for a covered project, the applicant shall pay the City a fee,
established by resolution of the City Council, to compensate the City for the
costs incurred in administering this Chapter.
(Ord. 957 § 3 (part), 2018)
4.13.120 Enforcement.
   Any violation of this Chapter shall be subject to any enforcement remedies
available under the law and/or La Puente Municipal Code, including but not
limited to
Chapter 1.12 and
Chapter 3.20. In addition, the City may enforce the violation of this Chapter
by means of civil enforcement through a restraining order, a preliminary or
permanent injunction, or by any other means authorized under the law. The City
may also enforce any violation herein by revoking or suspecting the building,

noticed public hearing, shall set forth the amount of the sanitary sewer
capacity charge, set forth any findings required by law, and set forth the time
for payment.
(Ord. 07-865, 2007)
4.14.030 Use of revenues.
   The revenues raised by payment of the sanitary sewer capacity charge shall
be accounted for in a capital facilities fund. Separate and special accounts
within the fund shall be used to account for revenues, along with any interest
earnings on such accounts. These monies shall be used for the following
purposes:
   (a)   To pay for property acquisition, including right-of-way acquisition,
design, engineering, and construction of the public facilities and reasonable
cost of outside consultant studies related thereto;
   (b)   To reimburse the city for designated public facilities constructed by
the city with funds (other than gifts or grants) from other sources together
with accrued interest;

administration of the sanitary sewer capacity charge program.
(Ord. 07-865, 2007)
4.14.040 Developer construction of facilities.
   If a developer is required, as a condition of approval of a permit, or
otherwise proposes, to construct, or dedicate land for, a public facility that
has been designated to be financed with sanitary sewer capacity charges and if
the facility has supplemental size, length, or capacity over that needed for
the impacts of the development, a credit against the charge otherwise levied by
this chapter concerning the development project in an amount not to exceed the
cost of such public facilities as estimated by the city in adopting the charge
shall be offered by the city and, if the charge is less than such amount, the
developer shall be entitled to reimbursement. The reimbursement amount shall be
from charge revenue only.
(Ord. 07-865, 2007)
4.14.050 Administrative guidelines.
   The City Council may, by resolution, adopt administrative guidelines to set
forth procedures for the calculation, reimbursement, and other administrative
aspects of the sanitary sewer capacity charge.

(Ord. 936 § 3, 2015)
4.16.030 Definitions.
   Except as specifically provided herein, any term used in this
Chapter 4.16 shall be defined as that term in the current Municipal NPDES
permit, or if it is not specifically defined in either the Municipal NPDES
permit, then as such term is defined in the Federal Clean Water Act, as
amended, and/or the regulations promulgated thereunder. If the definition of
any term contained in this chapter conflicts with the definition of the same
term in the current Municipal NPDES permit, then the definition contained in
the Municipal NPDES permit shall govern. The following words and phrases shall
have the following meanings when used in this chapter:
   “Automotive Service Facility” means a facility that is categorized in any
one of the following Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) and North
American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes (SIC 5013, 5014, 5511,
5541, 7532-7534 and 7536-7539). For inspection purposes, Permittees need not
inspect facilities with SIC codes 5013, 5014, 5541, 5511, provided that these
facilities have no outside activities or materials that may be exposed to
stormwater.
   “Basin Plan” means the Water Quality Control Plan, Los Angeles Region, Basin
Plan for the Coastal Watersheds of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, adopted by

stormwater or non-stormwater discharged to the receiving water.
   “Biofiltration” means a LID BMP that reduces stormwater pollutant discharges
by intercepting rainfall on vegetative canopy, and through incidental
infiltration and/or evapotranspiration, and filtration. Incidental infiltration
is an important factor in achieving the required pollutant load reduction.
Therefore, the term “biofiltration” as used in this chapter is defined to
include only systems designed to facilitate incidental infiltration or achieve
the equivalent pollutant reduction as biofiltration BMPs with an underdrain
(subject to approval by the Regional Board’s Executive Officer). Biofiltration
BMPs include bioretention systems with an underdrain and bioswales.
   “Bioretention” means a LID BMP that reduces stormwater runoff by
intercepting rainfall on vegetative canopy, and through evapotranspiration and
infiltration. The bioretention system typically includes a minimum 2-foot top
layer of a specified soil and compost mixture underlain by a gravel-filled
temporary storage pit dug into the in-situ soil. As defined in the Municipal
NPDES permit, a bioretention BMP may be designed with an overflow drain, but
may not include an underdrain. When a bioretention BMP is designed or
constructed with an underdrain it is regulated by the Municipal NPDES permit as
biofiltration.
   “Bioswale” means a LID BMP consisting of a shallow channel lined with grass
or other dense, low-growing vegetation. Bioswales are designed to collect
stormwater runoff and to achieve a uniform sheet flow through the dense
vegetation for a period of several minutes.
   “City” means the City of La Puente.
   “Clean Water Act” (CWA) means the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as
amended, 33 U.S.C. Section 1251, et seq.
   “Commercial Malls” means any development on private land comprised of one or
more buildings forming a complex of stores which sells various merchandise,
with interconnecting walkways enabling visitors to easily walk from store to

limited to: mini-malls, strip malls, other retail complexes, and enclosed
shopping malls or shopping centers.
   “Construction Activity” means any construction or demolition activity,
clearing, grading, grubbing, or excavation or any other activity that result in
land disturbance. Construction does not include emergency construction
activities required to immediately protect public health and safety, routine
maintenance activities, or routine maintenance activities required to maintain
the integrity of structures by performing minor repair and restoration work,
maintain the original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, or original purposes
of the facility. See “Routine Maintenance” definition for further explanation.
Where clearing, grading or excavating of underlying soil takes place during a
repaving operation, State General Construction Permit coverage by the State of
California General Permit for Storm Water Discharges Associated with Industrial
Activities or for Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction Activities
is required if more than one acre is disturbed or the activities are part of a
larger plan.
   “Control” means to minimize, reduce or eliminate by technological, legal,
contractual, or other means, the discharge of pollutants from an activity or
activities.
   “Development” means construction, rehabilitation, redevelopment or
reconstruction of any public or private residential project (whether single-
family, multi-unit or planned unit development); industrial, commercial,
retail, and other non-residential projects, including public agency projects;
or mass grading for future construction. It does not include routine
maintenance, routine maintenance to maintain original line and grade, hydraulic
capacity, or original purpose of facility, nor does it include emergency
construction activities required to immediately protect public health and
safety.
   “Directly Adjacent” means situated within 200 feet of the contiguous zone
required for the continued maintenance, function, and structural stability of
the environmentally sensitive area.
   “Director” means the Director of Development Services of the City and his or
her authorized agent, representative or inspector.

disposal of any liquid, semi-solid, or solid substance.
   “Disturbed Area” means an area that is altered as a result of clearing,
grading, and/or excavation (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).
   “Executive Officer” means Executive Officer of the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board, Los Angeles.
   “Flow-through BMPs” means modular, vault type “high flow biotreatment”
devices contained within an impervious vault with an underdrain or designed
with an impervious liner and an underdrain.
   “General Construction Activities Storm Water Permit (GCASP)” means the
general NPDES permit adopted by the State Board which authorizes the discharge
of stormwater from construction activities under certain conditions.
   “General Industrial Activities Storm Water Permit (GIASP)” means the general
NPDES permit adopted by the State Board which authorizes the discharge of
stormwater from certain industrial activities under certain conditions.
   “Green Roof” means a LID BMP using planter boxes and vegetation to intercept
rainfall on the roof surface. Rainfall is intercepted by vegetation leaves and
through evapotranspiration. Green roofs may be designed as either a
bioretention BMP or as a biofiltration BMP. To receive credit as a bioretention
BMP, the green roof system planting medium shall be of sufficient depth to
provide capacity within the pore space volume to contain the design storm depth
and may not be designed or constructed with an underdrain.
   “Hazardous Material(s)” means any material(s) defined as hazardous by
Division 20, Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code.
   “Hillside” means a property located in an area with known erosive soil
conditions, where the development contemplates grading on any natural slope
that is 25 percent or greater and where grading contemplates cut or fill
slopes.
   “Hydromodification” means the alteration of the hydrologic characteristics
of coastal and non-coastal waters, which in turn could cause degradation of
water resources.
   “Illicit connection” means any device through or by which an illicit
discharge is conveyed into the municipal storm water system without a permit,
including but not limited to floor drains, pipes or any fabricated or natural
conduits, excluding roof drains which convey only storm water.
   “Illicit discharge” means the entry of any material other than storm water
unless such discharge is exempted under the municipal NPDES permit; is allowed
under a separate NPDES permit, including but not limited to a point source
permit, a General Industrial Activity Storm Water permit, or a General
Construction Activity Storm Water permit; or is allowed by the Executive
Officer.
   “Impervious Surface” means any man-made or modified surface that prevents or
significantly reduces the entry of water into the underlying soil, resulting in
runoff from the surface in greater quantities and/or at an increased rate, when
compared to natural conditions prior to development. Examples of places that
commonly exhibit impervious surfaces include parking lots, driveways, roadways,
storage areas, and rooftops. The imperviousness of these areas commonly results
from paving, compacted gravel, compacted earth, and oiled earth.
   “Industrial Park” means land development that is set aside for industrial
development.
   “Infiltration BMP” means a LID BMP that reduces stormwater runoff by
capturing and infiltrating the runoff into in-situ soils or amended onsite
soils. Examples of infiltration BMPs include infiltration basins, dry wells,
and pervious pavement.
   “LID” means Low Impact Development. LID consists of building and landscape
features designed to retain or filter stormwater runoff.
   “Maximum extent practicable” means, within the context of BMP selection,
choosing effective BMPs, and rejecting applicable BMPs only: (1) where
effective BMPs will serve the same purpose; (2) the BMPs would not be
technically feasible; or (3) the cost would be prohibitive.

4.16.070 Low Impact Development Measures.
   (a)   Objective. The provisions of this section contain requirements for
construction activities and facility operations of Development and
Redevelopment projects to comply with the current “Municipal NPDES permit,'”
lessen the water quality impacts of development by using smart growth
practices, and integrate LID design principles to mimic predevelopment
hydrology through infiltration, evapotranspiration and rainfall harvest and
use. LID shall be inclusive of new development and/or redevelopment projects.
   (b)   Scope. This Section contains requirements for stormwater pollution
control measures in Development and Redevelopment projects and authorizes the
City to further define and adopt stormwater pollution control measures, to
develop LID principles and requirements, including but not limited to the
objectives and specifications for integration of LID strategies, and to grant
waivers or alternate compliance as allowed by the Municipal NPDES permit and
collect fees from projects granted exceptions. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the City shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this
Section. Guidance documents supporting implementation of requirements in this
Ordinance are hereby incorporated by reference, including LID Manuals.
   (c)   Applicability. The following Development and Redevelopment projects,
termed “Planning Priority Projects,” shall comply with the requirements of this
Chapter:
      (1)   All development projects equal to 1 acre or greater of disturbed
area that adds more than 10,000 square feet of impervious surface area.
      (2)   Industrial parks 10,000 square feet or more of surface area.
      (3)   Commercial malls 10,000 square feet or more of surface area.
      (4)   Retail gasoline outlets with 5,000 square feet or more of surface
area.
      (5)   Restaurants (Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) of 5812) with
5,000 square feet or more of surface area.
      (6)   Parking lots with 5,000 square feet or more of impervious surface
area, or with 25 or more parking spaces.
      (7)   Streets and roads construction of 10,000 square feet or more of
impervious surface area.
      (8)   Automotive service facilities (Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) of 5013, 5014, 5511, 5541, 7532-7534 and 7536-7539) 5,000 square feet or
more of surface area.
      (9)   Projects located in or directly adjacent to, or discharging
directly to an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA), where the development
will:
         a.   Discharge stormwater runoff that is likely to impact a sensitive
biological species or habitat; and
         b.   Create 2,500 square feet or more of impervious surface area
      (10)   Single-family hillside homes.
      (11)   Redevelopment Projects
         a.   Land disturbing activity that results in the creation or addition
or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious surface area on an
already developed site on Planning Priority Project categories.
         b.   Where Redevelopment results in an alteration to more than fifty
percent of impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the
existing development was not subject to post-construction stormwater quality
control requirements, the entire project must be mitigated.
         c.   Where Redevelopment results in an alteration of less than fifty
percent of impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the
existing development was not subject to post-construction stormwater quality
control requirements, only the alteration must be mitigated, and not the entire
development.
         d.   Redevelopment does not include routine maintenance activities
that are conducted to maintain original line and grade, hydraulic capacity,
original purpose of facility or emergency redevelopment activity required to
protect public health and safety. Impervious surface replacement, such as the
reconstruction of parking lots and roadways which does not disturb additional
area and maintains the original grade and alignment, is considered a routine
maintenance activity. Redevelopment does not include the repaving of existing
roads to maintain original line and grade.
         e.   Existing single-family dwelling and accessory structures are
exempt from the Redevelopment requirements unless such projects create, add, or
replace 10,000 square feet of impervious surface area.

   (d)   Effective Date. The Planning and Land Development requirements
contained in this Ordinance shall become effective 90 days from the adoption of
the Ordinance. This includes Planning Priority Projects that are discretionary
permit projects or project phases that have not been deemed complete for
processing, or discretionary permit projects without vesting tentative maps
that have not requested and received an extension of previously granted
approvals within 90 days of adoption of the Ordinance. Projects that have been
deemed complete within 90 days of adoption of the Ordinance are not subject to
the requirements of this Chapter.
   (e)   Stormwater Pollution Control Requirements. The Site for every Planning
Priority Project shall be designed to control pollutants, pollutant loads, and
runoff volume to the maximum extent feasible by minimizing impervious surface
area and controlling runoff from impervious surfaces through infiltration,
evapotranspiration, bioretention and/or rainfall harvest and use.
      (1)   A new single-family hillside home development shall include
mitigation measures to:
         a.   Conserve natural areas;
         b.   Protect slopes and channels;
         c.   Provide storm drain system stenciling and signage;
         d.   Divert roof runoff to vegetated areas before discharge unless the
diversion would result in slope instability; and
         e.   Direct surface flow to vegetated areas before discharge, unless
the diversion would result in slope instability.
      (2)   Street and road construction of 10,000 square feet or more of
impervious surface shall follow USEPA guidance regarding Managing Wet Weather
with Green Infrastructure: Green Streets (December 2008 EPA-833-F-08-009) to
the maximum extent practicable.
      (3)   The remainder of Planning Priority Projects shall prepare a LID
Plan to comply with the following:
         a.   Retain stormwater runoff onsite for the Stormwater Quality Design
Volume (SWQDv) defined as the runoff from:
            i.   The 85th percentile 24-hour runoff event as determined from
the Los Angeles County 85th percentile precipitation isohyetal map; or
            ii.   The volume of runoff produced from a 0.75 inch, 24-hour rain
event, whichever is greater.
         b.   When, as determined by the City, 100 percent onsite retention of
the SWQDv is technically infeasible, partially or fully, the infeasibility
shall be demonstrated in the submitted LID Plan. The technical infeasibility
may result from conditions that may include, but are not limited to:
            i.   The infiltration rate of saturated in-situ soils is less than
0.3 inch per hour and it is not technically feasible to amend the in-situ soils
to attain an infiltration rate necessary to achieve reliable performance of
infiltration or bioretention BMPs in retaining the SWQDv onsite.
            ii.   Locations where seasonal high groundwater is within five to
ten feet of surface grade;
            iii.   Locations within 100 feet of a groundwater well used for
drinking water;
            iv.   Brownfield development sites or other locations where
pollutant mobilization is a documented concern;
            v.   Locations with potential geotechnical hazards;
            vi.   Smart growth and infill or redevelopment locations where the
density and/ or nature of the project would create significant difficulty for
compliance with the onsite volume retention requirement.
         c.   If partial or complete onsite retention is technically
infeasible, the project Site may biofiltrate 1.5 times the portion of the
remaining SWQDv that is not reliably retained onsite. Biofiltration BMPs must
adhere to the design specifications provided in the Municipal NPDES Permit.
            i.   Additional alternative compliance options such as offsite
infiltration may be available to the project Site. The project Site should
contact the City to determine eligibility.
         d.   The remaining SWQDv that cannot be retained or biofiltered onsite
must be treated onsite to reduce pollutant loading. BMPs must be selected and
designed to meet pollutant-specific benchmarks as required per the Municipal
NPDES Permit. Flow-through BMPs may be used to treat the remaining SWQDv and
must be sized based on a rainfall intensity of:
            i.   0.2 inches per hour, or
            ii.   The one year, one-hour rainfall intensity as determined from
the most recent Los Angeles County isohyetal map, whichever is greater.
         e.   A Multi-Phased Project may comply with the standards and
requirements of this section for all of its phases by: (a) designing a system
acceptable to the City to satisfy these standards and requirements for the
entire Site during the first phase, and (b) implementing these standards and
requirements for each phase of Development or Redevelopment of the Site during
the first phase or prior to commencement of construction of a later phase, to
the extent necessary to treat the stormwater from such later phase. For
purposes of this section, “Multi-Phased Project” shall mean any Planning
Priority Project implemented over more than one phase and the Site of a Multi-
Phased Project shall include any land and water area designed and used to
store, treat or manage stormwater runoff in connection with the Development or
Redevelopment, including any tracts, lots, or parcels of real property, whether
Developed or not, associated with, functionally connected to, or under common
ownership or control with such Development or Redevelopment.
   (f)   Other Agencies of the City. All City departments, offices, entities
and agencies, shall establish administrative procedures necessary to implement
the provisions of this Article on their Development and Redevelopment projects
and report their activities annually to the Director.

Code, or is otherwise a threat or detrimental to the public peace, health,
safety or welfare due to the magnitude of the crowd, noise, disturbance or

destruction of property, then the city manager or his or her designee or the

necessary to investigate or abate the violation or condition and shall advise

rooms or seating capacity in any building, or the number of machines used in
any business, such person shall, before obtaining a license for his or her

amount of the maximum admission fee to be charged, or the estimated number of
tables, alleys or other devices to be used for any game by such person, or the
estimated number of rooms or seating capacity in the building, or the estimated
number of machines to be used in such business. The license tax, based upon
such estimation, shall be paid at the time the first license is issued for any
newly established business. Within thirty days after the end of the license
period for which the license is issued, such person shall file a supplemental
statement with the business license officer as to the actual numbers and shall
pay any additional amount of license tax due. The business license officer is
authorized to refund any overpayment of the estimated license tax, if the
business license officer finds, based on the supplemental statement, that an
overpayment was made to the city.
   (c)   No statements required by this section shall be conclusive upon the
city or any officer thereof as to the matters therein set forth, and the same
shall not prejudice the rights of the city to recover any amount that may be
ascertained to be due from such person, in addition to the amount due based
upon the information in the statement, in case the statement is found to be
incorrect. The correctness of all the statements shall be subject to
verification by the business license officer who is hereby authorized and
empowered to inspect and audit the books and records of any and all persons

   This chapter shall be known as the “Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax
Ordinance” of the city of La Puente.
(Ord. 788 § 11 (part), 1999)
5.06.020 Savings clause.
   The provisions of this chapter are substantially the same as those
originally set forth in Ordinance No. 674, as adopted in 1992, and Ordinance
No. 698, as adopted in 1993. Therefore, this chapter is to be construed as a
restatement and continuation of these earlier ordinances, as previously
codified, and not as a new enactment. Nothing contained in this chapter shall
be interpreted or enforced in such a manner as to constitute an increase in the
tax imposed by these Ordinance No. 674 or Ordinance No. 698.
(Ord. 788 § 11 (part), 1999)
5.06.030 Definitions.
   For purposes of this chapter, unless it is plainly evident from the context
that a different meaning is intended, the following definitions shall apply:
   “Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is
occupied or intended or designed to be used, occupied or possessed by
transients for temporary dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes
any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel,
lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, rental unit, dormitory, public
or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other
similar structure or portion thereof.
   “Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession, of any room or rooms, or portion thereof, in any hotel for
temporary dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.
   “Operator” means the person who is a proprietor of the hotel, whether in the
capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any
other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing
agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall
also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the
same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of
this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both.
   “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture association,
social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate,
trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or
combination acting as a unit.
   “Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the
occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money,
goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property
and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.
   “Tax administrator” means the city manager of the city or his/her designee.
   “Temporary” means a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less,
counting portions of calendar days as full days. In the event that any person
rents a hotel room(s) for more than thirty consecutive calendar days, the
determination of whether the use was temporary for purposes of applying this
chapter shall be based on the time period of actual occupancy of the room by a
natural person or persons and not the duration of the room(s) reservation,
lease or rental agreement. In determining whether a use is temporary,
uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the
effective date of this chapter may be considered.
   “Transient” means any person who exercises temporary occupancy or is
entitled to occupancy for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less,
counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any person who exercises
occupancy or is entitled to occupancy shall be deemed to be a transient until
the period of thirty days has expired.
(Ord. 788 § 11 (part), 1999)
5.06.040 Tax imposed.
   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel each transient is subject to and
shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent of the rent charged by the
operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is
extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient
shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If
the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be
paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s
ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid
to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax
shall be paid directly to the tax administrator.
(Ord. 788 § 11 (part), 1999)
5.06.050 Exemptions.
   No tax shall be imposed upon:
   (a)   Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the
power of the city to impose the tax herein provided;
   (b)   Any federal or state of California officer or employee when on
official business; and
   (c)   Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by
reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.
   No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time
rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the
tax administrator.
(Ord. 788 § 11 (part), 1999)
5.06.060 Responsibility of operator.
   Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same
extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The
amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged,
and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No
operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or
indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the
operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part
will be refunded, except in the manner hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 788 § 11 (part), 1999)
5.06.070 Registration of hotel.
   Within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter, or within
thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any
hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register the hotel with the tax
administrator and obtain a business license and a transient occupancy
registration certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on
the premises. The certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
   (a)   The name of the operator;
   (b)   The address of the hotel;
   (c)   The date upon which the certificate was issued; and
   (d)   The following statement: This transient occupancy registration
certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled
the requirements of the uniform transient occupancy tax ordinance of the city
of La Puente by registering with the tax administrator for the purpose of
collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting said tax
to the tax administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to
conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in any unlawful
manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all applicable
laws, including but not limited to, those requiring a permit from any board,
commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not
constitute a permit.
(Ord. 788 § 11 (part), 1999)
5.06.080 Reporting and remitting.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of each calendar quarter or of such different reporting period as may be
established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator,
on forms provided by the tax administrator, of the total rents charged and
received, the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies, and such other
information as may be reasonably required. At the same time as the return is
filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax
administrator. The tax administrator may establish either shorter or longer
reporting periods for any individual certificate holder or shorter or longer
reporting periods for any individual certificate holder or category of
certificate holders if the tax administrator deems it necessary or desirable in
order to insure collection of the tax or to increase the efficiency of its
administration. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of
business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this
chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment
thereof is made to the tax administrator.
(Ord. 788 § 11 (part), 1999)
5.06.090 Penalties and interest.
   (a)   Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of
the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.
   (b)   Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of
ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and
the ten percent penalty first imposed.
   (c)   Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five
percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the
penalties stated in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.
   (d)   Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails
to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-
half of the one percent per month for each month or portion of a month that the
tax shall be delinquent on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from
the date on which the tax first became delinquent until paid. The interest
shall be computed on a monthly basis and shall not be subject to proration for
any portion of a month.
   (e)   Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as
accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax
herein required to be paid.
(Ord. 788 § 11 (part), 1999)
5.06.100 Failure to collect and report tax—Determination of tax by tax
administrator.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax and to make, within
the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed
in such manner as the tax administrator may deem best to obtain facts and
information on which to base an estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax
administrator shall procure such facts and information as the tax administrator
is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the
same and to make such report and remittance, the tax administrator shall
proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and
penalties provided for by this chapter. In the event such determination is
made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by
serving it personally or by deposing it in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known address. Such
operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make
application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount
assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the
time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax
administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and
payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less
than five business days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the
operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount
specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At
such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified
tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the tax
administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall
thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of
such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The
amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen calendar days unless
an appeal is taken as provided in Section
5.06.110 of this chapter.
(Ord. 788 § 11 (part), 1999)
5.06.110 Appeal.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect
to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen
days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The city
council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk
shall give a notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of
address. The findings of the city council shall be final and conclusive and
shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service
of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and
payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 788 § 11 (part), 1999)
5.06.120 Records.
   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment
to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a
period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount
of such tax as it may have been liable for the collection and payment of to the
city, including, without limitation, guest registration information, which
records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect, upon demand, at
all reasonable times.
(Ord. 788 § 11 (part), 1999)
5.06.130 Refunds.
   (a)   Claim Required. Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty
has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally
collected or received by the city under this chapter it may be refunded as
provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section; provided, that a claim in
writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon
which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three
years of the date of payment. The claim shall be made on forms furnished by the
tax administrator.
   (b)   Claim by Operator. An operator may claim a refund, or take as credit
against taxes collected and remitted, the amount overpaid, paid more than once
or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a
manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from which the tax
has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a
refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected
has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently
payable by the transient to the operator.
   (c)   Claim by Transient. A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid
or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the
city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a), but only when
the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when
the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the
satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to
obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)   Evidence. No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section
unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.
(Ord. 788 § 11 (part), 1999)
5.06.140 Tax declared a debt—Action to collect.
   Any tax required to be paid by an transient under the provisions of this
chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax
collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a
debt owned by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city
under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in
the name of the city of La Puente for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 788 § 11 (part), 1999)
5.06.150 Penalty for violations.
   Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required
herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses
to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax
administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, or who
fails or refuses to pay any tax, penalty or interest which is due and owing is
guilty of a misdemeanor, and is punishable by a fine not exceeding one thousand
dollars or by not more than six months imprisonment in the county jail or by
both such fine and imprisonment. Each such person shall be guilty of a separate
offense for each and every day during any portion of which any provision of
this chapter is committed, continued or permitted by such person and shall be
punishable accordingly. Any person required to make, render, sign or verify and
report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent
to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter
to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as aforesaid.

specified in subsection (a) of this section, if it is filed before the
expiration of the existing permit, or if it is filed not later than sixty
calendar days after the expiration of the existing permit and the director

renewal application from being filed. When an application is submitted pursuant
to this section, the fee shall be equal to the renewal fee established by

appeal the director’s decision to the city council in the manner prescribed in
Section
5.08.030(d) of this chapter.

5.08.090 Business permit transfers and changes.
   (a)   Transfers of Ownership. A new business permit is required whenever
there is a transfer in ownership of a business which is required to have a
permit issued under Section
5.08.020 of this chapter. If there is no change in the nature or scope of
business or in the business location, and if the previous owner has a valid
business permit at the time of transfer, the new permit shall be issued upon
filing of a complete application and payment of all required fees and taxes.
For the purposes of the previous sentence, the director may issue a new permit
even without obtaining the concurrence of other agencies. However, if the
original business permit application process required the business owner or
manager to be fingerprinted and/or a background investigation to be conducted,
then the new business owner or manager must also be fingerprinted and the new
permit shall be subject to the sheriff’s concurrence following a background
investigation. The following transactions shall be considered transfers:

shareholder to another.
   (b)   Change of Name. A new business permit is required whenever there is a
change of name of a business which is required to have a permit under Section
5.08.020 of this chapter. If there is no transfer of ownership or change in the
nature or scope of business or in the business location and if the permittee
operating under the previous name has a valid business permit at the time of
the change of name, the new permit shall be issued upon filing of a complete
application and payment of all required fees and taxes. For the purposes of the
previous sentence, the director may issue a new permit without obtaining the
concurrence of other agencies.
   (c)   Change of Location. A new business permit is required whenever there
is a change in location of a business which is required to have a permit under
Section
5.08.020 of this chapter.
   (d)   Change in Business. A new business permit is required whenever there
is a change in the nature or scope of the business which is required to have a
permit pursuant to Section
5.08.020.
   (e)   Report to Director. A permittee shall notify the director of any
transfer in ownership, change of name, change of location, or change in the
nature or scope of the business within ten days after such transfer or change.

city regulations. Such statement shall be submitted to the director.

be an adverse impact of the business on the public health, safety or welfare,
notice of the public hearing on the charges shall be mailed by certified or
registered mail or personally delivered to the applicant and given pursuant to
Section
5.08.030(d)(3) of this chapter.

      (1)   The permittee, the permittee’s agent, manager or employees has
failed to maintain the premises in a neat and clean condition and have allowed

Activities. The director or city council may impose conditions on the permit

or city council finds that one or more of the conditions in Section
5.08.110(a) of this chapter exist.
      (2)   Businesses Which Do Not Involve Constitutionally Protected
Expressive Activities. The director or city council may impose conditions on
the permit as are reasonably necessary to protect the peace and tranquility of
any residential area, mitigate traffic impacts, protect other uses in the area,
and protect the public health, welfare and safety. Any person issued a permit
pursuant to this chapter shall comply with all conditions that are imposed on
the permit. Any violation of the conditions of approval is a misdemeanor and is
subject to the penalties set forth in Section
1.08.040 of this code.
   (c)   Whenever the director or city council determines that unannounced
inspections of the business premises are necessary to enforce the provisions of
this chapter, it may impose as a condition of the permit that the applicant or
permittee consent to entry of the applicant’s or permittee’s place of business
at all reasonable times by any city officer or employee authorized to enforce
the provisions of this chapter or this code. Upon presentation of proper
credentials by any such officer or employee, the applicant or permittee shall
comply with such inspection.
   (d)   Whenever the director or city council determines that noise from any
establishment permitted under this chapter interferes with the right of persons
dwelling in the vicinity of such establishment to the peaceful and quiet use
and enjoyment of their property, or that the establishment permitted under this
chapter is in violation of the noise ordinance of the city of La Puente, as set
forth in
Chapter 4.34 of this code, it may impose as a condition of the permit that the
premises of the business activity be soundproofed to eliminate the noise or
reduce it to a reasonable and lawful level. In imposing a condition under this
section, the director or city council must balance all of the interests of the
respective parties, as well as the hardship which will result from the
condition. If the director or city council finds that the noise complained of
is of a minimum or inconsequential degree, no action shall be taken under this
paragraph.
   (e)   The director or the city council may change, modify or eliminate any
conditions previously placed on a permit upon written request of the permittee
if it finds that the reasons for the original imposition of such conditions
have been cured or no longer exist. Applications to change conditions shall be
noticed and set for public hearing in a manner consistent with Section
5.08.030(d) of this chapter, if the condition(s) was imposed after a duly

5.04.380 of this code.
(Ord. 786 § 2 (part), 1999)
5.08.150 Establishment and operation of smoke shops.
   Certain zoning permit, use permit or other entitlement for establishment and
operation of smoke shops prohibited.
   (a)   No person, partnership, corporation, or other entity shall commence
doing business as a smoke shop, as defined in Section 10.132.200 of the code,
except those establishments specifically excluded herein, until such reasonable
time as a detailed study may be made and the zoning and public hearings process
pertaining to these matters is completed, or until one year from the date of
adoption of this section, whichever occurs sooner.
   (b)   Establishments excluded from this section are those establishments
already inoperation at the time of the enactment of this section.
   (c)   Environmental assessment. Pursuant to the California environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines, the City Council declares that this section is
exempt from CEQA based on the following findings:
      (1)   This section is not a “project” within the meaning of Section 15378
of the State CEQA Guidelines, because it has no potential for resulting in
physician damage to the environment, directly or indirectly. The purpose of
this section is to prohibit, on an interim basis, doing business as or issuance
of business license to an owner or operator of a smoke shop as defined in
Section 10.132.200 of this code. This section, therefore, has no potential for
resulting in physical change in the environment, directly or indirectly; it
prevents changes in the environment pending the completion of the contemplated
zoning code review.
      (2)   This section is not subject to CEQA pursuant to Section 15060(c)(2)
because the activity will not result in a direct or reasonably forseeable
indirect physical change in the environment.
      (3)   This section is covered by the general rule that CEQA applies only
to projects which have the potential for causing a significant effect on the
environment. For the reasons set forth in subsection (1) and (2) of this
section, it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that this
section will have a significant effect on the environment, and therefore, this
section is not subject to CEQA.

other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be

5.18.010 Intent.
   The intent of this chapter is to establish procedures and standards by which
property address numbers will be painted on the curbs of adjacent public
streets at no direct cost to the city of La Puente. It is intended that the
work would be performed by individuals or entities that would seek voluntary
donations from the owners or residents of the benefitting properties that would
cover the cost of providing the service and support not-for-profit charitable
endeavors directly benefitting the city and its residents. This chapter would
not preclude the city from directly engaging and paying an independent
contractor or utilizing city employees to undertake such activities when in the
public interest.
(Ord. 825 § 1 (part), 2004)
5.18.020 Agreement and permit required.
   No person or entity shall engage in, conduct or carry on the business of
painting property address numbers on curbs of public streets, without first
having obtained an agreement and permit issued under the provisions of
Chapter 5.08 of this title. At any one time the city council may issue no more
than one exclusive agreement for painting address numbers on street curbs
within the city, to assure reliable, safe and quality service to city
residents. Upon approval of one agreement and issuance of associated permits,
the city shall not accept new or renewal applications for permits to paint
addresses on street curbs for the duration of the agreement. It shall be
unlawful for any person or entity to enter into the business of painting
address numbers on street curbs.
(Ord. 825 § 1 (part), 2004)
5.18.030   Selection of person or entity to provide address painting services
on street curbs.
   The city council shall establish procedures to select the person or entity
that will paint property addresses on the curbs of public streets. The city
council shall competitively solicit proposals to provide address painting
services on street curbs. Selection of the persons(s) or entity to provide such
services shall be based on the quality, nature and scope of the work,
procedures and service that are outlined in the proposal, as well as the
qualifications, experience and reputation of the person(s) or entity that will
perform the work.
(Ord. 825 § 1 (part), 2004)
5.18.040 Preference toward local not-for-profit entities.
   When selecting among any person(s) or entities with whom to enter an
agreement, the city council shall give preference to not-for-profit entities
that have actively provided charitable services to residents within the city
for a period of at least two years. If no reasonable proposals are received
from a not-for-profit entity or it is otherwise in the best interest of the
city, the city council may consider proposal and enter into an agreement with
other person(s) or a for-profit entity.
(Ord. 825 § 1 (part), 2004)
5.18.050 Standards for curb address painting.
   The painting of address numbers on street curbs shall conform with the
following standards:
   (a)   The painted numbers shall conform to city specifications as to size
and form, and the quality and type of paint to be used. The numbers shall be
black, four inches tall, on white reflectorized background. Background shall be
at least one inch larger than all lettering.
   (b)   The selected person or entity must notify residents at least twenty-
four (24) hours in advance of the period during which the curb address number
painting will be done.
   (c)   The selected person or entity must advise residents in writing that
they are under no obligation to pay for this service.
   (d)   All representatives of the selected person or entity who work in
public must wear a photographic identification badge that is approved by the
city.
   (e)   The selected person or entity and/or its subcontractor must respond
within a reasonable time frame to complaints, and correct errors within three
working days of being given such notice.
   (f)   The selected person or entity and/or its subcontractor must obtain a
city business license.
   (g)   All representative of the selected person or entity who work in public
must carry evidence of authorization to perform services (a copy of the permit
issued by the city).

to ensure cleanup and restoration of any public property.
   (c)   The decision by the film permit coordinator to approve or deny a
filming permit and conditions to be applied to an approved permit shall be
provided in writing within:
      (1)   Five full working days if no special traffic control, road closures
or stunts, or special effects are involved;

the public right-of-way and on private property to prevent traffic, safety, and

mobile vending will protect the public health and safety and ensure safe
pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Unregulated vending in the public right of
way, from pushcarts, vehicles including food trucks, stands, or by persons
contributes to traffic congestion and impedes the orderly movement of
pedestrians and vehicles. And the unregulated use of congested streets and
sidewalks with a high concentration of vehicular, pedestrian and commercial
activity by vendors make the streets and walkways unsafe for motorists,
cyclists, pedestrians, and vendors. (Ord. 959 § 2, 2019)

are sold, displayed, solicited or offered for sale or bartered or exchanged, or
any lunch wagon, including food trucks, or eating cart or vehicle upon a public
street, sidewalk, parkway, pedestrian path, or other public right-of-way within
the city.
   Person. One or more individuals, groups, businesses, business trusts,
companies, corporations, joint ventures, joint stock companies, partnership,

individuals (or the manager, lessee, agent, servant, officer, or employee of
any of them), whether engaged in business, nonprofit, or any other activity.
   Public Sidewalk or Public Street. All of those areas dedicated as public
thoroughfares, including, but not limited to, roadways, parkways, medians,
alleys, sidewalks and public ways.
   Roaming Sidewalk Vendor. A sidewalk vendor who moves from place to place and
stops only to complete a transaction.
   Sidewalk Vendor. A person who sells food or merchandise from a pushcart,
stand, display, pedal-driven cart, wagon, showcase, rack, or other non-
motorized conveyance, or from one's person, upon a public sidewalk, parkway,

   Swap Meet. A location operated in accordance with Article 6 of Chapter 9 of

arising out of the subject matter of this chapter. A permit issued pursuant to
this Chapter may specify where and when mobile vending is permitted. (Ord. 959

      (1)   The development of cable television and other telecommunications
systems may provide significant benefits for, and have substantial impacts

Article II. Cable Television Systems
5.52.100 Authority and findings.
   (a)   In accordance with applicable federal and state law, the city is
authorized to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct,
reconstruct, operate and maintain cable television systems within the city
limits.
   (b)   The city council finds that the development of cable television and
related telecommunications services may provide significant benefits for, and
substantial impacts upon, the residents of the city. Because of the complex and
rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the city council
further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best
be served by establishing regulatory powers to be exercised by the city. This
Article II is intended to specify the means for providing to the public the
best possible cable television and related telecommunications services, and
every franchise issued in accordance with this Article II is intended to
achieve this primary objective. It is the further intent of this Article II to
adopt regulatory provisions that will enable the city to regulate cable
television and related telecommunications services to the maximum extent
authorized by federal and state law.
(Ord. 760 § 2 (part), 1998)
5.52.110 Franchise terms and conditions.
   (a)   Franchise Purposes. A franchise granted by the city under the
provisions of this article may authorize the grantee to do the following:
      (1)   To engage in the business of providing cable service and such other
telecommunications services as may be authorized by law and which grantee
elects to provide to its subscribers within the designated franchise service
area;
      (2)   To erect, install, construct, repair, rebuild, reconstruct,
replace, maintain, and retain, cable lines, related electronic equipment,
supporting structures, appurtenances, and other property in connection with the
operation of the cable system in, on, over, under, upon, along and across
streets or other public places within the designated franchise service area;
      (3)   To maintain and operate the franchise properties for the
origination, reception, transmission, amplification and distribution of
television and radio signals, and for the delivery of cable services and such
other services as may be authorized by law.
   (b)   Franchise Required. It is unlawful for any person to construct,
install or operate a cable television system within any street or public way in
the city without first obtaining a franchise under the provisions of this
article.
   (c)   Term of the Franchise.
      (1)   A franchise granted under this article will be for the term
specified in the franchise agreement, commencing upon the effective date of the
ordinance or resolution adopted by the city council that authorizes the
franchise.
      (2)   A franchise granted under this article may be renewed upon
application by the grantee in accordance with the then-applicable provisions of
state and federal law and of this article.
   (d)   Franchise Territory. A franchise is effective within the territorial
limits of the city, and within any area added to the city during the term of
the franchise, unless otherwise specified in the ordinance or resolution
granting the franchise or in the franchise agreement.
   (e)   Federal or State Jurisdiction. This article will be construed in a
manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws, and it applies to
all franchises granted or renewed after the effective date of this article, to
the extent authorized by applicable law.
   (f)   Franchise Nontransferable.
      (1)   Grantee may not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, or dispose
of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary
sale, contract, consolidation, or otherwise, the franchise or any of the rights
or privileges therein granted, without the prior consent of the city council
and then only upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the city
council, which consent may not be unreasonably denied or delayed. Any attempt
to sell, transfer, lease, assign, or otherwise dispose of the franchise without
the consent of the city council is null and void. The granting of a security
interest in any assets of the grantee, or any mortgage or other hypothecation,
will not be deemed a transfer for the purposes of this subsection.
      (2)   The requirements of subsection (f)(1) of this section apply to any
change in control of grantee. The word “control” as used herein is not limited
to the ownership of major stockholder or partnership interests, but includes
actual working control in whatever manner exercised. If grantee is a
corporation, prior authorization of the city council is required where
ownership or control of more than ten percent of the voting stock of grantee is
acquired by a person or a group of persons acting in concert, none of whom,
singularly or collectively, owns or controls the voting stock of the grantee as
of the effective date of the franchise.
      (3)   Grantee must notify the city in writing of any foreclosure or
judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the grantee’s franchise property,
or upon the termination of any lease or other interest covering all or a
substantial part of that franchise property. That notification will be
considered by the city as notice that a change in control of ownership of the
franchise has taken place, and the provisions of this paragraph that require
the prior consent of the city council to that change in control of ownership
will apply.
      (4)   For the purpose of determining whether it will consent to an
acquisition, transfer, or change in control, the city may inquire as to the
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and grantee
must assist the city in that inquiry. In seeking the city’s consent to any
change of ownership or control, grantee or the proposed transferee, or both,
must complete Federal Communications Commission Form 394 or its equivalent.
This application must be submitted to the city not less than one hundred twenty
days prior to the proposed date of transfer. The transferee must establish that
it possesses the legal, financial and technical capability to operate and
maintain the cable system and to comply with all franchise requirements during
the remaining term of the franchise. If the legal, financial and technical
qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the city will consent to the
transfer of the franchise. The consent of the city to that transfer will not be
unreasonably denied and delayed.
      (5)   Any financial institution holding a pledge of the grantee’s assets
to secure the advance of money for the construction or operation of the
franchise property has the right to notify the city that it, or a designee
satisfactory to the city, will take control of and operate the cable television
system upon grantee’s default in its financial obligations. Further, that
financial institution must also submit a plan for such operation within ninety
days after assuming control. The plan must insure continued service and
compliance with all franchise requirements during the period that the financial
institution will exercise control over the system. The financial institution
may not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year unless
authorized by the city, in its sole discretion, and during that period of time
it will have the right to petition the city to transfer the franchise to
another grantee.
      (6)   Grantee must reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable review
and processing expenses incurred in connection with any transfer or change in
control of the franchise. These expenses include, without limitation, costs of
administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the
proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all
costs incurred by these experts), notice and publication costs, and document
preparation expenses. No reimbursement may be offset against any franchise fee
payable to the city during the term of the franchise.
   (g)   Geographical Coverage.
      (1)   Grantee must design, construct and maintain the cable television
system so as to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit in the city,
subject to any service-area line extension requirements of the franchise
agreement.
      (2)   After service has been established by activating trunk or
distribution cables for any service area, grantee must provide service to any
requesting subscriber in that service area within thirty days from the date of
request, provided that the grantee is able to secure on reasonable terms and
conditions all rights-of-way necessary to extend service to that subscriber
within that thirty-day period.
   (h)   Nonexclusive Franchise. Each franchise granted in nonexclusive. The
city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional
franchises for a cable television system, or any component thereof, as it deems
appropriate, subject to applicable state and federal law. If an additional
franchise is proposed to be granted to a subsequent grantee, a notice public
hearing must first be held in accordance with the provisions of Government Code
Section 53066.3.
   (i)   Multiple Franchises.
      (1)   The city may grant any number of franchises, subject to applicable
state and federal law. The city may limit the number of franchises granted,
based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law
and specific local considerations, such as:
         (A)   The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple
cables in addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the existing utility
systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage;
         (B)   The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result of cable
system competition, such as lower rates and improved service;
         (C)   The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition,
such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents’ property, and the
disruption arising from numerous excavations within the public rights-of-way;
      (2)   The city may require that any new grantee be responsible for its
own underground trenching and the associated costs if, in the city’s opinion,
the rights-of-way in any particular area cannot reasonably accommodate
additional cables.

(Ord. 760 § 2 (part), 1998)
5.52.230 Agreement required.
   (a)   No video programming services may be provided in the city by an open
video system operator unless the operator and the city have executed a written
agreement setting forth the terms and conditions under which the operation of
the proposed open video system will be authorized by the city.
   (b)   The agreement between the city and the open video system operator may
contain terms and conditions that relate to the following subject matters, to
the extent that such terms, conditions, and subject matters are not preempted
by federal statute or regulations:
      (1)   The nature, scope and duration of the agreement, including
provisions for its renewal or extension;
      (2)   The obligation of the open video system operator to pay to the
city, at specified items, fees on the gross revenues received by the operator,
as authorized by 47 CFR § 76.1511, in accordance with the following standards
and procedures:
         (A)   The amount of the fees on the gross revenues will be five
percent, and will be paid in lieu of the franchise fees permitted under Section
622 of the Communications Act,
         (B)   The term “gross revenues” means: (i) all gross revenues received
by an open video system operator or its affiliates, including all revenues
received from subscribers and all carriage revenues received from unaffiliated
video programming providers, and (ii) all advertising revenues received by the
operator or its affiliates in connection with the provision of video
programming, where such revenues are included in the calculation of the cable
franchise fee paid to the city by the franchised cable operator. The term
“gross revenues” does not include revenues, such as subscriber or advertising
revenues, collected by unaffiliated video programming providers;
      (3)   The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with
requirements relating to information collection and recordkeeping, accounting
procedures, reporting, periodic audits, and inspection of records in order to
ensure the accuracy of the fees on the gross revenues that are required to be
paid as specified above in subsection (b)(2) of this section;
      (4)   The obligation of the open video system operator to meet the city’s
requirements with respect to public, educational, and governmental access
channel capacity, services, facilities and equipment, as provided for in 47 CFR
§ 76.1505. In this regard, the following standards and procedures are
applicable:
         (A)   The open video system operator is subject to the same public,
educational, and governmental access requirements that apply within the cable
television franchise service area with which its system overlaps,
         (B)   The open video system operator must ensure that all subscribers
receive all public, educational, and governmental access channels within the
franchise service area in which the city’s subscribers are located,
         (C)   The open video system operator may negotiate with the city to
establish the operator’s obligations with respect to pubic, educational, and
governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities and equipment. These
negotiations may include the city’s franchised cable operator if the city, the
open video system operator, and the franchised cable operator so desire,
         (D)   If the open video system operator and the city are unable to
reach an agreement regarding the operator’s obligations with respect to public,
educational, and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities and
equipment with the city’s jurisdiction, then the following obligations will be
imposed:
            (i)   The open video system operator must satisfy the same public,
educational, and governmental access obligations as the city’s franchised cable
operator by providing the same amount of channel capacity for public,
educational, and governmental access and by matching the city’s franchised
cable operator’s annual financial contributions in support of public,
educational, and governmental access services, facilities and equipment that
are actually used by the city. For in-kind contributions, such as cameras or
production studios, the open video system operator may satisfy its statutory
obligation by negotiating mutually agreeable terms with the city’s franchised
cable operator, so that public, educational, and governmental access services
to the city are improved or increased. If such terms cannot be agreed upon, the
open video system operator must pay to the city the monetary equivalent of the
franchised cable operator’s depreciated in-kind contribution, or, in the case
of facilities, the annual amortization value. Any matching contributions
provided by the open video system operator must be used to fund activities
arising under Section 611 of the Communications Act,
            (ii)   The city will impose upon the open video system operator the
same rules and procedures that it imposes upon the franchised cable operator
with regard to the open video system operator’s use of channel capacity
designated for public, educational, and governmental access use when that
capacity is not being used for such purposes,
         (E)   The city’s franchised cable operator is required under federal
law to permit the open video system operator to connect with its public,
educational, and governmental access channel feeds. The open video system
operator and the franchised cable operator may decide how to accomplish this
connection, taking into consideration the physical and technical
characteristics of the cable and the open video systems involved. If the
franchised cable operator and the open video system operator cannot agree on
how to accomplish the connection, the city has the right to decide. The city
may require that the connection occur on city-owned property or on public
rights-of-way,
         (F)   All costs of connection to the franchised cable operator’s
public, educational, and governmental access channel feed must be borne by the
open video system operator. These costs will be counted towards the open video
system operator’s matching financial contributions set forth above in
subsection (b)(4)(D)(i) of this section,
         (G)   The city will not impose upon the open video system operator any
public, educational, or governmental access obligations that are greater than
those imposed upon the franchised cable operator,
         (H)   If there is no existing franchised cable operator, the
provisions of 47 CFR § 76.1505(d)(6) will be applicable in determining the
obligations of the open video system operator,
         (I)   The open video system operator must adjust its system to comply
with new public, educational, and access obligations imposed on the city’s
franchised cable operator following a renewal of the cable television
franchise; provided, however, that the open video system operator will not be
required to displace other programmers using its open video system to
accommodate public, educational, and governmental access channels. The open
video system operator must comply with such new public, educational, and
governmental access obligations whenever additional capacity is or becomes
available, whether it is due to increased channel capacity or to decreased
demand for channel capacity;
      (5)   If the city and the open video system operator cannot agree as to
the application of the FCC’s rules regarding the open video system operator’s
obligations to provide public, educational, and governmental access under the
provisions of subsection (b)(4) of this section, then either party may file a
complaint with the FCC in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set
forth in 47 CFR § 76.1514. No agreement will be executed by the city until the
dispute has been finally resolved;
      (6)   If the open video system operator intends to maintain an
institutional network, as defined in Section 611(f) of the Communications Act,
the city will require that educational and governmental access channels be
designated on that institutional network to the same extent that those channels
are designated on the institutional network of the city’s franchised cable
operator;
      (7)   The authority of an open video system provider to exercise
editorial control over any public, educational, or governmental use of channel
capacity will be restricted in accordance with the provisions of 47 CFR §
76.1505(f);
      (8)   The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with all
applicable federal and state statutes and regulations relating to customer
service standards, including the Cable Television and Video Customer Service
and Information Act (Government Code Sections 53054, et seq.), and the Video
Customer Service Act (Government Code Sections 53088, et seq.);
      (9)   If a new physical plant is proposed to be constructed within the
city, the obligation of the open video system operator to comply with the
following rights-of-way use and management responsibilities that are also
imposed by the city upon other telecommunications service providers in a
nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner:
         (A)   Compliance with all applicable city building and zoning codes,
including applications for excavation, encroachment and construction permits
and the payment of all required permit and inspection fees,
         (B)   The coordination of construction requirements,
         (C)   Compliance with established standards and procedures for
constructing lines across private property,
         (D)   Compliance with all applicable insurance and indemnification
requirements,
         (E)   The repair and resurfacing of construction-damaged streets,
         (F)   Compliance with all public safety requirements that applicable
to telecommunications service providers using public property or public rights-
of-way;
      (10)   Acts or omissions constituting breaches or defaults of the
agreement, and the applicable penalties, liquidated damages, and other
remedies, including fines or the suspension, revocation or termination of the
agreement;
      (11)   Requirements relating to the sale, assignment or transfer of the
open video system;
      (12)   Requirements relating to the open video system operator’s
compliance with and implementation of state and federal laws, rules and
regulations pertaining to the operation of the open video system;
      (13)   Such additional requirements, conditions, terms, policies and
procedures as may be mutually agreed upon by the city and the open video system
operator and that will, in the judgment of the city council, best serve the
public interest and protect the public health, welfare and safety.
(Ord. 760 § 2 (part), 1998)
Article IV. Other Telecommunications Services and Systems
5.52.300 Other multichannel video programming distributors.
   The term “cable system,” as defined in federal law and as set forth in
Article V of this chapter, does not include a facility that serves subscribers
without using any public rights-of- way. Consequently, the categories of
multichannel video programming distributors identified below are not deemed to
be cable systems and are therefore exempt from the city’s franchise
requirements and from certain other local regulatory provisions authorized by
federal law, provided that their distribution or transmission facilities do not
involve the use of the city’s public rights-of-way:
   (a)   Multichannel multipoint distribution service (MMDS), also known as
“wireless cable,” which typically involves the transmission by an FCC-licensed
operator of numerous broadcast stations from a central location using line-of-
sight technology;
   (b)   Local multipoint distribution service (LMDS), another form of over-
the-air wireless video service for which licenses are auctioned by the FCC, and
which offers video programming, telephony, and data networking services;
   (c)   Direct broadcast satellite (DBS), also referred to as “direct-to-home
satellite services,” which involves the distribution or broadcasting of
programming or services by satellite directly to the subscriber’s premises
without the use of ground receiving or distribution equipment, except at the
subscriber’s premises or in the uplink process to the satellite. Local
regulation of direct-to-home satellite services is further proscribed by the
following federal statutory provisions:
      (1)   47 U.S.C. § 303(v) confers upon the FCC exclusive jurisdiction to
regulate the provision of direct-to-home satellite services,
      (2)   Section 602 of the Communications Act states that a provider of
direct-to-home satellite service is exempt from the collection or remittance,
or both, of any tax or fee imposed by any local taxing jurisdiction on direct-
to-home satellite service. The terms “tax” and “fee” are defined by federal
statute to mean any local sales tax, local use tax, local intangible tax, local
income tax, business license tax, utility tax, privilege tax, gross receipts
tax, excise tax, franchise fees, local telecommunications tax, or any other
tax, license or fee that is imposed for the privilege of doing business,
regulating, or raising revenue for a local taxing jurisdiction.
(Ord. 760 § 2 (part), 1998)
5.52.310 Video providers—Registration—Customer service standards.
   (a)   Unless the customer protection and customer service obligations of a
video provider, as that term is defined in Article V of this chapter, are
specified in a franchise, license, lease, or similar written agreement with the
city, a video provider must comply with all applicable provisions of the
following state statutes:
      (1)   The Cable Television and Video Customer Service and Information Act
(Government Code Sections 53054, et seq.);
      (2)   The Video Customer Service Act (Government Code Sections 53088, et
seq.)
   (b)   All video providers that are operating in the city on the effective
date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or that intend to operate in
the city after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter,
must register with the city. The registration form must include or be
accompanied by the following:
      (1)   The video provider’s name, address, and local telephone numbers;
      (2)   The names of the officers of the video provider;
      (3)   A copy of the video provider’s written policies and procedures
relating to customer service standards and the handling of customer complaints,
as required by Government Code Sections 53054, et seq. These customer service
standards must include, without limitation, standards regarding the following:
         (A)   Installation, disconnection, service and repair obligations,
employee identification, and service call response time and scheduling,
         (B)   Customer telephone and office hours,
         (C)   Procedures for billing, charges, refunds and credits,
         (D)   Procedures for termination of service,
         (E)   Notice of the deletion of a programming service, the changing of
channel assignments, or an increase in rates,
         (F)   Complaint procedures and procedures for bill dispute resolution,
         (G)   The video provider’s written commitment to distribute annually
to the city, and to its employees and customers, a notice describing the
customer service standards specified above in subsections (b)(3)(A) through (F)
of this section. This annual notice must include the report of the video
provider on its performance in meeting its customer service standards, as
required by Government Code § 53055.2;
      (4)   Unless a video provider is exempt under federal law from its
payment, a registration fee in an amount established by resolution of the city
council to cover the reasonable costs incurred by the city in reviewing and
processing the registration form;
      (5)   In addition to the registration fee specified above in subsection
(b)(4) of this section, the written commitment of the video provider to pay to
the city, when due, all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the city in
resolving any disputes between the video provider and its subscribers, which
dispute resolution is mandated by Government Code Section 53088.2(o)
   (c)   The city council may establish by ordinance a schedule of monetary
penalties for the material breach by a video provider of its obligations under
subparagraphs (a) through (n) of Government Code Section 53088.2. As used
herein, the term “material breach” means any substantial and repeated failure
to comply with the consumer service standards set forth in Government Code
Section 53088.2. The provisions of that ordinance must be consistent with the
provisions of Government Code Section 53088.2. The schedule of monetary
penalties may also impose a penalty, as authorized by Government Code Section
53056(a), for the failure of a video provider to distribute the annual notice
required by Government Code Section 53055.1, which penalty may not exceed five
hundred dollars for each year in which the notice is not distributed as
required by state statute.
(Ord. 760 § 2 (part), 1998)
5.52.320 Antennas for telecommunications services.
   Title 10 of this code sets forth the city’s regulatory requirements relating
to the siting of satellite earth station antennas, also referred to as
“satellite dish antennas,” which are parabolic or dish-shaped antennas or
devices that are designed for over-the-air reception of radio or television
broadcast signals, multichannel multipoint distribution service, or direct
broadcast satellite services.
(Ord. 760 § 2 (part), 1998)
5.52.330 Telecommunications service provided by telephone corporations.
   (a)   The city council finds and determines as follows:
      (1)   The federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempts and declares
invalid all state rules that restrict entry or limit competition in both local
and long-distance telephone service.
      (2)   The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is primarily
responsible for the implementation of local telephone competition, and it
issues certificates of public convenience and necessity to new entrants that
are qualified to provide competitive local telephone exchange services and
related telecommunications service, whether using their own facilities or the
facilities or services provided by other authorized telephone corporations.
      (3)   Section 234(a) of the California Public Utilities Code defines a
“telephone corporation” as “every corporation or person owning, controlling,
operating, or managing any telephone line for compensation within this state.”
      (4)   Section 616 of the California Public Utilities Code provides that a
telephone corporation “may condemn any property necessary for the construction
and maintenance of its telephone line.”
      (5)   Section 2902 of the California Public Utilities Code authorizes
municipal corporations to retain their powers of control to supervise and
regulate the relationships between a public utility and the general public in
matters affecting the health, convenience and safety of the general public,
including matters such as the use and repair of public streets by any public
utility and the location of the poles, wires, mains or conduits of any public
utility on, under or above any public streets.
      (6)   Section 7901 of the California Public Utilities Code authorizes
telephone and telegraph corporations to construct telephone or telegraph lines
along and upon any public road or highway, along or across any of the waters or
lands within this state, and to erect poles, posts, piers or abatements for
supporting the insulators, wires, and other necessary fixtures of their lines,
in such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the
road or highway or interrupt the navigation of the waters.
      (7)   Section 7901.1 of the California Public Utilities Code confirms the
right of municipalities to exercise reasonable control as to the time, place
and manner in which roads, highways and waterways are accessed, which control
must be applied to all entities in an equivalent manner, and may involve the
imposition of fees.
      (8)   Section 50030 of the California Government Code provides that any
permit fee imposed by a city for the placement, installation, repair or
upgrading of telecommunications facilities, such as lines, poles or antennas,
by a telephone corporation that has obtained all required authorizations from
the CPUC and the FCC to provide telecommunications services, must not exceed
the reasonable costs of providing the service for which the fee is charged, and
must not be levied for general revenue purposes.
   (b)   In recognition of and in compliance with the statutory authorizations
and requirements set forth above in subsection (a) of this section, the
following regulatory provisions are applicable to a telephone corporation that
desires to provide telecommunications service by means of facilities that are
proposed to be constructed within the city’s public rights-of-way:
      (1)   The telephone corporation must apply for and obtain, as may be
applicable, an excavation permit, an encroachment permit, or a building permit
(“ministerial permit”);
      (2)   In addition to the information required by this code in connection
with an application for a ministerial permit, a telephone corporation must
submit to the city the following supplemental information:
         (A)   A copy of the certificate of public convenience and necessity
issued by the CPUC to the applicant, and a copy of the CPUC decision that
authorizes the applicant to provide the telecommunications service for which
the facilities are proposed to be constructed in the city’s public rights-of-
way,
         (B)   If the applicant has obtained from the CPUC a certificate of
public convenience to operate as a competitive local carrier, the following
additional requirements are applicable:
            (i)   As required by Decision No. 95-12-057 of the CPUC, the
applicant must establish that it has timely filed with the city a quarterly
report that describes the type of construction and the location of each
construction project proposed to be undertaken in the city during the calendar
quarter in which the application is filed, which information is sufficient to
enable the city to coordinate multiple projects, as may be necessary,
            (ii)   If the applicant’s proposed construction project will extend
beyond the utility rights-of- way into undisturbed areas or other rights-of-
way, the applicant must establish that is has filed a petition with the CPUC to
amend its certificate of public convenience and necessity and that the proposed
construction project has been subjected to a full-scale environmental analysis
by the CPUC, as required by Decision No. 95-12-057 of the CPUC,
            (iii)   The applicant must inform the city whether its proposed
construction project will be subject to any of the mitigation measures
specified in the negative declaration [“Competitive Local Carriers” (CLCs)
Projects for Local Exchange Communication Service throughout California”] or to
the mitigation monitoring plan adopted in connection with Decision No. 95- 12-
057 of the CPUC. The city’s issuance of a ministerial permit will be
conditioned upon the applicant’s compliance with all applicable mitigation
measures and monitoring requirements imposed by the CPUC upon telephone
corporations that are designated as competitive local carriers.
   (c)   In recognition of the fact that numerous excavations in the public
rights-of-way diminish the useful life of the surface pavement, and for the
purpose of mitigating the adverse impacts of numerous excavations on the
quality and longevity of public street maintenance within the city, the
following policies and procedures are adopted:
      (1)   The city manager is directed to ensure that all public utilities,
including telephone corporations, comply with all local design, construction,
maintenance and safety standards that are contained within, or are related to,
a ministerial permit that authorizes the construction of facilities within the
public rights-of-way;
      (2)   The city manager is directed to coordinate the construction and
installation of facilities by public utilities, including telephone
corporations, in order to minimize the number of excavations in the public
rights-of-way. In this regard, based upon projected plans for street
construction or renovation projects, the city manager is authorized to
establish on a quarterly basis one or more construction time periods or
“windows” for the installation of facilities within the public rights-of-way.
Telephone corporations and other public utilities that submit applications for
ministerial permits to construct facilities after a predetermined date may be
required to delay such construction until the next quarterly “window” that is
established by the city.

5.54.010 Purpose.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive set of
regulations applicable to newsracks on the public streets, sidewalks and other
public property. The purpose of this chapter is to advance and improve safety
and aesthetics by controlling the number, size, construction, placement and
appearance of newsracks without restricting the free dispersal of information
guaranteed by the constitutions of the United States and the state of
California.
   More specifically, the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public
peace, morals, health, safety and general welfare by regulating the placement,
appearance, servicing and insuring of newsracks so as to protect against the
dangers of impairing or distracting the vision of motorists and pedestrians;
the hazards of unreasonably interfering with or impeding the flow of pedestrian
or vehicular traffic, including ingress into or egress from any residence or
place of business, or from the street to the sidewalk by persons exiting or
entering parked or standing vehicles; unreasonably interfering with the use of
public property for its intended purpose; unduly restricting access to the use
of poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes or locations
used for transportation purposes; unsightly structures inconsistent with the
intent and purpose of the city’s design regulations; neglectful servicing of
newsracks resulting in visual blight on public rights-of-way and other public
property and detracting from the aesthetics of store window displays, adjacent
landscaping and other improvements; reduction in value of surrounding property;
unnecessary exposure of the city to personal injury or property damage claims
or suits; and public display of harmful or offensive matters. The city council
finds and determines that the strong and competing interests of the public and
of newspapers and other similar materials require a reasonable accommodation
which can only be satisfactorily achieved through the means of this chapter
which is designed to accommodate such interests by regulating the time, place
and manner of using newsracks. It is not the intent of this chapter to in any
way discriminate against, regulate or interfere with the publication,
circulation, distribution or dissemination of any publications.
(Ord. 789 § 4 (part), 1999)
5.54.020 Definitions.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have
the meanings as ascribed to them by this section:
   “Director” means the director of community development or his or her
designee.
   “Newsrack” means any self-service or coin-operated box, container, storage
unit, or other dispenser installed, used or maintained for the display or sale
of any written or printed material, including, but not limited to, newspapers,
news periodicals, magazines, books, pictures, photographs and records.
   “Person” means any individual, company, corporation, association, business
or other legal entity.
   “Sidewalk” means and includes that portion of a street other than a roadway,
set apart by curbs, barriers, markings or other delineation for pedestrian
travel, other than crosswalks.
   “Streets,” as used herein, means and includes roads, streets, highways and
alleys publicly maintained and open to the use of the public and privately
owned and maintained roads and streets generally held open to the public use.
(Ord. 789 § 4 (part), 1999)
5.54.030 Permit required.
   No person shall place, affix, erect, construct, or maintain a newsrack on
any sidewalk without a permit issued under the provisions of
Chapter 5.08 of this title. If any of the provisions of
Chapter 5.08 of this title conflict with the provisions of this chapter, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail as to all matters and questions
arising out of the subject matter of this chapter.
(Ord. 789 § 4 (part), 1999)
5.54.040 Additional information required for application.
   In addition to the information required in Section
5.08.030(a) of this title, an applicant for a newsrack permit shall furnish the
following information:
   (a)   The name, address and telephone number of a responsible person whom
the city may notify or contact at any time concerning the applicant’s newsrack
(s)
   (b)   The number of newsracks and the exact proposed location of each; and
   (c)   The names of the newspapers or periodicals to be contained in each
newsrack.
(Ord. 789 § 4 (part), 1999)
5.54.050 Insurance.
   (a)   Unless a time extension is granted in writing by the director, within
five business days of approval of the permit, the permittee must file with the
director an insurance certificate establishing that the applicant has in force
public liability and property damage insurance in the amount of one million
dollars to indemnify the city against any personal injury, death, loss or
damage resulting from the permittee’s activities. The city and its officers,
employees and agents shall be named as additional insureds. The policy must
include a statement by the insurance carrier that thirty days advance written
notice will be given to the city before any cancellation or modification of
coverage. The permittee must maintain such insurance for as long as the
permittee maintains a newsrack on a city sidewalk. The applicant shall also
execute a hold harmless agreement as provided by the city prior to the issuance
of any permit.
   (b)   Upon a showing that the insurance requirements are so financially
burdensome that they would constitute an unreasonable burden on First Amendment
rights by virtue of the financial circumstances of the applicant, the director
may waive or decrease that requirement, as necessary.
(Ord. 789 § 4 (part), 1999)
5.54.060 Additional criteria for denial.
   The director shall grant the permit if he or she finds that there is no
reason to deny the permit under Section
5.08.060(a) of this title, unless there is a finding that:
   (a)   The newsrack fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter;
   (b)   The proposed location of the newsrack creates a substantial
obstruction or hazard to vehicular or pedestrian traffic; or
   (c)   The proposed location of the newsrack is within one hundred eight
inches of a location where six newsracks are already in place on a block and
approval would violate Section
5.54.090 of this chapter. In such event the applicant, upon request, may be
placed on a waiting list. When the proposed location becomes available due to a
reduction in the number of newsracks, the applicant will be notified according
to its placement on the waiting list and a new application may be submitted at
that time.
(Ord. 789 § 4 (part), 1999)
5.54.070 Denial.
   If a permit is denied, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the
specific basis of such denial by the director.
(Ord. 789 § 4 (part), 1999)
5.54.080 Appeal procedure.
   Any final decision of the director may be appealed to the city manager by
the applicant. The appeal shall be made in writing, shall be filed within five
business days after mailing or personal delivery of a notice of denial or
revocation, and shall set forth the specific grounds for the appeal. The city
manager, or the city manager’s designee, shall hear the aggrieved person or
designated representative, receive relevant information and documents, and act
on the appeal within three business days of receiving the appeal. The city
manager’s decision shall be final.

and/or the operation of any medical marijuana cooperative or collective.

under penalty of perjury, shall contain such information as is requested by the
city, and shall comply with the following requirements:
      (1)   The applicant for medical marijuana cooperative or collective shall

      (2)   The application shall include a complete description of the type,
nature and extent of the enterprise to be conducted and for which application
is made, with evidence that the enterprises is either a "cooperative" or
"collective", as set forth in the guidelines. The requirements, standards and
criteria of the guidelines are as follows:
         (A)   Statutory cooperatives: A cooperative must file articles of
incorporation with the state and conduct its business for the mutual benefit of
its members. (Corporations Code §§ 12201, 12300.) No business may call itself a
"cooperative" (or "co-op") unless it is properly organized and registered as
such a corporation under the Corporations or Food and Agricultural Code. (Id.
at § 12311(b).) Cooperative corporations are "democratically controlled and are
not organized to make a profit for themselves, as such, or for their members,
as such, but primarily for their members as patrons." (Id. at § 12201.) The
earnings and savings of the business must be used for the general welfare of
its members or equitably distributed to members in the form of cash, property,
credits, or services. (Id.) Cooperatives must follow strict rules on
organization, articles, elections and distribution of earnings, and must report
individual transactions from individual members each year. (Id. at §12200 et
seq.) Agricultural cooperatives are likewise nonprofit corporate entities
"since they are not organized to make profit for themselves, as such, or for
their members, as such, but only for their members as producers." (Food and
Agricultural Code § 54033.) Agricultural cooperatives share many
characteristics with consumer cooperatives. (See, e.g. Id. at § 54002 et seq.)
Cooperatives should not purchase marijuana from, or sell to, non-members;
instead, they should only provide a means for facilitating or coordinating
transactions between members.
         (B)   Collectives: California law does not define collectives, but the
dictionary defines them as "a business, farm, etc., jointly owned and operated
by the members of a group." (Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House,
Inc.© 2006.) Applying this definition, a collective should be an organization
that merely facilitates the collaborative efforts of patient and caregiver
members - including the allocation of costs and revenues. As such, a collective
is not a statutory entity, but as a practical matter it might have to organize
as some form of business to carry out its activities. The collective should not
purchase marijuana, but should facilitate or coordinate transactions between
members.
      (3)   The address of the location from which the cooperative or
collective will be operated, and a copy of a lease signed by the owner or duly
authorized agent of the property, authorizing allowing the applicant to occupy
the property as a medical marijuana collective or cooperative. The property
owner must authorize the application for a medical marijuana collective or

welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or

manner on private property in connection with the business of a licensed
dismantler, licensed vehicle dealer, a junk dealer, or when such storage or
parking is necessary to the operation of a lawfully conducted business or
commercial enterprise.

officer—Procedures.
   The processing agency may review appeals or other objections to a parking

citation, an operator may request initial review by the processing agency. The
request for initial review may be made in writing, by telephone or in person.

   In order to contest the parking citation, the operator must deposit with the
processing agency the full amount of the parking penalty on or before the
fifteenth day following the mailing to that operator of the results of the
processing agency’s initial review. At the same time, the operator must provide
a written explanation of the reason or reasons for contesting the parking
citation on a form provided by the processing agency. If the operator is unable
to deposit the full amount of the parking penalty, the operator must provide
verifiable and substantial proof of an inability to deposit the parking
penalty. Upon presentation of such proof, the processing agency shall proceed
with the contest procedure despite the operator’s failure to deposit the full
amount of the parking penalty. If it is ultimately determined that the operator
is not liable for the parking violation, then the full amount of the parking
penalty deposited shall be refunded.

declaration, on forms provided by the processing agency, or by personal
appearance before a hearing examiner.
   (d)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, if
the vehicle has been immobilized or impounded for unpaid parking citations, the

the parking citations upon which the seizure was based, without requiring a
deposit of the parking penalty, provided that the vehicle remains under the
control of the immobilizing or impounding agency.

a procedure for contesting parking citations and notices of delinquent parking
violations.
(Ord. 700 § 2 (part), 1993)

   Parking citations shall be issued in accordance with the following
procedures:
   (a)   If a vehicle is unattended at the time that the parking citation is
issued for a parking violation, the issuing officer shall securely attach to
the vehicle the parking citation setting forth the violation, including
reference to the section of the California Vehicle Code, this code, or other
parking regulation violated; the approximate time of the violation; the
location of the violation, and the date by which the operator is to deposit the
parking penalty or contest the parking citation pursuant to Section
6.66.130. The citation shall state the amount of the parking penalty and the
address of the agent authorized to receive deposit of the parking penalty.
   The parking citation shall also set forth the vehicle license number and
registration expiration date, if such date is visible; the last four digits of
the vehicle identification number, if that number is visible through the
windshield; the color of the vehicle; and, if discernable, the make of the
vehicle.
   (b)   The parking citation, or copy thereof, shall be considered a record
kept in the ordinary course of business of the issuing agency and the
processing agency, and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained
therein.
   (c)   Once the parking citation is prepared and attached to the vehicle
pursuant to subsection (a) above, the issuing officer shall file notice of the
parking violation with the processing agency.
   (d)   If during issuance of the parking citation, without regard to whether
the vehicle was initially attended or unattended, the vehicle is driven away
prior to attaching the parking citation to the vehicle, the issuing officer
shall file the notice with the processing agency. The processing agency shall
mail, within fifteen days of issuance of the parking citation, a copy of the
parking citation to the registered owner.
   (e)   If after a copy of the parking citation is attached to the vehicle, or
personally given to the operator, the issuing agency or the issuing officer
determines that the issuing officer was in error in issuing the parking
citation, the issuing officer or the issuing agency may recommend, in writing,
that the parking citation be canceled. The recommendation shall state the
reason or reasons for cancellation and shall be filed with the processing
agency.
   Under no circumstance shall a personal relationship with any public
official, officer, issuing officer, or law enforcement agency be grounds for
cancellation.
   (f)   If a processing agency makes a finding that there are grounds for
cancellation as set forth in the City’s administrative policy, or pursuant to
any other basis provided by law, then the finding or findings shall be filed
with the processing agency, and the parking citation shall be canceled pursuant
to Section

notice of delinquent parking violation or completes and files an affidavit of
nonliability that complies with Section
6.66.110 or Section
6.66.120, the vehicle registration shall not be renewed until the parking
penalties have been paid. In addition, the notice of delinquent parking
violation shall contain, or be accompanied by, an affidavit of nonliability and
information concerning what constitutes nonliability, information as to the
effect of executing an affidavit, and instructions for returning the affidavit

(Ord. 700 § 2 (part), 1993)
6.66.100 Copy of citation upon request by registered owner.
   (a)    Within fifteen days of request, made by mail or in person, the
processing agency shall mail or otherwise provide to the registered owner, or
the registered owner’s agent, who has received a notice of delinquent parking
violation, a copy of the original parking citation. The issuing agency may
charge a fee sufficient to cover the actual cost of copying and/or locating the
original parking citation, not to exceed two dollars. Until the issuing or
processing agency complies with a request to provide a copy of the parking
citation, the processing agency may not proceed to immobilize the vehicle in
question merely because the registered owner has received five or more
outstanding parking violations over a period of five or more days.
   (b)   If the description of the vehicle on the parking citation does not
substantially match the corresponding information on the registration card for
that vehicle the processing agency shall, on written request of the operator,
cancel the notice of parking violation.
(Ord. 700 § 2 (part), 1993)
6.66.110 Affidavit of nonliability—Leased or rented vehicle.
   A registered owner shall be released from liability for a parking citation
if the registered owner files with the processing agency an affidavit of
nonliability in a form satisfactory to the processing agency and such form is
returned within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of delinquent
parking violation together with proof of a written lease or rental agreement
between a bona fide rental or leasing company and its customer which identifies
the renter or lessee and provides the operator’s driver’s license number, name
and address. The processing agency shall serve or mail to the renter or lessee
identified in the affidavit of nonliability a notice of delinquent parking
violation. The processing agency shall inform the renter or lessee that he or
she must pay the full amount of the fine, or provide notice to the processing
agency that he or she intends to contest the parking citation pursuant to
Section
6.66.130 within fifteen days of the mailing of the notice of delinquent parking
violation. If the processing agency does not receive payment of the parking
citation or does not receive notice of an intent to contest within fifteen

(Ord. 700 § 2 (part), 1993)
6.66.120 Affidavit of nonliability—Sale.
   (a)   A registered owner of a vehicle shall be released from liability for a
parking citation issued to that vehicle if the registered owner served with a
notice of delinquent parking violation files with the processing agency, within
thirty days of receipt of the notice of delinquent parking violation, an
affidavit of nonliability together with proof that the registered owner served
with a notice of delinquent parking violation has made a bona fide sale or
transfer of the vehicle and has delivered possession thereof to the purchaser
prior to the date of the alleged violation. The processing agency shall obtain
verification from the Department that the former owner has complied with the
requirements necessary to release the former owner from liability pursuant to
California Vehicle Code Section 5602 or the successor statute thereto.
   (b)   If the registered owner has complied with California Vehicle Code
Section 5602, or the successor statute thereto, the processing agency shall
cancel the notice of delinquent parking violation with respect to the
registered owner.
   (c)   If the registered owner has not complied with the requirements
necessary to release the owner from liability pursuant to California Vehicle
Code Section 5602, or the successor statute thereto, the processing agency

(Ord. 700 § 2 (part), 1993)
6.66.130 Contesting parking citation—Procedure.
   (a)   If an operator or registered owner contests a parking citation or a
notice of delinquent parking violation, the processing agency shall do all of
the following:
      (1)   First, either investigate with its own records and staff or request
that the issuing agency investigate the circumstances of the citation with
respect to the contestant’s written explanation of the reason or reasons for
contesting the parking citation.
   If, based on the results of that investigation, the processing agency is
satisfied that the violation did not occur, or the registered owner was not
responsible for the violation by virtue of having sold, rented or leased the
vehicle, or because legally supportable or mitigating circumstances as set
forth in the City’s administrative policy warrant a dismissal, the processing
agency shall cancel the parking citation, and make an adequate record of the
reason or reasons for canceling the parking citation. The processing agency
shall mail the results of the investigation by first class mail to the
contestant within ten days of the decision.
      (2)   If the contestant is not satisfied with the results of the
investigation provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the contestant
may, within fifteen days of the mailing of the results of the initial
investigation, deposit the amount of the parking penalty or provide proof of an
inability to deposit the parking penalty, and request an administrative
hearing.
      (3)   If the contestant prevails at the administrative hearing, then the
full amount of the parking penalty deposited shall be refunded.
   (b)   The administrative hearing procedure shall consist of the following:
      (1)   The contestant shall make a written request for administrative
hearing on a form and in a manner satisfactory to the processing agency, and
may request to contest the parking citation either in person or by written
declaration;
      (2)   If the contestant is a minor, that person shall be permitted to
appear at a hearing or admit responsibility for a parking citation without the
necessity of the appointment of a guardian. The processing agency may proceed
against the minor in the same manner as if the minor were an adult;
      (3)   The administrative hearing shall be conducted before an examiner
designated to conduct the hearing by the city council or by the processing
agency.
   (c)   The issuing officer shall not be required to participate in an
administrative hearing. The issuing agency shall not be required to produce any
evidence other than the parking citation or copy thereof, and information
received from the Department identifying the registered owner of the vehicle.
   This documentation in proper form shall be considered prima facie evidence
of the violation.
   (d)   The processing agency’s final decision shall be in writing and
delivered personally to the contestant or the contestant’s agent, or delivered
by first class mail within ten (10) working days following the hearing.
   (e)   If the contestant is not the registered owner of the vehicle, all
notices to the contestant required under this section shall also be given to
the registered owner by first class mail.
(Ord. 700 § 2 (part), 1993)
6.66.140 Collection of unpaid parking penalties.
   Except as otherwise provided below, the processing agency shall proceed
under subsections (a) or (b), but not both, in order to collect an unpaid
parking penalty:
   (a)   File an itemization of unpaid parking penalties and other related fees
with the Department for collection pursuant to the California Vehicle Code
Section 4760 or the successor statute thereto.
   (b)   If more than four hundred dollars in unpaid parking penalties and
other related fees have been accrued by any one registered owner or the
registered owner’s renter, lessee or sales transferee, proof thereof may be
filed with the court which has the same effect as a civil judgment. Execution
may be levied and such other measures may be taken for the collection of the
judgment as are authorized for the collection of unpaid civil judgments entered
against a defendant in an action against a debtor.
   The processing agency shall send notice by first class mail to the
registered owner or renter, lessee, or sales transferee indicating that a civil
judgment has been filed and the date that the judgment shall become effective.
The notice shall also indicate the time: that execution may be levied against
that person’s assets, that liens may be placed against that person’s property,
that the person’s wages may be garnished, and that other steps may be taken to
satisfy the judgment. The notice shall also state that the processing agency
will terminate the commencement of a civil judgment proceeding if all parking
penalties and other related fees are paid prior to the date set for hearing. If
judgment is entered, then the city may file a writ of execution or an abstract
with the court clerk’s office identifying the means by which the civil judgment
is to be satisfied.
   If a judgment is rendered for the processing agency, that agency may
contract with a collection agency licensed pursuant to Chapter 8 (commencing
with Section 6850) of Division 3 of the California Business and Professions
Code, or the successor statutes thereto, to collect the judgment.
   The processing agency shall pay the established first paper civil filing fee
at the time an entry of civil judgment is requested.
   (c)   If the registration of the vehicle has not been renewed for sixty days
beyond the renewal date, and the citation has not been collected by the
Department pursuant to the California Vehicle Code Section 4760, or the
successor statute thereto, then the processing agency may file proof of unpaid
penalties and fees with the court which has the same effect as a civil judgment
as provided above in subsection (b)
   (d)   The processing agency shall not file a civil judgment with the court
relating to a parking citation filed with the Department unless the processing
agency has determined that the registration of the vehicle has not been renewed
for sixty days beyond the renewal date and the citation has not been collected
by the Department pursuant to the California Vehicle Code Section 4760 or the
successor statute thereto.
(Ord. 700 § 2 (part), 1993)
6.66.150 Obligation of processing agency once parking penalty paid.
   (a)   If the operator or registered owner served with notice of delinquent
parking violation, or any other person who presents the parking citation or
notice of delinquent parking violation, deposits the penalty with the person
authorized to receive it, the processing agency shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Upon request, provide the operator, registered owner, or the
registered owner’s agent with a copy of the citation information presented in
the notice of delinquent parking violation. The processing agency shall, in
turn, obtain and record in its records the name, address and driver’s license
number of the person actually given the copy of the citation information;
      (2)   Determine whether the notice of delinquent parking violation has
been filed with Department or a civil judgment has been entered pursuant to
Section
6.66.140.
   (b)   If the processing agency receives full payment of all parking
penalties and other related fees and the processing agency has neither filed a
notice of delinquent parking violation nor entered a civil judgment, then all
proceedings for that citation shall cease.
   (c)   If the notice of delinquent parking violation has been filed with the
Department and has been returned by the Department pursuant to the provisions
of the California Vehicle Code and payment of the parking penalty has been
made, along with any other related fees, then the proceedings for that citation
shall cease.
   (d)   If the notice of delinquent parking violation has been filed with the
Department and has not been returned by the Department, and payment of the
parking penalty along with any other fees applied by either the Department or
the processing agency or both have been made, the processing agency shall do
all of the following:
      (1)   Deliver a certificate of payment to the operator, or other person
making payment;
      (2)   Within five working days transmit payment information to the
Department in the manner prescribed by the Department;
      (3)   Terminate proceedings on the notice of delinquent parking
violation;
      (4)   Deposit all parking penalties and other fees as required by law.

6.66.160 Deposit of parking penalties with the city.
   (a)   All parking penalties collected, including process service fees and
costs related to civil debt collection, shall be deposited to the account of
the processing agency, and then remitted to the city, if the city is not also
the processing agency.
   (b)   If the city is not the processing agency, then the city shall enter
into an agreement with the processing agency for periodic transfer of parking
citation receipts, along with a report setting forth the number of cases
processed and the sums received.
(Ord. 700 § 2 (part), 1993)
6.66.170 Filing of annual reports.
   The processing agency shall prepare an audited report at the end of each
fiscal year setting forth the number of cases processed, and all sums received

the city or its authorized issuing agency or the State Controller. The report
is a public record and shall be delivered to the city and its authorized
issuing agency.

being served.
   (b)   In the event any person owning, operating, leasing, occupying or
renting the property does not comply with the provisions of subparagraph (a) of
this section within the time provided for in the resolution enacted pursuant to
Section

(Ord. 303 § 1 (part); November 26, 1968)
8.40.110 Alternative to Section
8.40.100.
   The city council may, at its discretion, adopt the following procedure in
lieu of Section
8.40.100:
   (a)   Every person owning, operating, leasing, occupying or renting a
building or structure within a district shall construct and provide that
portion of the service connection on his property between the facilities
referred to in Section
8.40.090 and the termination facility on or within the building or structure
being served. If the above is not accomplished by any person within the time
provided for in the resolution enacted pursuant to Section
8.40.040 hereof, the city engineer shall give notice in writing to the person
in possession of such premises, and a notice in writing to the owner thereof as
shown on the last equalized assessment roll, to provide the required
underground facilities within ten days after receipt of the notice.
   (b)   The notice to provide the required underground facilities may be given
either by personal service or by mail. In case of service by mail on either of
such persons, the notice must be deposited in the United States mail in a
sealed envelope with postage prepaid, addressed to the person in possession of
such premises at such premises, and the notice must be addressed to the owner
thereof as the owner’s name appears, and must be addressed to the owner’s last
known address as the same appears on the last equalized assessment roll, and
when no address appears, to General Delivery, City of La Puente. If notice is
given by mail the notice shall be deemed to have been received by the person to
whom it has been sent within forty-eight hours after the mailing thereof. If
notice is given by mail to either the owner or occupant of such premises, the
city engineer shall, within forty-eight hours after the mailing thereof, cause
a copy thereof, printed on a card not less than eight inches by ten inches in
size, to be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.
   (c)   The notice given by the city engineer to provide the required
underground facilities shall particularly specify what work is required to be
done, and shall state that if the work is not completed within thirty days
after receipt of the notice, the city engineer will provide the required
underground facilities, in which case the cost and expense thereof will be
assessed against the property benefited and become a lien upon the property.
   (d)   If upon the expiration of the thirty day period, the required
underground facilities have not been provided, the city engineer shall
forthwith proceed to do the work; provided, however, if the premises are
unoccupied and no electric or communications services are being furnished
thereto, the city engineer shall, in lieu of providing the required underground
facilities, have the authority to order the disconnection and removal of any
and all overhead service wires and associated facilities supplying utility
service to the property. Upon completion of the work by the city engineer, he
shall file a written report with the city council setting forth the fact that
the required underground facilities have been provided and the cost thereof,
together with a legal description of the property against which the cost is to
be assessed. The council shall thereupon fix a time and place for hearing
protests against the assessment of the cost of such work upon the premises,
which time shall not be less than ten days thereafter.
   (e)   The city engineer shall forthwith, upon the time for hearing such
protests having been fixed, give a notice in writing thereof to the owner
thereof, in the manner hereinabove provided for the giving of the notice to
provide the required underground facilities, of the time and place that the
council will pass upon such report and will hear protests against such
assessment. The notice shall also set forth the amount of the proposed
assessment.
   (f)   Upon the date and hour set for the hearing of protests, the council
shall hear and consider the report and all protests, if there be any, and then
proceed to affirm, modify or reject the assessment.
   (g)   If any assessment is not paid within five days after its confirmation
by the council, the amount of the assessment shall become a lien upon the
property against which the assessment is made by the city engineer, and the
city engineer is directed to turn over to the assessor and tax collector a
notice of lien on each of the properties on which the assessment has not been
paid, and the assessor and tax collector shall add the amount of the assessment
to the next regular bill for taxes levied against the premises upon which the
assessment was not paid. The assessment shall be due and payable at the same
time as the property taxes are due and payable, and if not paid when due and
payable, shall bear interest at the rate of six percent per year.
(Ord. 303 § 1 (part); November 26, 1968)
8.40.120 Responsibility of city.
   The city shall remove at its own expense all city-owned equipment from all
poles required to be removed hereunder in ample time to enable the owner or
user of the poles to remove the same within the time specified in the
resolution enacted pursuant to Section
8.40.040.
(Ord. 303 § 1 (part); November 26, 1968)
8.40.130 Extension of time.
   In the event that any act required by this chapter or by a resolution
adopted pursuant to Section
8.40.040 cannot be performed within the time provided on account of shortage of
materials, war, restraint by public authorities, strikes, labor disturbances,
civil disobedience, or any other circumstances beyond the control of the actor,
then the time within which the act will be accomplished shall be extended for a
period equivalent to the time of the limitation.

8.50.010   Purpose.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote and encourage the use of electric
vehicles by creating an expedited, streamlined permitting process for electric
vehicle charging stations while promoting public health and safety and
preventing specific, adverse impacts in the installation and use of such
charging stations. This chapter is also intended to comply with California
Government Code Section 65850.7.
(Ord. 983 § 2 (part), 2023)
8.50.020   Definitions.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the words, terms and phrases as defined in
this section shall be construed as hereinafter set forth, unless it is apparent
from the context that a different meaning is intended:
   "Charging station", "charging system", or "electric vehicle charging
station" means any level of an electric vehicle supply equipment station that
is designed and built in compliance with Article 625 of the California
Electrical Code, as it reads on the effective date of this chapter, and
delivers electricity from a source outside an electric vehicle into a plug-in
electric vehicle.
   "Electronic submittal" means the utilization of one or more of the
following:
      (1)   Electronic mail or email.
      (2)   Facsimile.

   "Specific, adverse impact" means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and
unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, and written public health
or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the
application was deemed complete.
(Ord. 983 § 2 (part), 2023)
8.50.030   Expedited permitting process.
   Consistent with Government Code Section 65850.7, the building official shall
implement an expedited, streamlined permitting process for electric vehicle
charging stations, and adopt a checklist of all requirements with which
electric vehicle charging stations shall comply in order to be eligible for the
expedited review. The city's adopted checklist shall be published on the city's
website.
(Ord. 983 § 2 (part), 2023)
8.50.040   Permit application process.
   (a)   A permit application that satisfies the information requirements in
the city's adopted checklist shall be deemed complete and be promptly
processed. Upon confirmation by the building official, or his/her designee,
that the permit application and supporting documents meets the requirements of
the city adopted checklist, and is consistent with all applicable laws and
health and safety standards, the building official shall, consistent with
Government Code Section 65850.7, administratively approve the application and
issue all necessary permits.
   (b)   If the building official determines that the permit application is
incomplete, a written correction notice shall be issued to the applicant within
five business days for projects with up to twenty-five charging stations at a
single site or within ten business days for projects with twenty-six or more
charging stations at a single site. The written correction notice shall detail
all deficiencies in the application and any additional information required to
be eligible for expedited permit issuance. This correction notice may be in the
form of a printed document, electronic mail, or "red line" corrections on the
submitted plans.
   (c)   Consistent with Government Code Section 65850.7, the building official
shall allow for electronic submittal of permit applications covered by this
chapter and associated supporting documentation. In accepting such permit
applications, the building official shall also accept electronic signatures on
all forms, applications, and other documentation in lieu of a wet signature by
any applicant, provided that the city has the software necessary to accept
electronic signatures.
   (d)   In conjunction with the application process, the applicant shall
verify that the installation of an electric vehicle charging station will not
have a specific, adverse impact to public health and safety or building
occupants. Verification by the applicant includes but is not limited to the
following documentation: electrical system capacity and loads; electrical
system wiring, bonding and overcurrent protection; building infrastructure
affected by charging station equipment and associated conduits; areas of
charging station equipment and vehicle parking.
   (e)   In the technical review of a charging station, consistent with
Government Code Section 65850.7, the building official shall not condition the
approval for any electric vehicle charging station permit on the approval of
such a system by an association of a common interest development, as that term
is defined by Civil Code Section 4080.
   (f)   Approval of the expedited permit does not authorize an applicant to
energize or utilize the electric vehicle charging station until the required
inspection and approval to energize the system is granted by the City. The
inspection shall be performed in a timely manner and include consolidated
inspections, if required.
(Ord. 983 § 2 (part), 2023)
8.50.050   Technical review.
   It is the intent of this chapter to encourage the installation of electric
vehicle charging stations by removing obstacles to permitting for charging
stations so long as the action does not supersede the building official's
authority to address higher priority life-safety situations. If the building
official makes a finding based on substantial evidence that the electric
vehicle charging station could have a specific, adverse impact upon the public
health or safety, as defined in this chapter, the city may require the
applicant to apply for a site plan and design review subject to a minor review
and consideration by the development services director pursuant to
Chapter 10.94 of the Zoning Code.
(Ord. 983 § 2 (part), 2023)
8.50.060   Electric vehicle charging station installation requirements.
   (a)   Electric vehicle charging stations and associated equipment shall meet
all applicable health and safety standards and requirements, including but not
limited to any requirements imposed by the state and the La Puente Municipal
Code, the Los Angeles County fire department, the California Electrical Code,
the Society of Automotive Engineers, the National Electrical Manufacturers
Association, and accredited testing laboratories such as Underwriters
Laboratories, rules of the Public Utilities Commission or an electric utility
company regarding safety and reliability, and any applicable federal laws
including the Americans with Disabilities Act.
   (b)   Installation of electric vehicle charging stations and associated
wiring, bonding, disconnecting means, and overcurrent protective devices shall
meet the requirements of Article 625 and all applicable provisions of the
California Electrical Code.
   (c)   Installation of electric vehicle charging stations shall be
incorporated into the load calculations of all new or existing electrical
services and shall meet the requirements of the California Electrical Code.
Electric vehicle charging equipment shall be considered a continuous load.
   (d)   Anchorage of either floor-mounted or wall-mounted electric vehicle
charging stations shall meet the requirements of the California Building or
Residential Code as applicable per occupancy, and the provisions of the
manufacturer's installation instructions. Mounting of charging stations shall
not adversely affect building elements.

Code.” (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.02.020   Purpose and Authority.
   A.   Purpose. This Zoning Code is established to regulate the use of land

its residents and businesses through classifying, designating, regulating, and
restricting the use of land, buildings, and structures.

provisions shall apply, except as the same may be superseded by resolution or
ordinance. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.02.040   Relationship to General Plan.
   This Zoning Code provides the legislative framework to enhance and implement
the goals, policies, plans, principles, and standards of the City of La Puente
General Plan. This Zoning Code is the primary regulatory document used by the

the provisions of this Zoning Code unless otherwise stated in the specific
plan. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.02.080   Prior Rights and Violations.

ordinance repealed by this Zoning Code shall be continued, but in the future,
to the extent permitted by law, such rights shall be exercised in accordance

   B.   Nothing in this Title shall be interpreted to authorize the use of a
lot or parcel in any way that is in violation of any other applicable statute,
code, or regulation.
   C.   The provisions of this Zoning Code are not intended to abrogate any

10.02.100   Exemptions for City Projects.
   Except as otherwise required by law, any activities, developments, and/or
projects of or initiated by the City shall be exempt from the requirements of
this Zoning Code. However, the City will strive to meet the requirements to the
maximum extent practical based on individual circumstances.
(Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.02.110   Severability, Partial Invalidation of Zoning Code.
   If any section, subsection, clause, or phrase of this Zoning Code is for any
reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity or

remaining portions of the Zoning Code, it being expressly declared that this

The Director may at his or her discretion refer the determination to the
Commission.
      2.   In making a determination that a proposed use is or is not similar
to those listed, the Director or Commission shall consider:
         a.   Whether the characteristics of, and activities associated with,
the proposed use are equivalent to those of one or more of the uses listed in
the zone as allowable, and will not involve a greater level of activity,
population density, intensity, traffic generation, parking, dust, or noise than
the uses listed in the zone;
         b.   The purposes of the applicable zone and/or specific plan; and
         c.   The goals and policies of the General Plan.

   The boundaries, designations, and locations of the zones established by this
Zoning Code shall be shown upon the map(s) entitled “Zoning Map for the City of
La Puente, California,” adopted by ordinance and incorporated herein by
reference. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.06.040   Uncertainty of Boundaries.
   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any zone, the following
rules shall apply:
   A.   Where such boundaries are indicated as approximately following street
and alley lines or lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be such
boundaries.
   B.   In the case of unsubdivided property, and where a zone boundary divides
a lot, the location of such boundaries, unless the same are indicated by
dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the Zoning
Map.
   C.   Where a public street or alley if officially vacated or abandoned, the
centerline of such vacated street or alley shall be established as the zone
boundary and such vacated street or alley shall acquire the classification of
the property to which it reverts.
   D.   Areas of dedicated streets or alleys and railroad rights-of-way, other
than those which clearly have a zone as indicated on the Zoning Map, shall be
deemed to be unclassified and, in the case of streets and alleys, permitted to
be used only for purposes lawfully allowed by
Article 6 of the Municipal Code and the California Vehicle Code. In the case of
railroad rights-of-way, such right-of-way shall be permitted to be used solely
for the purpose of accommodating tracks, signals, other operative devices, and
the movement of rolling stock. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.06.050   Classification of Annexed Lands and Unclassified Property.
   A.   Undesignated Property. Any property which, for any reason, is not
designated on the Zoning Map as being classified in any of the zones
established by this Zoning Code shall be deemed to be classified consistent
with the applicable General Plan land use designation.
   B.   Land Annexed to the City of La Puente.
      1.   Any land hereafter annexed to the City of La Puente shall be deemed
to be zoned under such classification under this Zoning Code as is most nearly
the equivalent classification in the County.
      2.   Whenever it is deemed that the zoning of annexed lands is
inconsistent with adopted General Plan land use policy or other City policies,
the Commission may recommend and the Council may adopt the zone classifications
which shall apply to the annexed lands in the manner prescribed in
Article 7 (Zoning Code Administration) for amending this Zoning Code. (Ord. 935

(Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015; Ord. 939 § 3, 2016)
10.10.040   Recreational Vehicle Parking.
   A.   Purpose of Regulating Recreational Vehicle Parking. Provisions for the
size, number, and location of recreational vehicle parking in residential zones
are intended to enforce community standards with regard to residential
neighborhood aesthetics, traffic and pedestrian safety, and property
maintenance.
   B.   Allowed Zones. The parking of recreational vehicles shall only be
permitted in the R-E, R-1, and R-2 zones.
   C.   Restrictions on Obstructing Public Rights-of-Way. No recreational
vehicle shall park on any public sidewalk or parkway right-of-way, nor extend
from private property over any public right-of-way.
   D.   Permitted Parking Locations. Recreational vehicles shall only be parked
either on a legal driveway within the front yard area, on an allowed paved
surface within a side yard area, or the rear yard area.
   E.   Use as a Dwelling Prohibited. The use of recreational vehicle for
dwelling purposes during storage on a residential property and the connection
of utilities, water, or plumbing to a recreational vehicle, except for
temporary maintenance purposes, are strictly prohibited. No electrical,
plumbing, or other similar hook-ups shall be extended and/or used by the
recreational vehicle, except as needed for any 72-hour period immediately
preceding or following use of the recreational vehicle for its intended purpose
off site.
   F.   Size Limitations. The provisions of this Section shall apply to
recreational vehicles measuring no greater than 10 feet in width, 15 feet in
height, and 40 feet in length. Any recreational vehicle exceeding any of these
limits shall not be parked on any property zoned for residential use. (Ord. 935
§ 3 (part), 2015)
10.10.050   Privacy Standards for the R-E and R-1 Zones.
   A.   Purpose. Privacy standards are established to enforce community
standards with regards to the peace, quiet, and visual privacy within
residential neighborhoods, consistent with policies set forth in the General
Plan. The following privacy standards shall apply to all properties in the R-
E and R-1 zones.
   B.   Second Story Setbacks.
      1.   Interior Side Yard. For any second story, a minimum setback of 15
feet from an interior side property line shall be required. No balcony shall
project within that 15-foot setback area.
      2.   Street Side Yard. On a street side yard, the second story may extend
to the minimum required setback for the zone.
   C.   Window Location and Orientation. Second-story windows on a wall facing
an interior side yard or rear yard shall be located so as not to face directly
opposite any existing second-story window on an adjacent residential structure
unless the bottom portion of such second-story window is a minimum of five feet
six inches above the finished floor or provided such windows are screened by a
wing wall, lattice, screen, or other architectural feature, or provided such
windows are nontransparent or nontransluscent. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.10.060   Site Design and Architectural Standards.
   A.   Purpose and Applicability. Site design and architectural standards are
established consistent with General Plan policy to promote quality design of
new residential structures and additions. The City recognizes that quality
design promotes longer life of structures, improves the appearance and
maintenance of neighborhoods, and increases value in the housing stock
citywide. The following site design and architectural standards shall apply to
all new residential structures and to additions to residential structures.
   B.   Single-family Structures and Duplexes.
      1.   Site Design and Structure Orientation. Front entries shall be
clearly identifiable and for units that front a street, shall generally be
oriented toward the street.
      2.   Scale and Mass.
         a.   The bulk and mass of new single-family residential structures and
additions shall generally match the scale of existing structures in the
immediate neighborhood. However, this provision shall not prohibit the
construction of a two-story structure within a neighborhood of predominantly
single-story structures, provided the privacy standards of Section
10.10.050 (Privacy Standards for the R-E and R-1 Zones) are complied with.
         b.   Garages shall not be designed or located in a manner that
presents the garage as the prominent form of the front facade.
         c.   Wall off-sets, second-story balconies, decks, window
fenestrations, and similar features shall be used on front and street side
facades and any facade visible from the public right-of-way to provide
articulation and further reduce massing effects.
      3.   Architecture.
         a.   All facades visible from a public right-of-way shall incorporate
features that eliminate blank, unarticulated walls; add visual interest; avoid
clutter; and display a distinctive architectural style.
         b.   Additions to residential structures shall be designed and
constructed to match the architectural style and building form of the structure
to which they are added.
         c.   Rooflines and roofing materials shall be compatible with the
architectural style of the residential structure. Use of varying, uncoordinated
rooflines and roofing materials shall be avoided.
         d.   Window and door design and placement shall be consistent with the
overall architectural style of the structure.
         e.   Materials and finishes shall be of a consistent theme, shall
match the style of the residential structure, and shall be consistently applied
to all facades.
         f.   Roof-mounted equipment, where permitted, shall be screened from
view from public rights-of-way and adjacent properties by materials that are
architecturally compatible with the structure they serve.
      4.   Open Space - Common and Private. All common and private open spaces
shall comply with the requirements of Section
10.10.030.C (Open Space Requirements for the R-3 and R-4 Zones).

         a.   Where possible, pervious or semi-pervious surfacing materials
shall be used for pedestrian paths and driveways.
         b.   To the extent possible, orientation of structures and windows
shall take advantage of natural light and wind patterns for natural heating and
cooling.
   C.   Multi-Family Structures.
      1.   Site Design, Structure Orientation, and Access.
         a.   The front entry to the front unit of a multi-family development

   H.   Basis for Denial of Application. In reviewing an application for senior
citizen housing, the City shall take into account the surrounding environment
of the proposed senior citizen housing and conditions existing in that
environment that could have potential adverse impacts on senior residents with
respect to the existence or probable occurrence of noise, dust, vibration,
excessive traffic, large gatherings of people, or other conditions that will
interfere with the peaceful and quiet enjoyment of such housing for senior
citizens. The finding or findings that such adverse conditions exist may serve
as a basis for denial of an application.
   No Conditional Use Permit for a senior citizen housing development shall be
approved that would create an adverse living environment to the residents due
to limited open space, lack of amenities, and/or insufficient facilities to
promote a positive living environment. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)

(Ord 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.12.040   Site Design and Architectural Standards.
   A.   Access, Circulation, and Loading Areas.
      1.   In the C-2 zone, primary vehicular and pedestrian access shall be
from a street with a General Plan classification of Collector or higher, unless
the Director determines that no other access is possible.
      2.   Minimum driveway widths shall be as directed by the Fire Department.
      3.   Circulation shall be designed for both vehicle and pedestrian use.
Pedestrian access from the street and the parking lot to the main door of the
businesses they serve shall be designed to avoid conflict with vehicular
traffic. Pedestrian paths shall be clearly delineated with pavement materials
and/or markings and signage.
      4.   Dead-end parking aisles shall be avoided unless the size or shape of
a development site allows for no other configuration, as determined by the
Director.
      5.   Where physically possible, reciprocal parking area access between
shopping centers shall be required.
      6.   Loading areas shall be designed and located generally to the rear of
a property and out of view of public rights-of-way, and shall be designed to
avoid conflicts with interior pedestrian and vehicular circulation and to
minimize noise and other impacts on adjacent uses.
   B.   Commercial Shopping Centers - Site Design and Design Treatments.
      1.   To the maximum extent practical, as determined by the Director,
buildings shall be oriented as close to the street as possible, with parking
toward the rear of the site.
      2.   Shopping centers shall be identified by monument signage and may
include a logo. Landmark monuments are encouraged (such as bell towers, clock
towers, water features, etc.). Any signs and monuments provided shall be
designed and integrated into the architectural theme of their respective
complexes.
      3.   A unified architectural theme shall be applied to all structures
within the center and associated signage.
      4.   The entry area shall complement the development through paving
texture and color.
      5.   Plant materials shall be used to accentuate and distinguish the
center from the adjacent streetscape. The planting of annual or perennial color
shall be used to distinguish the entries.
   C.   Scale and Massing.
      1.   The scale and massing of structures shall achieve a street-level
environment accommodating to pedestrians.
      2.   Structures shall be designed to avoid long, monotonous, plain
facades. Techniques such as staggered building planes, variation of facades,
recessed entries, and arcades shall be used to create variety and interest.
      3.   Commercial structures adjacent to residential uses shall incorporate
sensitive transitions in scale and massing.For example, structure mass shall be
broken down using height step-backs, articulated sub-volumes, and horizontal
and vertical facade articulation.
   D.   Architectural Treatment.
      1.   A unified architectural and design theme shall be applied to all
structures within a development.
      2.   Roof lines and materials shall be compatible with the architectural
style of the structures.
      3.   Quality and definable treatment shall be applied to all facades
exposed to public view. Blank end walls shall be avoided. Treatments shall
include architectural features, landscaping, or art elements that tie into the
overall design theme.
      4.   Particular consideration to color and material shall be given to the
design and treatment of roofs because of their potential visual impact. Roof
flashing, rain gutters, down spouts, vents, and other roof protrusions shall be
screened from view or finished to match adjacent materials and/or colors of the
structure.
      5.   Additions to structures shall be designed to match the roofline,
style, and colors of the original structure. Where the original structure has
limited design quality, the addition shall include design features that add
texture and architectural interest.
      6.   Building entrances shall be readily identifiable through the use of
varied height, color, or building planes.
   E.   Walls and Fences.
      1.   Wall and fencing materials and patterns shall be compatible with the
style and themes of the structures. Unfinished precision block walls are
specifically prohibited.
      2.   Where walls are erected in locations visible from a public right-of-
way, the use of full dimension caps, pilasters, and changes in wall surfaces
(staggering) shall be applied.
      3.   In locations where walls might invite vandalism or graffiti,
landscaping shall be provided along the walls.
   F.   Landscaping. Landscaping, at a minimum, shall be provided in all
required setback and all yard areas that face a public right-of-way or private
street, within required parking areas pursuant to
Chapter 10.30 (Off-Street Parking and Loading), and as otherwise may be
required through the Site Plan Review process or any required discretionary
approval.

traditional retail- and service-oriented commercial zones. The use regulations
for this zone are intended to encourage and support manufacturing-type jobs,
but also to minimize adverse impacts and protect adjacent uses. (Ord. 935 § 3

(staggering) shall be applied.
      3.   In locations where walls might invite vandalism or graffiti,
landscaping shall be provided along the walls.
   D.   Landscaping. Landscaping, at a minimum, shall be provided in all
required setback and all yard areas that face a public right-of-way or private
street, within required parking areas pursuant to

(Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.24.030   Vision Clearance Triangle at Intersections.
   A.   Vision Clearance Triangle Required - Purpose. For purposes of public
safety, corner lots in all zones—except as may be permitted by any Specific
Plan for zero lot line development—shall be developed in a manner that ensures
visibility across the corners of the intersecting streets, alleys, and private
driveways. A Vision Clearance Triangle shall be required for this purpose.
   B.   Vision Clearance Triangle Defined; Restrictions.
      1.   The Vision Clearance Triangle consists of a triangular-shaped area
on a corner lot formed by measuring the prescribed distance from the
intersection of the front and street side property lines, an intersecting
alley, or an intersecting driveway, and connecting the lines diagonally across
the property, making an approximate 90-degree triangle, as illustrated in
Figure 3-1.
Figure 3-1
Vision Clearance Triangle

IMAGES/0-0-0-7185.png]
      2.     The Vision Clearance Triangle shall have two equal triangle sides
of minimum distance 15 feet, as illustrated in
Figure 3-1.
      3.   Where the intersection is formed by a street and a driveway or
alley, or by a driveway and alley, the minimum length of the two equal triangle
sides shall be five feet.
      4.   Within the Vision Clearance Triangle, no tree, fence, shrub, or
other physical obstruction higher than 42 inches above the top of curb shall be
permitted. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.24.040   Height Measurement and Exceptions.
   A.   Height Measurement.
      1.   Structure height shall be measured as the vertical distance between
the lowest ground elevation or finished grade and the highest point of the
subject structure. The highest point shall be the coping of a flat roof, deck
line of a mansard roof, or peak of the highest gable of a pitch or hip roof,
exclusive of vents, air conditioners, chimneys, and the like. See
Figure 3-2.

IMAGES/0-0-0-7187.png]
      2.   For sloped lots or structures with varied floor elevations, the
height shall be measured as the vertical distance from the average level of the
ground under the structure to the top-most point of the roof. The average level
of the ground is determined by adding the elevations of the lowest and highest
points of the part of the lot covered by a structure, and dividing by two.

Measurement of Height on Through Lots

IMAGES/0-0-0-7189.png]
      3.     On through lots 150 feet or less in depth, the height of a
structure on such lot shall be measured from the sidewalk level of the street
upon which the structure fronts.
      4.   On through lots more than 150 in depth, the height regulations and
basis of height measurements for the street permitting the greater height shall
apply. However, such height allowance may extend no more than 150 from that
street. See
Figure 3-3.
   B.   Exceptions to Height Limits. The following exceptions to height limits
are allowed, provided compliance is achieved with all other applicable permit
requirements and development standards of this Zoning Code.
      1.   Uninhabited architectural design features such as towers, spires,
steeples, domes, and cupolas, as well as any permitted rooftop equipment, may
exceed the specified height limit by a maximum of 10 percent, subject to
approval by the Director.
      2.   Flagpoles and chimneys may exceed the specified height limit by a
maximum of 20 percent.
      3.   Electrical transmission lines and towers are exempt from the
provisions of this Chapter.
      4.   Height exceptions for wireless communications facilities are set
forth in
Chapter 10.50.200 (Wireless Communications Facilities) of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 935 § 3, 2015)
10.24.050   Setbacks: Measurement, Standards, and Exceptions.
   A.   Open Spaces. Except as provided in this Chapter, every required setback
area creating a yard shall be kept free from structures from the ground to the
sky. No setback area or open space provided around any structure for the
purposes of complying with the provisions of this Zoning Code shall be
considered as providing a setback area or open space for any other structure.
No setback area or open space on any adjoining property shall be considered as
providing a setback area or open space on a site upon which a structure is to
be erected.
   B.   Modification of Side Setback Requirement on Combined Lots. When the
common property line separating two or more contiguous lots is covered by a
structure or permitted group of structures, or when the placement of a
structure or structures with respect to such common property line or lines does
not fully conform to the required setback area on each side yard common
property line or lines, such lots shall constitute a single site for the
purposes of the requirements of this Zoning Code, and the required side setback
area shall not apply to such common property line.
   C.   Setback Requirements for Property Abutting Future Street Right-of-way.
No structure shall be erected or maintained on any lot which abuts a street
having only a portion of its required width dedicated unless the setbacks
provided and maintained in connection with that structure have a width or depth
sufficient to accommodate completion of the road width plus the width or depth
required to satisfy the setback requirements for the zone in which the property
is located. However, this requirement does not require a setback of such width
or depth as to reduce the buildable width of a corner lot to less than 40 feet.
   D.   Side Setback when a Dwelling Fronts the Side Yard. In the case where a
dwelling fronts a side yard, the minimum width of that side yard shall be not
less than 10 feet, except that any garage front facing that yard shall be set
back no less than 20 feet. Open, unenclosed porches not extending above the
floor level of the first floor may project into such side yard upon which such
a dwelling fronts for a distance of not more than 42 inches.
   E.   Side Setback when the Rear of a Dwelling Faces the Side Yard. When the
rear of a dwelling abuts a side yard, the setback on that side yard shall be as
established for the rear yard in that zone. Open unenclosed porches may not be
closer to the side lot line than five feet. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.24.060   Solid Waste and Recyclable Materials Storage Areas.
   All multifamily residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, and all
other land uses - with the exception of detached single-family homes - shall
provide an enclosure for the storage of containers for solid waste and
recyclable materials. Such enclosures shall be sufficiently sized to
accommodate the number and size of bins needed for the sanitary storage and
collection of solid waste and recyclable materials generated by the facility on
a weekly or more frequent basis. The design and construction of such storage
areas shall be subject to the approval of the Director and shall be:
      1.   Enclosed on three sides by a solid screening wall or fence with a
minimum height of five feet, designed to be architecturally compatible with the
surrounding structures.
      2.   Provided with an approved operable door or gate on the fourth side
properly secured to prevent access by unauthorized persons and minimize
scavenging, while allowing authorized persons access for disposal and
collection of materials.
      3.   Provided with a covering or roof for security (to prevent scavenging
and/or dumping). The roof should provide adequate clearance to allow complete
access to the waste bins, but should not exceed eight feet in height. Open
areas between the solid wall and the roof should also be secured.
      4.   Provided with a concrete pad within the fenced or walled areas and a
concrete apron that facilitates the handling of the individual bins or
containers.
      5.    Designed to accommodate individual bins or containers that protect
contents from adverse environmental conditions that might render recyclable
materials unmarketable. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.24.070   Security Screens and Shutters.
   Where security screens and shutters are provided, as defined in
Article 9 of this Code, all such security screens and shutters shall comply

10.28.040   Measurement of Fence, Hedge, and Wall Height.
   A.   General. For the purposes of this
Chapter 10.28, fence, hedge, and wall height shall be measured as the vertical
distance from the ground elevation or finished grade of the property on which
the fence, hedge, or wall is erected or planted to the highest point of the
fence, hedge, or wall. To allow for variation in topography on a parcel, the
height of a fence, hedge, or a wall may vary up to six inches.
   B.   Difference in Grade Height between Two Parcels. Where there is a
difference in the ground elevation or finished grade between two adjoining
parcels of less than two feet, the height of any fence or wall constructed
along the common property line shall be determined by using the finished grade
of the highest contiguous parcel (see
Figure 3-6). When there is a difference in the ground level between two
adjacent parcels of two feet or more, the height of a fence or wall shall be
determined by the Director. The Director shall consider the physical and visual
height impact on abutting properties.

parking. (Ord. 935 § 3, 2015)
10.30.060   Off-Street Parking Space Requirements.
   A.   Facilities Required by Type of Use.
Table 3-3 establishes the spaces and facilities required for off-street parking
for the uses specified. These standards shall apply at the time a new structure
is erected or placed on the ground, when an existing structure is altered or
enlarged, when a new land use is established, and/or when a use is intensified
by the addition of floor space or seating capacity, unless otherwise specified
in this Chapter.
   B.   Uses Not Listed. Where the parking requirements for a use are not
specifically listed in
Table 3-3, the parking requirements for such a use shall be determined by the
Director. Such determination shall be based upon the requirements for the most
comparable and/or similar use. Such determinations shall be documented in
writing and shall be appealable pursuant to
Chapter 10.114 (Appeals).
   C.   Rounding. When the computation of the required number of off-street
parking spaces results in a fractional space, the number of required spaces
shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
   D.   Mixed Occupancies. In the case of mixed uses or occupancies in a
structure and/or on a lot, the total number of off-street parking spaces shall
be calculated for each use by applying the required parking standard for the
principal use to each of the separate uses. Alternative parking may be provided
pursuant to Section
10.30.110 (Shared Parking).
   E.   Driveway Area not Counted. Any driveway area leading to a garage shall
not be used to satisfy the off-street parking requirement for any required
uncovered parking space.

(Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.30.080   Parking in the R-E, R-1, and R-2 Zones.
   A.   Parking within Front Yard Area.
      1.   The parking of vehicles in any front yard area in the R-E, R-1, and
R-2 zones is restricted to the driveway and any adjacent allowed paved area.
      2.   For properties with a two-car garage for which one additional paved
parking space is required per
Table 3-3 and that additional space is proposed to be located within the front
yard area, the maximum width of the driveway with the one additional required
parking space shall not exceed 27 feet within the front yard area, and the
driveway apron shall not exceed a width of 20 feet. The additional parking
space shall be located along the side of the driveway abutting the side lot
line. Where insufficient width exists at this location, the additional parking
space may be located on the opposite driveway side.
      Where such parking arrangement causes the total paved area to exceed the
limits of front yard hardscape coverage established in Section
10.32.100. (Landscape Requirements - Residential Development), the Director may
administratively waive such hardscape limitation.
      3.   For properties with a two-car garage located in the rear of the
property with no alley access, the required additional paved parking space
shall be provided as a minimum nine-foot-wide by 20-foot-long parking space
behind the required front yard setback, with the required maneuvering space
provided. Where existing improvements do not allow for such configuration, the
parking space may be established in the front yard adjacent to the existing
driveway as described in subparagraph 2 above.
      4.   For properties with a two-car garage with alley access, the
additional required paved parking space shall be a minimum nine-foot-wide by
20-foot-long space located adjacent to the existing garage. Any new curb cuts,
driveways, or parking spaces shall be prohibited in the front yard.
   B.   Carports. In the R-E and R-1 zones, a carport shall not be counted as
provided required parking. However, where a carport provides additional, non-
required parking in the R-E and R-1 zones, such carport shall be permitted only
within the rear one-third of the lot. On a corner lot, the carport shall be set
back a minimum of 40 feet from any street-side lot line. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part),
2015)
10.30.090   Parking Lot Location.
   A.   Residential Uses. Required parking facilities for residential uses as
specified in this Chapter shall be located on the same lot or parcel of land
with the use in which it is intended to serve, except where parking districts
or community parking facilities have been established by ordinance or
resolution of the Council.
   B.   Non-Residential Uses. Required parking for non-residential uses shall
be provided in one of the following ways:
      1.   On the same lot or parcel of land with the use in which it is
intended to serve; or
      2.   By membership in a vehicle parking district; or
      3.   On a lot or parcel of land within 500 feet of the use, subject to
the approval of the Director and provided that the distant lot can be accessed
safely and conveniently by pedestrians and further provided that a covenant
acceptable to the City Attorney specifically identifies and authorizes the
parking use for the same period of time for which the land use is approved.
Distance between the parking lot and the use being served shall be measured via
a convenient and safe pedestrian route, as determined by the Director. (Ord.
935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.30.100   Parking Lot and Structure Design Considerations.
   A.   Design Specifications. Parking lots shall be designed and constructed
as indicated in Section
10.30.070
(Parking Space and Drive Aisle Dimensions). Parking lot paving shall consist of
a material approved by the City Engineer.
   B.   Screening from Public Right-of-way. Any parking area not separated by a
fence or wall from any street, alley, or other public right-of-way shall be
provided with a minimum five-foot-wide landscape buffer between the parking
area and the street, alley, or other public right-of-way, as measured from the
edge of the right-of-way to the parking area. Landscaping, other than trees,
shall be designed and maintained to establish a screen of approximately 36
inches in height. Screening materials may include a combination of plant
materials, earthen berms, raised planters, low walls, or other screening
devices that meet the intent of this requirement, as approved by the Director.
   C.   Parking Lot Lighting. All parking lots shall be provided with outdoor
lighting and safety lighting as approved by the Director.

IMAGES/0-0-0-7201.png]
   D.   Access and Circulation.
      1.   Parking spaces within a parking lot or structure shall be designed
and located so that any required maneuvering into or out of the space will not
interfere with vehicles entering or exiting the parking lot, and so that
vehicles can enter an abutting street in a forward direction. The drive aisles
shall be designed so that a vehicle is not required to enter a street to move
from one drive aisle to another.
      2.   Vehicle circulation shall be designed to avoid conflicts with
pedestrian circulation within the parking lot. Pedestrian ways shall be
designed to provide the most direct and safest travel path from parking aisles
and spaces to the uses being served. Internal pedestrian ways shall be
distinguished from driving surfaces by such techniques as paving materials,
raised curbs, and signage.
      3.   Within a parking structure, piers and pillars shall not encroach
into parking stalls.
   E.   Entrance and Exit Identification. Whenever an entrance or exit to off-
street parking facilities is provided from a street or alley, such entrance or
exit shall be clearly marked and visually identified.
   F.   Surfacing and Drainage. Parking lot surfacing materials shall consist
of sturdy, all-weather surfaces including, but not limited to concrete,
asphalt, and any other material capable of capturing, carrying, and disposing
of surface water runoff. Pervious or partially pervious surfaces are acceptable
to help achieve water quality goals and requirements, provided such surfaces
are approved by the City Engineer. All parking lots shall be designed to convey
surface runoff to approved retention and/or drainagefacilities. In no case
shall such drainage be allowed across the surface of a public sidewalk.
   G.   Wheel Stops. At the discretion of the Director, wheel stops shall be
provided for each parking space where landscaped curb areas are not provided.
Wheel stops shall be placed 18 inches from an opposite-facing parking space.
(Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.30.110   Shared Parking.
   A.   Shared Parking Requirements.
      1.   Where it can be demonstrated that two or more land uses can
effectively share common parking facilities due to the nature of the uses and
distinctly different demand for parking, or where off-site parking is proposed
to meet parking requirements, then an application may be filed for such parking
arrangement. Such application shall include a parking study that identifies the
parking demand of all subject land uses and that clearly demonstrates how and
why parking facilities can be shared.
      2.   The applicant shall provide a parking study prepared by a registered
traffic engineer that specifically analyzes the parking demand for each use
proposing to share the parking, each use’s hours of operation, and other
related issues of all involved uses.
      3.   The building or use for which an application is being made for
authority to share and utilize the existing off-street parking facilities
provided by another building or use shall be located within 500 feet of such
parking facilities.
   B.   Findings for Granting Shared/Joint Use and Off-site Parking
Arrangements. To grant a request for shared/joint use or off-site parking, the
Director shall make the following findings:
      1.   There is clear and convincing evidence that peak-hour parking demand
from all uses does not coincide and/or the uses are such that the hours of
operation are different for the various businesses or uses.
      2.   Adjacent or nearby properties will not be adversely affected by the
shared/joint use or off-site parking.
      3.   The parking arrangement is consistent with the General Plan and all
requirements of this Code.
   C.   Legal Agreement Required. A legal agreement shall be signed by all
parties using shared/joint use parking facilities. Such agreement shall be
approved by the CityAttorney and Director, shall be recorded with the Los
Angeles County Recorder, and shall continue to be valid upon change of
ownership.
   D.   Change in Use. In the event of a change in use, a new application shall
be filed or the existing agreement amended to the satisfaction of the Director.
(Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.30.120   Compact and Tandem Parking.
   A.   Compact Parking. Compact parking spaces, where provided, shall not
comprise more than 15 percent of any development and shall be developed subject

   It is unlawful to store and/or park on any lot in any residential zone any
commercial vehicle exceeding an unladen weight of 6,000 pounds. This
restriction does not apply to private recreational vehicles belonging to the
resident or guest of the property, provided such recreational vehicle complies
with the size restrictions established in Section
10.10.040 (Recreational Vehicle Parking). (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.30.150   Parking Restrictions in Commercial Zones.
   It is unlawful to store or park any vehicle having an unladen weight of at
least 10,000 pounds for more than three consecutive hours during any 24-hour
period on any lot or parcel within the C-1 and C-2 zones, and on any lot or
parcel subject to the provisions of the Downtown Specific Plan. Further, it is
unlawful to store or park on such lot any trailer of any size or weight that is

   This chapter shall be known as the City of La Puente Landscaping Chapter.
(Ord. 17-948 § 4, 2017)
10.32.020   Purpose and Intent.
   The state legislature has found that:
   A.   The waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever
increasing demands;
   B.   The continuation of California’s economic prosperity is dependent on
the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses;
   C.   It is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient
use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource;
   D.   Landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California by
providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the
environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire
protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development;
   E.   Landscape design, installation, maintenance, and management can and
should be water efficient; and
   F.   Article X, Section 2 of the California Constitution specifies that the
right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the
beneficial use to be served, and the right does not and shall not extend to
waste or unreasonable method of use of water.
   G.   Consistent with these findings, the purpose of the city’s water
efficient landscape ordinance is to establish a model acceptable under Governor
Brown’s April 1, 2015 Drought Executive Order (B-19-25) as being at least as
effective as the state model water efficient landscape ordinance in the context
of conditions in the city in order to:
       1.   Promote the values and benefits of landscapes while recognizing the
need to utilize water and other resources as efficiently as possible;
      2.   Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing, and
maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and
rehabilitated projects;
      3.   Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste
prevention for existing landscapes; and
      4.   Use water efficiently without waste by setting a Maximum Applied
Water Allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the
lowest practical amount. (Ord. 17-948 § 4, 2017)
10.32.030   Applicability.
   A.   New landscape installations or rehabilitation projects: As of the
effective date of this chapter, all sections of this chapter shall apply to the
following landscape projects:
      1.   New landscape projects, with an aggregate landscape area equal to or
greater than 500 square feet, requiring a building permit or landscape permit,
plan check or design.
      2.   Rehabilitated landscape projects with an aggregate landscape area
equal to or greater than 2,500 square feet requiring a building or landscape
permit, plan check, or design review.
      3.   New or rehabilitated landscape projects with an aggregate landscape
area of 2,500 square feet or less may comply with the performance requirements
of this ordinance or conform to the prescriptive measures (Appendix G)
contained in the Planning Commission Guidelines for Water Efficient Landscape.
      4.   New or rehabilitated landscape projects using treated or untreated
graywater or rainwater capture on site, any lot or parcels within the project
that has less than 2,500 square feet of landscape area and meets the lot or
parcel’s landscape water requirements (Estimated Total Water Use) entirely with
the treated or untreated graywater or through stored rainwater capture on site
is subject only to Appendix G of the Guidelines.
   B.   This water efficient landscape ordinance does not apply to:
      1.   Registered local, state, or federal historical sites;
      2.   Ecological restoration projects that do not require a permanent
irrigation system;
      3.   Mined-land reclamation projects that do not require a permanent
irrigation system; or
      4.   Plant collections, as part of botanical gardens and arboretums that
are open to the public.
   C.   The architectural guidelines of a common interest development,
including apartments, condominiums, planned developments, and stock
cooperatives, shall not prohibit or include conditions that have the effect of
prohibiting the use of low-water use plants as a group.
   D.   The requirements of this chapter may be partially or wholly waived, at
the discretion of the Development Services Director, or his/her designee, for
landscape rehabilitation projects that are limited to replacement of plantings
with equal or lower water needs and where any modifications to the irrigation
system do not require ministerial permits and the irrigation system is found to
be designed, operable, and programmed consistent with minimizing water waste in
accordance with local water purveyor(s)’ regulations or programs. (Ord. 17-948
§ 4, 2017)
10.32.040   Planning Commission Guidelines.
   The Planning Commission shall by resolution adopt guidelines providing
rules, regulations, requirements and procedures to assure technical compliance
with water efficiency standards at least as efficient as the model ordinance
described in California Government Code Section 65595(a). (Ord. 17-948 § 4,
2017)
10.32.050   Implementation Procedures.
   A.   Prior to installation, a landscape documentation package shall be
submitted to the city for review and approval of all landscape projects subject
to the provisions of this water efficient landscape ordinance. Any landscape
documentation package submitted to the city shall comply with the provisions of
the planning commission guidelines for water efficient landscaping.
   B.   The landscape documentation package shall include a certification by a
landscape architect licensed in the State of California stating that the
landscape design and water use calculations have been prepared by or under the
supervision of the licensed professional and are certified to be in compliance
with the provisions of this water efficient landscape ordinance and the
planning commission guidelines for water efficient landscaping.
      1.   Landscape and irrigation plans shall be submitted to the city for
review and approval with appropriate water use calculations.
      2.   Water use calculations shall be consistent with calculations
contained in the guidelines and shall be provided to the local water purveyor,
as appropriate, under procedures determined by the city.
      3.   Verification of compliance of the landscape installation with the
approved plans shall be obtained through a certification of completion in
conjunction with a certificate of occupancy or permit final process, as
provided in the planning commission guidelines for water efficient landscaping.
(Ord. 17-948 § 4, 2017)
10.32.060   Landscape Water Use Standards.
   A.   For landscape installation or rehabilitation projects subject to the
requirements of Section
10.32.030, the estimated applied water use allowed for the landscaped area
shall not exceed the maximum applied water allowance (MAWA) calculated using an
evapotranspiration adjustment factor (ETAF) of 0.7, except for special
landscaped areas where the MAWA is calculated using an ETAF of 1.0; or the
design of the landscaped area shall otherwise be shown to be equivalently
water-efficient in a manner acceptable to the city; as provided in the planning
commission guidelines for water efficient landscaping.
   B.   Irrigation of all landscaped areas shall be conducted in a manner
conforming to the rules and requirements, and shall be subject to penalties and
incentives for water conservation and water waste prevention as determined and
implemented by the local water purveyor or as mutually agreed by local water
purveyor and the city. (Ord. 17-948 § 4, 2017)
10.32.070   Delegation.
   The city may delegate to, or enter into a contract with, a local agency to
implement, administer, and/or enforce any of the provisions of the water
efficient landscape ordinance on behalf of the city. (Ord. 17-948 § 4, 2017)
10.32.080   Definitions.
   The following definitions are applicable to this chapter:
   “Aggregate landscape areas” pertains to the areas undergoing development as
one project or for production home neighborhoods or other situations where
multiple parcels are undergoing development as one project, but will eventually
be individually owned.
   “Applied water” means the portion of water supplied by the irrigation system
to the landscape.
   “Ecological restoration project” means a project where the site is
intentionally altered to establish a defined, indigenous, historic ecosystem.
   “Estimated applied water use” means the average annual total amount of water
estimated to be necessary to keep plants in a healthy state, calculated as
provided in the guidelines. It is based on the reference evapotranspiration
rate, the size of the landscape area, plant water use factors, and the relative
irrigation efficiency of the irrigation system.
   “Evapotranspiration” or “ETo” see “Reference Evapotranspiration”.
   “Evapotranspiration adjustment factor” or “ETAF” is equal to the plant
factor divided by the irrigation efficiency factor for a landscape project, as
described in the Guidelines. The ETAF is calculated in the context of local
reference evapotranspiration, using site-specific plant factors and irrigation
efficiency factors that influence the amount of water that needs to be applied
to the specific landscaped area. A combined plant mix with a site-wide average
plant factor of 0.5 (indicating a moderate water need) and average irrigation
efficiency of 0.71 produces an ET adjustment factor of (0.7) = (0.5/0.71),
which is the standard of water use efficiency generally required by this water
efficient landscape ordinance and the guidelines, except that the ETAF for a
special landscape area shall not exceed 1.0.
   “Guidelines” refers to the guidelines for implementation of the water
efficient landscape ordinance, as adopted by the city, which describes
procedures, calculations, and requirements for landscape projects subject to
this water efficient landscape ordinance.
   “Hardscapes” means any durable material or feature (pervious and non-
pervious) installed in or around a landscaped area, such as pavement or walls.
Pools and other water features are considered part of the landscaped area and
not considered hardscapes for purposes of this water efficient landscape
ordinance.
   “Irrigation efficiency” means the measurement of the amount of water
beneficially used divided by the amount of water applied. Irrigation efficiency
is derived from measurements and estimates of irrigation system characteristics
and management practices. The irrigation efficiency for purposes of this water
efficient landscape ordinance are 0.75 for overhead spray devices and 0.81for
drip systems.
   “Landscaped area” means all the planting areas, turf areas, and water
features in a landscape design plan subject to the maximum applied water
allowance and estimated applied water use calculations. The landscaped area
does not include footprints of buildings or structures, sidewalks, driveways,
parking lots, decks, patios, gravel or stone walks, other pervious or non-
pervious hardscapes, and other non-irrigated areas designated for non-
development (e.g., open spaces and existing native vegetation).
   “Landscape contractor” means a person licensed by the State of California to
construct, maintain, repair, install, or subcontract the development of
landscape systems.
   “Landscape documentation package” means the documents required to be
provided to the city for review and approval of landscape design projects, as
described in the guidelines.
   “Landscape project” means total area of landscape in a project, as provided
in the definition of “landscaped area,” meeting the applicability requirements
under section 26-750.1100 of this water efficient landscape ordinance.
   “Local agency” means a city or county, including a charter city or charter
county, that is authorized to implement, administer, and/or enforce any of the
provisions of the water efficient landscape ordinance. The local agency may be
responsible for the enforcement or delegation of enforcement of this water
efficient landscape ordinance including, but not limited to, design review,
plan check, issuance of permits, and inspection of a landscape project.
   “Local water purveyor” means any entity, including a public agency, city,
county, or private water company that provides retail water service.
   “Maximum applied water allowance” or “MAWA” means the upper limit of annual
applied water for the established landscaped area as specified in Section 2.2
of the guidelines. It is based upon the area’s reference evapotranspiration,
the ET adjustment factor, and the size of the landscaped area. The estimated
applied water use shall not exceed the maximum applied water allowance. MAWA =
(ETo) (0.62) [(ETAF x LA) + (1-ETAF) x SLA.
   “Mined-land reclamation projects” means any surface mining operation with a
reclamation plan approved in accordance with the Surface Mining and Reclamation
Act of 1975.
   “New construction” means, for the purposes of this water efficient landscape
ordinance, a new building with a landscape or other new landscape such as a
park, playground, or greenbelt without an associated building.
   “Non-pervious” means any surface or natural material that does not allow for
the passage of water through the material and into the underlying soil.
   “Pervious” means any surface or material that allows the passage of water
through the material and into the underlying soil.
   “Permit” means an authorizing document issued by local agencies for new
construction or rehabilitated landscape.
   “Plant factor” or “plant water use factor” is a factor, when multiplied by
ETo, that estimates the amount of water needed by plants. For purposes of this
Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance, the plant factor range for low water use
plants is 0 to 0.1; the plant factor range for moderate water use plants is 0.4
to 0.6; and the plant factor range for high water use plants is 0.7 to 1.0.
Plant factors cited in this Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance are derived
from the publication “Water Use Classification of Landscape Species.” Plant
factors may also be obtained from horticultural researchers from academic
institutions or professional associations as approved by the California
Department of Water Resources (DWR).
   “Recycled water” or “reclaimed water” means treated or recycled wastewater
of a quality suitable for non-potable uses such as landscape irrigation and
water features. This water is not intended for human consumption.
   “Reference evapotranspiration” or “ETo” means a standard measurement of
environmental parameters which affect the water use of plants. ETo is given
expressed in inches per day, month, or year as represented in Appendix A of the
Guidelines, and is an estimate of the evapotranspiration of a large field of
four (4) to seven (7) inch tall, cool-season grass that is well watered.
Reference evapotranspiration is used as the basis of determining the maximum
applied water allowances.
   “Rehabilitated landscape” means any re-landscaping project that meets the
applicability criteria of Section
10.32.030, where the modified landscape area is greater than two thousand five
hundred (2,500) square feet.
   “Special landscape area” means an area of the landscape dedicated solely to
edible plants such as orchards and vegetable gardens, areas irrigated with
recycled water, water features using recycled water, and recreational areas
dedicated to active play such as parks, sports fields, golf courses, and where
turf provides a playing surface.
   “Turf” means a ground cover surface of mowed grass. Annual bluegrass,
Kentucky bluegrass, Perennial ryegrass, Red fescue, and Tall fescue are cool-
season grasses. Bermuda grass, Kikuyu grass, Seashore Paspalum, St. Augustine
grass, Zoysia grass, and Buffalo grass are warm-season grasses.
   “Valve” means a device used to control the flow of water in an irrigation
system.
   “Water feature” means a design element where open water performs an
aesthetic or recreational function. Water features include ponds, lakes,
waterfalls, fountains, artificial streams, spas, and swimming pools (where
water is artificially supplied). The surface area of water features is included
in the high water use hydrozone of the landscaped area. Constructed wetlands
used for on-site wastewater treatment, habitat protection or storm water best
management practices that are not irrigated and used solely for water treatment
or storm water retention are not water features and, therefore, are not subject
to the water budget calculation. (Ord. 17-948 § 4, 2017)
10.32.090   Landscape Requirements— Commercial, Industrial and Institutional
Development.
   A.   Applicability. The standards in this section shall apply to all
commercial, industrial, and institutional developments.
   B.   Landscape coverage requirement. Shrubs, groundcover, and turf shall
provide 100% coverage of those areas not occupied by structures, parking areas,
storage, or trash enclosures at the time of issuance of a certificate of
occupancy. Embellished pavement, fountains, and similar hardscape materials may
in part be substituted for the required landscaping through the site plan and
design review process or other discretionary review that applies.
   C.   Parkway planting and maintenance. Areas within the public right-of-way
shall have landscaping installed by the developer/property owner. Parkways
located between the curb and the sidewalk shall be a minimum of five feet wide
unless altered by special engineering constraints, as determined by the City
Engineer. Such area shall contain trees as per the street tree requirements
specified in Section
10.32.120. Parkways may meander, thus reducing or increasing the minimum
distance from the curb, subject to approval by the Director. The ground surface
shall be planted with low spreading shrubs or groundcover to provide 100%
coverage. Turf shall not be used unless specifically approved by the Director.
   D.   Parkway-adjacent planting and maintenance. Parkways located between the
sidewalk and the edge of development shall meet the following requirements:
      1.   Such areas shall contain at least one 24-inch-box tree for every 30
linear feet of frontage. This calculation establishes the number of required
trees; the trees are not required to be located linear or equally spaced.
Although not specifically required, planting areas of variable widths are
encouraged, particularly for projects with frontages exceeding 150 feet. Trees
without invasive roots and root control barriers shall be required.
      2.   The ground surface shall contain shrubs, mulch, or ground cover to
provide coverage within two years. Turf shall not be used in area narrower than
five feet unless approved by the Director.
      3.   If a wall or fence separates the development from the street,
planting vines or espalier shrubs shall be incorporated into the planting
design.
   E.   Required landscaping for loading areas. Loading areas shall incorporate
landscaping to provide screening if visible from the public right-of-way,
adjacent uses, and pedestrians.
   F.   Required landscaping for trash enclosures. Trash enclosure areas
visible from a public right-of-way shall contain a planting area around the
perimeter of the enclosure wall except at access gates. The landscaping in the
planting area shall consist of vertical plantings such as tall shrubs or hedges
and vines on the enclosure walls. (Ord. 17-948 § 4, 2017)
10.32.100   Landscape Requirements—Residential Development.
   A.   Applicability. The standards in this section shall apply to all
residential uses.
   B.   R-E, R-1, and R-2 Zones
      1.   Front yard. All front yard areas shall be provided with landscaping
and irrigation. In front yards, hardscape materials, exclusive of the required
minimum driveway area and permitted parking area, shall not exceed 15% of the
front yard area. The balance of the front yard area shall be planted with live
plant materials. The use of hardscape for walkways, porches, and outdoor living
areas is allowed.
      2.   Side yards on corner lots. On a corner lot, any side yard that abuts
and is visible from a public right-of-way shall be landscaped and provided with

10.34.140   Master Sign Programs.
   A.   Purpose and Intent. Master Sign Programs are intended to provide for
uniformity and design consistency within commercial or industrial developments.
A Master Sign Program may include standards, criteria, and guidelines that are
more restrictive than the requirements of this Chapter. As an incentive to
creating signage that is well designed, attractive, appropriately proportioned,
and architecturally compatible with the buildings on the site on which the
signs are to be located, an approved Master Sign Program may allow for more
flexibility with regard to sign area, number, or height of signs than what is
otherwise permitted under this Chapter.
   B.   Applicability of Master Sign Program to New Developments. A Master Sign
Program is required for multiple-tenant developments with four or more tenants.
   C.   Applicability of Master Sign Program to Existing Developments. Any
existing single-tenant development located in a commercial or industrial zone
which is converted for occupancy by four or more tenants sharing the same
building or parking facilities is considered a new development project for the
purposes of this section. No new or additional signs, other than temporary
signs, shall be installed prior to the approval of a Master Sign Program.
   D.   Application; Approval by Director Required.
      1.   An application for a Master Sign Program shall be filed on forms
provided by the Director and fees paid pursuant to a fee schedule adopted by
Council resolution. The Director may act to approve, approve with conditions,
or deny a Master Sign Program application.
      2.   If the applicant, pursuant to subparagraph A above, requests
modifications to the sign standards contained in this
Chapter 10.34, the application shall clearly state and illustrate the
justification for such modification. In granting an approval for a Master Sign
Program with modifications to the sign standards, the Director, or the
Commission or Council on appeal, shall be required to make the following
findings:
         a.   That the Master Sign Program complies with all applicable
provisions of the General Plan and the purposes of this
Chapter 10.34;
         b.   That the Master Sign Program provides for well-designed,
attractive, and appropriately proportioned signage that is architecturally
compatible with the buildings on the site; and
         c.   That signage erected and maintained pursuant to the Master Sign
Program will not adversely affect adjacent properties and uses with regard to
size, placement, or illumination. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.34.150   Temporary Signs.

      2.   A permit for a temporary sign shall not be issued for the same
business or permittee more than six times in any one calendar year.
      3.   The applicant shall submit a detailed site plan and/or elevation

authorized signs on the site, nor shall the temporary sign obstruct the
temporary signs of other businesses on the same site.
   C.   Permitted Temporary Signs.
      1.   Banners and Pennants.
         a.   One banner is permitted for each tenant space, except that corner
tenant spaces or freestanding single-occupant structures may maintain a maximum

any one time. Pennants may be substituted for banners.
         b.   Individual banners shall be limited in size to a maximum of 50
square feet.
         c.   A banner shall be attached to, and parallel with, a wall of the

         d.   No one business shall be allowed to display a banner or banners
for more than 90 days per calendar year.
         e.   A business may erect a temporary sign consisting of a banner on a

percent of the window area of the window in which they are placed and for the
purposes of public safety, shall not be placed or extend higher than five feet
above the grade adjacent to the window on which such sign is located.
      4.   Hand-Held Sign.
         a.   Commercial hand-held signs shall not be displayed within any
public right-of-way.
         b.   Commercial hand-held signs on private property are allowed where

temporary signs shall not occupy required parking spaces, impede required
pedestrian travel, or impede required vehicular access to and from the property
or within the property. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.34.160   Signs Utilizing Non-Roman Alphabet.
   A.   Public Safety Necessity. The City recognizes the importance of signs
for advertising business locations and services. An equally important function
of signs is identifying businesses and locations clearly in a manner to
emergency services and response personnel that allows them to provide a high
degree of public safety protection. In recognition of this latter important
function of signs, the City establishes the standards set forth in this
Section.
   B.   Requirement for Supplementary English Language Characters. Every sign
larger than four square feet of surface area erected in connection with any
business within the City of La Puente which utilizes any non-Latin/Roman
letters, symbols, or characters in 50 percent or more of its advertising
message and in lettering readable from the nearest public street, shall be
considered to be a non-English language sign. Each non-English language sign
shall contain, at a minimum, a generic description written in English of the
nature of such business, legible from the nearest public street. (Ord. 935 § 3
(part), 2015)
10.34.170   Electronic Display Billboards.
   A.   Purpose and Intent. These provision regulate the establishment,
operations, and maintenance of Electronic Display Billboards, as defined in
10.34.050. The City recognizes that Electronic Display Billboards can serve a
community purpose through the generation of revenue for the City, for the
advertising of products and services that may be of interest to community
members, and for the provision of a medium to display public service
announcements and emergency messages.
   B.   Applicability. This Section applies to all Electronic Display
Billboards in the City as follows:
      1.   The provisions of this Section are in addition to any standards or
other regulations imposed by the required Development Agreement. However, where
any standard(s) imposed by the required Development Agreement conflict with the
general standards specified in this Section, the standards imposed by the
Development Agreement shall prevail. In no case, however, shall the required

conformity with the current regulations for the zone in which it is located.
      3.   The extent of damage or destruction shall be determined by comparing
the estimated cost of restoring the sign to its condition before the damage or
partial destruction and the estimated cost of replacing the sign as it existed
before the damage. Estimates for this purpose shall be reviewed and approved by
the Building Official. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)

Director shall notify the owner of such sign, in writing, stating the location
where the sign is being held and that it will be destroyed if not claimed by
the owner within 30 days after the date of such notice. The sign will be
returned to the owner only upon payment of the cost of such emergency
abatement. If the sign is not claimed within 30 days after the receipt of the
notice, or within 10 days upon conclusion of a hearing requested by the owner
as provided for in paragraph C of this section, the City may otherwise dispose
of the sign.
   C.   The cost of such emergency abatement shall be charged against the owner
of the sign and may be recovered by the City by an appropriate legal action or
by assessment against the property. The person assessed shall be granted a
hearing before the Planning Commission to contest the amount or propriety of
the charge if such person requests a hearing within 30 days of notice from the
City.
   D.   For the purposes of this section, a sign shall be presumed to be
property of the person who owns the premises upon which the sign is located.

authorize a facility to be established in a less appropriate location if doing
so is necessary to prevent substantial aesthetic impacts.
      4.   Design and Development Standards. Personal Wireless Communications
Facilities shall be designed and maintained as follows:
         a.   All new personal Wireless Communications Facilities shall be set
back at least 1,000 feet from schools, dwelling units, and parks, as measured
from the closest point of the personal Wireless Communications Facility
(including accessory equipment) to the applicable property line, unless an
applicant establishes that a lesser setback is necessary to close a significant
gap in the applicant's personal Communications service, and the proposed
personal Wireless Communications Facility is the least intrusive means to do
so. An applicant who seeks to increase the height of an existing personal
Wireless Communications Facility, or of its antennas, located less than 1,000
feet from a school, dwelling unit, or park shall establish that the increase is
necessary to close a significant gap in the applicant’s personal Communications
service, and the proposed increase is the least intrusive means to do so.
         b.   Facilities shall have subdued colors and non-reflective materials
which blend with the materials and colors of the surrounding area and
structures.
         c.   Unless otherwise prohibited by State or Federal law, all
equipment not located on a roof shall be underground; any equipment that is not
undergrounded shall be screened from adjacent uses to the maximum extent
feasible.
         d.   The facilities shall not bear any signs or advertising devices
other than certification, warning, or other signage required by law or
expressly permitted by the City.
         e.   At no time shall equipment noise (including air conditioning
units) from any facility exceed the applicable noise limit established in
Section
10.38.060 (Noise) at the facility’s property line; provided, however, that for
any facility located within 500 feet of any property zoned residential, or
improved with a residential use, the equipment noise shall at no time be
audible at the property line of any residentially zoned, or residentially
improved property.
         f.   If the majority of radio frequency coverage from the proposed
facility is outside the City limits, the applicant shall, in addition to the
other requirements of this Section, prove that the applicant is unable to
locate the proposed facility within the locale(s) that will receive the
majority of the coverage from the proposed personal Wireless Communications
Facility, and that no other feasible location for the facility exists outside
of the City limits. The fact that an applicant for a discretionary permit in
the City has been denied a wireless facility, antenna, or wireless coverage in
another jurisdiction shall not be considered evidence or proof that the
applicant is unable to locate in another jurisdiction.
      5.   Independent Expert Review. The City shall retain an independent,
qualified consultant to review any application for a permit for a new personal
Wireless Communications Facility or modification to an existingpersonal
Wireless Communications Facility. The review is intended to be a review of
technical aspects of the proposed Wireless Communications Facility or
modification of an existing Wireless Communications Facility and shall address
any or all of the following:
         a.   Whether the proposed Wireless Communications Facility is
necessary to close a significant gap in coverage and is the least intrusive
means of dong so;

         c.   Technical demonstration of the unavailability of alternative
sites or configurations and/or coverage analysis;
         d.   The applicability of analysis techniques and methodologies;
         e.   The viability of alternative sites and alternative designs; and
         f.   Any other specific technical issues designated by the City.
   The cost of the review shall be paid by the applicant through a deposit
estimated to cover the cost of the independent review, established by the
Director.
      6.   Conditions of Approval. All facilities approved under this Section
shall be subject to the following conditions:
         a.   Facilities. Facilities shall not bear any signs or advertising
devices other than legally required certification, warning, or other required
seals or signs, or as expressly authorized by the City.
         b.   Abandonment.
            (1)   Personal Wireless Communications Facilities that are no
longer operating shall be removed at the expense of the applicant, operator, or
owner no later than 90 days after the discontinuation of use. Disuse for 90
days or more shall also constitute a voluntary termination by the applicant of
any land use entitlement under this Zoning Code or any predecessor to this
Code.
            (2)   The Director shall send a written notice of the determination
of non-operation to the owner and operator of the personal Wireless
Communications Facility, who shall be entitled to a hearing on that
determination before the Commission, provided that written request for a

Any hearing shall be conducted in compliance with
Chapter 10.116 (Public Notices and Hearings), although no further appeal from
the decision of the Commission may be had other than in compliance with Code of
Civil Procedure Section 1094.5. Upon a final decision of the Commission or the
running of the time for a request for a hearing without such a request, the
operator shall have 90 days to remove the facility.
            (3)   The operator of a facility shall notify the City in writing
of its intent to abandon a permitted site. Removal shall comply with applicable
health and safety regulations. Upon completion of abandonment, the site shall
be restored to its original condition at the expense of the applicant,
operator, or owner.
            (4)   All facilities not removed within the required 90-day period
shall be in violation of this Zoning Code. In the event the City removes a
disused facility upon the failure of the applicant, operator, or owner to
timely do so, the applicant, operator, and owner shall be jointly and severally
liable for the payment of all costs and expenses the City incurs for the
removal of the facilities, including legal fees and costs.
         c.   Indemnification. The applicant, operator of a facility and
property owner (when applicable) shall defend, indemnify and hold the City and
its elective and appointed boards, commissions, officers, agents, consultants
and employees harmless from and against all demands, liabilities, costs
(including attorneys’ fees), or damages arising from the City's review and/or
approval of the design, construction, operation, location, inspection or
maintenance of the facility.
         d.   Removal of Unsafe Facilities. If, at any time after 10 years of
the issuance of a Building Permit or Encroachment Permit, or any shorter period
permitted by Government Code Section 65964(b), any personal Wireless
Communications Facility becomes incompatible with public health, safety or
welfare, the applicant or operator of the facility shall, upon notice from the
City and at the applicant’s or operator’s own expense, remove that facility.
Written notice of a determination in compliance with this Subparagraph shall be
sent to the owner and operator of the personal Wireless Communications
Facility, who shall be entitled to a hearing on that determination before the
Commission, provided that written request for a hearing is received by the
Department within 10 days of the date of the notice. Any hearing shall be
conducted in compliance with
Chapter 10.116 (Public Notices and Hearings), although no further appeal from
the decision of the Commission may be had other than in compliance with Code of
Civil Procedure Section 1094.5. Upon a final decision of the Commission or the
running of the time for a request for a hearing without such a request, the
operator shall have 90 days to remove the facility.
         e.   Monitoring Requirements. The owner or operator of any personal
Wireless Communications Facility approved in compliance with this Subsection
shall cooperate with the Director to verify that the facility conforms with
relevant building and safety requirements, and verify that the facility
complies with the requirements of this Section.
         f.   Performance Bond. Before the issuance of a Building Permit or
Encroachment Permit, the applicant or owner/operator of the facility shall pay
for and provide a performance bond, which shall be in effect until all
facilities are fully and completely removed and the site reasonably returned to
its original condition. The purpose of this bond is to cover the applicant’s or
owner/operator of the facility’s obligation under the conditions of approval
and the Municipal Code. The bond coverage shall include, but not be limited to,
removal of the facility, maintenance obligations and landscaping obligations.
(The amount of the performance bond shall be set by the Director on a case-
specific basis and in an amount reasonably related to the obligations required
under this Zoning Code and all conditions of approval, and shall be specified
in the conditions of approval.)
         g.   Nontransferability. An applicant shall not transfer a permit to
any person or entity before completion of construction of a personal Wireless
Communications Facility.
         h.   As-built Photographs. The applicant shall submit as-built
photographs of the facility within 90 days of installation of the facility,
detailing the installed equipment.

   A.   General. The purpose of this
Article 5 is to establish uniform provisions for the regulation of
nonconforming land uses, structures and parcels. It is the intent of this
Article 5 to bring nonconformities, such as nonconforming uses, structures, and
parcels, into conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code and to
eliminate the long-term continuance of such nonconformities. This Article is
intended to permit continuation of uses and continued occupancy and maintenance
of structures that were legally established but do not comply with all of the
standards and requirements of this Zoning Code in a manner that promotes the
public health, safety, and welfare and does not conflict with the goals and
objectives of the General Plan.

structure, use, or parcel that was legally established prior to the adoption of
this Zoning Code but fails to meet any provisions contained herein, or any
subsequent amendments.

Zoning Code shall be deemed to require any change in the plans, construction,
or designated use of any structure for which a building permit or land use
entitlement has properly been issued in accordance with the provision of
ordinances then in effect and upon which actual construction or use has been
started prior to the date the nonconformity was established, provided that in
all such cases regarding construction, actual construction shall be diligently
carried on until completion of the structure. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.60.020   Establishment of Lawful Nonconforming Status: Nonconforming Uses,
Structures and Parcels.
   A.   A legal nonconforming use, structure, or parcel is one that was

Zoning Code and continuing since that time, but which no longer conforms to the

zone district boundaries, or change in other applicable regulations of this
Code. Such legal nonconforming use, structure, or parcel may continue subject
to the requirements of this Article.
   B.   Uses, structures, and parcels that were illegally or unlawfully
established, constructed, or divided shall not be considered legal or lawful
nonconforming uses, structures, or parcels.

of this Zoning Code including but not limited to, location, density, floor
area, height, yard, usable open space, buffering, performance standards, or the
lack of an approved Conditional Use Permit or other required authorization,
permit, or approval. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.60.030   Continuation of Incidental Nonconformity.
   Any structure or use that has nonconforming parking, landscaping, accessory
structures, setbacks or yard area, or structure height may continue
indefinitely, provided no improvements, other than routine maintenance, are
performed. However, at the time any application is filed for a building permit
or any other permit required or authorized by this Zoning Code to modify or
expand the structure or use, a good faith effort shall be made to correct the
incidental nonconformity. Exceptions include structure height and setbacks,
which can be continued in a nonconforming state, provided that the

otherwise comply with the provisions of
Chapter 10.72 (Miscellaneous Nonconforming Provisions). (Ord. 935 § 3 (part),
2015)

current regulations of this ZoningCode, the nonconforming rights and privileges
with respect to that nonconformity are terminated and shall not be restored.

ownership, the combination of parcels or portions of the parcels shall be
considered a single, individual parcel for the purposes of this Zoning Code,
and no portions of that parcel shall be used, occupied, divided, or sold in any

the following modifications and expansions may be allowed without requiring
conformance with established standards.
      1.   Single-family dwelling units that have nonconforming parking may be
expanded to include additional square footage to the unit. However, where a new
bedroom is proposed to be constructed, at least one additional parking space
shall be provided.
      2.   Where a side yard setback is nonconforming, an addition to a
structure with such nonconformity shall be allowed to maintain the
nonconforming setback, provided any such addition does not, as determined by
the Director, create any adverse impact on an adjoining property.
      3.   For any use other than a single-family residence, an expansion of up
to 10 percent of the existing floor area may be allowed without any requirement
to establish conformity of required setbacks, landscaping, structure height,

instance where an existing nonconforming structure or any portion of a
nonconforming structure is demolished in the course of maintenance and repair,

damaged to the extent of 50 percent or more of the appraised replacement value
of the nonconforming structure, as determined by the Building Official, prior
to the damage or partial destruction, or is voluntarily razed or is required to
be razed, the structure shall only be restored in full conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Code and all applicable Building Codes.
   C.   Destruction of Less than 50 Percent. If the total cost of repairs,
including structural alterations, required for reconstruction do not exceed 50
percent of the appraised replacement value of the nonconforming structure, as
determined by the Building Official, prior to the damage or partial
destruction, the damaged or partially destroyed portions of the nonconforming
structure may be reconstructed without bringing all portions of the structure
into conformance with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   D.   Estimate of Damage and Cost of Reconstruction. The extent of damage or
partial destruction shall be based upon the reasonable replacement value of the
structure immediately prior to the damage or partial destruction, as determined
by the City’s Building Official. All appraised values referred to in this
Section shall be determined by a State licensed appraiser and confirmed by the
Building Official. Estimates of repairing or replacing the damaged portion of
the structure for purposes of this Section shall be made by or shall be
reviewed and approved by the Building Official, and shall be based on the
minimum cost of construction in compliance with the Building Code.
   E.   Exemption for Single-Unit and Multi-Unit Residential Structures. Any
legally established single-unit or multi-unit residential structure that
experiences destruction of 50 percent or more of the appraised replacement
value may be completely reconstructed to the extent it existed prior to such
destruction. However, all efforts shall be made to comply with the provisions
of this Zoning Code to the extent practicable and in particular, any off-street
parking deficiencies that existed prior to such destruction shall be remedied
to the greatest extent possible, as determined by the Director. (Ord. 935 § 3
(part), 2015)
10.64.040   Seismic Retrofitting.

conforming. However, the number of existing off-street parking spaces shall not
be reduced.
   B.   Expansion. When an existing structure or use with nonconforming parking
is expanded, additional parking spaces shall be provided in compliance with the
provisions of

and the new use shall provide all required off-street parking and loading in
accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 10.30 (Off-Street Parking and Loading). However, the Director shall
have the authority to allow for a reduction in the required number of parking
and/or loading spaces for the conforming use, provided the following findings
can be made:
         a.   That the conforming use benefits the community by providing new
economic development and job opportunities; and
         b.   That the conforming use will not adversely impact surrounding
uses or public streets by increasing demand for on-street parking.

provided on the same site as the use it serves, the applicant may provide
alternative parking facilities pursuant to Section
10.30.090.B (Parking Lot Location). (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)

and/or pertinent policies shall be construed as either a recommendation for
approval or denial of the application or project by any City staff.
      4.   Failure by City staff to identify all required studies or all
applicable requirements shall not constitute a waiver of those requirements.
Additionally, the provision of incorrect information by City staff does not
waive the Zoning Code requirements.
   B.   Application Contents. Each application for a permit or other approval
pertaining to this Zoning Code shall be filed with the Department on a City
application form, together with all required fees and/or deposits and all other
information and materials specified in the most up-to-date Department handout

   B.   Timing of Payment. Applications shall not be deemed complete, and
processing shall not commence, on any application until all required fees or
deposits have been paid. Failure to timely pay supplemental requests for
payment of required fees and/or deposits shall be a basis for denial or
revocation of any permit or other requested approval, notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Zoning Code.
   C.   Refunds and Withdrawals. Application fees cover City costs for public
hearings, mailings, staff time and the other activities involved in processing
applications.
Consequently, no refund due to denial shall be allowed. In the case of a
withdrawal, the Director shall have the discretion to authorize a partial
refund based upon the pro-rated costs to-date and the status of the application
at the time of withdrawal in compliance with the Planning Fee Schedule. (Ord.

persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the California
Fair Employment and Housing Act, the Federal Fair Housing Act, and the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (also known as the Acts) in the
application of zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies, and
procedures. A Reasonable Accommodation is typically an adjustment to physical
design standards (e.g., setbacks) to accommodate the placement of wheelchair
ramps or other exterior modifications to a dwelling in response to the needs of
a disabled resident. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.90.020   Applicability.
   A.   Eligible Applicants.
      1.   A request for Reasonable Accommodation may be made by any person
with a disability, their representative or any entity, when the application of
a zoning law or other land use regulation, policy, or practice acts as a
barrier to fair housing opportunities.
      2.   A person with a disability is a person who has a physical or mental
impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more major life
activities, anyone who is regarded as having this type of impairment, or anyone
who has a record of this type of impairment, as those terms are defined by the
Acts.
   B.   Eligible Requests.
      1.   A request for Reasonable Accommodation may include a modification or
exception to the rules, standards, and practices for the siting, development,
and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate
regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to
housing of their choice.
      2.   A request for Reasonable Accommodation shall comply with Section
10.90.030 (Application Requirements), below. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)

submitted for concurrent review with another discretionary land use application
shall be reviewed by the authority reviewing the discretionary land use
application. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.90.050   Review Procedures.
   A.   Director’s Review. The Director shall make a written decision and
either approve, approve with modifications, or deny a request for Reasonable
Accommodation in compliance with Section
10.90.060 (Findings and Decision), below.
   B.   Other Review Authority. The written decision on whether to approve or
deny the request for Reasonable Accommodation shall be made by the authority
responsible for reviewing the discretionary land use application in compliance
with the applicable review procedure for the discretionary review. The decision
to approve or deny the request for Reasonable Accommodation shall be made in
compliance with Section
10.90.060 (Findings and Decision), below.
   C.   Request of Further Information. If necessary to reach a determination
on the request for Reasonable Accommodation, the review authority may request
further information from the applicant consistent with the Acts, specifying in
detail the information that is required. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)
10.90.060   Findings and Decision.
   A.   Findings. The applicable review authority may approve a request for
Reasonable Accommodation, with or without conditions, only after first making

Acts specified in Section
10.90.010 (Purpose), above;
      2.   The housing, which is the subject of the request, will be used by an
individual defined as disabled under the Acts;
      3.   The request for Reasonable Accommodation is necessary to make
specific housing available to an individual with a disability under the Acts;
      4.   The requested Reasonable Accommodation would not impose an undue
financial or administrative burden on the City;
      5.   The requested Reasonable Accommodation would not require a
fundamental alteration in the nature of a City program or law, including but
not limited to land use and zoning;
      6.   There would be no potential impact on surrounding uses;
      7.   The physical attributes of the subject property and structure(s)
would warrant approval of the requested Reasonable Accommodation; and
      8.   No other Reasonable Accommodations would provide an equivalent level
of benefit.
   B.   Conditions of Approval. In approving a request for Reasonable
Accommodation, the review authority may impose conditions of approval deemed
reasonable and necessary to ensure that the Reasonable Accommodation will
comply with the findings required by Subsection A. (Findings), above.
   C.   Failure to Make Findings. The review authority shall deny the
application when it fails to make any one or more of the required findings.

since the previous hearing(s), which materially affects the applicant’s real

10.102.110   Covenants for Easements.
   A.   Applicability.
      1.   Covenant for Easement May Be Required. When necessary to achieve the
land use goals of the City, the City may require a property owner holding
property in common ownership to execute and record a Covenant for Easement in
favor of the City, in compliance with Government Code Sections 65870 et seq.
      2.   Required Provisions. A Covenant for Easement may be required to
provide for emergency access, ingress and egress, landscaping, light and air
access, open space, parking, reciprocal access, or for solar access.
   B.   Condition of Approval. The Covenant for Easement may be imposed as a
condition of approval by the applicable review authority.
   C.   Definitions. For purposes of this Section, the following words, terms,
and phrases, when used in this Section, shall have the meanings ascribed to
them in this Section, except where the context clearly indicates a different
meaning:
      1.   Easement. An easement is usually for the benefit of other than the
property owner, and is an interest in land that belongs to someone else and
creates an encumbrance on that land. It is created by grant of easement and
accompanied by a legal description and plat of the easement which are recorded
against the property at the Office of the County Recorder.
      2.   Irrevocable Offer of Dedication. This is an actual offer of
dedication for future right-of-way. The offer is recorded, but does not go into
effect until the Council authorizes and accepts the right-of-way. The exhibits
used are the same as for any other dedication, a legal description and a plat
showing its location.
      3.   Partial Reconveyance. If a landowner has a loan against the subject
property, there is a first deed of trust on the property. The City requires
that all property purchased from a property owner be free and clear of all
encumbrances. This requires a release (Partial Reconveyance) from the lender
for that portion of the property the City is acquiring.
      4.   Reciprocal Access Easement. This is an agreement between parties
owning adjacent properties. This allows all owners of property that have
entered into this agreement the right of access over the owner’s property. This
instrument is used for ingress and egress, parking, sanitary sewer, water and
storm drainage across, over, or under each property for the benefit of each
party.
      5.   Right-of-Entry. Gives the City the right to enter across, over,
under, or upon the grantor's property and is usually used to allow construction
to proceed before right-of-way being acquired.
   D.   Form of Covenant. The form of the Covenant shall be approved by the
City Attorney, and the Covenant for Easement shall:
      1.   Describe Property. Describe the real property subject to (i.e.,
burdened by) the easement;
      2.   Describe Property to be Benefited. Describe the real property to be
benefited by the easement;
      3.   Planning Permit. Identify the City permit or approval that relied on
or required the Covenant; and
      4.   Purpose of Easement. Identify the purpose(s) of the easement.
   E.   Recordation. The Covenant for Easement shall be recorded in the County
Recorder’s Office.
   F.   Effect of Covenant. From and after the time of its recordation, the
Covenant for Easement shall:
      1.   Act as an Easement. Act as an easement in compliance with Chapter 3
(commencing with Section 801) of Title 2 of Part 2 of Division 2 of the Civil
Code, except that it shall not merge into any other interest in the real
property. Civil Code Section 1104 shall be applicable to the conveyance of the
affected real property; and
      2.   Impart Notice. Impart notice to all persons to the extent afforded
by the recording laws of the State. Upon recordation, the burdens of the
Covenant shall be binding on, and the Covenant shall benefit, all successors-
in-interest to the real property.
   G.   Enforceability of Covenant. The Covenant for Easement shall be
enforceable by the successors-in-interest to the real property benefited by the
Covenant and the City. Nothing in this Section creates standing in any person,
other than the City, and any owner of the real property burdened or benefited
by the Covenant, to enforce or to challenge the Covenant or any requested
amendment or release.
   H.   Release of Covenant. The release of the Covenant for Easement may be
affected by the Council, or under an appeal, following a noticed public hearing
in compliance with
Chapter 10.116 (Public Notices and Hearings).
      1.   May Be Released by City. The Covenant for Easement may be released
by the City, at the request of any person, including the City or an affected
property owner, on a finding that the Covenant, on the subject property, is no
longer necessary to achieve the land use goals of the City.
      2.   Recordation of Notice. A notice of the release of the Covenant for
Easement shall be recorded with the County Recorder’s Office.
   I.   Fees.
      1.   The City shall impose fees to recover the City’s reasonable cost of
processing a request for a release.
      2.   Fees for the processing shall be established by the Planning Fee
Schedule. (Ord. 935 § 3 (part), 2015)

   Landscaping Terms for
Chapter 10.32 (Landscaping).
      Annual reference evapotranspiration rate or ETo means a standard
measurement of environmental parameters which affect the water use of plants.
ETo is given expressed in inches per day, month, or year, and is an estimate of
the evapotranspiration of a large field of four-to seven-inch tall, cool-season
grass that is well watered. Calculation of the ETo shall be from the nearest
monitoring site to the City as determined by the California Department of Water
Resources.
      Applied water means the portion of water supplied by the irrigation
system to the landscape.
      Budget-based tiered-rate structure means tiered or block rates for
irrigation accounts charged by the retail water agency in which the block
definition for each customer is derived from lot size or irrigated area and the
evapotranspiration requirements of landscaping.
      Ecological restoration project means a project where the site is
intentionally altered to establish a defined, indigenous, historic ecosystem.
      Estimated Applied Water Use means the average annual total amount of
water estimated to be necessary to keep plants in a healthy state. It is based
on the reference evapotranspiration rate, the size of the landscape area, plant
water use factors, and the relative irrigation efficiency of the irrigation
system.
      ET adjustment factor or ETAF is equal to the plant factor divided by the
irrigation efficiency factor for a landscape project. The ETAF is calculated in
the context of local reference evapotranspiration, using site-specific plant
factors and irrigation efficiency factors that influence the amount of water
that needs to be applied to the specific landscaped area. A combined plant mix
with a site-wide average plant factor of 0.5 (indicating a moderate water need)
and average irrigation efficiency of 0.71 produces an ET adjustment factor of
(0.7) = (0.5/0.71), which is the standard of water use efficiency generally
required by
Chapter 10.32 (Landscaping), except that the ETAF for a special landscape area
shall not exceed 1.0.
      Hardscape means any durable material or feature (pervious and non-
pervious) installed in or around a landscaped area, such as pavements or walls.
Pools and other water features are considered part of the landscaped area and
not considered hardscape for purposes of
Chapter 10.32 (Landscaping).
      Homeowner installed landscape means any landscaping either installed by a
private individual for a single family residence or installed by a licensed
contractor hired by a homeowner. A homeowner, for purposes of this ordinance,
is a person who occupies the dwelling he or she owns. This definition excludes
speculative homes, which are not owner-occupied dwellings and which are subject
to the requirements applicable to developer-installed residential landscape
projects.
      Irrigation efficiency means the measurement of the amount of water
beneficially used divided by the amount of water applied. Irrigation efficiency
is derived from measurements and estimates of irrigation system characteristics
and management practices. The minimum average irrigation efficiency for
purposes of
Chapter 10.32 is 0.71. Greater irrigation efficiency can be expected from well
designed and maintained systems.
      Landscaped area means all the planting areas, turf areas, and water
features in a landscape design plan subject to the Maximum Applied Water
Allowance and Estimated Applied Water Use calculations. The landscaped area
does not include footprints of buildings or structures, sidewalks, driveways,
parking lots, decks, patios, gravel or stone walks, other pervious or non-
pervious hardscapes, and other non-irrigated areas designated for non-
development (e.g., open spaces and existing native vegetation).
      Landscape Documentation Package means the documents required to be
provided to the City for review and approval of landscape design projects.
      Landscape professional means a licensed landscaped architect, licensed
landscape contractor or any other person authorized to design a landscape
pursuant to Section 5500.1, 5615, 5641, 5641.1, 5641.2, 5641.3, 5641.4, 5641.5,
5641.6, 6701, 7027.5 of the California Business and Professions Code, Section
832.27 of Title 16 of the California Code of Regulations, and Section 6721 of
the California Food and Agriculture Code.
      Landscape project means total area of landscape in a project, as provided
in the definition of landscaped area, meeting the requirements under
Chapter 10.32 (Landscaping).
      Local water purveyor means any entity, including a public agency, city,
county, or private water company that provides retail water service.
      Mined-land reclamation projects means any surface mining operation with a
reclamation plan approved in accordance with the Surface Mining and Reclamation
Act of 1975.
      Maximum Applied Water Allowance or MAWA means the upper limit of annual
applied water for the established landscaped area. It is based upon the area's
reference evapotranspiration, the ET Adjustment Factor, and the size of the
landscaped area. The Estimated Applied Water Use shall not exceed the Maximum
Applied Water Allowance.
      New construction means, for the purposes of
Chapter 10.32 (Landscaping), a new building with a landscape or other new
landscape such as a park, playground, or greenbelt without an associated
building.
      Non-pervious means any surface or natural material that does not allow
for the passage of water through the material and into the underlying soil.
      Pervious means any surface or material that allows the passage of water
through the material and into the underlying soil.
      Plant factor or plant water use factor is a factor, when multiplied by
ETo, that estimates the amount of water needed by plants. For purposes of this
Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance, the plant factor range for low water use
plants is 0 to 0.3; the plant factor range for moderate water use plants is 0.4
to 0.6; and the plant factor range for high water use plants is 0.7 to 1.0.
Plant factors cited in
Chapter 10.32 are derived from the Department of Water Resources 2000
publication “Water Use Classification of Landscape Species.”
      Recycled water or reclaimed water means treated or recycled waste water
of a quality suitable for non-potable uses such as landscape irrigation and
water features.
      Rehabilitated landscape means any re-landscaping project that meets the
applicability criteria of

feet, is 50 percent of the total landscape area, and the modifications are
planned to be completed within one year.
      Smart automatic irrigation controller means an automatic timing device
used to remotely control valves that operate an irrigation system and which
schedules irrigation events using either evapotranspiration (weather-based) or
soil moisture data.
      Special landscape area or SLA means an area of the landscape dedicated
solely to edible plants such as orchards and vegetable gardens, areas irrigated
with recycled water, water features using recycled water, and areas dedicated
to active play such as parks, sports fields, golf courses, and where turf
provides a playing surface.
      Turf means a ground cover surface of mowed grass. Annual bluegrass,
Kentucky bluegrass, Perennial ryegrass, Red fescue, and Tall fescue are cool-
season grasses. Bermuda grass, Kikuyu grass, Seashore Paspalum, St. Augustine
grass, Zoysia grass, and Buffalo grass are warm-season grasses.
      Valve means a device used to control the flow of water in an irrigation
system.
      Water feature means a design element where open water performs an
aesthetic or recreational function. Water features include ponds, lakes,
waterfalls, fountains, artificial streams, spas, and swimming pools (where
water is artificially supplied). The surface area of water features is included
in the high water use hydrozone of the landscaped area. Constructed wetlands
used for on-site wastewater treatment, habitat protection or storm water best
management practices that are not irrigated and used solely for water treatment
or storm water retention are not water features and, therefore, are not subject
to the water budget calculation.
   Laundry and Dry Cleaning - Nonretail. A facility that specializes in the

garage is accessible directly from the street, and the principal entrance of
the house is accessible directly from the walk, and that adequate space between
buildings will be maintained;
   (e)   Where economically proper and feasible, business properties and
multiple-dwelling properties located only upon the through streets bounding the
superblocks and served by adequate automobile parking space either off the
street or by special design of the street, and in case of business properties,
such parking shall be easily accessible from all parts of the project by the
system of walks above-mentioned;
   Provided, that in no case shall any lot proposed to be subdivided into a
planned development project shall have a area of less than six thousand square
feet; that every through street shall have a width of not less than sixty feet;

street, shall have an adequate turning area at the dead end, and shall have a
width of not less than thirty-four feet; that vision clearance and curb
construction at block corners be maintained as provided for in Section

width or on walks, the distance between houses across such streets or walks
shall be not less than fifty feet, and that where lots front upon such walks
rather than upon streets, the side lines shall be, so far as practical, at a
right angle to said walks instead of the streets;
   (f)   Copies of the required covenants, conditions and restrictions,
articles of incorporation, and bylaws or other documents of the owner’s
association or other identity which controls the common facilities shall be
submitted to the city for approval;
   (g)   All open areas with the exception of vehicular access ways and parking

covered by buildings and/or structures.
   (c)   Group and/or Cluster Dwellings. Contiguous lots and/or attached
dwelling units which are grouped or clustered in any manner so as to form a
single building may be permitted; provided, however, that such group shall not
contain more than six dwelling units and/or lots, nor shall the horizontal
dimensions of such building or dwelling structure be greater than one hundred
seventy-five feet.
   (d)   Development Standards. The development standards with respect to
setbacks, dwelling unit size, building heights, parking and other associated
requirements of the underlying zone shall be complied with.
