City in any court of competent jurisdiction for the collection of the amount of
any such delinquent or unpaid fee, service charge, utility charge, license, or
tax, together with any penalties applicable thereto as prescribed by this Code.
The remedy prescribed by this section shall be accumulative, and the use of an
action to collect such an amount as a debt by civil action shall not bar the
use of any other remedy provided by this Code or by law for the purpose of
enforcing the provisions thereof.
Sec. 1-2.07. Unreasonable refusal to pay or comply: Attorneys’ fees.
   In any civil action against a person to collect any fee, service charge,

any provision of this Code, if the person has failed for thirty (30) days after
demand prior to the commencement of the action to make payment or otherwise
perform in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Code, and it
appears to the court that such refusal was without reasonable cause, the court
may allow to the plaintiff a reasonable attorneys’ fee and include such fee in
any judgment that may be rendered in such action. The failure of a person to
defend any such action shall be deemed prima facie evidence that failure to
make payment or otherwise comply was without reasonable cause.

certificate can be issued. The certificate shall be issued when the property is
in full compliance with the City Codes.
   (3)   Require the owner, as part of the application fee for any needed
permit which the property owner failed to obtain before the activity or use was
initiated, to pay a code enforcement cost surcharge in an amount equal to the

other times as the Mayor may deem it necessary, the Mayor shall establish the
seating arrangement of the members of the Council.
   (c)   Processing motions. The Mayor, or such member of the City staff, as
the Mayor may designate, should verbally restate each question immediately
prior to calling for the vote. Following the vote, the City Clerk shall
announce whether the question carried or was defeated. The Mayor may publicly
explain the effect of a vote for the audience or direct a member of the City
staff to do so before proceeding to the next item.
   (1)   Motions out of order. The Mayor may, at any time with Council
approval, permit a member to introduce an ordinance, resolution or motion out
of the agenda order.
   (2)   Division of question. If the question contains two (2) or more
divisible propositions, the Mayor may, or upon the request of a member, divide
the question.
   (d)   Precedence of motions. When a motion is pending, no motion shall be
entertained except the following motions which shall have precedence in the
order indicated:
   (1)   Motion to adjourn (not debatable). A motion to adjourn shall be in
order at any time except as follows:
   (i)   When repeated without intervening business or discussion;
   (ii)   When made as an interruption of a member while speaking;
   (iii) When the previous question has been ordered; and
   (iv)   While a vote is being taken.
   A motion to adjourn “to another time” is debatable only as to the time of
adjourned meeting,
   (2)   Motion to fix hour of adjournment. This motion is to set a definite
time at which to adjourn. It is undebatable and unamendable except as to the
time set.
   (3)   Motion to table. This motion is to temporarily bypass the Subject. The
motion is undebatable and shall preclude all amendments or debate of the
subject under consideration. If it shall prevail, the matter may be “taken from
the table” at any time prior to the end of the next regular meeting.
   (4)   Motion to call the question. This motion is to close debate on the
main motion. It is undebatable. If the motion fails, debate is reopened. If the
motion passes, Council shall vote on the main motion.
   (5)   Motion to amend. This motion is debatable only as to the amendment. A
motion to amend an amendment shall be in order, but one to amend an amendment
to an amendment shall not. An amendment modifying the intention of a motion
shall be in order, but an amendment relating to a different matter shall not be
in order. A substitute motion on the same subject shall be acceptable.
   (6)   Motion to postpone. A motion to postpone indefinitely shall be fully
debatable. If adopted, the principal question shall be declared lost. Motions
to postpone to a definite time shall be amendable and debatable as to the
propriety of the postponement and the time set.
   (e)   Signing documents. The Mayor shall sign all ordinances, resolutions,
contracts and other documents necessitating a signature which were adopted in
that officer’s presence unless unavailable, in which case the signature of an
alternate presiding officer may be used.
   (f)   Sworn testimony. The Mayor or the Council may require any person
addressing the Council to be sworn as a witness and to testify under oath.

Sec. 1-8.113. Rules of debate.
   (a)   Recognition to speak. Every Councilmember desiring to speak shall
first address the Mayor and be recognized by such. The member shall solely
discuss the question under debate, avoiding personalities and indecorous
language.
   (b)   Questions to staff. Every Councilmember desiring to question the City
staff, after recognition by the Mayor, shall address the questions to the City
Manager, Assistant City Manager, City Clerk, City Attorney or appropriate
department head who shall be entitled either to answer or designate a member of
staff for that purpose.
   (c)   Interruption. A Councilmember, once recognized, shall not be
interrupted when speaking unless called to order by the Mayor or a point of
order or personal privilege is raised by another Councilmember. If a
Councilmember, while speaking, is called to order, the member shall cease
speaking until the question of order is determined. Members of the City staff,
after recognition by the Mayor, shall hold the floor until the completion of
their remarks or until recognition is withdrawn by the presiding officer.
   (d)   Points of order. The Mayor shall determine all “points of order”
subject to the right of any Councilmember to appeal the Mayor’s decision to the
Council. If an appeal is taken, the question shall be, “Shall the decision of
the Mayor be sustained?” A majority vote of those Councilmembers present shall
conclusively determine such question of order.
   (e)   Point of personal privilege. The right of a Councilmember to address
the Council on a question of personal privilege shall be limited to cases in
which the member’s integrity, character or motives are questioned. A
Councilmember raising a point of personal privilege may interrupt another
Councilmember who has the floor only if the Mayor recognizes the privilege.
   (f)   Privilege of closing the debate. The Councilmember moving the adoption
of an ordinance, resolution, or motion shall have the privilege of making the
closing remarks during debate.
   (g)   Limitation of debate. To encourage the full participation of all
members of the Council, no Councilmember or Councilmembers shall be permitted
to monopolize the discussion of the question. If a Councilmember has already
spoken and other Councilmembers wish to speak, the latter Councilmembers should
be recognized in preference to the Councilmember who has already spoken.
However, if no other Councilmembers seek recognition, the Mayor may recognize
the Councilmember who has already spoken.

discussion to the subject to be discussed, and, unless further time is granted
by the Council, limit their remarks to time allocated to the speaker by the
Mayor. All remarks shall be addressed to the Council as a whole and not to
individual staff or any member thereof. No question shall be asked of a
Councilmember or of City staff without the permission of the Mayor.
   (b)   Spokesperson for groups of persons. In order to expedite matters and
to avoid repetitious presentations whenever any group of persons wishes to
address the Council on the same subject matter, it shall be proper for the
Mayor to request that a spokesperson be chosen by the group and, in case
additional matters are to be presented by any other member of such group, to
limit the number of such persons addressing the Council. A written statement
card may be filled out and submitted to the City Clerk indicating the person's
opinion in writing. Those statements will be provided to City Councilmembers
and made part of the meeting record.
   (c)   After motion. After a motion has been made or a public hearing has
been closed, no member of the public shall address the Council from the
audience on the matter under consideration without first securing permission to
do so by the Council.

Sec. 1-9.204. Thousand Oaks City Council functions.
   The City Council shall preserve landmarks and points of historic interest
not in conflict with the public health, safety, and general welfare, and is the
final authority whether an item is designated a landmark of point of historic
interest.
   (a)   The functions of the City Council shall be to:
   (1)   Identify and refer potential landmarks and points of historic interest
which it has a reason to believe are, or will become in the near future, an
historic landmark or point of historic interest, to the Ventura County Cultural
Heritage Board to evaluate consistent with its functions identified in section
1-9.205;
   (2)   Deliberate whether to ratify the decision of the Ventura County
Cultural Heritage Board regarding the designation of a landmark or point of
historic interest;
   (3)   Amend this article when circumstances indicate;
   (4)   Determine which designated landmarks and points of historic interest
shall be marked with uniform and aesthetic markers, and appropriate public
funds therefore;
   (5)   Hear and consider applications for certificates of appropriateness for
any alteration to a landmark or point of historic interest as provided in
Section 1-9.206;
   (6)   Apply to the appropriate state agency for state registration of
landmarks or points of historic interest which meet state registration
criteria, and where the registration would assist in preservation; and,
   (7)   Develop guidelines, standards and criteria for fulfilling its duties
and functions under this article as well as running of its meetings.
   (b)   The City Council may, in its discretion, inspect and investigate a
potential landmark and point of interest rather than refer the item to Ventura
County Cultural Heritage Board in the manner set forth in subsection (a)(1), as
follows:
   (1)   The City shall perform the functions of the Ventura County Cultural
Heritage Board set forth in Section 1-9.205; and,
   (2)   The City Council shall post an agenda and hold a public hearing for
the purpose of identifying the landmark or point of historic-interest. Such
hearing shall be held at least fifteen (15) days or more after the property
owner of the potential landmark or place of historic interest has been notified
of the time and place of the hearing by registered mail.
   (c)   The City shall compile and maintain a list of all current historic,
cultural and natural landmarks, monuments and points of historic interest which
shall be declared as such. This information shall be made available to the
public.
   (d)   The City Council may apply to the appropriate state agency for state
registration of landmarks or sites which have historic significance, which
meet-state registration criteria, and where the registration would assist in
preservation. The City Council may find that even though an item has been
designated a landmark or point of historic interest, it does not warrant
registration as a state “historical landmark.” The City Council shall determine
the appropriate state registration, if any.
   (e)   In the event the City Council does not ratify the Ventura County
Cultural Heritage Board’s decision regarding the designation or rejection of an
item as a landmark or point of historic interest, the item shall remain
undesignated absent further review consistent with this article.

   (a)   Inspect and investigate all potential landmarks and points of historic
interest referred to it by the City Council consistent with the standards of
review set forth in the Ventura County Ordinance Code Sections 1360 through
1373, and determine whether the item is suitable for designation as a landmark
or point of historic interest in the City of Thousand Oaks.
   (b)   Evaluate the historic, architectural, archaeological, cultural or
aesthetic significance of the potential landmark or point of historic interest
to the City of Thousand Oaks including whether the item:
   (1)   Exemplifies or reflects special elements of the City's social,
aesthetic, engineering, architectural or natural history;

the broad patterns of the City's cultural heritage;
   (3)   Is associated with the lives of persons important to the City;
   (4)   Has yielded or has the potential to yield information important to the
prehistory or history of the City;
   (5)   Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or
method of construction, represents the work of a master, or possesses high
artistic values;
   (6)   Has interest to the general public or is limited in interest to a
special group of persons;
   (c)   Determine whether designation of the item as a landmark or point of
historic interest:
   (1)   Would require the expenditure by the City of any amount of money not
commensurate with the value of the item to be preserved;
   (2)   Infringe upon the rights of a private owner thereof to make any and
all reasonable uses thereof which are not in conflict with the purposes of this
Article.
   (d)   Establish the authenticity of the item's physical identity evidenced
by lack of deterioration and significant survival of characteristics that
existed during its period of importance, including the retention of location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association.
   (e)   Conduct a public hearing, with due notice to the property owner of the
potential landmark or place of historic interest, to determine whether the item
is suitable for designation.

is prohibited from defacing, demolishing, adding to, altering, relocating or
removing the specified portion of any structure, land formation or other item
that is designated a landmark or point of historic interest, except as provided
in this article.
   (b)   Landmark alteration; Certificate of appropriateness. If a property
owner desires to demolish, add to, alter, relocate or remove the specified

permit for the parcel on which the structure or land formation designated a
landmark or point of historic interest shall be conditioned upon the City
Council’s acting upon such a Certificate, and the required one hundred eighty
(180) day waiting period.
   Upon a filing of a request for a Certificate, the City Council shall have
ninety (90) days from the date of filing for review of the application and to

of the structure or land formation designated as a landmark or monument, or any
plaque or other aesthetic marker identifying the point of historic interest,
for one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the Council’s disapproval
action.
   During such Certificate review and one hundred eighty (180) day period, the
City Council may take steps necessary to preserve any structure or land
formation designated as a landmark or point of historic interest, such as, but
not limited to, the creation of civic and citizens preservation committees, the
establishment of private and/or public funding efforts for acquisition or
restoration of the declared landmark or point of historic interest, or the
requesting of grant monies for acquisition or restoration.

CHAPTER 10. CODE OF ETHICS FOR OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES
Sec. 1-10.01. Declaration of policy.
   The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials
and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that
government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the
governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and
that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In
recognition of these goals, there is hereby established a code of ethics for
all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. The
purpose of this chapter is to establish ethical standards of conduct for all
such officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are
incompatible with the best interests of the City and by directing the
disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other
interests in matters affecting the City. The provisions of this chapter and
such rules and regulations as may be established are hereby declared to be in
the best interest of the City and for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare of its citizens.
(§ 1, Ord. 868-NS, eff. September 18, 1984)
Sec. 1-10.02. Responsibilities of public office.
   Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office
for the benefit of the public. They are bound to uphold the United States and
State Constitution and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation, State
and the City and thus to foster respect for all governments. They are bound to
observe, in their official acts, the highest standards of performance and to
discharge faithfully the duties of their office, regardless of personal
considerations. Recognizing that the public interests must be their primary
concern, their conduct in both their official and private affairs should be
above reproach.
(§ 1, Ord. 868-NS, eff. September 18, 1984)
Sec. 1-10.03. Dedicated service.
   All officials and employees of the City owe a duty of loyalty to the
political objectives expressed by the electorate and the programs developed by
the Council to attain those objectives. Appointive officials and employees
should adhere to the rules of work and performance established as the standards
for their positions by the appropriate authority.
   Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach the law,
or ask others to do so, and owe a duty to cooperate fully with other public
officials and employees unless prohibited from so doing by law or by the
officially recognized confidentiality of their work.
(§ 1, Ord. 868-NS, eff. September 18, 1984)
Sec. 1-10.04. Fair and equal treatment.
   (a)   Interest in appointments. The canvassing of members of the Council,
directly or indirectly, in order to obtain preferential consideration in
connection with any appointment to the municipal service, shall disqualify the
candidate for appointment except with reference to positions filled by
appointment by the Council.
   (b)   Use of public property. No official or employee shall request or
permit the use of City-owned vehicles, equipment, materials, or property for
personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the
public generally or are provided as municipal policy for the use of such
official or employee in the conduct of official business.
   (c)   Obligations to citizens. No official or employee shall grant any
special consideration, treatment or advantage to any citizen beyond that which
is available to every other citizen.
(§ 1, Ord. 868-NS, eff. September 18, 1984)
Sec. 1-10.05. Conflicts of financial interest.
   With regards to conflicts of financial interests, the following shall be
deemed the “Conflict of Interest Code” of the City of Thousand Oaks as required
by Government Code Section 87300 et seq.:
   (a)   Incorporation of state statutes and regulations. The definitions and
disclosure requirements contained in the Political Reform Act of 1974
(Government Code Section 81000 et seq.), and in the regulations of the Fair
Political Practices Commission (2 Cal. Code of Regs. Section 18730, et seq.),
and any amendments to the Act or regulations, are incorporated by reference
into this section.
   (b)   Designated persons. The City Council shall adopt and periodically
review a resolution designating City employees, boardmembers, commissioners,
committee members, officers and City consultants (herein designated persons),
who must file conflict of financial interest statements. In that resolution
designating persons required to file, the City Council shall set forth the
corresponding disclosure categories for such persons. By said resolution the
City Council has determined that these persons make or participate in the
making of decisions which may foreseeably have a material effect on said
person’s financial interests. All persons holding positions listed in this
resolution shall file conflict of interest statements consistent with the
disclosure categories and this section.
   For purposes of this chapter the term “designated employee” as used in
Government Code Section 81000 et seq. and 2 Cal. Code of Regs. Section 18730,
et seq. shall be included within the definition of designated persons as used
herein.
   (c)   Disclosure categories. Being listed as a city designated person under
this section does not establish any additional disclosure obligation for those
persons who are also specified in Government Code Section 87200 (City
Councilmembers, Planning Commissioners, City Manager, City Attorney, City
Treasurer and candidates for City Council) and, as a result, obligated to file
under state law.
   This section does not establish any additional disclosure obligation for any
designated person who is designated in a conflict of interest code for another
agency, if all of the following apply:
   (1)   The geographical jurisdiction of the City is the same as or is wholly
included within the jurisdiction of the other agency;
   (2)   The disclosure category assigned in the code of the other agency is
the same as the City’s; and
   (3)   The filing officer is the same for both agencies.
   Designated persons who are required to file statements of economic interests
under any other agency’s conflict of interest code may expand their statement
to cover all reportable interests required for both jurisdictions, and file
copies of this expanded statement with both entities in lieu of filing separate
and distinct statements, provided that each copy of such expanded statement
filed in place of an original is signed and verified by the designated person
as if it were an original.
   (d)   Statements of economic interests. Place of filing. Designated persons
shall file their statements of economic interests with the City Clerk who is
deemed the filing officer for purposes of this section.
   (e)   Manner of disqualification. When a designated person determines that
he or she should not make a governmental decision because he or she has a
disqualifying interest in it, the determination not to act must be accompanied
by disclosure of the disqualifying interest. In the case of a voting body, this
determination and disclosure shall be made part of the agency’s official
record; in the case of the City Manager or City Attorney this determination and
disclosure shall be made in writing to the City Council; and in the case of
other designated employees, this determination and disclosure shall be made in
writing to the designated employee's supervisor.
   (f)   Assistance of the commission and counsel. Any designated person who is
unsure of his or her duties under this Code may request assistance from the
City Attorney or the Fair Political Practices Commission pursuant to Government
Code Section 83114, provided that nothing in this section requires the City
Attorney to issue any formal or informal opinion.
   (g)   Violations. Designated persons violating any provision of this section
are subject to the administrative, criminal and civil sanctions provided in the
Political Reform Act, Government Code Sections 81000 through 91014. In
addition, a decision in relation to which a violation of the disqualification
provisions of this section, or of Government Code Section 87100 or 87450, has
occurred may be set aside by the Superior Court as void pursuant to Government
Code Section 91003.

eff. March 4, 1986, § 1, Ord. 1226-NS, eff. January 3, 1995, § 1, Ord. 1329-NS,
eff. January 7, 1999, and Ord. 1601-NS, eff. January 16, 2014)
Sec. 1-10.06. Political activities.
   No appointive official or employee shall orally, by letter or otherwise
solicit or participate in soliciting any assessment, subscription or
contribution to any political party during working hours on the premises of any
governmental property owned by the City and shall at all times conform to the
provisions of Sections 3202 and 3203 of the Government Code of the State.
   No official or employee, whether elected or appointed, shall promise any
appointment to any position with the City as a reward for any political
activity.
(§ 1, Ord. 929-NS, eff. September 2, 1984)
Sec. 1-10.07. Applicability of chapter provisions.
   When a Councilmember or other official or employee has doubt as to the
applicability of a provision of this chapter to a particular situation, he/she
should apply to the Council for an advisory opinion and be guided by that
opinion when given. The Councilmember or other officials or employees shall
have the opportunity to present their interpretations of the facts at issue and
of the applicable provisions of this chapter before such advisory decision is
made. The provisions of this chapter shall be operative in all instances
covered by such provisions, except when superseded by applicable statutory
provisions or when the application of a statutory provision is discretionary
but determined to be more appropriate or desirable.
(§ 1, Ord. 868-NS, eff. September 18, 1984)
Sec. 1-10.08. Ex parte communications.
   No official or employee shall encourage, make or accept any ex parte or
other unilateral application or communication that excludes the interests of
other parties in a matter under consideration when such application or
communication is designed to influence the official decision or conduct of the
official or other officials, employees or agencies in order to obtain a more
favored treatment or special consideration to advance the personal or private
interests of him/herself or others. The purpose of this provision is to
guarantee that all interested parties to any matter shall have equal
opportunity to express and represent their interests.
   Any written ex parte communication received by an official or employee in
matters where all interested parties should have an equal opportunity for a
hearing shall be made a part of the record by the recipient.
   Any oral ex parte communication received under such conditions should be
written down in substance by the recipient and also be made a part of the
record.
   A communication concerning only the status of a pending matter shall not be
regarded as an ex parte communication.
(§ 1, Ord. 868-NS, eff. September 18, 1984)
Sec. 1-10.09. Avoidance of impressions of corruptibility.
   Public officials and employees, whether appointed or elected, full time or
part time, paid or unpaid, should conduct their official and private affairs so
as not to give a reasonable basis for the impression that any such official or
employee can be improperly influenced in the performance of his/her public
duties. Such officials or employees should so conduct themselves as to maintain
public confidence in their performance of the public trust in the government
they represent. They should not be a source of embarrassment to that government
and should avoid even the appearance of conflict between their public duties
and private interests.
(§ 1, Ord. 868-NS, eff. September 18, 1984)
Sec. 1-10.10. Discrimination in appointments.
   No person shall be appointed to, removed from, or in any way favored or
discriminated against with respect to any appointive administrative office
because of such person's race, color, age, religion, sex, national origin,
political opinions, affiliations, or functional limitation as defined by
applicable State or federal laws, if otherwise qualified for the position or
office. This provision shall not be construed to impair administrative
discretion in determining the requirements of a position or in a job assignment
of a person holding such a position, subject to review by the Council.
(§ 1, Ord. 868-NS, eff. September 18, 1984)
Sec. 1-10.11. Investments creating a conflict of interest.
   No Councilmember, official or employee, whether paid or unpaid, should seek
to acquire or obtain any financial interest which would create or may create a
conflict or incompatibility with the performance of his or her official duties.
(§ 1, Ord. 868-NS, eff. September 18, 1984, as amended by § 2, Ord. 911-NS,
eff. March 4, 1986)
Sec. 1-10.12. City allegiance and proper conduct.
   (a)   Incompatible employment. No Councilmember, official or employee shall
engage in or accept any private employment, or render services for private
interest, when such employment or service is incompatible with proper discharge
of his or her official duties or would tend to impair his or her independence
or judgment or action in the performance of those duties.
   (b)   Disclosure of confidential information. No Councilmember, official or
employee shall, without proper authorization of the Council, disclose
confidential information concerning the property, government, or affairs of the
City, nor shall he or she use such information to advance the financial
interest of himself, herself or others.
   (c)   Gifts and favors. No Councilmember, official or employee shall
knowingly accept any gift which creates a conflict of financial interest and is
given by any person, firm, or corporation which to his or her knowledge is
interested, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever in business
dealings with the City. No Councilmember, official or employee shall accept any
gift regardless of amount, retainer or compensation that is contingent upon a
specific action by the City Council, a City commission or a City agency.
   (d)   Representing private interest before the City agencies or courts. No
Councilmember, official or employee whose salary is paid in whole or in part by
the City shall appear on behalf of business or private interests of another
before any agency of the City where such appearance would create a potential of
having to abstain from officials participating on that matter or be
incompatible with that Councilmember’s, official’s or employee’s official
duties. In addition, he or she shall not represent any private interest of
another person or entity in any action or proceeding against the interest of
the City in any litigation to which the City is a party.
   A Councilmember may appear before City agencies on behalf of constituents in
the course of his or her duties as a representative of the electorate or in the
performance of public or civic obligations.
   (e)   Interest in City contracts. Regardless of whether he or she abstained
from participating in the City decision to award or enter into the contract, no
Councilmember, official or employee shall have an investment or monetary
interest in any contract with the City made by them in their official capacity,
or by any board or body of which they are members, except as permitted by
Government Code Section 1090, et seq.
(§ 1, Ord. 868-NS, eff. September 18, 1984, as amended by § 2, Ord. 911-NS,
eff. March 4, 1986, and § 2, Ord. 1226-NS, eff. January 3, 1995)
Sec. 1-10.13. Future employment.
   It shall be improper for any former officer or employee to appear as a
compensated representative at any time before the Council, or any of its
agencies in which they were formerly employed, in connection with any case or
other matter in which such former officer or employee was duly connected in a
policy-making capacity or managerial capacity while an officer or employee of
the City for one (1) year following the termination of the officer or employee.
Such officer or employee may be released from the obligation imposed by the
provisions of this section upon the submission of a written request to the
Council in advance of his/her proposed appearance and a certification that,
while an officer or employee of the City, took no action or obtained no
information which would prejudice his/her conduct or presentation, either at
the time he/she was an officer or employee, or at the time of the presentation.
(§ 1, Ord. 868-NS, eff. September 18, 1984; Ord. 1668-NS, eff. January 10,
2020)
Sec. 1-10.14. Giving testimony.
   It is the duty of municipal employees to answer questions submitted to them
by respectfully constituted authority that may reflect upon the employees’
fitness for municipal office or employment. If any City officer or employee,
after reasonable notice and an opportunity to answer, is called upon or
requested to give testimony or to produce evidence upon relevant matters
pertaining to his/her office or position in connection with any lawful or
constitutional inquiry conducted by the Council, the Ventura County Grand Jury,
and State or federal legislative committee, or the Attorney General of the
State, such officer shall, to the best of his/her ability, answer such
inquiries or shall submit a statement of his/her reasons for refusal thereof to
the Council for its consideration. The Council, where permitted by law, shall
thereafter inform such officer or employee whether or not such officer or
employee is required, as a condition of continued employment, to answer such
questions and the officer or employee continues to refuse to answer the
questions thus propounded, such officer or employee shall resign immediately on
the request of the Council or shall forfeit his/her position at the suit of the
City. Nothing in this provision shall be construed to impair a constitutional
or civil right.
(§ 1, Ord. 868-NS, eff. September 18, 1984)
Sec. 1-10.15. Sanctions.
   In addition to any other penalties or remedies provided by law, any
violation of the provisions of this chapter shall constitute a cause for

1592-NS, effective December 21, 2013.
Sec. 1-13.01. Purpose.
   The purposes of this chapter are;
   (a)   To eliminate the possibility of corruption or the appearance of
corruption in local elections, arising as a result of disproportionately large
political contributions, by adopting the least restrictive limits possible on
the amounts of money any person may contribute or otherwise cause to be
available to candidates for the City Council and those who support or oppose
such candidates; and
   (b)   To promote informed actions by the electors of the City by requiring
the full and truthful disclosure of contributions and expenditures in election
campaigns; and
   (c)   To inhibit improper or illegal campaign activity, and to provide for
enforcement of this chapter; and
   (d)   Pursuant to California Government Code Section 81013, and Elections
Code Section 10202, to impose contribution limitations, disclosure
requirements, and prohibitions in addition to those imposed by state law, but
that do not prevent any person from complying with state law.
(§ 3, Ord. 1592-NS, eff. December 21, 2013)
Sec. 1-13.02. Definitions.
   The definitions set forth in the California Political Reform Act, as it now

this chapter except as to those terms defined in this section:
   “Candidate” means an individual: (i) who is listed on the ballot; or (ii)
who has qualified to have write-in votes on his or her behalf counted by
election officials for nomination or election to the City Council; or (iii) who
receives a contribution or makes an expenditure or gives his or her consent for
any other person to receive a contribution or make an expenditure with a view
to bringing about his or her nomination or election to the City Council,
whether or not the specific City Council office for which he or she will seek
nomination or election is known at the time the contribution is received or the
expenditure is made, and whether or not he or she has announced his or her
candidacy or filed a declaration of candidacy at such time. Candidate also
includes any member of the City Council who is the subject of a recall effort.
   For the purpose of this chapter, a member of the City Council becomes the
subject of a recall effort, and therefore becomes a candidate, at such time as
the notice of intention to circulate petitions is served on that member.
Thereafter, any action taken by a person to advocate the recall of the
candidate shall be deemed to be opposing the candidate, and any action taken by
a person to oppose the recall of the candidate shall be deemed to be supporting
the candidate.
   An individual who becomes a candidate shall retain his or her status as a
candidate until such time as that status is terminated pursuant to Section
84214 of the California Government Code. Candidate does not include any person
within the meaning of Section 301(b) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of
1971.

candidate's withdrawal as a candidate, defeat or date of the election; or (ii)
the date on which outstanding bills or debts owed by the candidate or committee
are paid in full. Contributions received during such ninety (90) day period
shall be used only to pay outstanding bills or debts owed by the candidate or
committee for that election, or to comply with the provisions of Government
Code Section 84308.
   (3)   If, at the end of the period specified in Section 1-13.03(b)(2), there
remains any unexpended balance in the campaign bank account of any such
candidates or committees, such unexpended funds remaining in the account shall
be either kept for the purpose of maintaining available funds to comply with
the requirements under Government Code Section 84308, should an occurrence
requiring such arise; or be disposed of by either returning the funds to
contributors pro rata; turning such funds over to the General Fund of the City
of Thousand Oaks; or donated to any bona fide charitable, educational, civic,
religious, or similar tax exempt, nonprofit organization, where no substantial
part of the proceeds will have a material financial effect on the former

indirectly, by any person or combination of persons acting jointly in a name
other than the name by which they are identified for legal purposes, nor in the
name of another person or combination of persons. No person shall make a
contribution in his or her name of anything belonging to another person or
received from another person on the condition that it be used as a
contribution. Upon discovery by a candidate for elective office, or his or her
campaign treasurer or committee, or ballot measure committee, that a
contribution has been received in violation of this subsection, the amount

contributions are aggregated: “Entity” means any person, other than an
individual; “Majority owned” means an ownership of more than fifty percent.
   (1)   The contributions of an entity whose contributions are directed and
controlled by any individual shall be aggregated with contributions made by
that individual and any other entity whose contributions are directed and
controlled by the same individual;
   (2)   If two or more entities make contributions that are directed and
controlled by a majority of the same persons, the contributions of those
entities shall be aggregated;
   (3)   Contributions made by entities that are majority owned by any person

in their decision to make contributions.

not required to obtain a business tax certificate prior to doing business
within the City nevertheless shall be liable for the payment of the tax imposed
by the provisions of this chapter.

   (d)   Appeals: Council action. The Council shall have the authority to

(§ 2, Ord. 176-NS, eff. December 4, 1970)
Sec. 3-1.06. Unlawful businesses not authorized.
   No business tax certificate issued pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter, or the payment of any tax required under the provisions of this
chapter, shall be construed as authorizing the conduct or continuance of any
illegal business, or of a legal business in an illegal manner, or to conduct
within the City the business for which a business certificate has been issued
without complying with all the provisions of the laws of the City and State and
Federal laws, including, but not limited to, those requiring a permit from any
board, commission, department, or office of the City.
   The Collector shall not issue any business tax certificate, other than a
renewal business tax certificate, to any fixed place of business within the
City until such time as it is shown that the business has met the requirements
of the zoning, building, fire, health, and permit laws of the City. For the
purpose of providing the requisite evidence of such compliance, the Collector
shall provide the forms for the signature of the appropriate officers.
   Failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall constitute
grounds for the refusal, suspension, or revocation of the business tax
certificate.
(§ 2, Ord. 176-NS, eff. December 4, 1970)
Sec. 3-1.07. Branch establishments.
   A separate business tax certificate shall be obtained for each branch
establishment or location of the business transacted and carried on and for
each separate type or category of business at the same location. Each business
tax certificate shall authorize the holder to transact and carry on only the
business described thereby at the location or in the manner designated in such
business tax certificate; provided, however, warehouses used in connection with
or incidental to a business taxed under the provisions of this chapter shall
not be deemed to be separate places of business or branch establishments.
(§ 2, Ord. 176-NS, eff. December 4, 1970)
Sec. 3-1.08. Evidence of doing business.
   When any person shall by use of signs, circulars, cards, telephone books, or
newspapers advertise, hold out, or by any other means represent that he is in
business in the City, or when any person holds an active license or permit
issued by a governmental agency indicating that he is in business in the City,
and such person fails to deny by a sworn statement given to the Collector that
such person is not conducting a business in the City after being requested to
do so by the Collector, then these facts shall be considered prima facie
evidence that such person is conducting a business in the City.
(§ 2, Ord. 176-NS, eff. December 4, 1970)
Sec. 3-1.09. Constitutional apportionment.
   None of the business license taxes provided for in this chapter shall be so
applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative
of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Constitution of the
United States and the State. In any case where a business tax is believed by a
business tax certificate holder or applicant for a business tax certificate to
place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of such
constitutional clauses, he may apply to the Collector for an adjustment of the
business tax. Such application may be made before, at, or within one year after
the payment of the prescribed business tax. The applicant shall, by sworn
statement and supporting testimony, show his method of business, his gross
volume or estimated gross volume of business, and such other information as the
Collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such
undue burden or violation. The Collector shall then conduct an investigation
and, after having first obtained the written approval of the City Attorney,
shall fix as the business tax for the applicant an amount that is reasonable
and nondiscriminatory or, if the business tax has already been paid, shall
order a refund of the amount over and above the business tax so fixed. In
fixing the business tax to be charged the Collector shall have the power to
base the business tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure
which will assure that the business tax assessed shall be uniform with that
assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not
exceed the business tax as prescribed by the provisions of this chapter. Should
the Collector determine the gross receipts measure of business tax to be the
proper basis, he may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of
termination of the applicant’s business in the City or at the end of each three
(3) month period, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of
business tax therefor; provided, however, no additional business tax during any
one calendar year shall be required after the business tax certificate holder
shall have paid an amount equal to the annual business tax as prescribed in
this chapter.
(§ 2, Ord. 176-NS, eff. December 12, 1970)
Sec. 3-1.10. Exemptions.
   The provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed or construed to apply to
any person transacting and carrying on any business exempt by virtue of the
Constitution or applicable statutes of the United States or of the State from
the payment of such taxes as are prescribed in this chapter.
   Any person claiming an exemption pursuant to the provisions of this section
shall file a sworn statement with the Collector stating the facts upon which an
exemption is claimed, and in the absence of such statement substantiating the
claim, such person shall be liable for the payment of the taxes imposed by this
chapter.
   The Collector shall, upon a proper showing contained in the sworn statement,
issue a business tax certificate to such person claiming an exemption pursuant
to the provisions of this section without payment to the City of the business
tax required by this chapter. Such certificate shall show on its face that it
is issued to an exempt holder pursuant to the provisions of this section.
   The Collector, after giving notice and a reasonable opportunity for a
hearing to a business tax certificate holder, may revoke any business tax
certificate granted pursuant to the provisions of this section upon proof that
the exempt holder of such business tax certificate is not entitled to the
exemption as provided in this section.
   (a)   Disabled veterans. No business tax payable pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter shall be payable by any honorably discharged soldier, sailor,
marine, or airman of the United States who suffers from a service-connected
disability and due to this disability is unable to obtain his livelihood by
means of manual labor and who is at the time of application a qualified voter
of the State; subject, however, to the following restrictions, limitations,
regulations and conditions:
   (1)   Every applicant shall furnish a certificate of physical disability

discharge.
   (2)   When an exempt business tax certificate is issued, it shall be
nontransferable and for the exclusive use of the named.

citizen, police officer, or by the Director of Finance or any of his deputies.
   (5)   Every business tax certificate issued pursuant to the provisions of
this section shall expire sixty (60) days from and after the date of issuance,
and a new business tax certificate may thereafter be issued pursuant to the
provisions of this section.
   (6)   It shall be unlawful for any person to transfer or convey the
certificates mentioned in subsection (1) of this subsection to any person for
the purpose of securing the business tax certificate required by the provisions
of this chapter.
   (7)   Failure to comply with any and all the restrictions, limitations,
regulations, and conditions of this subsection (a) shall be grounds for the
revocation of such business tax certificate and for refusing its renewal.
   (b)   Charitable, religious, and nonprofit organizations. Any applicant for
a business tax certificate to solicit funds for charitable, religious, or
nonprofit purposes shall be required to register with the License Department of
the City, identify himself, and establish his authority to act for the
charitable, religious, or nonprofit cause which he purports to represent. The
provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed or construed to require the
payment of a business tax certificate to conduct, manage, or carry on any
business, occupation, or activity of any institution or organization recognized
as a tax exempt institution or organization by the Franchise Tax Board of the
State or Internal Revenue Service of the United States carried on wholly for
the benefit of religious, charitable, or nonprofit purposes and from which
profit is not derived either directly or indirectly by any person. Nor shall
any business tax be required for the conducting of any entertainment, concert,
exhibition, or lecture on scientific, historical, literary, religious, or moral
subjects whenever the receipts or net proceeds of any such entertainment,
concert, exhibition, or lecture are appropriated or turned over to any
religious organization or school or to any bona fide religious or benevolent
purpose within the City; nor shall any business tax be required for the
conducting of any entertainment, dance, concert, exhibition, or lecture by any
religious, charitable, fraternal, educational, military, State, County, or
municipal organization or association whenever the receipts of any such
entertainment, dance, concert, exhibition, or lecture are to be appropriated
for the purpose and objects for which such organization or association was
formed and from which profit is not derived, either directly or indirectly, by
any individual, by any individual; provided, however, the provisions of this
section shall not be deemed to exempt any person, organization, or association
from complying with the provisions of this Code requiring a permit from the
Council or any commission or officer to conduct, manage, or carry on any
profession, trade, calling, or occupation.
   Such exemption shall not be construed to extend to any person, business,
corporation or organization receiving a fee, wage, stipend, salary, emolument,
remuneration, compensation, or pay for the performance of the business,
occupation, or activity. Any such person, business, corporation, or
organization shall be subject to the business tax provisions of this chapter.
The person, business, corporation, or organization shall deduct the appropriate
business tax from the moneys conveyed for services rendered and shall cause the
same to be conveyed to the Director of Finance prior to the business,
occupation, or activity being undertaken.
   (1)   Volunteer workers receiving no remuneration whatsoever shall be exempt
from the business tax provisions of this chapter.

any part-time occupation provided the gross income of such natural person,
minor, or adult over sixty-five (65) from the business, trade occupation, or
calling does not exceed One Thousand Two Hundred and no/100ths ($1,200.00)
Dollars per year.

tax certificate; provided, however, the Collector may issue for each tax period
for which the business tax has been paid one identification sticker, tag,

business where the tax is measured by the gross receipts from such items.

in the manner provided in this section for serving notices of the action taken

five Thousand and no/100th ($75,000.00) Dollars and over and originally

   The Council hereby declares that this chapter is adopted to achieve the
following, among other, purposes and directs that the provisions hereof be

and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code of the State;

identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State insofar as those
provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained
in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the said Revenue and Taxation Code;
   (c)   To adopt a sales and use tax law which imposes a tax and provides a
measure therefor which can be administered and collected by the State Board of
Equalization in a manner which adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and
requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes; and
   (d)   To adopt a sales and use tax law which can be administered in a manner
that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of
Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code of the State, minimize the cost of
collecting City sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of
record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this
chapter.
(§ 4, Ord. 6)
Sec. 3-13.05. Contract with State.
   Prior to January 1, 1965, the City shall contract with the State Board of

operation of this sales and use tax law; provided, however, if the City shall
not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to January 1,

shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of
such a contract rather than January 1, 1965.
(§ 5, Ord. 6)
Sec. 3-13.06. Sales tax.
   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is
hereby imposed upon all retailers in the City at the rate of nine hundred

(§ 6, Ord. 6)
Sec. 3-13.07. Place of sale.
   For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the

from such sales shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to
the State sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made.

at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and

of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the State Board of
Control, the State Board of Equalization, the State Treasury, or the
Constitution of the State; the substitution shall not be made when the result
of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the City,
or any agency thereof, rather than by or against the State Board of
Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or
operation of this chapter; the substitution shall not be made in those sections
including, but not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior
boundaries of the State where the result of the substitution would be to
provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use,
or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be
exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use, or other consumption
remains subject to tax by the State under the provisions of Part 1 of Division
2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code of the State, or to impose this tax with
respect to certain sales, storage, use, or other consumption of tangible
personal property which would not be subject to tax by the State under the said
provisions of that Code; the substitution shall not be made in Sections 6701,
6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6797, or 6828 of the

CHAPTER 19. MUNICIPAL SOLAR UTILITY
Sec. 3-19.01. Findings.
   The City Council of the City of Thousand Oaks hereby makes the following
findings:
   (a)   The residents of the City of Thousand Oaks face the certainty of
continued escalating prices for home energy supplies and continued dependence
upon imported sources of energy.
   (b)   Solar energy has been found to be an inexhaustible, reliable and
nonpolluting energy resource that can contribute to the public health, safety
and welfare of the citizens of Thousand Oaks by lessening dependence upon
nonrenewable and imported sources of energy.
   (c)   The high initial cost of purchasing and installing a solar energy
device is the primary economic barrier to expanded solar energy use. Leasing of
solar energy devices has proven to be an effective means to reduce this
economic barrier and may be an attractive economic alternative to ownership for
many consumers.
   (d)   Section 17052.5 of the State Revenue and Taxation Code restricts
eligibility for the fifty-five (55%) percent California Solar Tax Credit for
leased systems to lessors granted a permit from a municipal solar utility
program established by ordinance prior to January 1, 1983.
   (e)   The establishment of a municipal solar utility program can increase
public awareness of solar energy alternatives and lead to a greater degree of
consumer protection and consumer confidence in leasing solar energy systems,
thus substantially increasing the use of solar energy within the City of
Thousand Oaks.
(§ 1, Ord. 825-NS, eff. December 21, 1982)
Sec. 3-19.02. Intent.
   It is the intent of this chapter to establish a municipal solar utility
within the City of Thousand Oaks for the purpose of facilitating the direct
leasing of solar energy equipment and to establish regulatory authority for any
solar leasing operation that may be conducted under the program.
(§ 1, Ord. 825-NS, eff. December 21, 1982)
Sec. 3-19.03. Definitions.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have
the meanings ascribed to them by this section:
   (a)   “Leasing company” shall mean any person advertising, marketing,
placing and arranging, pursuant to a lease arrangement, for installation and
servicing of solar energy devices for a fee.
   (b)   “Municipal solar utility (MSU)” shall mean any program conducted by a
local government or its authorized agent to promote the utilization of
renewable energy and energy conservation technologies through educational,
consumer protection or financial assistance programs.
   (c)   “Solar lease arrangement” shall mean a contract between a lessee and
an investor for the leasing of solar energy devices, owned by the investor and
leased and possessed by the lessee, which devices are affixed to or located at
and servicing the real property owned or occupied by the lessee.
   (d)   “Solar energy device” shall include equipment and materials that are
intended to be located on or affixed to real property that uses solar energy
directly to:
   (1)   Heat or cool a building or structure;
   (2)   Provide domestic hot water or hot water for recreational or
therapeutic purposes;
   (3)   Provide process heat or mechanical energy;
   (4)   Generate electricity.
(§ 1, Ord. 825-NS, eff. December 21, 1982)
Sec. 3-19.04. Regulation of solar leasing operations.
   (a)   No person shall operate as a certified solar leasing company under the
Municipal Solar Utility Program of the City of Thousand Oaks as established
herein without having obtained a valid solar leasing permit from the City. Such
a permit shall authorize the conduct of solar leasing operations under the
Municipal Solar Utility Program for a period of up to three years and may be
renewable.
   (b)   After this effective date of the ordinance establishing this chapter
and within seventy-five (75) days after receiving the first written request
from a leasing company for a solar leasing permit, the City Council shall, by
resolution, establish all requirements for obtaining certification under the
Municipal Solar Utility Program. Such requirements shall include those which
protect consumers against any inexperienced or financially unstable solar
leasing companies, substandard equipment or installation practices or unfair
lease arrangements.
   (c)   Reasonable fees shall be determined to cover the costs of
administering this chapter and may be established by resolution of the City
Council.
(§ 1, Ord. 825-NS, eff. December 21, 1982)
CHAPTER 20. MISCELLANEOUS FEES: COST RECOVERY

adjusted rate that exceeds the maximum rate calculated pursuant to Subdivision
(d) of this Section for the date on which the adjusted rate will commence.
   (d)   The maximum rate shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)   For every person who is engaged in commercial cannabis cultivation

percent of gross receipts.

retailer (dispensary) or non-store front retailer (delivery business), or
microbusiness (retail sales activity) the maximum tax rate shall not exceed six
(6%) percent of gross receipts.
      (4)   For every person who engages in a cannabis distribution business,
the maximum tax rate shall not exceed three (3%) percent of gross receipts.
      (5)   For every person who engages in a cannabis manufacturing,
processing, or microbusiness (non-retail activity) or any other type of
cannabis business not described in Sections (d)(1), (2), (3) or (4), the
maximum tax rate shall not exceed four (4%) percent of gross receipts.

require that a deposit, to be applied against the taxes for a calendar quarter,
be made by a taxpayer at the beginning of that calendar quarter. In no event
shall the deposit required by the Tax Administrator exceed the tax amount he or
she projects will be owed by the taxpayer for the calendar quarter. The Tax
Administrator may require that a taxpayer make payments via a cashier's check,
money order, wire transfer, or similar instrument.
   (e)   For purposes of this section, the square feet of canopy space for a

this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed to the City. Any person owing money to
the City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable in an action
brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such debt. The provisions

or the failure to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter.
(§ 1, Ord. 1657-NS, eff. January 1, 2019)
Sec. 3-21.17. Apportionment.
   If a business subject to the tax is operating both within and outside the
City, it is the intent of the City to apply the Cannabis Business Tax so that
the measure of the tax fairly reflects the proportion of the taxed activity
actually carried on in the City. To the extent federal or state law requires
that any tax due from any taxpayer be apportioned, the taxpayer may indicate
said apportionment on his or her tax return. The Tax Administrator may
promulgate administrative procedures for apportionment as he or she finds
useful or necessary.
(§ 1, Ord. 1657-NS, eff. January 1, 2019)
Sec. 3-21.18. Constitutionality and legality.
   This tax is intended to be applied in a manner consistent with the United
States and California Constitutions and state law. None of the tax provided for
by this chapter shall be applied in a manner that causes an undue burden upon
interstate commerce, a violation of the equal protection or due process clauses
of the Constitutions of the United States or the State of California or a
violation of any other provision of the California Constitution or state law.
If a person believes that the tax, as applied to him or her, is impermissible
under applicable law, he or she may request that the Tax Administrator release
him or her from the obligation to pay the impermissible portion of the tax.
(§ 1, Ord. 1657-NS, eff. January 1, 2019)
Sec. 3-21.19. Audit and examination of premises and records.

power to inspect any location where commercial cannabis cultivation occurs and
to audit and examine all books and records (including, but not limited to
bookkeeping records, state and federal income tax returns, and other records
relating to the gross receipts of the business) of persons engaged in cannabis
businesses. In conducting such investigation, the Tax Administrator shall have
the power to inspect any equipment, such as computers or point of sale
machines, that may contain such records.
   (b)   It shall be the duty of every person liable for the collection and
payment to the City of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve,
for a period of at least three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to
determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the
collection of and payment to the City, which records the Tax Administrator or
his/her designee shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.
(§ 1, Ord. 1657-NS, eff. January 1, 2019)

to repeal, amend, be in lieu of, replace or in any way affect any tax, fee or
other charge imposed, assessed or required by, under, or by virtue of any other
chapter of this code, or any other ordinance or resolution of the City. Any
references made or contained in any other chapter of this code to any licenses,
license taxes, fees, or charges, or to any schedule of license fees, shall be
deemed to refer to the licenses, license taxes, fees or charges, or schedule of
license fees, provided for in other chapters of this code.
   (b)   Notwithstanding subdivision (a) of this section a cannabis business
shall not be required to pay the license fee required by Chapter 3-1 of Title 3
of this code so long as all of business's activities within the City that would
require payment of a license fee are activities subject to the Cannabis
Business Tax.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may revoke or refuse to renew the license
required by Chapter 3-1 of this code for any business that is delinquent in the
payment of any tax due pursuant to this chapter or that fails to make a deposit
required by the Tax Administrator pursuant to Section
3-21.06(d).
(§ 1, Ord. 1657-NS, eff. January 1, 2019)
Sec. 3-21.21. Payment of tax does not authorize unlawful business.
   (a)   The payment of a Cannabis Business Tax required by this chapter, and
its acceptance by the City, shall not entitle any person to carry on any
cannabis business unless the person has complied with all of the requirements
of this code and all other applicable state laws.
   (b)   No tax paid under the provisions of this chapter shall be construed as
authorizing the conduct or continuance of any illegal or unlawful business, or
any business in violation of any local or state law.
(§ 1, Ord. 1657-NS, eff. January 1, 2019)
Sec. 3-21.22. Deficiency determinations.
   If the Tax Administrator is not satisfied that any statement filed as
required under the provisions of this chapter is correct, or that the amount of
tax is correctly computed, he or she may compute and determine the amount to be
paid and make a deficiency determination upon the basis of the facts contained
in the statement, or upon the basis of any information in his or her possession
or that may come into his or her possession within three (3) years of the date
the tax was originally due and payable. One (1) or more deficiency
determinations of the amount of tax due for a period or periods may be made.
When a person discontinues engaging in a business, a deficiency determination
may be made at any time within three (3) years thereafter as to any liability
arising from engaging in such business whether or not a deficiency
determination is issued prior to the date the tax would otherwise be due.
Whenever a deficiency determination is made, a notice shall be given to the
person concerned in the same manner as notices of assessment are given under
Section
3-21.24.
(§ 1, Ord. 1657-NS, eff. January 1, 2019)
Sec. 3-21.23. Failure to report, nonpayment, or fraud.
   (a)   Under any of the following circumstances, the Tax Administrator may
make and give notice of an assessment of the amount of tax owed by a person
under this chapter at any time:

provisions of this chapter;
      (2)   If the person has not paid the tax due under the provisions of this
chapter;
      (3)   If the person has not, after demand by the Tax Administrator, filed
a corrected statement, or furnished to the Tax Administrator adequate
substantiation of the information contained in a statement already filed, or
paid any additional amount of tax due under the provisions of this chapter; or
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any
business tax due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five
(25%) percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to
penalties and interest otherwise stated in this chapter and any other penalties
allowed by law.
   (b)   The notice of assessment shall separately set forth the amount of any
tax known by the Tax Administrator to be due or estimated by the Tax
Administrator, after consideration of all information within the Tax
Administrator's knowledge concerning the business and activities of the person
assessed, to be due under each applicable section of this chapter, and shall
include the amount of any penalties or interest accrued on each amount to the
date of the notice of assessment.

business or to such other address as he or she shall register with the Tax
Administrator for the purpose of receiving notices provided under this chapter;
or, should the person have no address registered with the Tax Administrator for
such purpose, then to such person's last known address. For the purposes of
this section, a service by mail is complete at the time of deposit in the
United States mail.
(§ 1, Ord. 1657-NS, eff. January 1, 2019)
Sec. 3-21.25. Tax assessment: Hearing, application and determination.
   Within thirty (30) days after the date of service, the person may apply in
writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the assessment. If
application for a hearing before the City is not made within the time herein

hearing, the Tax Administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing
before him or her no later than sixty (60) days after the receipt of the
application, unless a later date is agreed to by the Tax Administrator and the
person requesting the hearing. Notice of such hearing shall be given by the Tax
Administrator to the person requesting such hearing not later than five (5)
days prior to such hearing. At such hearing said applicant may appear and offer

written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in Section
3-21.24 for giving notice of assessment.
(§ 1, Ord. 1657-NS, eff. January 1, 2019)

(§ 1, Ord. 1657-NS, eff. January 1, 2019)
Sec. 3-21.27. Conviction for violation: Taxes not waived.

Sec. 3-21.28. Violation deemed a misdemeanor.

provision of law or equity are cumulative. The use of one (1) or more remedies
by the City shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of
enforcing the provisions of this chapter.
(§ 1, Ord. 1657-NS, eff. January 1, 2019)
Sec. 3-21.30. Amendment or repeal.

of the tax;
   (b)   An action that interprets or clarifies the methodology of the tax, or
any definition applicable to the tax, so long as interpretation or
clarification (even if contrary to some prior interpretation or clarification)

had, for some period of time, failed to collect the tax.

fourteen (14) days following the mailing of the notice of denial, suspension,
revocation, or conditioning sent to the applicant to the address listed by the
applicant pursuant to this chapter. The written appeal must contain all reasons
and documentary support why the denial, revocation, suspension, or conditioning
should be overturned. Any successful appeal will result in approval or
reinstatement of an approval and refund of any fines collected by the City.
      (1)   The City Manager shall not accept an appeal, and no hearing shall
be held, unless the appellant has paid a filing fee, in an amount set by
resolution of the City Council, to defray the cost of such appeal. Any appeal
without the timely payment of fees shall be considered to be untimely.

in the conduct of their affairs regardless of the existence of any common law
or statutory rule which might make admission of such evidence improper over
objection in civil actions. Hearsay evidence may be admissible if it is the
sort upon which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of
serious affairs. The rules of privilege shall be applicable to the extent they
are permitted in civil actions. Irrelevant, collateral, and repetitious
testimony shall be excluded.
      (5)   In the case of denial of an initial permit application the
appellant shall have the burden of proving that he or she meets the
requirements for issuing the permit in the first instance; in the case of the
conditioning, revocation or denial of a permit renewal, the City shall have the

      (6)   Based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, the City Manager
shall determine whether the decision should be affirmed, modified or reversed.
      (7)   The City Manager's decision shall be communicated in writing to the
appellant within seven (7) calendar days after the close of the hearing and
submission of the matter to the City Manager for decision. The City Manager's

shall state the reasons therefor.
      (8)   The decision of the City Manager shall include notice that the
decision is final and conclusive, that judicial review may be sought therefrom
pursuant to California Civil Procedure Code Section 1094.5, and that any action
filed in the Superior Court shall be filed within ninety (90) days following

   A Resident Parking Permit is automatically suspended as soon as notice of
revocation is delivered to the permit holder. The suspension shall become a
permanent revocation if either (1) no timely appeal is filed, or (2) the City

any period of suspension, a Resident Parking Permit shall not be valid nor
shall it exempt a vehicle from compliance with this Section.

holder may appeal a decision to deny or revoke a permit to the City Engineer.
Any such appeal shall be in writing and shall be filed with the City Engineer
within seven (7) calendar days after delivery of a notice of denial or
revocation. If such an appeal is made, the applicant or permit holder shall be
given an opportunity for a review and meeting concerning the decision by the
City Engineer or his designee. The City Engineer or his designee is authorized
to affirm, reverse or modify any such decision. Notice of the determination on
reconsideration shall be in writing.
   (2)   Appeal to the City Council (final appeal). Any applicant or permit
holder may appeal the determination of the City Engineer to the City Council.
Any such appeal (1) shall be in writing, (2) shall state the reasons for the
appeal, and (3) shall be filed with the City Engineer’s determination. If such
an appeal is timely made, the applicant or permit holder shall be given an
opportunity for a review by and meeting with the City Council concerning the
denial or revocation of the permit. The City Council is authorized to affirm,
reverse or modify any such denial or revocation.
   (s)   Penalty provisions.

twenty-four (24) hours apart have indicated that three (3) or more vehicles
displaying “for sale” signs have been parked at that location or along a high
volume street;
   (2)   That the parking of vehicles at this location or along this street in
groups significantly interferes with the flow of traffic or with vehicular or
pedestrian safety;
   (3)   That the rights of those who own, control or have possession of a

area expeditiously or not without stopping en route except when reasonably
required for the same and orderly conduct of the parade; or

CHAPTER 7. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION*
*   Chapter 7 entitled “Flood Damage Prevention,” codified from Ordinance No.
696-NS, repealed by Section I, Ordinance No. 994-NS, effective April 12, 1988
and repealed by § 1, 1531-NS, effective February 11, 2010.
Sec. 4-7.01. Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and methods.
   (a)   Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of California
has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local
governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
   (b)   Findings of fact. The City Council finds:
   (1)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Thousand Oaks are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (2)   These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities also contributes to flood losses.
   (c)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable
regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and
privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide [i.e. mudflow] or flood
related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:
   (1)   Protect human life and health;
   (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted
areas caused by flood damage;
   (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
   (8)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
   (d)   Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter includes regulations to:
   (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
   (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.

Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface
elevation of the base flood.
   (u)   “Floodplain or flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to
being inundated by water from any source. See “Flooding.”
   (v)   “Floodplain Administrator” is the community official designated by
title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.
   (w)   “Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and
enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but
not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain
management regulations, and open space plans.
   (x)   “Floodplain management regulations” means this chapter and other
zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other
application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas.
This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination
thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and
damage.
   (y)   “Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate

the “Regulatory Floodway” where encroachment may be permitted.
   (bb)   “Fraud and victimization” as related to Sec. 4-7.06 of this chapter,
means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the
public. In examining this requirement, the City of Thousand Oaks will consider
the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government
responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one-
hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the
base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of
damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a
whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that
those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase
the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be
insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
   (cc)   “Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot perform its
intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to
water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are

for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
   (ee)   “Hardship” as related to Sec. 4-7.06 of this chapter means the
exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested
variance. The City requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and
peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is
not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be
resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
   (ff)   “Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the
ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   (gg)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
   (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
   (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district;
   (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states
with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary
of Interior; or
   (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either
by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or
directly by “the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
   (hh)   “Levee” means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment,
designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to
contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from
temporary flooding.
   (ii)   “Levee system” means a flood protection system which consists of a
levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage
devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering
practices.
   (jj)   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area,
including basement (see “Basement” definition).
   (1)   An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that
is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area
other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor
provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements,
including, but not limited to:
   (2)   The flood openings standard in Sec. 4-7.05(a)(3);
   (3)   The anchoring standards in Sec. 4-7.05(a)(1);
   (4)   The construction materials and methods standards in Sec. 4-7.05(b);
and
   (5)   The standards for utilities in Sec. 4-7.05(b).
   (kk)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle”.
   (ll)   “Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous
parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or
sale.
   (mm)   “Market value” is defined in the City of Thousand Oaks substantial
damage/ improvement procedures. See Sec. 4-7.04(b)(2).
   (nn)   “Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance
Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations
shown on a community's Flood. Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
   (oo)   “New construction,” for floodplain management purposes, means
structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after October
17,1978, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (pp)   “New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home
park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum,
the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final
site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after.
   (qq)   “Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation,
channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel,
refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or
projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.
   (rr)   “One-hundred-year flood” or “100-year flood” see “Base flood.”
   (ss)   “Program deficiency” means a defect in a community's floodplain
management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective

or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream,
canal, or basin.
   (uu)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:
   (1)   Built on a single chassis;
   (2)   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
   (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty

temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (w)   “Regulatory floodway” means the channel of a river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to
discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than one (1') foot.
   (ww)   “Remedy a violation” means to bring the structure or other
development into compliance with State or local floodplain management
regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its
noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the
structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the
enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar
violations, or reducing State or Federal financial exposure with regard to the
structure or other development.
   (xx)   “Riverine” means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river
(including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
   (yy)   “Sheet flow area.” See “Area of shallow flooding.”
   (zz)   “Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area in the floodplain
subject to a one (1%) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or, AH.
   (aaa)   “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement and other
proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one
hundred and eighty (180) days from the date of the permit. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
   (bbb)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building that is principally
above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured
home.
   (ccc)   “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty (50%) percent of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (ddd)   “Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty (50%) percent of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
   (eee)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   (fff)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   (ggg)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this
chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be
prohibited by this chapter.
   (hhh)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without
the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of
compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such
time as that documentation is provided.
   (iii)   “Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum
(NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies
in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
   (jjj)   “Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo,
channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least
periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which
substantial flood damage may occur.

Sec. 4-7.03. General Provisions.
   (a)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the City of Thousand
Oaks.
   (b)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) in the "Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Ventura County, California and
Incorporated Areas" dated January 3, 1983, with accompanying Flood Insurance
Rate Maps (FIRM'S) dated January 3, 1983 and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps
(FBFM's), dated June 7, 1974, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions,
are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This
FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter
and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation
of this chapter and which are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain
Administrator. The study, FIRM'S and FBFM's are on file at the Public Works
Department, 2100 E. Thousand Oaks Boulevard, Thousand Oaks, California.
   (c)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed,
located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms
of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements
(including violations of conditions and safeguards) shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the City Council from taking such
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
   (d)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (e)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
   (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (f)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of City of Thousand Oaks, any officer or employee thereof, the State of
California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made hereunder.
   (g)   Severability. This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby
declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the ordinance as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the
section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

Sec. 4-7.04. Administration.
   (a)   Designation Of The Floodplain Administrator. The City Engineer or his/
her designee is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this
chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its
provisions.
   (b)   Duties And Responsibilities Of The Floodplain Administrator. The
duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but
not be limited to the following:
   (1)   Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine:
   (i)   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including
determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing
structures;
   (ii)   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;
   (iii)   The site is reasonably safe from flooding;
   (iv)   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one (1') foot at any point within the City of Thousand Oaks; and
   (v)   All letters of map revision (LOMR's) for flood control projects are
approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building Permits must not
be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved
CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land
preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition.
   (2)   Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage
Procedures. Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About
Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying
and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial
damage, to include defining "Market Value." Assure procedures are coordinated
with other departments/divisions and implemented by City staff.
   (3)   Review, use and development of other base flood data. When base flood
elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Sec.
4-7.03(b), the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or
state agency, or other source, in order to administer Sec.
4-7.05.
   NOTE: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from
the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate
Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood
Elevations" dated July 1995.
   (4)   Notification of other agencies.
   (i)   Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:
   (aa)   Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water
Resources prior to alteration or relocation;
   (ab)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency; and
   (ac)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
   (ii)   Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations:
   (aa)   Within six (6) months of information becoming available or project
completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or
assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA
for a letter of map revision (LOMR).
   (ab)   All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the
issuance of building permits. Building Permits must not be issued based on
conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow
construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation' as
specified in the "start of construction" definition.
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical
changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain
management requirements are based on current data.
   (iii)   Changes in corporate boundaries:
   Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified
by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community
clearly delineating the new corporate limits.
   (5)   Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for
public inspection and make available as needed the following:

   (vi)   Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification
for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report
submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (6)   Map Determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact
location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions.
The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Sec.
4-7.04(d).
   (7)   Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as
specified in Sec.
4-7.03(c).

Sec. 4-7.05. Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
   (a)   Standards of construction. In all areas of special flood hazards the
following standards are required:
   (1)   Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements of
structures, including manufactured homes, shall be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
   (2)   Construction Materials and Methods. All new construction and
substantial improvements of structures, including manufactured homes, shall be
constructed:
   (i)   With flood resistant materials, and utility equipment resistant to
flood damage for areas below the base flood elevation;
   (ii)   Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   (iii)   With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding; and
   (iv)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (3)   Crawlspace construction. This sub-section applies to buildings with
crawl spaces up to two (2') feet below grade. Below-grade crawl space
construction in accordance with the requirements listed below will not be
considered basements.
   (i)   The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Crawl
space construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than
five (5') feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design
professional, such as a registered architect or professional engineer;
   (ii)   The crawl space is an enclosed area below the BFE and, as such, must
have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters. For guidance on flood openings, see FEMA
Technical Bulletin 1-93;
   (iii)   Crawl space construction is not permitted in V zones. Open pile or
column foundations that withstand storm surge and wave forces are required in V
zones;
   (iv)   Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with
materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation
walls of the crawl space used to elevate the building, but also any joists,
insulation, or other materials that extend below the BFE; and
   (v)   Any building utility systems within the crawl space must be elevated
above BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the
system components during flood conditions.
   (vi)   Requirements for all below-grade crawl space construction, in
addition to the above requirements, to include the following:
   (aa)   The interior grade of a crawl space below the BFE must not be more
than two (2') feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG), shown as D
in Figure 3 of Technical Bulletin 11-01;
   (ab)   The height of the below-grade crawl space, measured from the interior
grade of the crawl space to the top of the crawl space foundation wall must not
exceed four (4') feet (shown as L in Figure 3 of Technical Bulletin 11-01) at
any point;
   (ac)   There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters
from the interior area of the crawl space within a reasonable period of time
after a flood event, not to exceed seventy-two (72) hours; and
   (ad)   The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five (5')
feet per second for any crawl space. For velocities in excess of five (5') feet
per second, other foundation types should be used.
   (4)   Elevation and floodproofing.
   (i)   Residential construction. All new construction or substantial
improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including
basement:
   (aa)   In AE, AH, A1-30 Zones, elevated to or above the base flood
elevation.
   (ab)   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height
equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or
elevated at least two (2') feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth
number is specified.
   (ac)   In an A zone, without BFE's specified on the FIRM [unnumbered A
zone], elevated to or above the base flood elevation; as determined under Sec.
4-7.04(b)(3). Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest
floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or
licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be
properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (ii)   Nonresidential construction. All new construction or substantial
improvements of nonresidential structures shall either be elevated to conform
with Sec.
4-7.05(a)(4)(i); or
   (ab)   Be floodproofed, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the elevation recommended under Sec.
4-7.05(a)(4)(f), so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water;
   (ac)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
   (ad)   Be certified by a registered civil engineer or architect that the
standards of Sec.
4-7.05(a)(4)(ii)(aa) and (ab) are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
   (iii)   Flood openings. All new construction and substantial improvements of
structures with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding
basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must meet the
following minimum criteria:
   (aa)   For non-engineered openings:
   (A)   Have a minimum of two (2) openings on different sides having a total
net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding;
   (B)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1') foot above
grade;
   (C)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater; and
   (D)   Buildings with more than one (1) enclosed area must have openings on
exterior walls for each area to allow flood water to directly enter; or
   (ab)    Be certified by a registered civil engineer or architect.
   (iv)   Manufactured homes. See Sec.
4-7.05(d).
   (v)   Garages and low cost accessory structures.
   (aa)   Attached garages.
   (A)   A garage attached to a residential structure, constructed with the
garage floor slab below the BFE, must be designed to allow for the automatic
entry of flood waters. See Sec.
4-7.05(a)(4)(iii). Areas of the garage below the BFE must be constructed with
flood resistant materials. See Sec.
4-7.05(a)(2).
   (B)   A garage attached to a nonresidential structure must meet the above
requirements or be dry floodproofed. For guidance on below grade parking areas,
see FEMA Technical Bulletin TB-6.
   (ab)   Detached garages and accessory structures.
   (A)   "Accessory structures" used solely for parking (two (2) car detached
garages or smaller) or limited storage (small, low-cost sheds), as defined in
Sec.
4-7.02, may be constructed such that its floor is below the base flood
elevation (BFE), provided the structure is designed and constructed in
accordance with the following requirements:
   I.   Use of the accessory structure must be limited to parking or limited
storage;
   II.   The portions of the accessory structure located below the BFE must be
built using flood-resistant materials;
   III.   The accessory structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse and lateral movement;
   IV. Any mechanical and utility equipment in the accessory structure must be
elevated or floodproofed to or above the BFE;
   V.   The accessory structure must comply with floodplain encroachment
provisions in Sec.
4-7.05(f); and
   VI.   The accessory structure must be designed to allow for the automatic

4-7.05(a)(4)(iii).
   (B)   Detached garages and accessory structures not meeting the above
standards must be constructed in accordance with all applicable standards in
Sec.
4-7.05(a).
   (b)    Standards for utilities.
   (1)   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall
be designed to minimize or eliminate:
   (i)   Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and
   (ii)   Discharge from the systems into flood waters.
   (2)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them, or contamination from them during flooding.
   (c)   Standards for subdivisions and other proposed development.
   (1)   All new subdivisions proposals and other proposed development,
including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than
fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall:
   (i)   Identify the special flood hazard areas (SFHA) and base flood
elevations (BFE).
   (ii)   Identify the elevations of lowest floors of all proposed structures
and pads on the final plans.
   (iii)   If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the following
as-built information for each structure shall be certified by a registered
civil engineer or licensed land surveyor and provided as part of an application
for a letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) to the Floodplain
Administrator:
   (aa)   Lowest floor elevation.
   (ab)   Pad elevation.
   (ac)   Lowest adjacent grade.

drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (d)   Standards for manufactured homes.
   (1)   All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, on
sites located: (1) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (2) in a
new manufactured home park or subdivision; (3) in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or (4) in an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial
damage" as the result of a flood, shall:
   (i)   Within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be

   (2)   Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the City of Thousand Oaks shall
prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil
engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not
result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
   (3)   If Secs.
4-7.05(f)(1) and (2) are satisfied, all new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sec.
4-7.05.

1531-NS, eff. February 11, 2010; reenacted by § 2, said Ord. 1531-NS)
Sec. 4-7.06. Variance procedures.
   (a)   Nature of variances. The issuance of a variance is for floodplain
management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute
according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a
variance.
   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based
on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of
property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel
of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be
unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
   It is the duty of the City of Thousand Oaks to help protect its citizens
from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from
the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite
rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate.
   (b)   Conditions for variances.
   (1)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-
half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the
procedures of Secs.
4-7.04 and
4-7.05 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
   (2)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic
structures" (as defined in Sec.
4-7.02 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
   (3)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
"Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the
requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the City of Thousand Oaks need not grant
permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation
the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City of Thousand
Oaks believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local
ordinance.
   (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
   (i)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as Twenty-five and no/100ths ($25.00) Dollars for One Hundred
($100.00) Dollars of insurance coverage, and
   (ii)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by
the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Ventura County Recorder and
shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the
affected parcel of land.
   (6)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
   (c)   Appeal Board.
   (1)   In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and the:
   (i)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others;
   (ii)   Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
   (iii)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
   (iv)   Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
   (v)   Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
   (vi)   Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are
not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
   (vii)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
   (viii)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
   (ix)   Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
   (x)   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
   (xi)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.
   (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a:
   (i)   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
   (ii)   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and
   (iii)   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary
public expense, create a nuisance (see "Public safety and nuisance"), cause
"fraud and victimization" of the public, or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
   (3)   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement,
and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that the provisions of Secs.
4-7.06(c)(1) through (4) are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not
create a public nuisance.
   (4)   Upon consideration of the factors of Sec.
4-7.06(b)(1) and the purposes of this chapter, the City Council may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.

Sec. 4-7.07. Alluvial Fan Advisory.
   (a)   Hazards of Alluvial Fan Development. Alluvial fans present a unique
flood hazard environment where the combination of sediment, slope, and
topography create an ultra hazardous condition for which elevation on fill will
not provide reliable protection. Active alluvial fan flooding is characterized
by flow path uncertainty combined with abrupt deposition and erosion. As a
result, any area of an alluvial fan may be subject to intense flood hazards.
   The technology of mathematically modeling the hydrodynamics of water and
debris flows for alluvial fans is still in the early development stage. The
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has formulated a mapping procedure
for the purpose of defining the likelihood of flood hazards on inundated
alluvial fan zones to be used for flood insurance purposes and general
floodplain regulation, referred to as the FEMA alluvial fan methodology.
   An active alluvial fan flooding hazard is indicated by three related
criteria:
   (1)   Flow path uncertainty below the hydrographic apex;
   (2)   Abrupt deposition and ensuing erosion of sediment as a stream or
debris flow loses its competence to carry material eroded from a steeper,
upstream source area; and
   (3)   An environment where the combination of sediment availability, slope,
and topography creates an ultra hazardous condition for which elevation on fill
will not reliably mitigate the risk.
   Inactive alluvial fan flooding is similar to traditional riverine flood
hazards, but occurs only on alluvial fans. It is characterized by flow paths
with a higher degree of certainty in realistic assessments of flood risk or in
the reliable mitigation of the hazard. Counter to active alluvial fan flooding
hazards, an inactive alluvial fan flooding hazard is characterized by
relatively stable flow paths. However, areas of inactive alluvial fan flooding,
as with active alluvial fan flooding, may be subject to sediment deposition and
erosion, but to a degree that does not cause flow path instability and
uncertainty.
   An alluvial fan may exhibit both active alluvial fan flooding and inactive
alluvial fan flooding hazards. The hazards may vary spatially or vary at the
same location, contingent on the level of flow discharge. Spatially, for
example, upstream inactive portions of the alluvial fan may distribute flood
flow to active areas at the distal part of the alluvial fan. Hazards may vary
at the same location, for example, with a flow path that may be stable for
lower flows, but become unstable at higher flows.
   More detailed information can be found at FEMA's website: "Guidelines for
Determining Flood Hazards on Alluvial Fans" at http://www.fema.gov/fhm/
ft_afgd2.shtm#1.
   (b)   Alluvial Fans and LOMR's. The NFIP does not allow for the removal of
land from the floodplain based on the placement of fill (LOMR-F) in alluvial
fan flood hazard areas. The NFIP will credit a major structural flood control
project, through the LOMR process, that will effectively eliminate alluvial fan
flood hazards from the protected area. Details about map revisions for alluvial
fan areas can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations at Title 44, Part
65.13.
   (c)   Alluvial Fan Task Force. As stated in AB 2141 (Longville, Chapter 878,
Statutes of 2004), the State of California Department of Water Resources will
convene an Alluvial Fan Task Force (AFTF). The AFTF will produce an alluvial
fan model ordinance for local communities and a recommendations report to the
legislature.

7.01 through 5-7.04, codified from § 1, Ordinance No. 1319-NS, effective June
4, 1998)
Sec. 5-7.01. Findings and determinations.
   (a)   Substandard buildings as defined in the Uniform Housing Code pose a
threat to the health and safety of those who live in such conditions and, if
unattended, detrimentally impact property values, compromise the general
welfare of the surrounding community, and erode public confidence in its local
government. Experience from larger cities reveals that left unchecked,
substandard housing leads to physical and economic blight, demoralizing entire
neighborhoods.
   (b)   Currently, Thousand Oaks has a relatively young housing stock and does
not have a widespread problem with substandard buildings. As the housing stock
ages, the occurrence of substandard conditions will increase. However, it is a
better practice to anticipate future problems and act now to minimize or avoid
these problems. Whenever possible, property owners deserve to be notified and
provided an opportunity to abate substandard conditions occurring on their
property. However, a Property Owner’s repeated failure to correct substandard
conditions will not be tolerated.
   (c)   The purpose of the ordinance codified in this chapter is to identify
those property owners who do not comply with final orders of the Code
Compliance Officer, designate such property owners as “Substandard Housing
Owners,” and place all properties owned by Substandard Housing Owners into a
proactive code compliance program, in order to encourage Property Owners to
properly manage, control and maintain their properties and to deter Property
Owners from allowing people to live in substandard conditions.
(§ 1, Ord. 1319-NS, eff. June 4, 1998)
Sec. 5-7.02. Definitions.
   For purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply:
   (a)   “Property Owner” shall mean an individual having any interest in any
real property intended for human habitation, or an individual having any
interest in any entity, partnership, trust, or corporation having any interest
in any real property intended for human habitation. Property owner shall not
include a person with only a mortgage, lien, or similar security interest in
such property.
   (b)   “Substandard Housing Owner” shall mean any Property Owner who, on two
(2) or more occasions within a twelve (12) month period, has failed to obey a
“final order” of the Code Compliance Officer made pursuant to the Uniform
Housing Code.
(§ 1, Ord. 1319-NS, eff. June 4, 1998)
Sec. 5-7.03. Substandard Housing Owner properties; proactive code compliance.
   All property with a building or buildings intended for human habitation
owned by a Substandard Housing Owner shall be subject to the Substandard
Housing Owner Proactive Code Compliance Policy adopted by resolution of the
City Council.
(§ 1, Ord. 1319-NS, eff. June 4, 1998)
Sec. 5-7.04. Removal of property from proactive enforcement.
   A property may be removed from enforcement under the Substandard Housing
Owner Proactive Code Compliance Policy if: (1) a City inspection of the subject
building, condominium unit or apartment unit uncovers no violations of the
Uniform Housing Code, or, if violations are discovered, are abated within the
period required by the Code Compliance Officer; or (2) if after a visual
exterior inspection no violations of any applicable laws or codes are
identified by any City-designated enforcement officers.
(§ 1, Ord. 1319-NS, eff. June 4, 1998)
CHAPTER 8. MISCELLANEOUS OFFENSES

scheme, or device any fact, or makes any false, fictitious, or fraudulent
statement or representation, or makes or uses any false writing or document
when he knows the same to contain any false, fictitious, or fraudulent
statement or entry shall be guilty of a violation of this Code pursuant to

Penal Code of the State.

Sec. 5-8.08. Regulation of camping.
   (a)   Purpose. Public places within the City of Thousand Oaks should be
readily accessible and available to residents and the public at large. The use
of these areas for camping purposes or storage of personal property interferes
with the rights of others to use the areas for which they were intended. Such
action can constitute a public health and safety hazard which adversely impacts
public property, neighborhoods and commercial areas. The purpose of this
section is to maintain public places within the City of Thousand Oaks in a
clean and accessible condition, to prevent the accumulation of trash and
debris, and to reduce the risk of both structural and brush fires.

(§ 1, Ord. 1299-NS, eff. October 23, 1997, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1495-NS,
December 18, 2007; § 1, Ord. 1663-NS, eff. July 12, 2019)
Sec. 5-8.09. Prohibition on sitting and lying in certain public places.
   (a)   Purpose/Findings.
   (1)   Public streets, sidewalks and walkways are created and maintained for
the primary purposes of enabling pedestrians and vehicles to safely and
efficiently move about from place to place, facilitating deliveries of goods
and services, and providing all potential customers and visitors with
convenient access to goods and services, as well as a place to recreate and
engage in free public speech in shared civic space;
   (2)   Except as provided for in this Section, sitting or lying on public
streets, sidewalks or walkways interferes with the primary purposes of the
public street, sidewalk or walkway, threatens public safety and damages the
public welfare;
   (3)   Pedestrians, particularly the elderly, disabled, and vision-impaired,
are put at increased risk when they must see and navigate around individuals
sitting or lying upon the public sidewalk;
   (4)   In some circumstances, people sitting or lying on sidewalks deter many
members of the public from frequenting those areas. This, in turn, contributes
to an erosion of the essential economic viability of those areas. Business
failures and relocations can cause vacant storefronts contributing to a spiral
of deterioration and blight which harms the public health, safety and welfare;
   (5)   There are numerous other places within the City where sitting can be
accommodated without unduly interfering with the safe flow of pedestrian
traffic, impairing commercial activity, threatening public safety or harming
the public welfare. These other places include city parks, numerous public
benches and other seating facilities, plazas, portions of sidewalks not
intensively used by pedestrians, common areas open to the public, and private
property with the permission of the property owner;
   (6)   The City recognizes that there is a fundamental need to sleep and
desires to accommodate that need while also satisfying the needs of the general
public to travel freely and safely throughout the City.
   (7)   The limited regulation of sitting or lying down on sidewalks in is
both reasonably necessary and appropriately balances the public interest and
individual rights.
   (8)   Designated Open Space contains ecologically sensitive habitats,
including many protected plant and wildlife species as well as fresh water
supplies. Except as provided for in this Section, human presence in Open Space
other than on designated trails can seriously damage or destroy these habitats
as well as increase the risk of wildfire danger and possible injuries from
threatened wildlife.
   (b)   Definitions.
   (1)   “Obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic” means to walk, stand, place
an object, sit or lie in such a manner as to block passage by another person or
a vehicle, or to require another person or a driver of a vehicle to take
evasive action to avoid physical contact.
   (2)   “Public place” means public property, including, but is not limited
to, publicly owned parking lots and driveways, highways, streets, bridges,
alleys, sidewalks, walkways, and City owned areas generally accessible to the
public.
   (c)   Prohibitions. Except as provided in this Section:
   (1)   No person shall sit or lie down upon a public place or in doorways or
entrances to buildings in such a way as to impede pedestrian or vehicular
traffic.
   (2)   No person shall place any chair, stool, or other object upon any
public place or in doorways or entrances to buildings except as provided for in
this Code or permit issued by the City.
   (3)   No person shall be permitted to sleep in a public place between the
hours of 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
   (4)   No person shall be permitted to sleep in a public place between the
hours of 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. unless there are no sleeping spaces
practically available in any shelter or if there does not exist any viable
alternative to sleeping in a public place.
   (5)   No person shall be permitted to sleep in Open Space as defined in
Section 5-8.08(b)(4) at any time.
   (d)   Exceptions. The prohibitions in subsection (c) of this section shall
not apply in the following cases and to the following persons:
   (1)   Persons operating or patronizing a commercial establishment conducted
on the public sidewalk pursuant to an applicable, valid permit; or a person
participating in or attending a parade, festival, performance, rally,
demonstration, meeting or similar event conducted in a public place;
   (2)   Any conduct which is in conformity with the terms of any permit
granted pursuant to this Code; and
   (3)   Persons patronizing dining establishments with seating areas in the
public right of way which have been permitted pursuant to this Code.
   (e)   Picketing or protesting. It is not the intent of this section to
prohibit protesting, picketing, demonstrating, signature gathering, voter
registration, leafleting, or any other lawful activity permitted under the laws
of the United States of America, State of California, or by the National Labor
Relations Act in connection with a labor dispute.
(§ 1, Ord. 1300-NS, eff. October 23, 1997, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1663-NS,
eff. July 12, 2019)
Sec. 5-8.10. Aggressive begging.
   (a)   Findings.
   (1)   The public welfare is promoted by economically healthy commercial
areas which can dually function as centers of commerce and as civic centers
where people can meet and interact, and which therefore attract people to shop,
work, recreate and engage in public discourse. These areas provide easily-
accessible goods and services to local residents, workers and tourists,
employment opportunities, tax revenue necessary to support essential public and
social services, and economic productivity necessary to maintain and improve
property within these areas;
   (2)   Aggressive begging usually includes, but is not limited to, menacingly
approaching or following pedestrians, repetitive soliciting money despite
refusals, the use of abusive or profane language to cause fear and
intimidation, unwanted physical contact, or the intentional blocking of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic. In some circumstances, aggressive begging,
intentional obstruction of pedestrian or vehicle traffic, or solicitation in
certain areas where a person is captive or more vulnerable, may deter many
members of the public from frequenting those areas. This, in turn, contributes
to an erosion of the essential economic viability of those areas. Business
failures and relocations can cause vacant storefronts contributing to a spiral
of deterioration and blight which harms the public health, safety and welfare.
   (3)   The Council further finds that the presence of individuals who solicit
money from persons at or near banks, automated teller machines, in public
transportation vehicles, at outdoor cafes, or of someone waiting in line, is
especially troublesome because of the increased vulnerability and enhanced fear
of crime in those confined environments. Motorists also find themselves
confronted by persons seeking money who, without permission, wash their
automobile windows at traffic intersections, despite explicit indications by
drivers not to do so. Such activity carries with it an implicit threat to both
persons and property.
   (4)   The public should not have to endure unwanted, aggressive begging.
There are numerous places within the City where non-aggressive soliciting may
be accommodated without unduly interfering with the safe flow of pedestrian
traffic, impairing commercial activity, threatening public safety or harming
the public welfare. These other places include most city sidewalks, city parks,
common areas open to the public, and private property with the permission of
the property owner.
   (5)   The limitations on the time, place and manner of begging or soliciting
are reasonably necessary and appropriately balances the public interest and
individual rights.
   (b)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section the following definitions
apply:
   (1)   “Aggressive manner” means to beg with the intent to coerce, threaten,
hound or intimidate another person into giving money or goods and includes, but
is not limited to:
   (i)   Intentionally or recklessly making any physical contact with or
touching another person in the course of begging or soliciting without the
person's consent;
   (ii)   Following the person being solicited if that conduct is: (1) intended
to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear imminent bodily harm or
the commission of a criminal act upon property in the person's possession; or
(2) is intended to or is reasonably likely to intimidate the person being
solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation;
   (iii)    Continuing to beg or solicit within five (5) feet of the person
being solicited after the person has made a negative response, if continuing
the solicitation is: (1) intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person
to fear imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon property
in the person’s possession; or (2) is intended to or is reasonably likely to
intimidate the person being solicited into responding affirmatively to the
solicitation;
   (iv)   Intentionally or recklessly blocking the safe or free passage of the
person being solicited or requiring the person, or the driver of a vehicle, to
take evasive action to avoid physical contact with the person making the
solicitation. Acts authorized as an exercise of one's constitutional right to
picket or legally protest shall not constitute obstruction of pedestrian or
vehicular traffic;
   (v)   Intentionally or recklessly using obscene or abusive language or
gestures: (1) intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear
imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon property in the
person’s possession; or (2) is intended to or is reasonably likely to
intimidate the person being solicited into responding affirmatively to the
solicitation; or
   (vi)   Approaching the person being solicited in a manner that: (1) is
intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear imminent bodily
harm or the commission of a criminal act upon property in the person’s
possession; or (2) is intended to or is reasonably likely to intimidate the
person being solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation.
   (2)   “Beg” means to ask for, solicit or demand money or goods as a charity,
whether by words, bodily gestures, signs or other means.
   (3)   “Intimidate” means to engage in conduct which would make a reasonable
person fearful or feel compelled or threatened.
   (4)   “Public Place” means both public property and private property open to
the public and includes, but is not limited to, parks, plazas, parking lots,
highways, streets, bridges, alleys, driveways, sidewalks, walkways, and areas
generally accessible to the public.
   (5)   “Solicitation” or “Solicit” means any request made in person seeking
an immediate donation of money, food, cigarettes or other thing of value from
another person, by words, gestures, signs or other means, whether or not in
exchange for goods, services or other consideration, regardless of the
solicitor’s purpose or intended use of the money or other thing of value.
Purchase of an item for an amount far exceeding its value, under circumstances
where a reasonable person would understand that the purchase is in substance a
donation, is a donation for the purpose of this section. A person is not
soliciting for the purpose of this section when he or she passively displays a
sign or gives any other indication that he or she is seeking donations, and
where he or she does not address his or her solicitation to any specific person
other than in response to an inquiry by that person.
   (c)   Prohibited acts. It shall be unlawful for any person to beg or solicit
another person:
   (1)   In an aggressive manner in a public place;
   (2)   In any public transportation vehicle;
   (3)   Within twenty-five (25) feet of any entrance or exit of any bank or
check cashing business or within twenty-five (25) feet of any automated teller
machine or check cashing business without the consent of the owner or other
person legally in possession of such facilities;
   (4)   From any operator of a motor vehicle that is in traffic on a public
street in exchange for cleaning the vehicle's windows, or for blocking,
occupying, or reserving a public parking space, or directing the occupant to a
public parking space; provided, however, that this paragraph shall not apply to
services rendered in connection with emergency repairs requested by the
operator or passengers of such vehicle.
   (5)   While standing in any portion of a street or median, highway, or
driveways, to solicit from any person traveling in a vehicle along a public
right-of-way, including, but not limited to public streets, highways or
driveways.
   (d)   Notice. No person shall be cited under subsection (c) of this section
unless the person engages in conduct prohibited by said subsection after having
been notified by a law enforcement officer that the conduct violates subsection
(c) of this section.
   (e)   Penalties.
   (1)   A violation of this section may be punished by a fine not to exceed
One Hundred and no/100ths ($100.00) Dollars or by imprisonment for term not to
exceed thirty (30) days, or by both. If the person has been convicted of a
violation of this section within the previous period of one year, the person
shall be fined not more that Two Hundred Fifty and no/100ths ($250.000) Dollars
or imprisoned for not more than ninety (90) days, or both.
   (2)   In lieu of, or in addition to the penalty provided in this section, a
person in violation of this section may be required to perform community
service work as described by the court.
   (3)   Any arrest or conviction under this section shall be disclosed to
government social service agencies who request that the applicable public
official be notified of such events.
(§ 1, Ord. 1301-NS, eff. October 23, 1997)
Sec. 5-8.11. Encroachments onto public land.
   (a)   It shall be unlawful to encroach, or to make or cause any encroachment
over, under, or upon any publicly owned property of the City, City of Thousand
Oaks Redevelopment Agency, Conejo Open Space Conservation Agency (COSCA), or
any other public joint powers authority of which the City is a party, unless

CHAPTER 10. REMOVAL OF ABANDONED, WRECKED, DISMANTLED, OR INOPERATIVE VEHICLES*
*   Sections 5-10.01 through 5-10.14, codified from Ordinance No. 163, repealed

makes the following findings and declarations:
   The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or
inoperative vehicles, or parts thereof, on private or public property, not

plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance
creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for
rodents and insects, and to be injurious to the health, safety, and general
welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or
inoperative vehicle, or part thereof, on private or public property, not

The owner of the land may appear in person at the hearing, or present a sworn
written statement in time for consideration at the hearing, and deny
responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his reasons
for such denial.
   The Community Development Director may impose such conditions and take such
other action as he deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the
provisions of this chapter. He may delay the time for the removal of the
vehicle, or part thereof, if, in his opinion, the circumstances so justify. At
the conclusion of the public hearing, the Community Development Director may

or is inoperative on private or public property, and order the same removed
from the property as a public nuisance and disposed of as provided in this

charged against the owner of the land. The order requiring removal shall
include a description of the vehicle, or part thereof, and the correct
identification number and license number of the vehicle, if available at the

CHAPTER 16. PROHIBITION OF THE CONDUCT OF PUBLIC NUDITY*
*   Chapter 16 entitled “Unlawful Exposure of Private Parts and Female
Breasts,” consisting of Sections 5-16.01–5-16.08, codified from Ordinance 386-
NS, repealed by Section 1, Ordinance 1371-NS, effective January 18, 2001.
Sec. 5-16.01. Purpose.
   The City Council has considered the report of the City of Garden Grove,
California (1991) and the secondary effects of adult businesses which permit
displays of public nudity as described in the cases of Barnes v. Glen Theater,
Inc., (1991) 501 U.S. 560, 111 S.Ct. 2456, City of Erie v. PAP's A. M. (2000)
529 U.S. 277 , 120 S.Ct. 1382, and City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc.
(1986) 475 U.S. 41, 106 S. Ct. 925, rehearing denied, April 21, 1986, 475 U.S.
1132, 106 S. Ct. 1663. Public indecency laws are designed to prohibit certain
conduct such as public nudity for the purpose of preserving societal order and
a community’s notion of morality.
   The City Council finds that due the described secondary effects of public
nudity in adult businesses, as well as those effects of such conduct in other
public places require that the conduct of public nudity be prohibited as set
forth in this chapter. In addition, the Council finds that the conduct or
appearance of people (other than infants or small children) in the nude in a
public place or in a place open to or visible by the public, including
children, is inimical to public safety and order, and the community’s sense of
common decency and morality.
   The City Council further finds that certain lewd, immoral activities carried
on in public places for profit are highly detrimental to the public health,
safety and welfare, and lead to the debasement of both women and men, promote
violence, public intoxication, prostitution and other serious criminal
activity.

receive such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceeding.

alternate and an additional remedy to other abatement and enforcement
procedures available to the City.

CHAPTER 23. VENDING ON PUBLIC STREETS, PUBLIC PROPERTY, PRIVATE STREETS AND
RESIDENTIAL PARKING AREAS
Editor’s Note:
   Chapter 23 was reorganized by Ord. 1656-NS, effective January 1, 2019. The
original Chapter 23, comprised of Sections 5-23.01 through 5-23.05, was based
on Ords. 1188-NS, 1192-NS, and 1621-NS.
Sec. 5-23.01. Purpose and findings.
   (a)   Purpose. Sections 51036-51039 of the California Government Code
confers upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. The
requirements set forth in this chapter are intended to protect the public's
health, safety, and welfare by ensuring that vendors on public property provide
safe and sanitary conditions for consumers and the general public, are
adequately insured, are properly licensed with other agencies, and employ
persons that do not pose a threat to customers and the general public. This
chapter is adopted pursuant to the City's police powers for the purpose of
regulating vending on public property.
   (b)   Findings.
      (1)   The provisions set forth in this chapter ensure that the important
goals and policies of the City Council are upheld;
      (2)   Maintaining the requirement of a background check for street
vendors and extending this requirement to sidewalk vendors allows the City to
continue to meet its commitment to public safety;
      (3)   Maintaining restrictions on street vending and operating noise-
making devices in residential zones and extending these restrictions to
sidewalk vendors protects the quality of life of City residents and minimizes
disruption to the quiet enjoyment of residential property;
      (4)   Maintaining traffic and safety conditions for street vendors and
imposing similar requirements to sidewalk vendors ensures the safety of
residents and street and sidewalk vendors and minimizes impact to public
streets and the public right-of-way; and
      (5)   Maintaining the prohibition of street vending within five hundred
(500) feet of any public school between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on
the days the public school is in session and expanding this requirement to
sidewalk vending promotes public safety and minimizes impact to the public
right-of-way and traffic.

CHAPTER 24. LANDMARK TREE PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION*
* The regulations found in Ch. 24 were originally established by Ord. 1217 -NS,
adopted 9-27-94 and effective 10-28-94, and further amended by Ord. 1394-NS,
adopted 5-21-02 and effective 6-21-02, and Ord. 1446-NS, adopted 10-25-05 and
effective 11-25-05. Ch. 24 was then re-designated as Article 43 of Chapter 4 of

CHAPTER 25. MOBILE HOME RENT STABILIZATION
Sec. 5-25.01. Findings and purpose.
   There is a shortage of vacant and available mobile home spaces in the City
of Thousand Oaks resulting in a critically low vacancy factor. Mobile home
owners, tenants, and residents have a substantial investment in their
residences and appurtenances for which space is rented or leased in a mobile
home park. Additionally, the cost of moving a mobile home may be substantial,
and the risk of damage is significant. Thus, moving a mobile home is often not
a feasible option if rent becomes expensive. Many mobile home owners, tenants,
and residents are on fixed incomes and, if displaced as a result of their
inability to pay increased rents, must relocate at a substantial loss or
expense, and, in addition, as a result of such housing shortage they may be
unable to find decent, safe and sanitary new housing at affordable rent levels.
Aware of the difficulty in finding alternative decent housing, some mobile home
owners, tenants, or residents attempt to pay requested and uncontrolled rent
increases, but as a consequence, must expend less on other necessities of life.
This situation has had a detrimental effect on substantial numbers of renters
in the City, especially creating hardships on senior citizens on fixed incomes,
and low- and moderate-income households.
   The City causes data to be collected through the annual registration
statements submitted by mobile home landlords, which confirms a mobile home
space and housing shortage continues to exist in the City, the vacancy rate in
mobile home parks remain critically low and the deregulation of rents could
lead to exorbitant rent increases and aggravation of the crisis, problems and
hardships which existed prior to the adoption of the program. This housing
shortage necessitates the continuation of the mobile home rent stabilization
program. Therefore, it is necessary and reasonable to continue to regulate
rents to safeguard mobile home owners, residents, and tenants from excessive
rent increases and at the same time provide landlords with a just and
reasonable return on their rental spaces.

deterioration or loss in value, unless the tenant has given express written
consent to said increase.
   (d)   Special requirements. If the rent increase application is for the
purpose of reimbursing a park owner for a new improvement, or for replacement

all ballots cast along with said attestation as proof of the vote; and
      (5)   The mobile home park owner shall provide documentation of number of
ballots cast and the names and space numbers of those persons casting ballots
in the election.
   (e)   Special requirements exception. The special requirements set forth in
subsection
5-25.08(d)(4) shall not apply to applications for a rent increase to reimburse
a park owner for replacement or renovation work before the end of an
improvement's useful life, if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Community Development Director, City Manager, or designee, as applicable, that

Sec. 5-25.09. Planning Commission adjustments for just and reasonable return.
   (a)   Planning Commission adjustments. The Planning Commission shall have
the authority, in accordance with such guidelines as the Planning Commission
may establish, to grant increases in the rent for a rental space or spaces
located in the same mobile home park, upon receipt of an application for
adjustment filed by the landlord and after notice and hearing. If the Planning
Commission finds that such request for increase is in keeping with the purposes
of this chapter and that the maximum rent or maximum adjusted rent otherwise
permitted pursuant to this chapter constitutes a just and reasonable rent on
the rental space or spaces, the rent increase may be granted. The following are
factors, among other relevant factors as the Commission may determine, which
may be considered in determining whether a rental space yields a just and
reasonable return:
      (1)   Property taxes.
      (2)   Reasonable operating and maintenance expenses.
      (3)   The extent of capital improvements made to the common area or
spaces as distinguished from ordinary repair, replacement, and maintenance.
      (4)   Living space, and the level of housing services.
      (5)   Substantial deterioration of the rental spaces other than as a
result of ordinary wear and tear.
      (6)   Failure to perform ordinary repair, replacement, and maintenance.
      (7)   Financing costs on the property if it contains either a balloon
payment or variable rate provision.
      (8)   Changes to the CPI index utilized by the City of Thousand Oaks.
   (b)   Anti-speculation provision. If the only justification offered for the
requested rent increase on the landlord's application is an assertion that the
maximum rents or maximum adjusted rents permitted pursuant to this chapter do
not allow the landlord a return sufficient to pay both the operating expenses
and debt service on the rental space or spaces or on the mobile home park
containing the rental space or spaces, a rent adjustment will not be permitted
pursuant to this subsection to a landlord who acquired an interest in the
rental space or spaces after January 1, 1980.
   (c)   Procedures involving applications regarding just and reasonable
return.
      (1)   All applications for rent adjustment regarding just and reasonable
return shall be submitted to the Community Development Department and shall
include, among other things specified in the application requirements or
requested by the Department, the mailing addresses and space numbers of the
space or spaces for which an adjustment is requested. Each application shall be
accompanied by a filing fee of Twenty and no/100ths ($20.00) Dollars plus Five
and no/100ths ($5.00) Dollars per space affected by the proposed increase. The
Community Development Department shall determine whether an application is
complete within thirty (30) days of submittal. The applicant shall produce at
the request of the Community Development Department, or Planning Commission at
any subsequent hearing, such records, receipts and reports as may be necessary
to make a determination on the adjustment request. Failure to produce such
requested items shall be sufficient basis for the termination of the rent
adjustment proceedings. All applications for rent adjustment, together will all
oral and written evidence presented in support thereof, shall be under oath or
penalty of perjury.
      (2)   Within ten (10) days of the determination by the Community
Development Department that the application is complete, the Community
Development Department shall set a date for a hearing and determination. The
City shall notify the tenant or tenants of the subject space or spaces by mail
of the receipt of such application, the amount of the requested increase, the
landlord's justification for the request, and the place, date and time of the
hearing on the adjustment request. The hearing shall occur no less than ten
(10) days and no more than forty-five (45) days after the date of mailing such
notice.
      (3)   The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
procedure which the Planning Commission may choose to adopt. In the event that
the Planning Commission does not adopt such rules of procedure, the hearing
shall be conducted in general accordance with the City Council Manual of
Procedure, Ordinance 488-NS. At the time of the hearing, the landlord and/or
affected tenants may offer such documents, testimony, written declarations, or
evidence as may be pertinent to the proceedings.
      (4)   A determination with written findings in support thereof shall be
made within seventy-five (75) days from the conclusion of the hearing.
      (5)   Copies of the findings and determination of the Planning Commission
shall be mailed by the City to the applicant and all affected tenants.
   (d)   Appeal. Any dispute, contention, or disagreement relative to
interpretation, application, or enforcement of this Section
5-25.09, shall be submitted to the City Council for determination in accordance

CHAPTER 26. SOCIAL HOST LIABILITY
Sec. 5-26.01. Findings.
   (a)   Underage persons consuming alcoholic beverages, cannabis, or cannabis
products at gatherings held at private residences or at rented residential and
commercial premises is harmful to the underage persons themselves and a threat
to the peace, health, safety, quiet enjoyment of residential property and the
general welfare of the public. Underage persons, who have been consuming
alcoholic beverages or cannabis, are at greater risk to be in automobile
accidents, to commit suicide, to be assaulted, and are at greater risk of
sexual assaults.
   (b)   Persons responsible for the occurrence of these types of gatherings on
private property, over which they have possession or control, have failed to
ensure that alcoholic beverages, cannabis, or cannabis products are neither
served to nor consumed by underage persons at these parties.
   (c)   Problems associated with gatherings involving underage persons
drinking alcohol, consuming cannabis, or cannabis products are difficult to
prevent and deter. Police need an arsenal of tools to deal with these issues
and its attendant problems. If persons are held civilly responsible by having
to pay a significant fine for hosting a party where there is underage drinking
or cannabis consumption, they will be more likely to properly supervise or stop
such conduct at events held on property under their possession or control.
Because the median household income for the City of Thousand Oaks is higher
than other communities the fine needs to be significant to have such a
deterrent effect.
   (d)   In the past and present, law enforcement, fire and other emergency
response services personnel have and are required to respond, sometimes on
multiple occasions, to these types of gatherings. The repeated return of police
officers to the location of an event constitutes a drain of emergency personnel
and resources, often leaving other areas of the city without police protection
or with unreasonably limited protection. Responses to such gatherings also
result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources of the City
of Thousand Oaks, which are underwritten by general municipal taxes paid to the
City by its taxpayers and residents.
   (e)   Research has documented that cannabis use during adolescence and early
adulthood results in impaired neural connectivity in several areas of the brain
associated with learning and memory. This impairment may affect numerous
developmental problems among adolescents, including lower IQ scores, poorer
school performance, higher school dropout rates, and impaired verbal cognitive
and attention performance.
   The adverse effects associated with adolescent and early adulthood use of
cannabis increase in severity with early onset and heavy use.

alcoholic beverages or cannabis consumption by underage persons;
   (b)   To protect public health, safety, general welfare and quiet enjoyment
of residential property and properties neighboring one of these gatherings; and
   (c)   To establish standards and controls of parties, gatherings or
assemblages involving underage persons consuming alcoholic beverages or
cannabis on private property when such gatherings are determined to be a threat
to the public peace, health, safety or general welfare and require initial
police response and return calls to the location to disperse uncooperative
participants.

supplemental notice shall contain all of the information required for the
original notice and shall also refer to the recordation date and recorder's

CHAPTER 29. CANNABIS
Sec. 5-29.01. Purpose and intent.
   It is the purpose and intent of this Chapter to implement the provisions of
the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act ("MAUCRSA") to
accommodate the needs of medically-ill persons in need of and provide access to
cannabis for medicinal purposes as recommended by their health care provider
(s), and to provide access to same. It is also the purpose and intent of this
Chapter to provide access to adult-use cannabis for persons aged 21 and over as
authorized by the MAUCRSA while imposing sensible regulations on the use of
land to protect the City's residents, neighborhoods, and businesses from
disproportionately negative impacts.
   As such, it is the purpose and intent of this Chapter to regulate the retail
sale and testing of medicinal and adult-use cannabis and cannabis products in a
responsible manner to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents
of Thousand Oaks and to enforce rules and regulations consistent with state
law. It is the further purpose of intent of this Chapter to require all
commercial cannabis operators to obtain and renew annually a permit to operate
within Thousand Oaks. Nothing in this Chapter is intended to authorize the
possession, use, or provision of cannabis for purposes that violate state law.
The provisions of this Title are in addition to any other permits, licenses and
approvals which may be required to conduct business in the City, and are in
addition to any permits, licenses and approval required under state, county, or
other law.
   On January 16, 2019, Title 16, Section 5416(d) of the California Code of
Regulations adopted by the State of California went into effect. Section 5416
(d) permits commercial cannabis delivery of both recreational and medicinal
product from State of California-licensed retail operators to any county or
city within California even if such entity previously banned deliveries. Based
on the State's regulation requiring the City of Thousand Oaks to permit
deliveries of cannabis product to addresses within the City's jurisdiction,
this Title and Chapter of the Thousand Oaks Municipal Code is amended to remain
consistent with state law.
(§ 2, Ord. 1636-NS, eff. December 29, 2017, as amended by § 2, Ord. 1662-NS,

the provisions of the Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety
Act (hereinafter "MAUCRSA"), any subsequent state legislation and/or
regulations regarding same, the City of Thousand Oaks is authorized to adopt
ordinances that establish standards, requirements and regulations for the
licensing and permitting of commercial medicinal and adult-use cannabis
activity. Any standards, requirements, and regulations regarding health and

review criteria by which the top applicant or applicants in each category of
each commercial cannabis business under Section
5-29.08 (a) or (b) will be presented to the City Council for a final
determination at a public hearing.
   (b)   The top final applicants for a Cannabis Retailer may be invited to
attend the City Council meeting, where they may be expected to make a public
presentation and provide an overview of their proposal.
   (c)   At least ten (10) days prior to the hearing, notice of the hearing
shall be sent to all property owners located within five hundred (500) feet of
the proposed business locations proposed of each of the finalists to be
considered by the City Council. The five hundred (500) feet shall be measured
from the property line of the property the proposed business is located.
   (d)   The City Council shall either deny or approve the final applicants,
and shall select the top applicants in each category of commercial cannabis
businesses. The City Council's decision as to the selection of the prevailing
candidates shall be final.
   (e)   Official issuance of the commercial cannabis business permit(s) is
conditional upon the prevailing applicant(s) obtaining all required approvals.
Following the City Council's selection, the prevailing candidate(s) shall apply
to the Community Development Department to obtain any required approvals for
the permittee's location, if any. Approvals shall include compliance with all
applicable provisions of CEQA. The City Manager or designee(s) shall formally
issue the commercial cannabis business permit(s) once the Community Development
Director or designee(s) affirms that all required approvals have been obtained.
   (f)   Issuance of a commercial cannabis business permit does not create a
land use entitlement. The commercial cannabis business permit shall be for a
term of twelve (12) months and shall expire at the end of the twelve (12) month
period unless it is renewed as provided herein. For the purposes of determining
the expiration date of the permit, the date shall begin on the first day of

operations, notwithstanding the issuance of a permit, unless all of the State
and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to the requirements
of this Chapter and of the permit, have been complied with. Until a State
license is available and obtained by the City permittee, this shall mean
compliance with all provisions of the Medical Cannabis Collective Laws as set

   (g)   Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter to the contrary, the City
Council reserves the right to reject any or all applications if it determines

safety and welfare impacts on the community. Applicants shall have no right to
a commercial cannabis business permit until a permit is actually issued, and
then only for the duration of the permit's term. Each applicant assumes the
risk that, at any time prior to the issuance of a permit, the City Council may
terminate or delay the program created under this Chapter.
   (h)   If an application is denied, a new application by that applicant may
not be filed for one (1) year from the date of the denial.
   (i)   Each person granted a commercial cannabis business permit shall be
required to pay the permit fee established by resolution of the City Council
Resolution, to cover the costs of administering the commercial cannabis
business permit program created in this Chapter.

   (a)   The owner of a cannabis business permit shall not transfer ownership
or control of the permit to another person or entity unless and until the
transferee obtains an amendment to the permit from the City Council stating
that the transferee is now the permittee. A change of ownership shall be
defined as a change of more than 51% of the original ownership. Failure to
comply with this provision is grounds for permit revocation. Such an amendment
may be obtained only if the transferee files an application with the City
Manager or designee in accordance with all provisions of this chapter, as
though the transferee were applying for an original cannabis business permit,
accompanied by a transfer fee in an amount set by City Council Resolution, and
the City Council determines, after hearing, in accordance with this section
that the transferee passed the background check required for permittees and
meets all other requirements of this chapter.
   (b)   Commercial cannabis business permits issued through the grant of a
transfer by the City Council shall be valid for a period of one year beginning
on the day the City Council approves the transfer of the permit. Before the
transferee's permit expires, the transferee shall apply for a renewal permit in
the manner required by this chapter.
Sec. 5-29.20   Thousand Oaks Municipal Code
   (c)   A permittee may change the form of business entity without applying to
the City Council for a transfer of permit, provided that either:
      (1)   The membership of the new business entity is substantially similar
to original permit holder business entity (at least 51% of the membership is
identical), or
      (2)   If the original permittee is an unincorporated association, mutual
or public benefit corporation, agricultural or consumer cooperative corporation
and subsequently transitions to or forms a new business entity as allowed under
the MAUCRSA and to comply with Section subdivision (b), provided that the Board
of Directors (or in the case of an unincorporated association, the individual
(s) listed on the City permit application) of the original permittee entity are
the same as the new business entity.
      Although a transfer is not required in these two circumstances, the
permit holder is required to notify the City Manager or designee in writing of
the change within ten (10) days of the change. Failure to comply with this
provision is grounds for permit revocation.
   (d)   No commercial cannabis business permit may be transferred when the
City Manager or Police Chief has notified the permittee that the permit has
been or may be suspended or revoked.
   (e)   Any attempt to transfer a commercial cannabis business permit either
directly or indirectly in violation of this section is hereby declared void,
and such a purported transfer shall be deemed a ground for revocation of the
permit.

Department approvals, Health Department approvals and other zoning and land use
permit(s) and approvals.

this section. At least one copy of the version of Title 10 as adopted shall be
kept on file in the Office of the City Clerk for public record and inspection.
   (b)   In the event a conflict arises concerning the interpretation of the
provisions of the Thousand Oaks Municipal Code and Title 10 of the Los Angeles
County Code, the language and provisions of Title 10 of the Los Angeles County
Code shall take precedence.
   (c)   Any person, firm, company or corporation violating any of the
provisions of Title 10 of the Los Angeles County Code, as adopted by reference
in this section, shall be guilty of a violation of the Thousand Oaks Municipal
Code and upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to the penalties set forth

Sec. 6-1.101. Livestock care and maintenance.*
   No livestock shall be housed, kept, or confined within the City except under
the following conditions:
   (a)   No livestock shall be housed, kept, or confined within forty (40’)
feet of any habitable dwelling, religious facility, school, or other place of
human habitation except the dwelling of the owner thereof.
   (b)   The following minimum lot area shall be provided per animal in
addition to the area of any structure:
   (1)   Fifty (50) square feet of pen for each sheep, goat, pig, or other
small animal; and
   (2)   Two hundred (200) square feet of corral for each horse, bovine, pony,
colt, or other large animal, with a maximum of six hundred (600) square feet
required.
   (c)   Any area used to stable, harbor, or confine livestock shall be fenced
so as to prevent such livestock from ranging onto adjacent property. Stallions
over two and one-half (2-1/2) years of age and horse at stud shall be confined
to an area fenced to a minimum height of five (5’) feet and of construction
suitable to contain the animal.
   (d)   Any area used to stable, harbor, confine, or corral livestock shall be
kept reasonably free of dust, litter, and the accumulation of weeds and debris.
The stable, pen, or corral shall be periodically sprinkled with water in order
to keep dust from blowing onto adjacent property.
   (e)   No livestock shall be stabled, harbored, kept, or confined in any
stable, corral, yard, or enclosure in which the droppings and other waste
matter shall not have been removed at least once every seven (7) days, except
where such livestock is confined to an area of at least five (5) acres. If,
however, in the opinion of the enforcing authority, an area of any size is in
need of a cleaning of this type of waste matter, the owner shall remove such
waste matter within three (3) days of a notice ordering him to do so.
   (f)   Corrals, stables, and pens shall be plowed under or sprinkled with
chemicals so as to eliminate the “fly” breeding characteristics in the areas.
   (g)   Offensive odors emanating from livestock shall be controlled to the
extent that such odors will not unreasonably disturb the comfort of any
residents of the neighborhood.
   (h)   If, in the opinion of the enforcement officer, an animal is obviously
in need of medical attention, such officer shall inspect and provide for the
treatment of such animal by a veterinarian. The cost of the treatment,
regardless of the final disposition of the animal, shall be borne by the owner
thereof.
   (i)   Any animal which is found to be repeatedly mistreated by the lack of
food, water, or sanitary conditions or by beatings or other forms of cruelty
shall be impounded. The owner found to be mistreating such animal shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor.

   10.72.035 Isolation – Animals with Rabies Symptoms; Biting Animals
      A.   The Director shall take up and place in isolation any dog or cat,
whether licensed or not, which, in the opinion of a licensed veterinarian or
the Health Officer, displays symptoms suggestive of rabies. Such isolation
shall be at an animal shelter unless the owner of such dog or cat, with the
approval of the Health Officer, arranges with a licensed veterinarian for such
isolation in a private animal hospital or clinic. Any dog or cat placed in such
isolation shall be kept strictly confined and under such observation as may be
required by the Health Officer. Such isolation shall continue for at least ten
(10) days from the date of the symptoms suggestive of rabies were first
observed. Such isolation may be continued for a period longer than ten (10)
days if, in the opinion of any licensed veterinarian or the Health Officer,
such longer period is necessary. At the expiration of such ten (10) days or
longer period, any dog or cat confined at an animal shelter shall be released
upon payment of the fees set forth in paragraph E of this section if, in the
opinion of any licensed veterinarian or the Health Officer, such dog or cat
does not have rabies.
      B.   Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Director may take
up, impound, and isolate for the period required as specified in California
Code of Regulations Title 17, Sections 2606 et seq., following the date of the
alleged bite any animal of a type subject to rabies, which animal is reported

keeping of a biting animal confined and isolated upon his private premises as
provided in paragraph B of this section, fails for any reason whatsoever to
keep such animal continuously confined and isolated upon his premises, either
indoors or inside some enclosure, for the entire isolation period after such
written request is presented to the Director shall be guilty of a violation of
this Code pursuant to Section

or unlicensed, not continuously confined and isolated as set forth in this
article may be taken up forthwith by the Director and isolated at an animal
shelter.
      D.   Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Director may
impound and isolate, for the period required as specified in California Code of
Regulations, Title 17, Sections 2606 et seq., following the date any animal of
a type subject to rabies, which animal is suspected to have had contact with a
wild animal of a type susceptible to rabies, whether or not such animal has
been vaccinated with rabies vaccine, and whether or not such animal displays
any symptoms suggestive of rabies. The animal may be impounded and shall be
isolated in the manner set forth in paragraph A of this section for the
isolation of dogs or cats suspected of having rabies.
      E.   Any animal isolated at the animal shelter as set forth in this
section and found not to have rabies may be redeemed by the owner thereof by
paying to the Director all applicable fees and by obtaining any necessary
license tag. Any smaller animal may be redeemed in a similar manner. Any animal
which is not so redeemed within seventy-two (72) hours after the expiration of
the isolation period shall be deemed to have been abandoned and shall be
disposed of as provided in Chapter 10.36 Impoundment of Title 10 of the Los

of air pollution through the absorption of air contaminants, reduce glare, and
attenuate traffic noise, thus making the highway environment more pleasant for
both residents and visitors of the City;
   (f)   To recognize that landscape treatment in the public rights-of-way
imparts important physical, functional, economic, and aesthetic benefits to the
community and that the presence of trees and other vegetation, as well as
distinctive ornamental streetscape design features, can enhance the visual
identity of the City and thus improve the overall quality of the environment;
   (g)   To promote and enhance scenic highway distinction and identity by
developing and maintaining highway landscape themes;
   (h)   To provide for median and parkway landscaping as new development
occurs adjacent to scenic highways;
   (i)   To provide a policy, where development exists, that provisions be made
for parkway and median improvements, including landscaping or other special
treatment of public rights-of-way; and
   (j)   To recognize that, as street trees mature along with increased
population and urbanization and increased potential for liability, there is a
need to have policies which guide decisions regarding proposed removal and
replacement of street trees.

circumstances exist:
      (1)   The tree poses a significant threat to people, lawfully established

      (4)   The removal, trimming, or cutting is part of a Council approved
program for the replacement of street trees;
      (5)   The tree is causing extensive or substantial damages to public or
private property, and pruning and other remedial means have proven unsuccessful
or will not, in the opinion of the City’s tree consultant or Landscape
Supervisor, prove to be effective. Wastewater lateral damage through root
infiltration alone shall not be sufficient reason for tree removal;
      (6)   Alteration or removal is necessary to construct improvements within
the public right-of-way as certified by a Registered Civil Engineer of the
State of California in consultation and concurrence with a certified arborist
or Landscape Supervisor;

required in the interests of the preservation of the public health, safety and
welfare.

reasons for the removal and replacement.
   (g)   The tree trimming or removal procedures utilized shall conform to the
City’s Forestry Master Plan.
   (h)   In addition to the penalties provided by this Code, any person who
cuts, damages, moves or removes any street tree or portion thereof without City
approval, in violation of this section, is responsible for payment of proper
restitution and may be required to replace the street tree so removed or
damaged. Any damage to the tree shall be valued pursuant to the “Standards of
Valuation of Amenity Trees” of the International Society of Arboriculture.

damages have been caused by street trees.
   Damages caused to street improvements by street trees shall be handled in
the following manner:
   (a)   The City, at City expense, shall make the initial repairs of street
improvements damaged by tree roots. After the City has once made such repairs
with respect to a given tree, and the owner desires to retain the tree in
place, it will thereafter be the property owner’s responsibility to pay for any
future repairs necessitated by maintaining the tree or trees which caused the
damage. Non-fronting residential curbs and sidewalks shall be the
responsibility of the appropriate local community association, where one
exists, or of the individual property owner, where no such association exists,
after the City has made its initial repairs on the sidewalk or street
improvements. If the property owner or community association fails to make such
improvements, the City will make the repairs at the owner's expense, as
provided by law.
   (b)   The City, at City expense, shall remove trees within the public
rights-of-way when such trees are causing damages to sidewalks or other street
improvements; provided, however, this provision shall not apply to oak trees
and other historic trees which are provided for by resolution or specific
sections of this Code and, in addition, shall not apply when the property owner
on whose property the tree fronts agrees to be responsible for any and all
future repairs that may be necessitated due to the maintenance of the tree.
   (c)   Any tree which is removed shall be replaced with an appropriate City-
approved street tree at City expense.
   (d)   The City shall replace the curbs and gutters and make the necessary
repairs to the street improvements at the City’s expense.

for the full length of the right-of-way to achieve a continuous and/or
compatible landscape design theme. Where highways are wholly or partially
landscaped, attempts shall be made to continue the dominant landscape theme
along any future extensions of the route.
   (a)   Where new development occurs adjacent to “existing highways,” as
defined in the Scenic Highways Element, right-of-way landscaping and
improvements shall be installed in accordance with the provisions of this

signs, and scenic highway identification signs. Variations in the textural
finish or roadway surfaces at selected pedestrian crosswalks and street
intersections shall be within the Thousand Oaks Core Area whenever possible.

Sec. 7-2.909. Installation and maintenance programs, costs, and operation for
medians and parkways on secondary and primary highways, including scenic
highways.
   (a)    Development permits, special use permits, and tentative tract maps
approved for the development or expansion of projects on property adjacent to
primary and secondary highways shall be conditioned to require the improvement
of median islands and parkways in accordance with the provisions of this
article, unless this requirement is waived by the Council.
   (b)   Landscape maintenance districts may be established by the Council for
specific areas to share the costs for the installation and maintenance of
landscaped median islands and parkways.
   (c)   Capital improvement programs may be adopted by the Council to provide
for the construction of landscaped median and/or parkway improvements on
primary or secondary highways, giving priority to scenic highways as funds
become available. Scenic highways to be considered for priority capital
improvement funding shall include Moorpark Road and Thousand Oaks Boulevard.

into the traveled way of the public highway nor into the sidewalks, drainage
ditches, gutters, or other improved facilities.
   (b)   The public may not be denied the use of the planted area for
pedestrian or other lawful use. The City may use the planted area for any
purpose and may issue a permit to any applicant to perform encroachment work
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. If the lawn or similar ground cover
is damaged in the course of an authorized encroachment, the permittee who
caused the damage shall be responsible for the replacement thereof, unless the
permit specifically states otherwise.
   (c)   Plastic or artificial plants shall be prohibited, except as approved
by the Public Works Director and Community Development Director, within a
public right-of-way.

of plantings, fences or similar structure to encroach upon the public right-of-
way.
   (c)   Upon failure of the owner or occupant of private property to remove an
encroachment after receipt of written notice, the City may take any actions
authorized by this Code or State law to bring the property into compliance.

way, such owner or occupant of the private property failing to remove such
encroachment shall be liable for all costs associated with the removal of such
encroachment by the City pursuant to section

Article 13. Newsracks*
*   Article 13, consisting of Sections 7-2.1301 through 7-2.1308, codified from
Ordinance No. 727-NS, effective September 13, 1979 (Sections 7-2.1301 and 7-
2.1304 amended by Ordinance No. 1266-NS, effective September 17, 1996; Section
7-2.1306 amended by Ordinance No. 770-NS, effective February 26, 1981),
repealed by Section 1, Ordinance No. 1312-NS, effective February 12, 1998, and
Sections 7-2.1301 through 7-2.1312 added by Section 2, Ordinance No. 1312-NS,
effective February 12, 1998)
Sec. 7-2.1301. Purpose.
   (a)   The purpose of this article is to establish a comprehensive set of
regulations applicable to newsracks on the public rights-of-way and other
public property. In order to advance, improve and promote aesthetic concerns as
well as the public health, safety and welfare of the City of Thousand Oaks, it
is necessary to control the number, size, construction, placement and
appearance of such newsracks. This article is intended to accomplish these
ends, without restricting the free dispersal of information guaranteed by the
Constitutions of the United States and the State of California, through
regulation of the placement, appearance, and servicing, of newsracks on the
public rights-of-way so as to:
   (1)   Provide sufficient clearance and visibility for safety and convenience
of the pedestrian and driving public;
   (2)   Avoid the unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or
vehicular traffic, including ingress or egress from any residence or any place
of business or from the street to the sidewalks by persons crossing or exiting/
entering parked or standing vehicles;
   (3)   Provide reasonable access for the use and maintenance of utility
poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants and mail boxes, and access to
locations used for benches and public transportation purposes;
   (4)   Eliminate poorly maintained newsracks and the lack of uniformity in
the color and style of newsracks which have resulted in a visual blight on the
public rights-of-way, or which may unreasonably detract from the aesthetics of
store window displays, adjacent landscaping, and other improvements;
   (5)   Maintain and protect the values of surrounding properties;
   (6)   Reduce the unnecessary exposure of the City to personal injury and
property damage claims; and
   (7)   Provide for and maintain the freedom of speech for newspapers or news
periodicals using newsracks for distribution purposes.
   (b)   The City Council finds that the competing interests of the public
safety and welfare and for the open distribution of newspapers require
reasonable accommodations, which can only be satisfactorily achieved through
this article, which regulates the place and manner of using newsracks on public
property.

fill approved by and operating pursuant to the requirements, rules, applicable
zoning regulations, and other laws adopted by the Board of Supervisors of the
County or by the City. Such exemption shall not extend, however, to surrounding
berms, permanent access roads to the site, permanent building sites, or
protective drainage works;
   (f)   The construction of dams or reservoirs regulated or owned by the State
and the Federal governments;
   (g)   The temporary stockpiling of quarried or mined products or earth for
future processing, disposal, or sale, but only insofar as such operations are
conducted at a distance of more than one hundred (100’) feet inside the outer
property line of any parcel of land held in a single ownership and such
stockpiling is approved by the Planning Commission. The City Engineer shall
decide, subject to an appeal, if a statement of the location of any fill, and
the legal description of the parcel of land over which the fill is to be
placed, shall be filed by the owner of the property for recording in the office
of the County Recorder. If such statement indicates that the fill has been
compacted in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, such statement
shall be certified to by a soils engineer. The City Engineer may waive the
requirements for recording such statement when he believes the purpose of this
chapter does not require such recording;
   (h)   Farming and agricultural grading operations on parcels in a single
ownership which are larger than ten (10) acres and zoned and used primarily for
agricultural and/or soil and water conservation work under the direct control

Sec. 7-3.08. Permit requirements.
   (a)   Plans and specifications. With each application for a grading permit
and when required by the City Engineer for the enforcement of any provision of
this chapter, three (3) sets of plans shall be submitted. Except as waived by
the City Engineer for minor grading, the plans shall be prepared and signed by
a civil engineer, soils engineer, and, where applicable, engineering geologist,
and/or landscape architect, and shall show the following:
   (1)   A vicinity sketch or other data adequately indicating the site
location;
   (2)   The property lines and dimensions and bearings of the property on
which the work is to be performed;
   (3)   The location of any existing buildings or structures on the property
where the work is to be performed and the location of any building or structure
on the land of adjacent property owners, which building or structure is within
fifty (50’) feet of the property boundary;
   (4)   On all parcels of land where oak or landmark trees, protected by the
provisions of Article 42 or Article 43 of Chapter 4 of Title 9 of this Code,
are present, grading shall take place in a manner to insure the survival and
health of all such trees, except for those as to which removal is expressly
allowed. The location of any oak or landmark trees shall be precisely depicted
on the plan, indicating the location of the exact center of the trunk after a
field survey by a licensed surveyor. The trees shall be permanently marked with
numbered tags at a location three (3’) feet above the natural grade in a manner
acceptable to the Public Works Director. The plan shall indicate such tag
number for each tree, the diameter of the trunk of each tree, the existing
ground elevation of the downhill side of the tree, a specific reference to its
habit of branching (i.e., low branching restricting movement to the southeast),
and the ground plane projection of the natural drip line of the tree as
determined by a physical survey. The plan shall indicate the proposed
disposition of each such tree. Where any tree, other than one as to which
removal will be permitted, will be affected by grading, the details for
retaining walls, drains, pruning, trimming, and the establishment of a drip
line with respect to each such tree shall be prepared by a licensed landscape
architect and be included with the grading plan. No grading or activity
detrimental to the health of such tree shall take place within an established
drip line of the tree. Prior to the commencement of grading, fences shall be
constructed around the established drip line of all such trees. The purpose of
such fences shall be to prevent grading, heavy equipment work, and the storage
or dumping of materials within the established drip lines of such trees.
Grading or other site work within the established drip line shall be only as
authorized by the approved grading plan and shall be supervised and approved by
a landscape architect in attendance continuously during the progress of the
work. Fences may be temporarily removed or omitted, upon the approval of the
City Engineer, to facilitate such authorized work. All such work shall comply
with the approved details to protect the tree. Where trees could be affected by
a grading operation, a field orientation meeting shall take place prior to the
commencement of the work when deemed necessary or desirable by the City
Engineer. The purpose of such meeting shall be to communicate the approved
methods of grading and tree preservation to all parties involved with the
grading operation. Such meeting should include the City Engineer or his
authorized representative, a representative of the Community Development
Department, the permittee, or his authorized representative, the landscape
architect, and the soils engineer;
   (5)   Accurate topography showing suitable contours of the existing ground.
The contours shall be extended past the boundary lines of any project for a
minimum of one hundred (100’) feet. The City Engineer may require the contours
to be extended to include the watershed area and all other areas influencing
the proposed development;
   (6)   The elevations, dimensions, locations, extent, and slopes of all
proposed grading shown by contours or other means;
   (7)   A certification of the quantity and type of material of the excavation
and fill involved and the estimated starting and completion dates;
   (8)   Detailed plans of all drainage devices, walls, cribbing, dams, or
other protective devices to be constructed in connection with, or as a part of,
the proposed work, together with a map showing the drainage area and estimated
runoff of the area served by the drains. All hydrologic and hydraulic
calculations shall be signed by a civil engineer;
   (9)   Any additional plans, drawings, or calculations required by the City
Engineer; and
   (10)    An indication as to the type of structure to be constructed or
proposed use of the site, such as single-family residence, multiple,
commercial, or industrial.
   (b)   Modifications of approved plans. All modifications of approved grading
plans shall be approved in writing by the City Engineer. All required soils and
geological reports shall be submitted with the revised plans. No grading work
in connection with the proposed modifications shall be permitted without the
prior written approval of the City Engineer.
   (c)   Soils engineering reports. The City Engineer shall require a soils
engineering investigation, based upon the most recent grading plan. Such report
shall include data regarding the nature, distribution, and strength of existing
soils, conclusions and recommendations for grading procedures, design criteria
for corrective measures, or such other criteria as required by the City
Engineer. All such reports shall be prepared and signed by a registered soils
engineer, and all such reports shall be subject to the approval of the City
Engineer.
   (d)   Engineering geological reports. Prior to the issuance of a grading
permit, the City Engineer may require an engineering geological investigation,
based upon the proposed grading plan. The engineering geological report,
prepared and signed by an engineering geologist, shall include an adequate
description of the geology of the site and the conclusions and recommendations
regarding the effect of the geological conditions on the proposed development.
   All such reports shall be subject to approval by the City Engineer.
Supplemental reports and data may be required by the City Engineer if deemed
necessary. The recommendations included in the report and approved by the City
Engineer shall be incorporated into the grading plan. Reports shall be required
for all hillside developments. Other developments designated by the City
Engineer may be required to submit reports.
   (e)   Development permits and tract map requirements. No grading permit
shall be issued unless an appropriate development permit or other development
entitlement has been approved, and a grading plan has been approved. Moreover,
no grading permit shall be issued unless adequate bonds have been approved and
accepted by the Public Works Department guaranteeing completion of the grading.
As a condition of any entitlement to develop land, the decision-making body may
limit the height, angle, and design of any cut or fill slope and may impose
standards, such as contour grading (rounding off the tops of slopes) and
extensive landscaping (above that required by the provisions of Section
7-3.24 of this chapter) to mitigate any adverse environmental impact created by
any project.
   (f)   Hillside exploratory regulations. Surface and subsurface exploratory
work shall be performed by a soils engineer and an engineering geologist
approved by the City Engineer on all hillside grading work, except where waived
by the City Engineer. Such exploratory work shall be performed for the purpose
of obtaining detailed information on which the soils engineer and the
engineering geologist shall base recommendations for grading. The work shall be
based upon a detailed, accurate topographic base map prepared by the registered
civil engineer or land surveyor. The map shall be of suitable scale and shall
cover the area to be graded, as well as adjacent areas which may be affected by
the grading. The map shall include the existing and proposed contours, the
locations of streets, pads, slopes, and structures, and pertinent elevations.
   (1)   The engineering geologist’s and soil engineer’s exploratory work
should be conducted at locations considered most likely to reveal any
subsurface weakness which may lead to landslide, slump, or settlement failures.
It is recommended that an investigation be conducted where the stability will
be lessened by the grading or where any of the following conditions are
discovered or proposed:
   (i)   At fault zones where past land movement is evidenced by the presence
of fault gouge;
   (ii)   At contact zones between two (2) or more geologic formations;
   (iii)    At zones of trapped water or high water table quite often
associated with the conditions set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) of this
subsection;
   (iv)   At bodies of intrusive materials;
   (v)   At historic landslides or where the topography is indicative of
prehistoric landslides;
   (vi)   At adversely sloped bedding planes, short range folding, overturned
folds, and the like;
   (vii)    At locations where a fill slope is to be placed above a cut slope;
   (viii)    At proposed cuts exceeding twenty-five (25’) feet in height,
unless in competent rock or less heights in rock of questionable stability;
   (ix)   At the locations of all proposed fills;
   (x)   Where any side hill fills are proposed;
   (xi)   Wherever water from rainfall, irrigation, private sewage disposal
systems, or other probable sources from both the grading project and adjoining
properties is likely to reduce the subsurface stability;
   (xii)    Where the proposed grading may adversely affect the existing or
future stability of adjoining properties; and
   (xiii)   At known fracture zones.
   The investigation shall be sufficient to outline the problems and solutions
to the problems set forth in this subsection.
   (2)   The soils engineer and engineering geologist shall submit written
reports of their findings to the permittee or the civil engineer. Such reports
should include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following data, based
upon detailed surface and subsurface investigations:
   (i)   The engineering geologist’s report should include a detailed geologic
map showing bedrock, soil, alluvium, faults, shears, prominent joint systems,
lithologic contacts, seeps or springs, soils or bedrock slumps, landslides or
failures, and other pertinent geologic features existing on the proposed
grading site. Geologic cross sections, prepared to reasonably depict
anticipated geologic substructure, shall also be included in sufficient numbers
and details. The report should also include detailed logs of all borings, test
pits, or other subsurface data obtained during the course of the investigation.
The subsurface exploration should extend to sufficient depth into the bedrock
to expose the deepest rock affecting the proposed grading. The report should
include specific details and observations for the soils engineer’s use in the
analysis of the stability of cut slopes in zones of shallow or perched
subsurface waters that may affect slope stability.
   (ii)   The soils engineer’s report should include a map of the proposed
grading site showing the locations of all subsurface exploratory test pits or
borings. Detailed logs of the test pits or borings, including the approximate
locations of all soil or rock samples taken for laboratory testing, should also
be included. In addition, laboratory test results, soil classifications, shear
strength characteristics of the soils, and other pertinent soil engineering
data should be presented.
   Sufficient cross sections and cut and fill slope stability analyses should
be included to substantiate recommendations concerning the vertical height and
angle of all slopes on the project.
   Other aids in exploratory work may be used, but subsurface exploratory work
sufficient to support the findings should be performed. Both the engineering
geologist’s and soil engineer’s reports should describe the grading project as
to its location, topographic relief, drainage, geologic and soils types
present, the grading proposed, and the effects of such grading on the site and
adjoining properties and shall contain specific conclusions concerning the
feasibility and anticipated future stability of the overall project and an
analysis of the property on a lot by lot basis. Specific recommendations for
the correction of all known and/or anticipated geologic hazards on the grading
project shall be included.
   Recommendations included in the report and approved by the City Engineer
shall be incorporated into the grading plan or specifications.
   (g)   Revised grading plans. If the soil or other conditions are not as
stated in the application for a grading permit, the City Engineer may suspend
the grading permit until approval is obtained of a revised grading plan.
   (h)   Waivers. The City Engineer may waive the requirement for a contour map
or subsurface exploration as required by the provisions of this section if it
is determined to be unnecessary, but the work shall conform to the provisions
of this chapter and other relevant laws.
   (i)   Excavations for test purposes. Excavations made for test purposes
shall be restored to a condition reasonably approximating the original
condition, including the replacement of the natural landscaping.
   (j)   Import or export of fill materials. The source of the material to be
used for fill or the location to which excavated material will be removed, or
both, shall be identified.

Ord. 1610-NS, eff. January 15, 2016)
Sec. 7-3.09. Permit limitations and conditions.
   (a)   General. The issuance of a grading permit shall constitute an
authorization to do only that work which is described or illustrated on the
application for the permit or on the site plans and specifications approved by
the City Engineer.
   (b)   Responsibility of the permittee and contractor and their agents. The
permittee and contractor and their agents shall carry out the proposed grading
in accordance with the approved plans and specifications, the conditions of the
permit, and the requirements of this chapter and all other applicable laws. The
permittee and contractor and their agents shall maintain all required
protective devices and temporary drainage during the progress of the grading
work and shall be responsible for the observance of the hours of work, dust
control, and methods of hauling. The permittee and contractor and their agents
shall be responsible for the maintenance of the site and the removal of all
debris until such time as a notice of completion has been issued by the City
Engineer. The permittee and contractor and their agents, and each or all of
them, shall become subject to the penalties set forth in this chapter in the
event of failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter and other
applicable laws of the City. No approval shall exonerate the permittee or his
agents from the responsibility of complying with the provisions and intent of
this chapter.
   (c)   Jurisdiction of other agencies. Permits issued pursuant to the
requirements of this chapter shall not relieve the owner of responsibility for
securing the required permits for work to be accomplished which is regulated by
any other law, department, or division of the City, County, or State.
   (d)   Regulation of access or haul routes. The City Engineer may impose
conditions to the permit with respect to access or haul routes to and from
grading sites, the hours of work, methods of controlling dust, and safety
precautions involving pedestrian or vehicular traffic as he shall determine are
required in the interests of the public health, safety, and welfare.
   No permit shall be issued for the export or import of earth materials to or
from a grading site, except upon the following conditions:
   (1)   The size or type of hauling equipment shall be limited in accordance
with the width and conditions of the street.
   (2)   Traffic control devices, including flagmen, signs, and markers, shall
be utilized at appropriate places along the designated routes of access to such
sites.
   (3)   Temporary no parking restrictions may be imposed, with the approval of
the City Engineer, along such routes when determined necessary.
   (4)   Such other conditions as may be determined necessary for the public
health, safety, and welfare shall be imposed.
   (5)   In no event shall any export or import of earth materials to or from a
grading site be undertaken or conducted except by use of equipment which
complies in all respects with the Vehicle Code of the State.
   (6)   All loads shall be properly trimmed and watered or otherwise secured
so as to prevent spilling from the equipment.
   (7)   In all cases where the City Engineer designates the haul routes, such
designation of routes shall take into consideration the most practical means of
transporting the earth materials to or from the grading site consistent with
the safety and welfare of residents along the routes.
   (e)   Time limitations. The permittee shall fully perform and complete all
of the work contemplated to be accomplished pursuant to the grading permit
within the time limit specified in the permit.
   Once grading has commenced, it shall be pursued with diligence so as to
complete the operation within a reasonable period of time. If there is a
cessation of grading activity for a period in excess of sixty (60) days, the
City may utilize the bonds posted to guarantee performance to complete the
grading. In addition, all slopes shall be extensively landscaped and the
appropriate sprinkler system installed in accordance with an approved
landscaping plan prior to the release of a certificate of completion. The
cessation of grading activity between November 1 and April 15 due to heavy
rainfall will not be cause for the City to utilize the bonds to complete the
grading.
   If the permittee is unable to complete the work within the specified time,
he may, prior to the expiration of the permit, submit a written request for an
extension of time in which to complete the work. If, in the opinion of the City
Engineer, sufficient justification is shown, the time specified on the permit
may be extended for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days or as approved by
the City Engineer, but no such extension shall release any surety upon the
bond.
   (f)   Entry upon premises. The City Engineer, the Council, the surety
company, or their duly authorized representatives shall have access to the
premises described in the permit for the purposes of inspecting the progress of
the work. In the event of default in the performance of any term or condition
of the permit, the surety, or any person employed or engaged in his behalf,
shall have the right to go upon the premises to complete the required work,
including the installation of temporary erosion control devices and landscaping
as required by the provisions of this chapter.
   It shall be unlawful for the owner or any other person to interfere with the
ingress or egress from such premises of any authorized representative or agent
of any surety company or the City engaged in the work ordered by the City
Engineer or the Council.
   (g)   Consent of adjacent property owners. Whenever any grading operation
requires entry onto adjacent property for any reason, the permit applicant
shall obtain the written consent of the adjacent property owner or his
authorized representative and shall file a copy of such consent with the City
Engineer before a permit for such grading work may be issued.
   (h)   Restrictions during the rainy season.
   (1)   That period between November 1 and April 15 following is hereby
determined to be the period in which heavy rainfall normally occurs in the
City. During this period no grading work in excess of two hundred fifty (250)
cubic yards shall be authorized to start in any single grading site under a
permit where the City Engineer determines that such work will endanger the
public health or safety.
   Whenever it appears that any grading project previously commenced pursuant
to a permit issued by the City Engineer will not be completed prior to the
commencement of the rainy season, the City Engineer may order the installation
of temporary erosion control devices to protect any property adjacent to such
project.
   (2)   Previously authorized grading work which extends into the rainy season
shall be protected by incorporating temporary erosion control devices.
   (3)   Plans for erosion control devices shall be submitted to the City
Engineer and design approval obtained not later than October 1 of the coming
rainy season. The design of desilting basins which discharge into City streets
or natural watercourses shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
   (4)   All persons performing any grading operations during that period
designated as the rainy season shall put into effect all safety precautions
which are necessary in accordance with good engineering practices. All loose
dirt shall be removed from the grading, site, and adequate anti-erosion or
drainage devices, debris basins, or other safety devices to protect the life,
limb, health, and welfare of private and public property or others from damage
of any kind shall be installed. All temporary erosion control devices,
including desilting basins, shall be installed not later than November 1 of
each year and shall be maintained throughout the rainy season. The removal of
temporary erosion control devices during different phases of construction shall
have the prior approval of the City Engineer.
   (5)   No person shall excavate or fill so as to cause falling rocks, soil,
or debris in any form to fall, slide, or flow onto adjoining properties.
   (6)   All constructed desilting basins which are a part of the grading plan
shall be maintained by the applicant unless otherwise accepted for maintenance
by the City.
   (i)   Regulations relating to archaeological, paleontological, and
historical sites.
   (1)   Known sites. Permits to perform grading at or near known
archaeological, paleontological, or similar sites of historical significance
may be conditioned in such a manner as to:
   (i)   Ensure the preservation of the site;
   (ii)   Minimize adverse impacts on the site;
   (iii)    Allow reasonable time for qualified professionals to perform
archaeological investigations at the site; or
   (iv)   Preserve for posterity, in such other manner as may be necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, the positive aspects of the cultural or
historical site involved.
   (2)   Unknown sites. Where a grading permit has been issued with respect to
an area not known at the time of issuance to include an archaeological,
paleontological, or historical site, and where it is subsequently learned,
either by representatives of the City or by any person doing grading pursuant
to a grading permit, that a significant archaeological, paleontological, or
historical site may be encompassed within the area to be graded or being
graded, all grading shall cease, and the grading permit shall be deemed
suspended. The finding of a site which may be a significant archaeological,
paleontological, or historical site shall be reported to the Public Works
Director and the Community Development Director within seventy-two (72) hours
from the time the site is found. The Community Development Director, upon
receiving such a report, shall cause a preliminary investigation of the site to
be made by qualified professionals within five (5) working days after the time
such a report is received. If the preliminary investigation should confirm that
the site is or may be a significant archaeological, paleontological, or
historical site, the grading permit shall remain suspended for a period not to
exceed forty-five (45) days after the date the finding of the site was first
reported to or learned by the City. During the period of suspension, and as
promptly as reasonably possible, the Community Development Director shall
develop conditions to be attached to the grading permit pursuant to the
provisions of subsection (1) of this subsection. When such conditions are
developed and attached to the permit, the permit shall be deemed reissued
subject to such conditions, and the suspension shall be deemed terminated. In
extraordinary circumstances, the suspension may exceed forty-five (45) days if,
upon application of the Community Development Director to the Council, the
Council shall concur.
   (3)   Any condition or conditions imposed pursuant to the provisions of
subsections (1) or (2) of this subsection may be appealed to the Council in the
manner prescribed in this Code, and the determination of the Council of such
appeal shall be final.

Sec. 7-3.11. Conditions of approval.
   In granting any permit pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the City
Engineer or his authorized representative may attach such conditions as may be
reasonably necessary to prevent the creation of a nuisance or hazard to public
or private property. Such conditions may include, but shall not be limited to:
   (a)   The improvement of any existing grading to bring it up to the
standards of this chapter; and
   (b)   Requirements for fencing excavations or fills which would otherwise be
hazardous.
(§ 2, Ord. 156-NS, eff. August 27, 1970; as amended by § I, Ord. 534-NS, eff.
June 19, 1975)
Sec. 7-3.12. Liability.
   Neither the issuance of a permit pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
nor compliance with the provisions of this chapter or with any conditions
imposed in such permit, shall relieve any person from responsibility for
damages to other persons or property, nor impose any liability upon the City
for damages to other persons or property.
(§ 2, Ord. 156-NS, eff. August 27, 1970; as amended by § I, Ord. 534-NS, eff.
June 19, 1975)
Sec. 7-3.13. Denial of permits.
   (a)   A grading permit shall not be issued in any case where it is found
that the work proposed by the applicant is classed as hazardous grading, as
determined by the City Engineer, and is liable to endanger any private property
or result in the deposit of debris on any public way or interfere with any
existing drainage course.
   (b)   If the land area for which grading is proposed is subject to
geological or flood hazard to the extent that no reasonable amount of
corrective work can eliminate or sufficiently reduce the hazard to human life
or property, the grading permit and building permits for habitable structures
shall be denied.
   (c)   If the proposed grading would not comply with the requirements of an
applicable development permit or tentative tract map, or with any provisions of
law, including the provisions of this chapter, a grading permit shall be
denied.
(§ 2, Ord. 156-NS, eff. August 27, 1970; as amended by § I, Ord. 534-NS, eff.
June 19, 1975)
Sec. 7-3.14. Fees.
   Fees for plan-checking and inspection services in connection with grading
permits and retaining walls to be constructed as part of a grading operation
shall be paid to the Public Works Department in accordance with the current fee
schedule adopted by resolution of the Council.
(§ 2, Ord. 156-NS, eff. August 27, 1970; as amended by § I, Ord. 534-NS, eff.
June 19, 1975)
Sec. 7-3.15. Bonds.
   (a)   Required. A permit will not be issued for excavations or fills of more
than fifty (50) cubic yards until the permittee posts with the office of the
City Engineer a bond or cash deposit to insure compliance with the provisions
of this chapter and all conditions imposed on behalf of the City. (The bond or
cash deposit shall be executed by the owner and a corporate surety authorized
to do business in the State as surety in an amount sufficient to cover the cost
of the project in accordance with the provisions of subsection (f) of this
section, including the corrective work necessary to remove and eliminate
geological hazards.) All bonds shall be executed on forms obtainable at the
office of the City Engineer.
   (b)   Cash bonds. In lieu of a surety bond, the applicant may file a cash
bond with the City Engineer upon the same terms and conditions and in an amount
equal to that which would be required in the surety bond. The cash bond may be
in the form of cash or negotiable United States securities.
   (c)   Application of bonds to adjacent property. Where grading is required
on property adjacent to the grading site under permit to complete a project
satisfactorily, the owner of such adjacent property need not provide an
additional grading bond if the original is of sufficient amount to include such
additional grading.
   (d)   Conditions of bonds. Every bond required by the provisions of this
chapter shall be conditioned that the permittee shall:
   (1)   Comply with all of the provisions of this chapter and all other
applicable laws and ordinances;
   (2)   Comply with all of the terms and conditions of the permit for
excavation and fill to the satisfaction of the City Engineer;
   (3)   Complete all of the work described by the permit, and the plans and
specifications relative thereto, within the time limit specified in the permit.
Upon an application by the permittee, the City Engineer may, for sufficient
cause, extend the time specified in the permit, but no such extension shall
release any surety upon the bond; and
   (4)   Install temporary erosion control devices when required to do so by
the provisions of this chapter.
   (e)   Period and termination of bonds or cash deposits. The term of each
bond shall begin upon the date of filing and shall remain in effect until the
completion of the work to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, plus an
additional period of one year. In the event of failure to complete the work or
of failure to comply with any of the conditions and terms of the permit, the
City Engineer may order the work to be completed as required by the permit. The
surety executing such bond or such deposit shall continue to be firmly bound
under a continuing obligation for the payment of all necessary costs and
expenses which may be incurred or expended by the City in causing any and all
of such required work to be completed and accomplished, and such surety or the
depositor shall assent to any lawful extensions of time within which to
construct and complete such work. In the case of a cash deposit, such deposit
or any unused portion thereof shall be refunded to the permittee.
   The City Engineer may release, reduce, or exonerate the bond or cash deposit
under appropriate conditions when the public health and welfare is not
jeopardized.
   (f)   Amount of bond. The amount of the bond shall be based upon the
estimated cost of the work, plus twenty-five (25%) percent. The estimated cost
shall be established on the basis of the number of cubic yards of material in
either excavations or fills (whichever is the greater amount) at the rate per
yard as set forth in the fee schedule adopted by Council resolution.

Sec. 7-3.16. Hazardous soil and earth conditions.
   Whenever the City Engineer determines by inspection that any land or any
existing excavation or fill, from any cause, has become a menace to life or
limb, endangers public or private property, or adversely affects the safety,
usability, or stability of a public way, the owner or other person in legal
control of the property concerned, upon the receipt of written notice thereof
from the City Engineer, shall correct such condition in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and the requirements and conditions set forth in
such notice to eliminate the undesirable condition. The owner or other person
in legal control of such property shall immediately commence the work required
by such notice and shall complete the work within a maximum time of one hundred
twenty (120) days after the date of such notice, unless a shorter period of
time for completion has been specified in the notice, in which case the owner
or other person shall comply within such time as specified.

Sec. 7-3.17. General excavating and grading requirements.
   (a)   Supervision. The permittee shall provide sufficient supervisory
control during the grading operations to insure compliance with the approved
plans and with the provisions of this Code. The permittee shall avail himself
of geological and/or soils engineering services to implement the supervisory
control of the permittee’s registered civil engineer. The engineering geologist
and/or soils engineer shall be properly qualified, in accordance with the
provisions of Section 7-3.06 of this chapter, and qualified to perform such
services within the City. Periodic reports as required by the City Engineer
shall be submitted by the soils engineer and/or engineering geologist.
   (b)   Safety precautions during grading. If, at any stage of work on an
excavation or fill, the City Engineer determines by inspection that further
work as authorized by an existing permit is likely to endanger any property or
public way, the City Engineer may require that plans for such affected area be
amended to include adequate safety precautions as a condition to allow the work
to continue. The City Engineer may cause the work on the affected area to be
halted and may require that plans be amended to include adequate safety
precautions as a condition to allow the work to continue.
   Safety precautions may include, but shall not be limited to, specifying a
flatter exposed slope or construction of additional drainage facilities, berms,
terracing, compaction, cribbing, retaining walls or buttress fills, slough
walls, desilting basins, check dams, benching, wire mesh and guniting, rock
fences, revetments, or diversion walls.
   (c)   Supervised grading. Where necessary, the City Engineer shall require
the permittee to employ:
   (1)   A registered civil engineer to supervise all grading;
   (2)   A soils engineer to provide either constant or continuous soils
inspections: and
   (3)   An engineering geologist to provide either constant or continuous
geological inspections as suit the job.
   The employment of such persons shall not be deemed to render unnecessary
inspections described in this chapter, except that on any work requiring the
continuous supervision and inspection of a registered civil engineer, the
inspections required by this section may be delegated to the registered civil
engineer by the City Engineer.
   If the registered civil engineer, soils engineer, or engineering geologist,
fulfilling his responsibility pursuant to the provisions of this section, finds
that work is not being done in conformance with the provisions of this chapter
or the plans and specifications approved by the City Engineer, the registered
civil engineer, soils engineer, or engineering geologist shall immediately
notify the person in charge of the grading work, and if the nonconformity is
not corrected, the City Engineer shall be notified in writing of the
nonconformity and of the corrective measures to be taken. Such notice shall be
delivered to the office of the City Engineer within twenty-four (24) hours
except in the case of mass grading, which is more than 10,000 cubic yards per
day, when the time limit shall be eight (8) hours.
   If, for any reason, the services of any of the three (3) professional
persons are terminated during the progress of the grading work, such
professional person and the permittee shall immediately notify the City
Engineer in writing. Such termination may result in temporary delays in the
grading operations until satisfactory arrangements are made to assure the City
Engineer that competent professional supervision is provided. When the services
of one or all three (3) of the professionals of record are terminated, the
professional whose services have been terminated shall submit to the City
Engineer certification of work performed under his supervision, along with
deficiencies to be corrected. The new professional shall submit to the City
Engineer a letter of certification that the previous professional’s design,
reports, and recommendations have been reviewed, that all provisions the City
Engineer required as conditions of the grading permit will be complied with
during the course of the work, and that he shall review the detailed grading
plans and thus assume his responsibility as set forth in this chapter for all
future grading on the project. The letters shall be referenced to the approved
grading plans prepared by the design civil engineer.
   The certification shall state that the job was constructed as indicated by
the “as built” plant, that the soils engineer and engineering geologist’s
reports and certifications have been submitted, that they have provided their
services in accordance with good practices, and that all drainage provisions
and safety features have been incorporated in the grading of the site.
   (d)   Hillside grading. The rules and regulations set forth in this
subsection shall apply to all hillside grading in the City which shall be
considered supervised grading.
   The permittee shall employ a registered civil engineer to prepare the design
of grading plans for all hillside grading. The design civil engineer shall
prepare his design in accordance with good planning practices and applicable
codes and to the restrictions imposed as determined by detailed studies of the
site and materials to be graded. Such studies shall be performed by a soils
engineer and an engineering geologist approved by the City Engineer and shall
be submitted prior to the issuance of permits. The civil engineer shall furnish
sufficient supervision during construction to obtain compliance with the plans
as approved.
   The permittee shall employ a soils engineer and an engineering geologist
whose duties shall be to work closely with the civil engineer, to examine
surface and subsurface conditions in accordance with the provisions of
subsection (f) of Section 7-3.08 of this chapter, and to submit reports
thereon. Such reports, in conjunction with the provisions of this chapter,
shall form the basis for the design of the grading project. Such reports shall
be based upon a detailed topographic base map of the area to be graded and
shall include specific conclusions and recommendations for avoidance or
correction of all known existing or anticipated geologic hazards and any
adverse soil conditions on or affecting the site or contiguous property.
   The soils engineer, in addition to his pregrading exploratory work, shall
provide inspections during the placement of all compacted fill in accordance
with the requirements of this chapter, the approved plans, and good engineering
practices. In addition, he shall follow the progress of the job sufficiently
close to determine that the recommendations of his pregrading report are
followed. If conditions which require the modification of plans are encountered
during grading, he shall submit a report of his findings and recommendations
for a change of plans to the permittee and the civil engineer, the engineering
geologist, and the City Engineer. Periodic reports may be required as set forth
in subsection (a) of this section.
   The engineering geologist, in addition to his pre-grading exploratory work,
shall provide inspections during the actual grading process at least as often
as determined to be appropriate by the City Engineer. Such grading inspections
by the engineering geologist are to determine that the conditions of his
pregrading reports are as anticipated. If conditions which require the
modification of plans are encountered during grading, he shall submit a report
of his findings and recommendations to the permittee, the civil engineer, the
soils engineer, and the City Engineer. Periodic reports may be required as set
forth in subsection (a) of this section.
   The soils engineer, at the completion of the grading, shall submit a
certified report of compaction tests for all fill located within the limits of
the tract and/or off-site grading areas. The soils engineer’s final report
shall also include a statement that all subdrains were installed, his
professional opinion of the suitability of the fill placement area and the
ability of the natural materials to support the compacted fill without
excessive settlement of the fill or potential damage to structures erected
thereon, and a statement to the effect that he has inspected all cuts and fills
and that, in his opinion, they meet the design requirements. The report shall
be referenced to a dated “as built” plan prepared by the design civil engineer.
   The engineering geologist, at the completion of grading, shall submit a
final geologic report stating that he has maintained the required in-grading
inspection, that the recommendations of his pregrading report have been
followed, that in his professional opinion all known adverse geologic
conditions have been corrected or provided for, that future adverse geologic
conditions are not anticipated, and that all lots or sites are geologically
suitable and safe for construction. The report shall include the geologist’s
certification that he has inspected all cut slopes and sidehill fill placement
areas prior to the placement of fill. He shall also certify that all subdrain
placement areas were inspected prior to the installation of the subdrains. The
report shall be referenced to a dated “as built” plan prepared by the design
civil engineer.
   Upon completion of the grading, the civil engineer responsible for the
design shall submit an “as built” plan to the City Engineer for the approval of
all work covered by the grading permit and shall include the following:
   (1)   The plan shall be one inch equals forty (40’) feet scale, unless
otherwise approved by the City Engineer, and shall show the locations of
streets, pads, slopes, structures, pertinent elevations, original contours and
finished elevations, and other pertinent information required to show the as-
built condition, and shall be dated.
   (2)   The plan shall bear the signature of the design civil engineer who
shall certify that he has inspected the site, reviewed the plans, and that the
work shown and completed is substantially in accordance with his design.
   (3)   The plan shall also bear the signatures of the soils engineer and the
engineering geologist who shall certify that they have reviewed the plans and
that the work shown and completed is in accordance with their recommendations.

June 19, 1975)
Sec. 7-3.18. Inspections of excavations and fills.
   (a)   Requirements. All construction or work for which a permit is required
shall be subject to inspections by authorized employees of the City, and
certain types of work to be determined by the City Engineer shall have either
continuous or constant inspection and supervision by a registered civil
engineer, and/or other appropriate consultants, soils engineer, and engineering
geologist as a condition of the issuance of the grading permit. Prior to
issuing a grading certificate, a final inspection shall be made of all
construction or work for which a permit has been issued.
   (b)   Exposure of work. Whenever any work on which called inspections are
required, as specified in this section, is covered or concealed by additional
work without having first been inspected, the City Engineer may require, by
written notice, that such work be exposed for examination. The work of exposing
and recovering shall not entail expense to the City.
   (c)   Notices. The permittee or his agent shall notify the City Engineer
twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the time when the grading operation is
ready for each of the following inspections:
   (1)   Initial inspections. When the permittee is ready to begin work but
before any grading or brushing is started;
   (2)   Toe inspections. After the natural ground is exposed and prepared to
receive fill but prior to the placing of any fill. Approval for placing fill
shall not be made until all debris and unsuitable material has been removed
from the site to an approved location;
   (3)   Subdrain inspections. Inspections shall be required on all subdrains
after the installation but prior to the placement of any fill;
   (4)   Excavation inspections. After the excavation is started but before the

   (5)   Fill inspections. After the fill emplacement is started but before the
combined vertical height of the lift exceeds ten (10’) feet;
   (6)   Drainage device inspections. After the forms, steel reinforcement, and
pipe are in place but before any concrete is placed;
   (7)   Rough grading. When all the rough grading has been completed. This
inspection may be called for at the completion of the rough grading without the
necessity of the City Engineer having previously reviewed and approved
applicable reports;
   (8)   Rough grading certification. A conditional interim certificate may be
issued to the Public Works Department to allow the issuance of building
permits. This certificate shall in no way exonerate the applicant from
completing the grading;
   (9)   Final certification. When all work, including the installation of all
drainage structures, other protective devices, the compaction of trench
backfill, and planting and slope stabilization, has been completed and the “as
built” plan and required reports have been submitted;
   (10)    Other inspections. In addition to the called inspections provided by
this section, the City Engineer may make any other inspections of any work to
ascertain compliance with the provisions of this chapter and other laws; and
   (11)    Interrupted grading. When the permittee is ready to resume work, but
before any grading or brushing is started, the permittee or his agent shall
notify the City Engineer twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the time when the
grading operation is ready.
   (d)   Certification. The City Engineer shall certify to the Building
Official, upon the completion of the grading work, that all grading work has
been done in compliance with all approved grading plans and reports and that
all applicable Building Code regulations shall be administered by the office of
the Building Official thereafter.
   (e)   Issuance of certificates. Upon the final inspection when it is found
that the work authorized by the grading permit, including the installation of
all drainage structures, has been satisfactorily completed in accordance with
the requirements of this chapter, a grading certificate covering such work
shall be issued to the permittee by the City Engineer.
   (f)   Final reports. Upon the completion of the work, the City Engineer may
require the following reports and information:
   (1)   A report from a registered civil engineer certifying that all grading,
lot drainage, and drainage facilities have been completed in conformance with
the approved plans and the provisions of this chapter and that the graded site
will support residential or commercial type structures, whichever is
applicable;
   (2)   A soils engineering report including, but not limited to,
certification of the soil bearing capacity, summaries of field and laboratory
tests, locations of tests, expansive soil classification lot by lot, and slope
tests taken in the fills showing the limits of compacted fill on an “as built”
grading plan;
   (3)   An engineering geology report by the engineering geologist, based on
the final contour map, including specific approval of the grading as affected
by geological factors. Where necessary, a revised geologic map, cross sections,
and any recommendations necessary shall be included; and
   (4)   When “as built” grading plans are required, as determined by the City
Engineer, such plans shall be signed by the supervising civil engineer, the

June 19, 1975)
Sec. 7-3.19. Excavations.
   (a)   Height. Cut slopes shall not exceed a vertical height of twenty-five
(25’) feet unless approved by the Planning Commission or City Council. If a cut
slope is permitted above such height, a horizontal bench with a minimum width
of twenty-five (25’) feet may be required to be installed at each one hundred
(100’) feet of vertical height, and intervening terraces may also be required
as set forth in subsection (e) of this section. Slope height shall be measured
by taking the difference in the elevation of the top of slope and the toe of
slope. The top of slope height shall be measured at the center of the radius
where slope rounding to blend with natural terrain is employed.
   (b)   Slope. Excavations shall not be made with a cut face steeper in slope
than two (2) horizontal to one vertical.
   Exceptions.
   (1)   The City Engineer may authorize a cut slope which is steeper in slope
than two (2) horizontal to one vertical, and has a slope height of less than
six (6') feet, if:
   (i)   The applicant can demonstrate that because of special circumstances
applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location, or
surroundings, the strict application of this section would deprive such
property of the ability to be reasonably developed; and
   (ii)   The applicant produces sufficient data from a soils engineer, an
engineering geologist, and a landscape architect to demonstrate that the
material of which the slope is composed and that the material underlying the
slope is capable of permanent stability on a steeper slope, and that the
required slope planting can be adequately maintained.
   (2)   The Planning Commission or City Council may authorize a cut slope
which is steeper in slope than two (2) horizontal to one vertical and which
exceeds six (6’) feet in height if:
   (i)   The applicant can demonstrate that because of special circumstances
applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location, or
surroundings, the strict application of this section would deprive such
property of the ability to be reasonably developed; and
   (ii)   The applicant produces sufficient data from a soils engineer, an
engineering geologist, and a landscape architect to demonstrate that the
material of which the slope is composed and that the material underlying the
slope is capable of permanent stability on a steeper slope, and that the
required slope planting can be adequately maintained.
   (c)   Unstable material. If the material of the slope is of such composition
and character as to be
unstable, considering all types of anticipated loading and moisture conditions,
the engineering geologist and soils engineer shall, by testing and analysis,
provide specific criteria for the stabilization of such material by the
reduction of the slope angle, by buttressing, or by a combination of these or
other means.
   (d)   Cut slope limits. Tops of cut slopes shall not be made nearer than one
(1’) foot plus one-fifth (1/5) the height of the cut to the project boundary
but need not exceed a horizontal distance of ten (10’) feet. Cut slopes shall
not be divided horizontally by property lines, and cut slopes occurring on a
side or rear lot line shall be made a part of the downhill lot. If the City
Engineer determines that such requirement is unnecessary because of special
conditions, he may make adjustments as a condition of the grading permit.
   (e)   Intervening terraces. Terraces shall be paved (concrete or gunite)
terraces on cut slopes, shall have a minimum width of six (6’) feet, shall be
extensively landscaped in accordance with an approved landscaping plan, and
shall be spaced at intervals of thirty (30’) feet measured vertically. Where
only one terrace is utilized, it shall be placed at approximate mid-height. For
slopes flatter than two (2) to one, or where soil conditions warrant,
additional intervening terraces may be required.
   (f)   Temporary excavations and shoring. Excavations shall not remove the
lateral support from a public way or from an existing structure. For the
purposes of this section, the lateral support shall be considered to have been
removed when any of the following conditions exist:
   (1)   The excavation exposes any adverse geological formations which would
affect the lateral support of a public way or of an adjacent structure.
   (2)   The excavation extends below a plane extending downward at an angle of
forty-five (45) degrees from the edge of the public way.
   Exception: Normal footing excavations not exceeding two (2’) feet in depth
shall not be construed as removing lateral support.
   (3)   The excavation extends below a plane extending downward at an angle of
forty-five (45) degrees from the bottom of a footing of an existing structure.
   (g)   Excavations adjacent to an existing structure or public way.
Excavations adjacent to an existing structure or public way may be steeper than
one horizontal to one vertical where either:
   (1)   A foundation investigation by a soils engineer recommending that the
slope may be steeper than one to one has been approved by the City Engineer; or
   (2)   Temporary shoring is designed to support the excavation and plans are
approved and a permit is issued by the City Engineer.
   (i)   The temporary shoring shall be designated for an earth pressure
equivalent to that erected by a fluid weighing not less than thirty (30) pounds
per cubic foot, plus all surcharge loads, or as recommended by a soils engineer
and approved by the City Engineer.
   (ii)   The soil bearing values shall be those recommended by a soils
engineer and approved by the City Engineer.
   (iii)    The design of the required temporary shoring and necessary
underpinning shall include a sequence of construction and installation.
   (iv)   The allowable stresses used in the design of the temporary shoring
may be increased thirty-three and one-third (33-1/3%) percent for structural
and reinforcing steel and twenty-five (25%) percent for wood. No increase shall
be permitted for concrete.
   No action of the Council, Planning Commission, or City Engineer shall be
construed to waive the requirements of the General Safety Orders of the
Department of Industrial Relations of the State.
(§ 2, Ord. 156-NS, eff. August 27, 1970, as amended by § I, Ord. 534-NS, eff.
June 19, 1975, and § 1, Ord. 1098-NS, eff. April 11, 1991)
Sec. 7-3.20. Fills.
   (a)   Height. No finished fill slope shall exceed a vertical height of
twenty-five (25') feet unless approved by the Planning Commission or City
Council. If a fill slope is permitted above such height, a horizontal bench
with a minimum width of twenty-five (25’) feet may be required to be installed
at each one hundred (100’) feet of vertical height, and intervening terraces
also may be required as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
   (b)   Slope. No fill shall be made which creates any exposed surface steeper
in slope than two (2) horizontal to one vertical.
   Exceptions:
   (1)   The City Engineer may authorize a fill slope which is steeper in slope
than two (2) horizontal to one vertical and is less than six (6’) feet in
height, if:
   (i)   The applicant can demonstrate that because of special circumstances
applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location, or
surroundings, the strict application of this section would deprive such
property of the ability to be reasonably developed; and
   (ii)   The applicant produces sufficient data from a soils engineer, an
engineering geologist, and a landscape architect to demonstrate that the
material of which the slope is composed and that the material underlying the
slope is capable of permanent stability on a steeper slope, and that the
required slope planting can be adequately maintained.
   (2)   The Planning Commission or City Council may authorize a fill slope
which is steeper in slope than two (2) horizontal to one vertical and which
exceeds six (6’) feet in height, if:
   (i)   The applicant can demonstrate that because of special circumstances
applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location, or
surroundings, the strict application of this section would deprive such
property of the ability to be reasonably developed; and
   (ii)   The applicant produces sufficient data from a soils engineer, an
engineering geologist, and a landscape architect to demonstrate that the
material of which the slope is composed and that the material underlying the
slope is capable of permanent stability on a steeper slope, and that the
required slope planting can be adequately maintained.
   (c)   Unstable material. The City Engineer may require that the fill be
constructed with an exposed surface flatter than two (2) horizontal to one
vertical if, under the particular conditions, such flatter surface is necessary
for stability or safety.
   (d)   Fill slope limits. Toes of fill slopes shall not be made nearer to a
project boundary line than one-half (1/2) of the height of the fill but need
not exceed a horizontal distance of twenty (20’) feet. Fill slopes shall not be
divided horizontally by property lines, and fill slopes occurring on a side or
rear lot line shall be made a part of the downhill lot. If the City Engineer
determines such requirement is unnecessary because of special conditions, he
may make adjustments as a condition of the grading permit.
   (e)   Intervening terraces. Terraces shall be paved terraces, shall have a
minimum width of six (6’) feet, shall be extensively landscaped in accordance
with an approved landscaping plan, and shall be spaced at vertical intervals of
thirty (30’) feet; provided, however, for slopes less than forty (40’) feet in
vertical height, the terraces shall be approximately at mid-height. For slopes
flatter than two (2) horizontal to one vertical, or where soil conditions
require, additional intervening terraces may be required.
   (f)   Compaction. All fills shall be placed, compacted, inspected, and
tested in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. If the strict
enforcement of the provisions of this subsection is determined by the City
Engineer to be unnecessary because of the proposed or probable use of the land,
he may waive the requirements. The requirements of this subsection shall not be
waived when structures are to be supported by the fill, or if the fills are
being placed in areas to be designated as hillside, or where they are necessary
as a safety measure to aid in preventing the saturation, settling, slipping, or
erosion of the fill.
   (1)   The natural ground surface shall be prepared to receive fill by
removing vegetation, noncomplying fill, top soil, and/or porous, compressible
soil. Where natural slopes are five (5) horizontal to one vertical or
steeper, and the height of the fill is twenty (20') feet or greater, benching
into sound bedrock or other competent material shall be required. Fill slopes
which toe on natural slopes shall be provided with adequate drainage.
   (2)   No deleterious material shall be permitted in fills. Except as
otherwise permitted by the City Engineer, no rock or similar irreducible
material with a maximum dimension greater than eight (8”) inches shall be
buried or placed in fills.
   Upon recommendations made by a soils engineer and approved by the City
Engineer prior to the grading of any project, rock with dimensions from eight
(8”) inches to thirty-six (36”) inches may be placed in compacted fill. Such
oversized rocks shall not be in the upper ten (10’) feet of compacted fill or
nearer than twenty (20’) feet to the surface of any fill slope. Such rock areas
shall be shown on “as built” plans and certified to be compacted by the soils
engineer.
   (3)   The fill shall be spread in a series of layers, each not exceeding
eight (8”) inches in thickness, and shall be compacted by an approved method
after each layer is spread.
   (4)   The moisture content of the fill material shall be controlled at the
time of spreading and compacting to obtain the required relative compaction and
avoid excessive pore pressure as the fill increases in depth.
   (5)   All fills shall be compacted to a minimum of ninety (90%) percent of
the maximum density as determined by A.S.T.M. D 1557-66T, Method A or C,
modified to three (3) layers. If the required degree of relative compaction
cannot be attained on sloped surfaces, the slope shall be cut back until the
compacted inner core is exposed.
   The field density shall be measured in accordance with the procedure
specified in A.S.T.M. D 1556-58T, or a later revision, using the optional base
plate and making a suitable adjustment for volumes of rocks in the test hole or
other approved testing methods giving equivalent test results.
   (6)   A field density test, as set forth in subsection (5) of this
subsection, shall be taken for each eighteen (18”) inches of fill, or portion
thereof, measured vertically from the lowest point of the area to be filled, or
for each one thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill placed. In addition, in the
case of subdivisions, at least one field density test shall be taken on each
lot which receives fill.
   (7)   All fills regulated by the provisions of this chapter shall be tested
for relative compaction by the soils engineer. A certificate of compliance with
the terms of this section and the grading permit, setting forth densities,
relative compaction, the expansive soil report, allowable bearing value, and
other soil characteristics, shall be prepared and signed by the soils engineer.
Such report shall be submitted to, and be approved by, the City Engineer before
any final approval of the fill is given and before any foundation construction
begins.
   (8)   If building is not commenced within one year following the final
certification and approval by the City Engineer, a reevaluation as to the
adequacy of the intended use and a report shall be filed with the City Engineer
for approval. Such report shall contain data on compaction, stabilization, and
expansive soils.
   (g)   Fills toeing out on natural slopes. Fills toeing out on natural slopes
which are steeper than two (2) horizontal to one vertical shall not be
permitted.
   (h)   Combined cut and fill slopes. Combined cut and fill slopes shall meet
the requirements of subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section insofar
as steepness, height, and benching are concerned except that, where the slope
exceeds twenty-five (25’) feet in height, the required drainage bench shall be
placed at the top of the cut slope.
   Fill placed on or above the top of an existing or proposed cut or natural
slope steeper than three (3) horizontal to one vertical shall be set back from
the top of the slope a minimum distance of six (6’) feet.
   (i)   Existing fills. All existing man-made fills on any and all sites shall
be properly evaluated, and, if deficiencies exist, recommendations and design
criteria for corrective measures shall be included within the soils engineering
report.
   (j)   Progress reports.
   (1)   Periodic soils reports by a soils engineer certifying the compaction
or acceptability of all fills may be required. Such reports shall include, but
need not be limited to, the inspection of cleared areas and benches prepared to
receive fill and the removal of all soil and unsuitable materials, the bearing
capacity of the fill to support structures, the placement and compaction of
fill materials, and the inspection of buttress fills, subdrains, and similar
devices. The frequency of such reports shall be at the discretion of the City
Engineer and shall be a condition of the grading permit.

potential springs or seeps which will be covered by the fill. Subdrains shall
be installed after any watercourse has been excavated to firm material in
preparation for receiving the fill. Individual design shall be shown on each
plan for the City Engineer's approval. Upon the recommendation of the soils
engineer and engineering geologist, and upon the approval of the City Engineer,
the installation of subdrains may be eliminated.
   (h)   Site drainage. All building pads with cut or fill shall be constructed
to carry surface waters to the nearest practical street, storm drain, or
natural watercourse approved by the City Engineer and/or appropriate
governmental agency as a safe place to deposit such waters. At least a two (2%)
percent grade toward the approval disposal area shall be required for building
pads. Where recommended by the soils engineer, eave or ground gutters shall be
provided to receive all roof water and deliver it through a non-erosive device
to a street or watercourse. Compacted fill berms shall be required to be

private property who fails to remove pollutants within a reasonable time, as
determined by the director, may be charged with a violation of this section.
   (c)    It is unlawful to, and no person shall, fail to take every reasonable
step, consistent with or as set forth in an approved individualized best
management practices manual, or if none, the written standardized City best
management practices manual on file by the Public Works Department, to reduce
to the maximum extent practicable the discharge of stormwater containing any
pollutant.
   (d)    It is unlawful to, and no person shall, engage in any activity which
will, or may, result in a pollutant or pollutants entering the storm drain
system or watercourses, unless, after notice from the City, all practicable
measures to reduce such pollutants have been undertaken.
   (e)   It is unlawful for an owner of real property subject to, and their
successors or assigns, or a named responsible party in, a City approved
stormwater quality master plan or a stormwater pollution control plan to fail
to implement and adhere to the terms, conditions and requirements of such a
plan.

Article 3. Control of Urban Runoff
Sec. 7-8.301. Development, stormwater quality master and stormwater pollution
control plans.
   (a)   On and after September 1, 1999, all development activity within the
City shall be undertaken in accordance with all of the following:
   (1)   The conditions and requirements established by the NPDES permit or
other permit which are reasonably related to the reduction or elimination of
pollutants in stormwater from the project site.
   (2)   A stormwater pollution prevention plan, which shall be prepared in
accordance with state general permit requirements.
   (3)   A stormwater pollution control plan (if applicable), which shall be
prepared in accordance with City requirements.
   (4)   Any condition and requirement of a stormwater quality master plan
covering the development site. A stormwater quality master plan shall be
required to be submitted by the property owner in accordance with the City’s
requirements when the director determines that the development may result in
the discharge of significant levels of any pollutant to the storm drain system,
such as, but not limited to, the cases of specific plans, multi-phased
subdivisions, redevelopment plans and larger planned developments.
   (5)   The conditions and/or requirements established by the City to protect
specific watersheds or drainage basins.
   (b)   Prior to issuance by the City of any permit authorizing grading or
construction for a development, the property owner of the site for such
contemplated activity shall submit to and obtain the approval of the Director
for a stormwater pollution control plan.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a stormwater pollution control plan
shall not be required for construction by a property owner of only one single
family detached residential unit, for a room addition to any existing
residential unit, or for projects that require a grading permit and result in
soil disturbance of less than one acre of surface area and which is not part of
a larger common plan of development, unless the Director determines that the
grading may result in the discharge of significant levels of a pollutant into
the storm drain system. This exemption shall not apply to a phased project with
construction of one home at a time but more than one dwelling unit is to be
constructed over the full course of that residential project by any person.
   (d)   Each stormwater pollution control plan or stormwater quality master
plan shall name a responsible party for the project and compliance with the
plan.
   (e)   A City processing fee, in an amount determined by a City Council
resolution, for its costs and expenses incurred in the review, approval, or
revision of any stormwater pollution control plan and/or stormwater quality
master plan shall be charged to the property owner or responsible party and
shall be due and payable to the City at the time the plan is submitted to the
City for review.
   (f)   Compliance with the conditions and requirements of a stormwater
pollution control plan and/or stormwater quality master plan shall not exempt
any person from the requirement to comply independently with each provision of
this chapter.
   (g)   Proof of compliance with the state general permit for stormwater
discharges associated with construction activity (NPDES Permit No. CAS000002)
may be required in a form acceptable to the City prior to issuance by the City
of any permit authorizing grading or construction; upon inspection of the
construction site; during any enforcement proceeding or action; or for any
other reasonable cause.
(§ 1, Ord. 1343-NS, eff. October 14, 1999)
Sec. 7-8.302. Best management practices and requirements.
   (a)   Any person engaged in any land use, activities or operations, or
owning facilities or property, which may result in pollutants entering the
storm drain system, as determined by the director, shall prepare, be subject to
or obtain a best management practices manual and then implement those best
management practices to the maximum extent practicable to prevent or reduce
such discharge of pollutants to the City’s storm drain system or watercourses.
   (b)    The Director may adopt requirements identifying appropriate terms,
obligations and minimum content of a best management practices manual (“BMPs”)
for any land use, activity, business, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute the discharge of a pollutant to, or contamination of, the storm
drain system. If relevant, certain BMPs have been prepared and promulgated by
the City or any Federal, State, and/or regional agency for certain activities,
operations, or facilities, which could cause the discharge of pollutants to the
City’s storm drain system or watercourses, and every person undertaking such a
designated activity or operation, or owning or operating such facility shall
comply with such BMPs.
(§ 1, Ord. 1343-NS, eff. October 14, 1999)
Sec. 7-8.303. Notification of intent and compliance with general permits.
   Each responsible party, owner or discharger associated with any development
or nonexempt construction activity, or any other discharger described in any
NPDES or NPDES general permit as may be adopted by the EPA, the State Water
Resources Control Board, or the Regional Water Quality Control Board, shall
provide notice of intent, comply with, and undertake all other activities
required by such permit applicable to such discharges.
(§ 1, Ord. 1343-NS, eff. October 14, 1999)
Sec. 7-8.304. Elimination of illicit discharge and illicit connections.
   (a)   After written notification is mailed, personally delivered or posted,
the Director may require any person responsible for an illicit discharge to
immediately, or by a specified date, eliminate or discontinue the illicit
discharge, and the Director, if necessary as the result of an imminent or
pending storm event, may take immediate measures to eliminate the source of the
illicit discharge. If the discharge is not discontinued in the time specified,
the Director may take any enforcement measure described in this chapter and
steps reasonably necessary to eliminate the source of the illicit discharge or
to prevent the reoccurrence of future illicit discharges.
   (b)   After written notification is mailed, personally delivered or posted,
the Director may require a person in control of or responsible for an illicit
connection to the storm drain system to secure approval for the connection by a
specified date, regardless of whether or not the connection or discharges to it
had been established or approved prior to the effective date of this chapter.
If, subsequent to eliminating a connection found to be in violation of this
chapter, the person can demonstrate that an illicit discharge will no longer
occur, said person may request approval to reconnect. The reconnection or
reinstallation of the connection shall be at the director's discretion and
shall be subject to such conditions as the Director may determine; such
reconnection or reinstallation shall be at the requesting person’s sole
expense.
(§ 1, Ord. 1343-NS, eff. October 14, 1999)
Article 4. Inspections
Sec. 7-8.401. Scope of inspections.
   (a)   Right to enter to inspect. Upon presenting identification and an oral
request to enter made to any person who appears to be in possession or control
of any operation, business or real property, or where no such person is
present, after a written request to enter is mailed, personally delivered, or
faxed to the person in possession or control of any operation, business or real
property, the Director has the right to, and is hereby granted the power and
right to, enter onto the exterior/out-of-doors (or areas not being within a
fully enclosed structure) of private property within the City solely for the
purpose to inspect, monitor or investigate as to the possible source or
potential source of a discharge to the storm drain system or watercourses.
Except for occupied residential property, such right to enter shall be
exercisable at any time. For an occupied residential property, such entry shall
be made only during daylight hours.
   (b)   Compliance assessments. The Director may inspect property for the
purpose of verifying compliance with this chapter, including but not limited
to:
   (1)   Identifying products produced, processes conducted, chemicals used and
materials stored on or contained within the property;
   (2)   Identifying point(s) of discharge of all wastewater, process water
systems and pollutants;
   (3)   Investigating the natural slope at the location, including drainage
patterns and man-made conveyance systems (including roads with drainage
systems, catch basins, curbs, gutters, channels and storm drains);
   (4)   Establishing the location of all points of discharge from the
property, whether by surface runoff or through a storm drain system;
   (5)   Locating any illicit connection or the source of any illicit
discharge;
   (6)   Evaluating compliance with any stormwater pollution control plan; and
   (7)   Evaluating compliance with any permit issued pursuant to this chapter.
   (c)   Records review. The director may demand the production of such records
as is necessary to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter and
for the purpose of examination and copying.
   (d)   Sample and test. The Director may inspect, sample and test any area
runoff, soils within the source property, liquids, discharge, or materials
within any storage area (including any container contents), and/or treatment
system discharge for the purpose of determining the potential for contribution
of pollutants to the storm drain system. The Director may investigate the
structural integrity and condition of all storm drains, sanitary sewer
facilities/systems or other tanks, reservoirs or pipelines on the property
using appropriate tests, including but not limited to smoke and dye tests or
video surveys. The Director may take photographs or videotape, make
measurements or drawings, and create any other record reasonably necessary to
document conditions on the property.
   (e)   Monitoring. For the purpose of measuring any discharge or potential
source of discharge to the storm drain system, the Director may undertake a
monitoring program and other analysis, which may include both the installation
and maintenance of monitoring devices, or require the owner or person in charge
of day-to-day operations of the property to undertake the installation, record
keeping and maintenance of such monitoring devices, at the owner’s/operator’s
expense.
   (f)   Test results. The owner or person in charge of day-to-day operations
of the property subject to inspection shall provide copies of test results to
the City and, on submission of a written request to the Director, be entitled
to a copy of the test results conducted by the Director.
   (g)   Unreasonable delays. Unreasonable delays by the owner, occupant or
person in charge of day to day operations of private property in allowing the
Director access to the premises, or in the production of any demanded records,
beyond the date set forth in a written request shall be a violation of this
chapter.
   (h)   Inspection/search warrants. If the Director has been refused access to
a building, structure, property or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect, monitor and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the City designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the Director may seek
issuance of an administrative inspection or criminal search warrant from any
court of competent jurisdiction.
(§ 1, Ord. 1343-NS, eff. October 14, 1999)
Article 5. Enforcement and Penalties
Sec. 7-8.501. Administrative remedies.
   (a)   Notice of violation. When the director has probable cause to believe
that there may be a violation of this chapter, the Director may issue and
deliver to the owner, occupant or person in charge of day-to-day operations of
any public or private property, or to any person responsible for an illicit
connection or illicit discharge a notice of violation. The notice of violation
shall:
   (1)   Identify the provision(s) of this chapter, the best management
practices, the applicable storm water pollution prevention plan, stormwater
pollution control plan, stormwater quality management plan or permit alleged to
have been, or are then being, violated and describe the manner of compliance or
abatement required;
   (2)   State that continued noncompliance may result in additional penalties
and enforcement actions against the owner, person in charge, and/or occupant;
and
   (3)    State a compliance date that must be met by the owner, person in
charge and/or occupant;
   (b)   Administrative compliance orders. When the Director has probable cause
to believe that there may be a continuing or repeated violation of this
chapter, the Director may issue and deliver to the owner, occupant or person in
charge of day to day operations of any property, or to any person responsible
for an illicit connection or illicit discharge, an administrative compliance
order. The administrative compliance order may include the following terms and
requirements:
   (1)   Specific steps and time schedules for compliance as reasonably
necessary to prevent continued or threatened illicit discharges;
   (2)   Specific steps and time schedules for compliance as reasonably
necessary to discontinue any illicit connection;
   (3)   Specific requirements for containment, remediation, cleanup, removal,
storage, installation of overhead covering, or proper disposal of any pollutant
having the potential to contact stormwater runoff;
   (4)   Any other terms or requirements reasonably calculated to prevent
continued or threatened violations of this chapter, including, but not limited
to requirements for compliance with best management practice guidance documents
promulgated by any federal agency, the State of California or the City; and
   (5)   Any other terms or requirements reasonably calculated to achieve full
compliance with the terms, conditions and requirements of the stormwater
quality management plan, stormwater pollution prevention plan, stormwater
pollution control plan, stormwater quality master plan or permit issued
pursuant to this chapter.
   (c)   Cease and desist orders. If the Director determines that the public
health and safety requires the same, may issue a cease and desist order
directing the owner and/or person in charge of day-to-day operations of the
private property and/or any other person responsible for a violation of the
chapter to:
   (1)   Immediately discontinue any illicit connection or illicit discharge to
the storm drain system;
   (2)   Immediately contain or divert any flow of non-stormwater off the
property, where the flow is occurring in violation of any provision of this
chapter;
   (3)   Immediately discontinue any other violation of this chapter;
   (4)   Clean up the area affected by the violation as a condition of removal
of the order.
   (d)   Recovery of city’s costs; invoice of costs. When a notice of
violation, administrative compliance order, cease and desist order or any other
enforcement option is utilized to obtain compliance with this chapter, all
actual costs and expenses incurred by or of the City for City administrative
overhead, City salaries, attorney fees, expert fees, testing and monitoring
expenses, and other expenses incurred as a result of or during any inspection,
investigation, monitoring or administrative enforcement action conducted
pursuant to this chapter shall be a debt of, charged to and paid by the person
found to be violating this chapter. The Director may deliver an invoice for
costs to the owner, occupant or person in charge of day-to-day operations of
private property, any permittee or any responsible party, or any other person
who becomes subject to a notice of violation, administrative compliance order,
or cease and desist order. An invoice for costs shall be immediately due and
payable to the City and if not paid within thirty (30) days shall earn interest
at the rate of 1.5 percent per month until fully paid. If any owner, occupant,
person in charge of day-to-day operations, permittee or responsible party, or
any other person fails to either pay the invoice for costs or have the amount
of the invoice for costs reduced on appeal to the City Council in accordance
with this chapter, then the City may institute collection proceedings.
   (e)   Delivery of notice. Any notice of violation, administrative compliance
order, cease and desist order or invoice of costs to be “delivered” pursuant to
the requirements of this chapter shall:
   (1)   Include the address of the affected property and be mailed to the
address of the owner, as that address is shown on the most recently issued
equalized assessment roll released to the City for the affected property and
mailed or faxed to the occupant, if any, at the address of the affected
property; or
   (2)   If the address for the owner, occupant or person in charge of day-to-
day operations of any private property cannot be located after the reasonable
efforts of the Director, a notice of violation, administrative compliance
order, or cease and desist order shall be deemed delivered after posting on the
property at least ten (10) days prior to the date any order is to be complied
with.
   (f)   Judicial abatement. In the event the owner of the property, the
operator of a facility, a permittee, a responsible party or any other person in
possession or with authority to act fails to comply with any provision of a
compliance schedule of any notice of violation, administrative compliance
order, or cease and desist order issued pursuant to this chapter, the Director
may request the City to obtain appropriate judicial authorization to enter the
property, abate the condition and restore the area to its pre-violation
condition. Any costs incurred by the City in obtaining and carrying out the
judicial authorization may be recorded as lien against the affected property
and recovered by the City in a foreclosure action on that lien and/or in any
collection procedure authorized by law.
(§ 1, Ord. 1343-NS, eff. October 14, 1999)
Sec. 7-8.502. Appeals of administrative remedies.
   Any property owner subject to, or any person aggrieved by the issuance of a
notice of violation, administrative compliance order, or cease and desist order
issued pursuant to this chapter, may appeal to the City Council that
administrative action and issuance by the Director, provided the appeal is
filed on the City’s form with the City Clerk, and a copy provided to the
director, within fourteen (14) days of the issuance of such notice or order.
The appropriate appeal fee shall be paid at that time and the appeal processed
and heard in accordance with the provisions of Title 1, Chapter 4 of this Code.
During the City Council’s consideration of such an appeal, any requested
abatement actions shall be complied with, and the order is not stayed by reason
of such an appeal.
(§ 1, Ord. 1343-NS, eff. October 14, 1999)
Sec. 7-8.503. Public nuisance.
   Any condition in violation of the prohibitions of this chapter shall
constitute a threat to the public health, safety and welfare, and is declared
and deemed a public nuisance pursuant per se.
(§ 1, Ord. 1343-NS, eff. October 14, 1999)
Sec. 7-8.504. Infraction or misdemeanor: Separate offenses.
   (a)   Infractions. Any person believed to be in violation of any provision
of this chapter may be charged or cited with an infraction.
   (b)   Misdemeanor. Any person who negligently or knowingly violates any
provision of this chapter, undertakes to conceal any violation of this chapter,
continues any violation of this chapter beyond the date set for compliance
after delivery of notice thereof; or has previously violated the same provision
of this chapter, or repeatedly violated the terms, conditions and requirements
of any approved best management practices manual, storm water pollution
prevention plan, stormwater pollution control plan, stormwater quality master
plan or discharge permit, may be charged with criminal misdemeanor for such
violation.
   (c)   Separate offenses. Each pollution source found to be in violation of
this chapter is a separate offense and separate violation. Each day a violation
continues unabated as ordered by the director is a separate offense and
separate violation.
(§ 1, Ord. 1343-NS, eff. October 14, 1999)
Sec. 7-8.506. Violations of other laws.
   Any Person acting in violation of this chapter also may be acting in
violation of the Federal Clean Water Act or the State Porter-Cologne Act and
other laws and also may be subject to sanctions including civil liability.
Accordingly, the city is authorized to file a citizen suit pursuant to Federal
Clean Water Act Section 505(a), seeking penalties, damages, and orders
compelling compliance, and other appropriate relief. The City may notify EPA
Region IX, the Regional Board, or any other appropriate state or local agency,
of any alleged violation of this chapter.
(§ 1, Ord. 1343-NS, eff. October 14, 1999)
Sec. 7-8.507. Civil remedies: Injunctions.
   (a)   The Director may request that the City file a civil action seeking an
injunction against any threatened or continuing noncompliance with the
provisions of this chapter. Any temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction
issued pursuant hereto may include an order for reimbursement to the City of
all costs incurred in enforcing this chapter, including costs of inspection,
investigation and monitoring, the costs of abatement undertaken at the expense
of the City, costs relating to restoration of the environment, attorney fees,
court costs, and all other expenses as authorized by law.
   (b)   The Director may request the City to file an action for civil damages
in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking recovery of:
   (1)   All costs incurred in enforcement of this chapter, including but not
limited to costs relating to investigation, sampling, monitoring, inspection,
administrative expenses, attorney fees and court costs, and all other expenses
as authorized by law, and consequential damages;
   (2)   All costs incurred in mitigating harm to the environment or reducing
the threat to human health;
   (3)   Damages for irreparable harm to the environment;
   (4)   Damages resulting from any trespass or nuisance occurring on public
land or to the storm drain system from any violation of this chapter.

charging stations shall be approved ministerially through a nondiscretionary
building permit unless the City makes a finding, based on substantial evidence,
that the EV charging station would have a specific, adverse impact on public
health or safety, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or
avoid the specific, adverse, impact. A use permit may be required pursuant to
such a finding.
   (f)   In accordance with Government Code Section 65850.7, the Building
Official shall establish a checklist of all requirements with which electrical
vehicle charging stations shall comply in order to be eligible for expedited
review. The City's checklist shall be published on the City's website. The
Building Official shall implement an expedited administrative permit review
process for electrical vehicle charging stations, in which completed
applications meeting all checklist requirements shall require residential
permits to be issued within one business day, and commercial permits to be
issued within ten business days.
   (g)   The applicant may submit the permit application and associated
documentation to the Building Division of the Community Development Department
by personal appearance, regular mail, or electronic submittal, with required
permit processing fees as adopted by City Council Resolution. In the case of

infrastructure affected by charging station equipment and associated conduits,
and; areas of charging station equipment and vehicle parking.
   (i)   A permit application that satisfies the information requirements in
the City's adopted checklist shall be deemed complete. Upon confirmation by the
Building Official that the permit application and supporting documents meet
requirements of the adopted checklist and is consistent with all applicable
laws and health and safety standards, the Building Official shall, consistent
with Government Code Section 65850.7, approve the application and issue the
necessary permits. Such approval does not authorize an applicant to energize or
utilize the electric vehicle charging station until all necessary inspections
have been completed and approved. If the Building Official determines that the
permit application is incomplete, he or she shall issue a written correction
notice to the applicant, detailing all deficiencies in the application and any
additional information required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance.
   (j)   It is the intent of this section to encourage the installation of
electric vehicle charging stations by removing obstacles to permitting charging
stations so long as the action does not supersede the Building Official's
authority to address the higher priority life-safety situations. If the
Building Official makes a finding based on substantial evidence that the
electric vehicle charging station could have a specific adverse impact upon the
public health or safety, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily
mitigate or avoid the specific, adverse impact as defined in this section, the
applicant shall apply for a use permit.
   (k)   The decision of the Building Official pursuant to subdivision (i)
above may be appealed to the Planning Commission pursuant to Article 18,
Chapter 4, of Title 9 of the Thousand Oaks Municipal Code.
   (l)   In accordance with Government Code Section 65850.7(h), the Building
Official shall not condition approval for any electrical vehicle charging
station permit on the approval of such charging station by an association, as
that term is defined in Section 4080 of the Civil Code.

CHAPTER 2. CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FEES
Sec. 8-2.01. Purpose.
   On August 30, 1983, the County adopted a Police Facilities Development Fee
in order to relieve the overextension of police station facilities caused by
new development. These facilities are impacted by development in the City. The
City contracts with the County Sheriff’s Department to provide police services
to the incorporated limits of the City. In order to mitigate this impact and to
provide for the collection of the Police Facilities Development Fee, the City
enacts this chapter.

more sections, designed to be used as a dwelling unit. This definition does not
include recreational vehicles, commercial coaches, or factory-built modular
housing.
   (c)   Multiple-family unit. A “multiple-family unit” is located in a
building designed for occupancy by two or more families. This definition
includes duplexes (which do not meet the criteria for a single-family unit as
defined below), condominiums for which ownership only applies to air space
occupied by the unit, and apartments in which units are not individually owned
and utility services are shared.
   (d)   New construction. “New construction,” when applied to construction of
residential buildings or the installation of mobile homes, means the
construction or installation which increases the number of dwelling units on a
given lot. “New construction,” when applied to the construction or
installation of nonresidential buildings, means construction or installation
which increases the amount of floor space for nonresidential building purposes
on a given lot.
   (e)   Single-family residence. “Single-family residence” is a unit designed
for the occupancy of one family. This definition includes both single-family
detached and single-family attached units when the attached unit is subject to
separate ownership and entitlement to the land on which the unit sits, the
utility services are independent for that unit, and each unit is separated from
the other dwelling units either by open space or a vertical wall extending from
the ground to the roof.
(§ 2, Ord. 852-NS, eff. February 14, 1984)
Sec. 8-2.03. Collection of fees.

   All fees collected pursuant to Section 8-2.03 shall be deposited in a
restricted account within the City Treasury and the fees and any interest
earned thereon shall be used only for the purposes of acquiring or improving
the police facilities used in providing police services to the City.
(§ 1, Ord. 852-NS, eff. February 14, 1984)
Sec. 8-2.05. Refund of fee.
   Any fee erroneously collected pursuant to this chapter shall be refunded
without interest to the payer if, within one year after the date on which the
fee was deposited into the City Treasury, the payer files a written application
for refund with the City Clerk and provides proof of such error satisfactory to
the City. Any Police Facilities Development Fee collected pursuant to this
chapter for any structure where the building permit is subsequently canceled or
expires prior to the commencement of construction authorized thereby shall be
refunded without interest after deducting a refund processing fee, as set by
Councilmanic Resolution, provided the payer files a written application for
refund within one hundred eighty (180) days of such cancellation or expiration.

standards to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare through
structural strength, means of egress facilities, stability, sanitation,
adequate light and ventilation, energy conservation, accessibility,
sustainability, resiliency, and safety to life and property from fire and other
hazards attributed to the built environment and to provide safety to
firefighters and emergency responders during emergency operations.
   Certain changes and modifications have been made in the adoption of this
code because of the requirements of specific local conditions. Consistent with
this purpose, the provisions of this code are intended and always have been
intended to confer a benefit on the community as a whole and are not intended
to establish a duty of care toward any particular person.
   This code shall not be construed to hold the city or any officer, employee
or agent thereof responsible for any damage to persons or property by reason of
any inspection authorized herein or by reason of the issuance or nonissuance of
any permit authorized herein, and/or for any action or omission in connection
with the application and/or enforcement of this code. By adopting the
provisions of this code, the city does not intend to impose on itself, its
employees or agents any mandatory duties of care toward persons and property
within its jurisdiction so as to provide a basis of civil liability for
damages.
   This section is declaratory of existing law and is not to be construed as
suggesting that such was not the purpose and intent of previous code adoptions.

CHAPTER 15. DISABLED ACCESS APPEALS AND ADVISORY BOARD
Sec. 8-15.01. Purpose.
   Pursuant to the provisions of Part 5.5 of the State Health and Safety Code,
(Section 19955, et seq.), it is the intent of the City Council to insure that
all public accommodations or facilities constructed in the City with private
funds, shall be accessible to, and usable by, the disabled and, therefore,
there is hereby established a physically handicapped access appeals board
herein referred to as “Disabled Access Appeals and Advisory Board.” It is
further the intent of the Council that in cases of practical difficulty or
extreme differences, exceptions may be granted from the literal requirements of
the standards and specifications required by Title 24 of the California Code of
Regulations, state statutes or local law, or to authorize the use of other
methods or materials, but only when the work involves specified small jobs, or
it is clearly evident that equivalent facilitation and protection are thereby
secured.
   It is further the intent of the Council to obtain full compliance with
disabled accessibility requirements in all publicly funded buildings.
(§ 1, Ord. 1037-NS, eff. July 25, 1989, as amended by § 3, Ord. 1173-NS, eff.
March 2, 1993, and § 2, Ord. 1294-NS, eff. October 2, 1997)
Sec. 8-15.02. Disabled Access Appeals and Advisory Board.
   The Disabled Access Appeals and Advisory Board is hereby created and shall
be composed of five (5) at-large community members with appropriate
qualifications. Two (2) persons on the Board shall be disabled persons who are
movement impaired, two (2) members shall be persons experienced in construction
and one (1) member shall be a public member, all of whom shall be residents of
the City.
(§ 1, Ord. 1037-NS, eff. July 25, 1989, as amended by § 3, Ord. 1173-NS, eff.
March 2, 1993, and § 2, Ord. 1294-NS, eff. October 2, 1997, as amended by part
1, Ord. 1440-NS, eff. July 21, 2005)
Sec. 8-15.03. Appointment, terms and vacancies.
   (a)   Appointment. After compliance with the State Maddy Act, the Council
shall appoint qualified members of the Board. Each member of the Disabled
Access Appeals and Advisory Board serves at the pleasure of the Council and may
be removed by a majority vote of all members of the Council.
   (b)   Terms. At-large Board Member appointments shall be for two-year
staggered terms. Three terms shall expire at end of February of even numbered
years and two terms shall expire at end of February of odd numbered years.
   (c)   Vacancies. A vacancy on the Disabled Access Appeals and Advisory Board
shall be filled by City Council appointment of a qualified member, pursuant to
procedures adopted by Council resolution.
(§ 1, Ord. 1037-NS, eff. July 25, 1989, as amended by § 3, Ord. 1173-NS, eff.
March 2, 1993, as amended by part 1, Ord. 1440-NS, eff. July 21, 2005)
Sec. 8-15.04. Powers.
   (a)   General. The purpose of the Board is to act in an advisory capacity to
the City Council relative to measures and methods utilized to promote disabled
accessibility in the City. The duties of the Board are:
   (1)   To advise and recommend to the City Council ways and means to promote
disabled accessibility in the City. The Board may also, upon request, advise
private owners of ways to improve disabled accessibility of private property.
   (2)   To explore methods of obtaining private, local, state and federal
funds to promote disabled accessibility within the City.
   (3)   To render assistance regarding disabled accessibility in City
sponsored programs, activities and services and on access to City properties.
   (b)   Appeals. The Disabled Access Appeals and Advisory Board shall consider
at a noticed public hearing all matters referred to it by the City Council,
staff, and any written appeals filed by any aggrieved person regarding a City
departmental action taken, except as technical decision referred to in this
subsection, on a denial or issuance of building permit, paving permit or
departmental permit concerning issues of the application of state law, City
ordinances or City policies governing access for the disabled to public
accommodations in buildings and facilities constructed with private funds.
However, there is no right of appeal with regards to a departmental decision
required to meet specific numerical standards of Title 24 of the California
Code of Regulations, when no exception, exemption or other relief is authorized
by that law.
   (c)   Exceptions. The Board shall also review appeals of the Building
Official’s or the Department of Community Development’s granting or denying of
exceptions authorized under Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations.
Other than the small project exception under subsection (c) below, in reviewing
appeals of departmental decisions on exceptions from the literal requirements
of the standards and specifications authorized under Title 24, or City codes,
or in permitting the use of other methods and materials concerning disabled
accessibility and usability, the Board may approve such only when it finds (1)
an unreasonable hardship, if Title 24 requires such, would be created for the
permit applicant to alter the existing structure, and (2) it is clearly evident
that equivalent facilitation access and protection will be secured. “Equivalent
facilitation” means an alternative method of complying with the literal
requirements of the standards or specifications that provides access in terms
of the purpose of those standards or specific actions.
   (d)   Small project exceptions. When the total construction cost of
alterations, structural repairs or additions does not exceed the State’s 1996
valuation threshold amount of Eighty-One Thousand Eight Hundred Ninety-Six and
Forty-Six/100ths ($81,896.46) Dollars, as annually adjusted by the Construction
Cost Index, the Board, on appeal of such projects, may find that an
unreasonable
hardship exists on the permit applicant, and compliance shall be limited to the
actual work of the project. For purposes of this exception, an unreasonable
hardship exists where the cost of providing an accessible entrance, path of
travel, sanitary facilities, public phones and drinking fountains, is
disproportionate to the cost of the project; that is, where it exceeds twenty
(20%) percent of the cost of the project without these features. Where the cost
of alterations necessary to make these features fully accessible is
disproportionate, access shall be provided to the extent that it can be without
incurring disproportionate cost.
   The obligation to provide access may not be evaded by performing a series of
small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel if those
alterations could have been performed as a single undertaking. If an area has
been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and
subsequent alterations of that area or a different area on the same path of
travel are undertaken within three (3) years of the original alteration, the
total cost of alterations to the areas on that path of travel during the
preceding three (3) year period shall be considered in determining whether the
cost of making that path of travel accessible is disproportionate. Only
alterations undertaken after January 26, 1992, shall be considered in
determining if the cost of providing an accessible path of travel is
disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.
   (e)   Total exemptions. Where Title 24 authorizes the Building Official’s
finding of total exemption from full compliance for existing structures, the
appeals process to the Board shall be required to ratify such action as
required by Section 101.17.11, Item 4 of Title 24.
   (f)   Factors for determining unreasonable hardship. When required to find
an unreasonable hardship pursuant to granting any exceptions under state law or
City ordinance, the Board shall consider:
   (1)   Cost of providing access.
   (2)   Cost of all construction contemplated.
   (3)   Impact of proposed access improvements on financial feasibility of the
project.
   (4)   Nature of accessibility which would be gained or lost.
   (5)   Nature of the use of the facility under construction and its
availability to disabled persons.
   (g)   Recommendations. With issues sent to the Disabled Access Appeals and
Advisory Board by City staff or the City Council, the Board shall provide
recommendations to the City Council for the Council’s approval of
interpretations, policies, standards or guidelines to be used by the Building
Official, other City departments or the Board pertaining to unreasonable
hardships, other exceptions and the interpretation or application of state or
City laws, or city policies governing access for the disabled to public
accommodations or facilities constructed with private funds.
   (h)   Decision: Appeal to Council. The Board may grant, conditionally grant
or deny any appeal. The decision of an appeal shall be concurred in by at least
three (3) members of the Board. The granting or denying of any appeal by the
Board may be appealed by the applicant, any aggrieved person or any individual
Councilmember (without fee) to the City Council.
(§ 1, Ord.1037-NS, eff. July 25, 1989, as amended by § 3, Ord. 1173-NS, eff.
March 2, 1993, and § 2, Ord. 1294-NS, eff. October 2, 1997)
Sec. 8-15.05. Appeal process.
   (a)   Appeal right. Any person aggrieved by a decision or action taken by
the Building Official or the Department of Community Development on any
building permit, paving permit or development permit (including a major or
minor modification) being reviewed by that department and concerning the
application of state law, federal law, Title 24 of the California Code of
Regulations, City ordinances, or City policies, governing access of the
disabled to public accommodations and facilities in building or facilities
constructed with private funds, may file an appeal to the Board concerning that
action with the
Building Official. However, there is no right of appeal to a departmental
decision required to meet specific numerical standards of Title 24 when no
exception, exemption or other relief is authorized by that law. An “aggrieved”
person for the purpose of this chapter shall mean the applicant for the permit
subject to departmental action or any other person.
   (b)   Time of appeal. The applicant for a City development permit, filed
with the Department of Community Development, may request an early appeal of
any decision of that department concerning disabled parking or exterior access
for that project. Also, appeals may be filed under the City’s Special
Accommodations/Lack of Access procedures as contained in the ADA Self Analysis
for City of Thousand Oaks programs. All other appeals shall be filed within ten
(10) days of the issuance of the tentative building paving or development
permit. These permits shall be conditionally issued and subject to the ten (10)
day appeal period. The Department of Community Development and the Building
Official shall publicly post a list of all building permits, development
permits and exceptions subject to Title 24, such as are approved in order to
provide the public with notice of permits which an aggrieved person may wish to
appeal.
   (c)   Form: Fees. The appeal shall be on the City approved form and clearly
set forth the grounds and basis for the appeal. No appeal shall be considered
by the Disabled Access Appeal and Advisory Board except upon the grounds
stated. Except for an appeal of a special accommodation/lack of access
involving City administered programs, no appeal shall be deemed filed and
accepted unless the appeal processing fee is paid at that time by the appellant
in the amount as determined by City Council resolution to cover the cost
connected with processing that appeal.
   (d)   Hearing: Notice: Appeal to Council. The Board shall hold a noticed
public hearing and make its determination on the appeal within thirty (30) days
of its filing with the Building Official and issue its decision by resolution
containing the required findings. Notice shall be published and posted in a
conspicuous place at City Hall at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. The
notice of the time and place of the hearing shall also be mailed to the
appellant and the affected permit applicant at least ten (10) days prior to the
hearing. This hearing may be set beyond thirty (30) days, providing a written
waiver of such time limit is given by the permit applicant. If the Board fails
to act on any appeal within the time limit specified in this subdivision, then
the action of the Building Official on the matter shall be final subject to
appeal to the City Council. The appeal to the Council shall be filed within
five (5) days of the Board’s decision. The appeal to the Council shall be on
the City’s approved form, filed with the Building Official. No appeal shall be
considered unless the appropriate fee is paid upon filing. The Council shall
hear the appeal within thirty (30) days of its filing.
   (e)   Open hearings. The Board’s public hearings shall be open to the
general public with a public concerns opportunity and an agenda posted pursuant
to the requirements of state law (the Brown Act).

CHAPTER 2. GENERAL PLAN AND SPECIFIC PLANS*
*   Chapter 2 entitled “Master Plan,” consisting of Section 9-2.01, codified
from Ordinance No. 7, repealed by Ordinance No. 190-NS, effective January 28,
1971. Chapter 2 entitled “General Plan,” consisting of Sections 9-2.01 through
9-2.05, added by Ordinance No. 190-NS, effective January 28, 1971 repealed by
Ordinance No. 436-NS, effective April 25, 1974.
Article 1. General Plan
Sec. 9-2.101. Defined.
   The Community Development Department shall prepare, the Planning Commission
shall approve, and the Council shall adopt a comprehensive, long-term General
Plan for the physical development of the City and of any land outside the
boundaries of the City which, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, bears
relation to the future growth and development of the City and its planning. The
General Plan thus adopted shall comply with the requirements of Articles 5 and
6 of Chapter 3 of Title 7 of the Government Code of the State as to form and
the manner of adoption. Such plan as adopted shall be a policy guide to the
Planning Commission and Council in implementing future development and long-
term planning. Such plan may be amended as set forth in this chapter and shall
not be considered a zoning law or specific zoning. The preparation of specific
plants, the granting of zoning, and the authorization of zone changes after the
adoption of such plan shall take into consideration the analysis, projections,
and studies adopted as part of such General Plan. Zoning shall be consistent
with the General Plan, as required by the provisions of Sections 65860 of said
Government Code.
(§ 1, Ord. 436-NS, eff. April 25, 1974)
Sec. 9-2.102. Nature and Purpose.
   The General Plan shall consist of a statement of development policies and
shall include a diagram or diagrams and a text setting forth objectives,
principles, standards, and plan proposals and shall include a land use element,
a circulation element, a housing element, an open space element, a conservation
element, a seismic safety element, a safety element, a scenic highways element,
a noise element, and such other elements as may be required in the future by
State legislation as contained in the Government Code of the State. In
addition, such plan shall include as many of the permitted elements under
Section 65303 of said Government Code as may seem to the Council, upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission, to be reasonably required.
(§ 1, Ord. 436-NS, eff. April 25, 1974)
Sec. 9-2.103. Formulation.
   During the formulation of a General Plan, the Planning Commission shall
consult with public officials and agencies, public utility companies, civic,
educational, professional, and other organizations, and citizens generally to
the end that the maximum coordination of plans may be secured, and properly
located sites for all public purposes may be indicated on the General Plan.
(§ 1, Ord. 436-NS, eff. April 25, 1974)
Sec. 9-2.104. Adoption.
   The General Plan, or any part or element thereof, and any amendment to such
plan or any part or element thereof, shall be adopted by resolution in the
manner provided by Article 6 of Chapter 3 of the State Planning and Zoning Law
(commencing at Government Code section 65350).
   “Notice of all public hearings with respect to the adoption of the General
Plan or any part or element thereof, shall be given in the manner prescribed by
the California Government Code and as may be augmented by the provisions of
Chapter 12 of this title.”

Sec. 9-2.105. Administration.
   The General Plan, or any part or element thereof, and any amendment to such
plan, or any part or element thereof, shall be administered in accordance with
the provisions of Article 7 of Chapter 3 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the State
Government Code.
(§ 1, Ord. 436-NS, eff. April 25, 1974, as amended by §22, Ord. 1250-NS, eff.
January 9, 1996)
Article 2. Procedure for Amendments to the General Plan
Sec. 9-2.201. Amendment procedures.
   All amendments to the General Plan, or any part or element thereof, shall be
considered in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of Chapter 3 of the
State Planning and Zoning Law (commencing at Government Code Section 65350). No
mandatory element of the General Plan may be amended more frequently than as
specified in Government Code Section 65358.
   Notice of all public hearings with respect to the amendment of the General
Plan, or any part or element thereof, shall be given in the manner prescribed
by the California Government Code and as may be augmented by the provisions of
Chapter 12 of this title.
(§ 1, Ord. 436-NS, eff. April 25, 1974, as amended by §5, Ord. 1178-NS, eff.
April 27, 1993)
Sec. 9-2.202. Initiation.
   A proposed amendment to an element of the General Plan may be initiated in
the following manner only:
   (a)   By the adoption of a resolution of the Planning Commission setting the
matter for study and hearing; or
   (b)   By the adoption of a resolution of the Council requesting the Planning
Commission to set the matter for hearing, report, and recommendation:
   (1)   Upon its own motion; or
   (2)   Upon the acceptance of a petition filed pursuant to the provisions of
Article 3 of this chapter.
   In all cases where an amendment to the General Plan is initiated, the
Council or Planning Commission shall designate the area and/or subjects to be
studied.
(§ 1, Ord. 436-NS, eff. April 25, 1974)
Sec. 9-2.203. Increases on residential densities or commercial acreage.
   (a)   Purpose. The City’s General Plan is a long term guide for orderly
development of this community, which plan should not be subject to unreasonable
and increased development pressures. Based on the City’s present build out
under that General Plan, the City Council finds the City of Thousand Oaks is at
a point where the ultimate and foreseeable residential and commercial
development in the City’s Planning Area can be accurately predicted. The City’s
infrastructure and public facilities were or have been designed based on the
development projections in the City’s General Plan, as in effect on November 5,
1996. These public facilities can accommodate that planned and foreseeable
development. However, any increase in the residential density ranges or in
commercial acreage over those presently shown in the Land Use Element of the
General Plan will alter the character of the City and place an unacceptable
burden on the City’s topography and infrastructure. The City desires to promote
an improved local jobs/housing balance, and since land use changes to
environmentally sensitive industrial uses do not place as great a demand on
public services, roads, freeways and infrastructure, as do residential and
commercial uses, such changes are not a new policy direction requiring a vote
of the community.
   Any amendment either to the General Plan's designated acreage for
“commercial” land uses or in the residential land use density ranges, which
produces a net increase in excess of the land areas so designated, or in excess
of the dwelling unit per net acre density ranges shown on the Land Use Element
of the City’s General Plan as of November 5,1996, is a policy decision that the
voters of the City of Thousand Oaks should make.
   (b)    Voter approval of certain general plan amendments. No proposed
amendment to the Land Use Element of the City’s General Plan of the following
types shall be effective until it has been considered and approved for the
ballot by the City Council, and then submitted to and approved by a majority of
the City’s voters voting at a general or special election:
   (1)   Any amendment which reclassifies land from the “parks, golf course,
and open space” designation to any other designation; or
   (2)   Any amendment which cumulatively provides a net increase in the
maximum number of residential dwelling units which could be permitted under the
proposed land use designation; or
   (3)   Any amendment which cumulatively provides a net increase in the land
designated “commercial.”
   The proposed amendment to the Land Use Element must first have been
initiated pursuant to Section
9-2.202, have completed any environmental analysis required by law and have
been reviewed by the Planning Commission. A proposed ballot measure under this
section may contain or affect more than one site, designation or parcel.
   (c)   Periodic Review. As required by law, the City Council shall
periodically review the land uses and density ranges in the Land Use Element of
the General Plan, as well as the overall General Plan’s internal consistency,
and may request the approval of proposed Land Use Element changes by the voters
pursuant to this section, if the Council finds new circumstances,
justification, or state/federal mandates require such an amendment.
   (d)   Exemptions. This requirement of a voter approval shall not be required
or apply for the following amendments or situations:
   (1)   Where the amendment is necessary to avoid, or the application of the
voter approval requirement of this section would be deemed, an unconstitutional
taking of property under the United States or California Constitutions, be
contrary to federal laws, or the laws of this state:
   (2)   Where the amendment is necessary in order to comply with, or is
directed under a court order, judgment, writ or mandate.
   (3)   Where the amendment is necessary for a viable use of publicly owned
land which has been determined by the owner to be, and is, declared surplus as
no longer needed for a public purpose, such as unneeded school sites or the
approximate thirty-five (35) acres at 401 Hillcrest Drive.
   (e)   City Council sponsored initiative; effective period. This section was
enacted as a City Council sponsored initiative, approved by the voters at a
city-wide general election on November 5, 1996. Except for evaluation,
processing and procedural matters, this section cannot be amended or repealed
by the City Council without such amendment or repeal being approved by the
voters of Thousand Oaks. This section shall be effective and apply to any Land
Use Element amendments up to November 5, 2026, at which time this section shall
terminate.
(§ 2, Ord. 1280-NS, eff. Dec. 13, 1996)
Sec. 9-2.204. Limitations on amendments relating to the “Parks, Golf Courses,
Open Space” designation.
   (a)   Until December 31, 2050, the provisions and designations governing the
intent for lands designated “Parks, Golf Courses, Open Space” on the Land Use
Element, Open Space Element and Recreational Element, as amended through March
1, 1996, shall not be amended except to add lands to the “Parks, Golf Courses,
Open Space” designation; unless such amendment is approved by the vote of the
people.
   (b)   All those lands designated as “Parks, Golf Courses, Open Space” in the
adopted City of Thousand Oaks General Plan “Land Use Map,” as amended through
March 1, 1996, and lands which are subsequently added to the “Parks, Golf
Courses, Open Space” designation, shall remain so designated until December 31,
2050, unless redesignated to another General Plan land use category by vote of
the people, or redesignated by the City Council pursuant to the procedures set
forth in subsection (c), below.
   (c)   Land use designated as “Parks, Golf Courses, Open Space” on the Land
Use Map may be redesignated to another land use category by the City Council if
each of the following conditions are satisfied:
   (1)   The City Council makes a finding that the application of the
provisions of Section 2(a) of Ordinance 1265-NS would constitute
unconstitutional taking of the private landowner’s property; and
   (2)   In permitting the redesignation, the City Council allows additional
land uses only to the extent necessary to avoid said unconstitutional taking of
the landowner’s property.
   (d)   Approval by a vote of the people is accomplished when a General Plan
amendment is placed on the ballot through any procedure provided for in the
Elections Code, and a majority of the voters vote in favor of it. Whenever the
City Council adopts an amendment requiring approval by a vote of the people,
pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the City Council’s action shall
have no effect until after such a vote is held and a majority of the voters
vote in favor of it. The City Council shall follow the provisions of the
Elections Code in all matters pertaining to such an election.
   This section is consistent with the initiative petition and accompanying
ordinance presented to Thousand Oaks City Council, and then adopted by the City
Council on June 18, 1996 and re-adopted on December 13, 2016. Until December
31, 2050, this section may only be amended or repealed by the voters of the
City at a general election.

Article 5. Urban Restriction Boundary
Sec. 9-2.501. Purpose and findings.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this initiative is to re-adopt for the City of
Thousand Oaks its Urban Restriction Boundary and the protections of lands
designated as Existing Parks, Golf Courses, Open Space, as set forth in the
Parks Initiative. The Thousand Oaks City Urban Restriction Boundary (Thousand
Oaks CURB) line has the following objectives:
   (1)   To encourage efficient growth patterns and protect the City of
Thousand Oaks' quality of life by concentrating future development largely
within existing developed areas, or, in some cases, directly adjacent to them,
consistent with the availability of infrastructure and services;
   (2)   To promote on lands outside the Thousand Oaks CURB line ongoing
agricultural and other natural resource and open space uses as defined in
Government Code Section 65560(b), such as preservation of natural resources and
natural habitat, public and private outdoor recreation, uses that foster public
health and safety, and productive investment for farming enterprises;
   (3)   To manage the City's growth in a manner that fosters and protects the
character of Thousand Oaks while encouraging appropriate economic development
in accordance with the City's unique local conditions;
   (4)   To allow the City to continue to meet its reasonable housing needs for
all economic segments of the population, especially low and moderate income
households, by directing the development of housing into areas where services
and infrastructure are more efficiently available; and
   (5)   To promote stability in long term planning for the City by
establishing a cornerstone policy within the General Plan designating the
geographic limits of long term urban development and allowing sufficient
flexibility within those limits to respond to the City's changing needs over
time.
   The Parks Initiative has similar purposes, and works symbiotically with the
SOAR measure, with its intent focused on protecting the unique position held by
lands designated Existing Parks, Golf Courses, Open Space within the City's
planning area.
   (b)   Findings.
   (1)   The protection of existing agricultural, open space and watershed
lands surrounding the City of Thousand Oaks is of critical importance to
present and future residents of the City of Thousand Oaks. Agriculture has been
and remains a major contributor to the economy of the City and County of
Ventura, directly and indirectly creating employment for many people and
generating substantial tax revenues for the City.
   (2)   In particular, the City of Thousand Oaks and surrounding area, with
its unique topography, viewsheds, watershed lands and proximity to unique
soils, micro-climate and hydrology, is a gate-keeper to one of the finest
growing regions in the world. Ranch land, vegetable and fruit production from
the County of Ventura and in particular the importance of the Calleguas
watershed, Hidden Valley, Tierra Rejada Valley and alluvial plains adjacent to
the City have achieved international acclaim, enhancing the City's economy and
reputation. As importantly, the ring of open space around the City provides a
unique open space buffer of immense importance to the protection of the
wildlife indigenous to the area.
   (3)   Continued urban encroachment into agricultural, open space or
watershed areas will impair agriculture and threaten the public health, safety
and welfare by causing increased traffic congestion, associated air pollution,
not only for the City but for its jurisdictional neighbors. Such urban
encroachment would eventually result in both the unnecessary, expensive
extension of public services and facilities and inevitable conflicts between
urban, agricultural and open space uses.
   (4)   The unique character of the City of Thousand Oaks and quality of life
of City residents depend on the protection of a substantial amount of open
space, rural and agricultural lands both within and without its City limits.
Part of that unique character requiring protection is the land use designations
of Existing Parks, Golf Courses, Open Space within the City’s planning area.
   The protection of such lands not only ensures the continued viability of
agriculture, but also protects the available water supply to surrounding
communities and contributes to flood control and the protection of wildlife,
environmentally sensitive areas, and irreplaceable natural resources. As
importantly, continuing the existence of the City Urban Restriction Boundary
around the City of Thousand Oaks would promote the formation and continuation
of a cohesive community by defining the boundaries and by helping to prevent
urban sprawl. Such a City Urban Restriction Boundary has and will continue to
promote the efficient municipal services and facilities by confining urban
development to defined development areas.
   (5)   This initiative ensures that the important Goals and Policies of the
general plan are inviolable against transitory short-term political decisions
and that agricultural, watershed and open space lands are not prematurely or
unnecessarily converted to other non-agricultural or non-open space uses
without public debate and a vote of the people.
   Accordingly, the initiative requires that until December 31, 2050, the City
of Thousand Oaks shall restrict the provision of urban services, or creation of
urban uses, other than in certain circumstances and according to specific
procedures set forth in this initiative measure, within the Urban Restriction
Boundary created in 1998 by initiative, and extended by this initiative measure
using the location of the Sphere of Influence Line established by the Local
Agency Formation Commission as of January 1, 1998. Although the Sphere of
Influence has since been expanded to include the Broome Ranch, the CURB line
shall continue to be in its current location, coterminous with the Sphere of
Influence line applicable to the City of Thousand Oaks in existence on January
1,1998, approved by the Local Agency Formation Commission.
   (6)   Although established in the same location as the Sphere of Influence
line as it existed as of January 1, 1998, the CURB is not intended to and shall
in no way inhibit, and has not inhibited, the Local Agency Formation Commission
from changing or altering the Sphere of Influence line in accordance with state
law. The two lines although coincidentally coterminous as of one point in time
are independent one from the other in legal significance and purpose. While the
Sphere of Influence line may be altered by the Local Agency Formation
Commission in accordance with the provisions of state law, the Urban
Restriction Boundary is a local land use policy of the City and shall not be
changed except as herein provided.
   (7)   The Parks Initiative calls out the protection of lands designated by
the City of Thousand Oaks as Existing Parks, Golf Courses, Open Space in the
general plan. Said lands shall remain as so designated, absent a vote of the
public until December 31, 2050.
(§ 1, Ord. 1328-NS, eff. December 4, 1998; as amended by § 2, Ord. 1628-NS,
eff. December 23, 2016)
Sec. 9-2.502. General Plan amendment.
   1.   PURPOSE
   The City of Thousand Oaks and surrounding area, with its unique viewsheds,
watershed lands and proximity to unique soils, micro-climate and hydrology, is
a gate-keeper to one of the finest growing regions in the world. Ranch land,
vegetable and fruit production from the County of Ventura and in particular
Hidden Valley, the Tierra Rejada Valley and alluvial plains adjacent to the
City have achieved international acclaim, enhancing the City's economy and
reputation.
   The purpose of this initiative is to ensure that the preservation of
agricultural production, open space, and protection of environmentally
sensitive habitat both inside the City through the Parks Initiative readoption
and outside of the City through the SOAR initiative readoption are inviolable
against transitory short-term political decisions and that agricultural,
viewshed, watershed and open space lands are not prematurely or unnecessarily
converted to other non-agricultural or non-open space uses without public
debate and a vote of the people. As importantly, limiting urban sprawl through
the use of an Urban Restriction Boundary and protection of the land use
designations Existing Parks, Golf Courses, Open Space, enhances the sense of
community, allows for development unique to the City of Thousand Oaks and
promotes the efficient use of the City's infrastructure.
   2.   PRINCIPLES
   Continued urban encroachment into open space, viewshed and watershed areas
negatively impacts sensitive environmental areas, intrudes on open space
irrevocably changing its utility, diminishes the quality of life and threatens
the public health, safety and welfare by causing increased traffic congestion,
associated air pollution, alteration of sensitive lands in flood plains and
causing potentially serious water problems, such as pollution, depletion, and
sedimentation of available water resources not only for the City of Thousand
Oaks but for its jurisdictional neighbors. Such urban encroachment would
eventually result in both the unnecessary, expensive extension of public
services and facilities and inevitable conflicts between urban and open space/
agricultural uses.
   The unique character of the City of Thousand Oaks and quality of life of
City residents depend on the protection of a substantial amount of open space,
viewshed, and watershed. The protection of such lands through the
implementation of this Initiative by readoption of the Parks Initiative and the
SOAR initiatives through December 31, 2050, not only ensures the continued
viability of agriculture, but also protects the available water supply and
contributes to flood control and the protection of wildlife, environmentally
sensitive areas, and irreplaceable natural resources.
   3.   IMPLEMENTATION
   (a)   The City of Thousand Oaks hereby readopts the land use designations
set forth for protection in the Parks Initiative, in particular Existing Parks,
Golf Courses, Open Space, and readopts the established Thousand Oaks City Urban
Restriction Boundary (Thousand Oaks CURB), both as set forth in Ord. 1628-NS on
Exhibit "A." The Thousand Oaks CURB continues to run coterminously with the
Sphere of Influence line established by the Local Agency Formation Commission
for the City of Thousand Oaks, as it existed as of January 1,1998.
   (b)   Until December 31, 2050, the City of Thousand Oaks shall retain the
designations and land uses allowed on all lands designated in the General Plan
and on the Jurisdictional Boundaries Map [Attached to Ord. 1628-NS as Exhibit
"A " and incorporated herein by reference] as Existing Parks, Golf Courses,
Open Space, and shall restrict urban services (except temporary mutual
assistance with other jurisdictions) and urbanized uses of land to within the
Thousand Oaks City Urban Restriction Boundary, except as provided herein and
except for the purpose of completing roadways designated in the Circulation
Element of the Thousand Oaks General Plan as of January 1,1998, construction of
public potable water facilities, and public parks. In each reference to the
year 2030 found within the Parks Initiative, attached to Ord. 1628-NS (this
measure) as Exhibit "B", that reference is hereby amended to reference the year
2050. Other than for the exceptions provided herein, upon the effective date of
this Thousand Oaks SOAR and Parks Initiative General Plan amendment voter
approval extensions, the City and its departments, boards, commissions,
officers and employees shall continue to refuse to grant, or by inaction allow
to be approved by operation of law, any General Plan amendment, rezoning,
specific plan, subdivision map, conditional use permit, building permit or any
other ministerial or discretionary entitlement, which is inconsistent with the
purposes of this General Plan amendment extension, unless in accordance with
the Amendment Procedures of Section 4 of this General Plan Amendment extension.
   (c)   "Urbanized uses of land" as it pertains to the CURB shall mean any
development which would require the establishment of new community sewer
systems or the significant expansion of existing community sewer systems; or,
would result in the creation of residential densities greater than one primary
residential unit per 10 acres in area; or, would result in the establishment of
commercial or industrial uses which are neither agriculturally- related nor
related to the production of mineral resources.
   (d)   The Land Use Element Map, attached to Ord. 1628-NS as Exhibit "A " is
restated, and readopted to reflect the continued existence of the Thousand Oaks
Urban Restriction Boundary and the Existing Parks, Golf Courses, Open Space
land use designations through the year 2050.
   (e)   The City Urban Restriction Boundary, nor the Existing Parks, Golf
Courses, Open Space land use designations, as identified herein, may not be
amended, altered, revoked or otherwise changed prior to December 31, 2050,
except by vote of the people or by the City Council pursuant to the procedures
set forth in Section 4 of this General Plan amendment.
   4.   CHANGES TO BOUNDARY and LAND USE DESIGNATIONS; PROCEDURES
   Until December 31, 2050, the foregoing Purposes, Principles and
Implementation provisions of this initiative, extending and restating the
requirement for voter participation for changes to Existing Parks, Golf
Courses, Open Space and the CURB may be amended only by a vote of the people
commenced pursuant to the initiative process by the public, or pursuant to the
procedures set forth below.
   (a)   The City Council may amend the City Urban Restriction Boundary
described herein if it deems it to be in the public interest, provided that the
amended boundary is within the limits of said Urban Restriction Boundary
established by this General Plan Amendment. Any such contraction of the CURB
line may not thereafter be re-extended without following the procedures set
forth herein.
   (b)   The City Council, following at least one public hearing for
presentations by an applicant and the public, and after compliance with the
California Environmental Quality Act, may amend the Urban Restriction Boundary
described herein to comply with state law regarding the provision of housing
for all economic segments of the community, the City Council may amend the City
Urban Restriction Boundary as described herein in order to accommodate lands to
be designated for residential uses, provided that no more than 10 acres of land
may be brought within the Urban Restriction Boundary for this purpose in any
calendar year. Such amendment may be adopted only if the City Council makes
each of the following findings:
   (1)   The land is immediately adjacent to existing compatibly developed
areas and the applicant for the inclusion of land within the City of Thousand
Oaks Urban Restriction Boundary has provided to the City evidence that the Fire
Department, Police Department, Public Works Department, the Community
Development Department, applicable water and sewer districts, and the School
District with jurisdiction over such land have adequate capacity to accommodate
the proposed development and provide it with adequate public services; and
   (2)   That the proposed development will address the highest priority need
identified in the analysis by which the City has determined it is not in
compliance with State Law, i.e., low and very low income housing; and
   (3)   That there is no existing residentially designated land available
within the City Urban Restriction Boundary to accommodate the proposed
development; and
   (4)   That it is not reasonably feasible to accommodate the proposed
development by redesignating lands within the City Urban Restriction Boundary;
and
   (5)   Notice of such Proposed Modification is given according to the City's
standard notice requirements to neighboring properties; and as well, not less
than 30 days prior to the proposed modification appearing on the City Council
agenda, to LAFCo, and to all individuals or organizations who or which have
indicated a desire for such Notice by requesting the same by placing his/her/
its name and contact information with the City Clerk.
   (c)   The City Council following at least one public hearing for
presentations by an applicant and the public, and after compliance with the
California Environmental Quality Act, may amend the City Urban Restriction
Boundary described herein, or may redesignate lands designated on the General
Plan as Existing Parks, Golf Courses, Open Space, based on substantial evidence
in the record, if the City Council makes each of the following findings:
   (1)   Application of the provisions of subsections (a) or (b) of these
amendment procedures are unworkable and failure to make the suggested
amendments would constitute an unconstitutional taking of a landowner's
property for which compensation would be required or would deprive the
landowner of a vested right; and
   (2)   The amendment and associated land use designations will allow
additional land uses only to the minimum extent necessary to avoid said
unconstitutional taking of the landowner's property or to give effect to the
vested right.
   (d)   The City Council following at least one public hearing for
presentations by an applicant and the public, and after compliance with the
California Environmental Quality Act, may place any amendment to the Urban
Restriction Boundary or the provisions of the Existing Parks, Golf Courses,
Open Space land use designations, each as readopted by this initiative, on the
ballot pursuant to the mechanisms provided by State Law.
   (e)   The General Plan may be reorganized and individual provisions,
including the provisions of this initiative, may be renumbered or reordered in
the course of ongoing updates of the General Plan in accordance with the
requirements of state law.

   This measure shall be interpreted so as to be consistent with all federal
and state laws, rules, and regulations. If any section, sub-section, sentence,
clause, phrase, part, or portion of this measure is held to be invalid or
unconstitutional by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, such
decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this
measure. The voters hereby declare that this measure, and each section, sub-
section, sentence, clause, phrase, part, or portion thereof would have been
adopted or passed even if one or more sections, sub-sections, sentences,
clauses, phrases, parts, or portions are declared invalid or unconstitutional.

person or circumstance, such invalidity shall not affect any application of
this measure that can be given effect without the invalid application. This
initiative shall be broadly construed in order to achieve the purposes stated
in this initiative. It is the intent of the voters that the provisions of this
measure shall be interpreted by the City and others in a manner that
facilitates the protection of lands designated as Existing Parks, Golf Courses,
Open Space within the City and the confinement of urban uses within a City
Urban Restriction Boundary thereby protecting agricultural, open space and
rural lands, and preventing urban sprawl.

permitted by the regulations of the underlying zone, Specific Plan (if
applicable), and General Plan designation in which the property is located.
When the Council deems it to be in the public's interest or appropriate for
proper planning for the subject property, the Council may allow a tentative map
application to be filed and processed concurrently with a proposed change of
the zone classification, Specific Plan, and/or General Plan or amendment
thereto, where such change is necessary to accommodate the proposed subdivision
or use. Where concurrent processing is permitted, the required public hearings
for the entitlements and associated zoning, Specific Plan or General Plan
legislative actions shall be combined, and only the Council shall make the
final decision on the subdivision entitlement application(s).
   (c)    Tentative maps shall not be deemed filed until any environmental

for approval within one year after the date of the issuance of a tract number,
the number shall no longer be valid and shall be cancelled by the County
Surveyor. No number which has been used previously on a map which has expired
or was denied shall be used again. No tract number shall be issued whenever
another valid tract number exists for all or part of the land lying within the
proposed subdivision, unless the application is for a “dash number” of an
approved tentative tract. Such dash numbers shall be issued only for tentative
tracts which have an approved phasing plan.

Sec. 9-3.508. Soil and geology reports.
   A preliminary soils report, prepared by a civil engineer registered in the
State and based upon adequate test borings, shall be submitted to the Community
Development Director for use in evaluating and reporting the environmental
impact the subdivision may have on the City.
   (a)   The preliminary soils report shall describe the nature of the
subsurface soils and any soil conditions which would affect the geometrics of
the proposed development. The soils report shall state whether the proposed
plan is feasible and provide general solutions for all known hazardous
conditions or problems. The reports shall include the locations and logs of any
test borings, and percolation test results and a hydrological evaluation if on-
site sewage disposal is proposed.
   (b)   If the City Engineer and Building Official have knowledge of, or the
preliminary soils report indicates, the presence of critically expansive soils
or other soils problems which, if not corrected, could possibly lead to
structural defects or hazardous conditions, a soils investigation of each lot
in the subdivision may be required. Such soils investigation shall be performed
by a civil engineer registered in the State who shall recommend the corrective
action which is likely to prevent structural damage and eliminate any hazards
to each structure proposed to be constructed in the area where such soils
problems exist.
   (c)   For hillside or other geologically hazardous areas an engineering
geology evaluation defining the geologic conditions of the site shall be
submitted. The geologic evaluation shall state whether the proposed plan is
feasible and provide general solutions for all known hazardous conditions or
problems. The evaluation shall include the location and lots of any test
borings and shall evaluate the effect of the geology on the proposed
development and on adjacent properties. The evaluation report shall point out
specific areas where development may create hazardous conditions.
   (d)   The soils and geologic reports shall designate a suitable building
site for each lot which site is safe from settlement, landsliding, mudsliding,
and flood hazards and which has reasonable access thereto.
   The Planning Commission may approve the subdivision, or portion thereof,
where soils problems or geological hazards exist if the Planning Commission
determines that the actions recommended in the soils and/or geology reports are
likely to prevent public health or safety problems, prevent structural damage,
and eliminate any hazards to each structure to be constructed, and a condition
to the issuance of any building permit shall require that the approved
recommended action be incorporated in the construction of each structure.

Sec. 9-3.510. Acceptance of maps.
   When the required number of copies of a tentative map and accompanying
reports have been received by the Community Development Department, the
tentative map shall be examined by the Community Development Department staff
in light of the requirements of the City of Thousand Oaks Improvement Standards
and Specifications and of this Code to determine whether or not the tentative
map contains all of the required information and is acceptable for filing. The
date upon which it is found to be acceptable shall be placed on the tentative
map and considered to be the filing date. Whenever a tentative map is found not
to be acceptable for filing, the person submitting the map shall be notified of
the reasons therefor. When the required number of copies of the tentative map
have been accepted for filing by the Community Development Department, copies
shall be forwarded for review by other agencies pursuant to the provisions of
Sections 66453, et seq, of the Subdivision Map Act. Nothing set forth in this
section shall be construed to contradict or constrict the provisions of Section
9-3.501 of this article concerning preliminary maps.

Article 6. Design and Improvements
Sec. 9-3.601. Requirements.
   All subdivisions and the tentative maps thereof shall conform to the General
Plan of the City and all applicable planning, zoning, design and improvement,
and environmental requirements. Unless otherwise specified, design requirements
and improvement requirements may be modified or waived only by the Planning
Commission or Council.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.602. Lots.
   Each sideline of a lot in any proposed subdivision shall be as close as is
practicable to perpendicular to the center line of the street at the point at
which the lot side line terminates. All lot lines shall comply with Section
9-3.908 of Article 9 of this chapter at the time of the recordation of the
proposed subdivision. All lots in a proposed subdivision shall conform to the
minimum lot area and width requirements of the zone in which the proposed
subdivision is located. No lot shall have less than forty (40’) feet of
frontage, and no staff of a flag lot shall be less than twenty (20’) feet wide.
All residential, commercial, and industrial lots shall have direct access to
public streets, except where private street, common driveway, or other
reciprocal easement rights are specifically approved by the City and made a
matter of record in the office of the County Recorder. In determining the
permissible minimum lot area of lots less than ten thousand (10,000) square
feet in size, all public utility line easements shall be excluded even though
such easements are included in the lot design.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.603. Size requirements.
   (a)   All proposed lots or parcels shall have not less than the minimum
width and length required by the zoning regulations as specified in Chapter 4
of this title. All proposed lots or parcels of less than ten (10) acres gross
shall also have not less than the minimum net area required by said zoning
regulations. Each lot or parcel shall have a conforming width at the front yard
setback or building line required by the applicable zone classification. The
average lot depth shall not be greater than three (3) times the lot width at
the setback or building line, unless the Planning Commission determines that
topographic features in the area justify a greater average depth.
   (b)   Whenever a division of land results in a lot or parcel for which the
only means of access is by way of an easement or the staff on a flag lot, the
easement or staff shall be considered as a public road or street for the
purposes of determining the size of the lot.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.604. Street rights-of-way.
   The street layout of a proposed subdivision shall be consistent with all
street right-of-way designations shown on the Circulation Element of the
General Plan of the City or applicable Specific Plans at the time the tentative
map is approved. The street layout and widths of rights-of-way shall also
comply with the requirements of the City of Thousand Oaks Improvement Standards
and Specifications. The requirements of this section affecting road alignments
may be waived or modified if the Planning Commission finds, after making an
appropriate study and investigation of the physical features of the area and
the general alignment of the existing roadway, and considering such other
engineering information as may be available, that the street rights-of-way
shown on the Circulation Element or applicable Specific Plans for the area of
the subdivision would not follow the existing right-of-way center line and
would follow an alignment other than the existing alignment.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.605. Utility easements.
   To the extent practicable, underground utility easements, whenever necessary
shall be abutting and parallel to lot lines.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.606. Drainage easements.
   The design of a proposed subdivision shall be such as to provide for the
proper drainage of the proposed subdivision and all lots and improvements
therein, based on the runoff which can be anticipated from the ultimate
development of the watershed area in which the subdivision is located. The
design shall be such that there are no undrained depressions. Easements shall
be provided within the proposed subdivision as may be necessary to provide for
the proper drainage of the proposed subdivision and which are included in the
Master Drainage Plan for the Conejo Valley approved by the City or the
Comprehensive Plan of Flood Control Channels approved by the Board of
Supervisors of the Ventura County Flood Control District. Access to open
channels included in the Master Drainage or Comprehensive Plan shall be
provided along the entire length of the channel. Access to underground drainage
conduits shall be provided by an easement not less than ten (10’) feet in width
directly above the entire length of the conduit, which shall not permit any
structures, including masonry walls to be installed or maintained. The design
of the proposed subdivision shall be such as to protect the subdivision and the
lots and improvements therein from off-tract drainage or flood damages. The
design shall also ensure that all public facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems, are located, elevated, and constructed so as to
minimize or eliminate flood damage. Further, the design shall provide that any
concentrations or increases or surface water resulting from the development of
the proposed subdivision are conveyed by means of adequate facilities to
suitable natural watercourse or drainage facility in the area. Off-tract
easements as may be necessary for such facilities shall be provided by the
subdivider. All easements required to be provided pursuant to this section
shall be offered for dedication at the time the final map or parcel map is
filed for approval.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.607. State highways.
   If an existing or proposed State highway abuts a proposed subdivision, the
subdivider shall secure all pertinent road data and specifications and shall
provide that the design of the proposed subdivision is compatible with the use
of such State highway.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.608. Public water agencies.
   Whenever a proposed subdivision requiring a final map is located within the
boundaries of a public water agency or a private service company willing and
able to provide water service to the lots, the agency or company shall be
chosen as the water purveyor for the proposed subdivision.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.609. Public wastewater agencies.
   Whenever a proposed subdivision requiring a final map is located within the
boundaries of a public wastewater agency willing and able to provide sewer
service to the lots, the agency shall be chosen to provide sewer service for
the proposed subdivision.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.610. Street lighting.
   Prior to the recordation of the subdivision map, if so directed or required,
the subdivider shall cause the area within the subdivision to be included in
the City of Thousand Oaks Municipal Lighting District or appropriate
maintenance assessment district and any applicable subzone thereof providing
street lighting. The Planning Commission may waive such requirement for parcel
maps if the Planning Commission finds that inclusion within such a service area
is unnecessary because of the size or location of the proposed parcels or that
inclusion could be more appropriately a condition of approval of a future
development plan.

Article 7. Hearings, Reports and Appeals, Expirations and Extensions of
Approvals
Sec. 9-3.701. Reports and recommendations.
   Any staff report or recommendations on a tentative map to the Planning
Commission shall be in writing, and a copy thereof shall be delivered to the
subdivider at least three (3) days prior to any hearing or action on such map
by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.702. Hearings and appeals.
   (a)   For subdivisions which require the preparation of a tentative map and
a final map, the Advisory Agency shall, within fifty (50) days after the filing
of the map, or within such longer period of time as may be agreed to by the
subdivider, hold a public hearing on the map, make all findings required by
this Code and the Subdivision Map Act, conditionally approve, recommend
conditional approval by the City Council, recommend denial by the City Council,
or disapprove the tentative map and report its action to the subdivider, as
follows:
   (1)   Where the Commission is considering a regular or vesting tentative map
application for which the Council has permitted concurrent processing of the
application with a change of zone classification or other legislative action
(Specific Plan amendment or General Plan amendment) pursuant to Section
9-3.502, the City Council shall make the final decision on approving the
tentative map application and the Commission shall only make a recommendation
to the Council of conditional approval or denial of the tentative map. Where
the Commission has recommended denial, the Commission may forward to the
Council proposed conditions of approval for the Council's consideration if the
Council determines to approve the tentative map application. Upon receiving a
recommendation from the Commission, the Council shall conduct its own public
hearing on the tentative map application(s) and associated legislative land use
actions, providing notice thereof in the same manner as was required for the
Commission hearing, and shall render a final decision.
   (2)   In all other cases, the Commission shall render a decision to
conditionally approve or disapprove the tentative map application.
   (3)   Where, due to the absence of a Commissioner(s), a tie vote is cast on
a motion to approve, conditionally approve, or deny an appeal, a permit or
entitlement, or on the recommendation to the City Council for the approval or
denial on a permit or entitlement (in the case of applications being processed
concurrently with legislative actions), and the Commission is unable to break
the tie vote situation through further deliberation and votes during that
meeting and immediately following the tie vote, then the Commission shall
reopen the hearing and continue the matter on an open hearing basis until the
next Commission meeting at which the tie might be broken through the
participation of the Commissioner(s) absent at the original hearing.
   If the Commission determines that the tie cannot be broken within the next
twenty-one (21) days due to the announced conflict and abstention of a
Commissioner in the matter, a vacancy, or a long term absence, then no
entitlement shall be granted and the matter shall be automatically referred to
the City Council for a decision with no recommendation implied or made by the
Commission.
   A tentative map shall not be deemed to have been filed until the preliminary
map procedure, governed by Section
9-3.501 of Article 5 of this chapter, has been completed, rejected or
abandoned.
   In accordance with the provisions and time limitations set forth in Section
66452.5 and 66474.7 of the Subdivision Map Act, any interested party adversely
affected by a decision to conditionally approve, or disapprove a tentative map
may appeal the decision of the Planning Commission to the Council, which shall
hold a public hearing and make a decision thereon. In addition, the City
Council may, on its own motion within ten (10) days after the final decision by
the Planning Commission, elect to review and consider any decision of the
Planning Commission. No application for an appeal need be filed by the City
Council, or any member representative thereof, when the City Council elects, by
majority vote of its own motion, to review and consider a decision of the
Planning Commission.
   (b)   For lot line adjustment and waivers or parcel maps which do not
require the preparation of a tentative map or a parcel map pursuant to Sections
9-3.302 and
9-3.303 of Article 3 of this chapter and the Subdivision Map Act, the Community
Development Director shall constitute the Advisory Agency, and shall conduct a
public hearing prior to rendering a decision. Within fifty (50) days after the
filing of the application, the contents of which shall be specified by the
Community Development Director, or within such longer period of time as may be
agreed to by the applicant, the Community Development Director shall make all
findings required by this chapter and the Subdivision Map Act, shall approve,
conditionally approve, or disapprove the application, and shall report his or
her action to the applicant. In accordance with the provisions and time
limitations set forth in Sections 66452.5 and 66474.7 of the Subdivision Map
Act, any interested person adversely affected by a decision may appeal any
decision of the Community Development Director (Advisory Agency) to the
Planning Commission (Appeal Board), which shall hold a public hearing thereon,
and may appeal any decision of the Planning Commission (Appeal Board) to the
Council, which shall hold a public hearing thereon. In addition, the City
Council may, on its own motion within ten (10) days after the final decision by
the Planning Commission, elect to review and consider any decision of the
Planning Commission. No application for an appeal need be filed by the City
Council, or any member representative thereof, when the City Council elects, by
majority vote on its own motion, to review and consider a decision of the
Planning Commission.
   (c)   Whenever a public hearing is to be held, notice shall be given in the
manner required by Chapter 12 of this title.
   (d)   Following the approval of a tentative map for a subdivision requiring
the preparation of a final map, the Community Development Department, upon the
payment of the fee specified therefor, may grant requests for minor
modifications of the tentative map which do not affect the quantity or quality
of required dedications, which do not increase the total number or
significantly alter the configuration of the proposed lots in the subdivision,
which do not affect the grading of the subdivision, which do not affect the
design integrity of the subdivision, or which do not alter the intent or
purpose of the imposed conditions of approval. Before granting any minor
modification request, the Community Development Department shall make a written
finding, with a statement of reasons in support thereof, that the proposed
modification could not reasonably be expected to change any of the findings
previously adopted at the time of the approval of the tentative map. Minor
modification decisions which are objected to in writing by any interested
person aggrieved by the decision within ten (10) days after rendition shall be
deemed to be recommendations only, and the modification request shall
thereafter be processed in the manner provided in this chapter, and for the fee
required, for the initial processing of tentative maps for subdivisions
requiring the preparation of final maps.
   (e)   Requests for major modifications of approved tentative maps of
subdivisions requiring the preparation of final maps shall be processed in the
manner provided in this chapter, and for the fee required, for the initial
processing of tentative maps for such subdivisions.
   (f)   Upon the payment of the fee specified therefor by Council resolution,
requested minor or major modifications of approved tentative maps of
subdivisions requiring the preparation of parcel maps shall be processed in the
same manner as provided for subdivision or tract maps.
   (g)   Any interested person may file with the Community Development
Department a written request for notification of any proposed modification of a
particular approved tentative map. At least five (5) days prior to the granting
of any request to modify any approved tentative map, copies of the proposed
modification shall be provided to all persons who have filed notification
requests pursuant to this section.
   (h)   In approving or conditionally approving tentative subdivision maps,
the Planning Commission, or the Council on appeal, shall find that the proposed
subdivision, together with its provisions for its design and improvement, is
consistent with applicable General and Specific Plans and laws and standards
adopted by the City. The Planning Commission, or the Council on appeals, may
deny the approval of the tentative map on any of the grounds provided by City
laws or standards or the Subdivision Map Act. The Commission or Council shall
deny approval if it makes any of the following findings:
   (1)   That the proposed map is not consistent with the applicable General
and Specific Plans;
   (2)   That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not
consistent with the applicable General and Specific Plans;
   (3)   That the site is not physically suitable for the type of development;
   (4)   That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed density of
development;
   (5)   That the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are
likely to cause substantial environmental damages or substantially and
avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat;
   (6)   That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements is
likely to cause serious public health problems; and
   (7)   That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will
conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or
the use of property within the proposed subdivision or with public access to
public resources as defined and regulated by Sections 66478.1, et seq. of the
Subdivision Map Act. In this connection, the governing body may approve a map
if it finds that alternate easements, for access or for use, will be provided
and that they will be substantially equivalent to easements previously acquired
by the public. This subsection shall apply only to easements of record or to
easements established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and no
authority shall be granted to a legislative body to determine that the public
at large has acquired easements for access through, or the use of, property
within the proposed subdivision.

   (a)   Expiration. The approval or conditional approval of a tentative map
shall expire thirty-six (36) months from the following date: in the event no
appeal was taken, or if the subdivider appealed, from the date of Planning
Commission approval; in the case of appeals by other persons, from the date of
the decision on appeal. Failure to submit to the City all items needed to file
a final map or parcel map with the County Recorder within such period shall
terminate all proceedings, and any subdivision of the same land shall require
the filing and processing of a new map using a new tentative tract number
issued in accordance with the provisions of Section
9-3.503 of Article 5 of this chapter. The subdivider shall be responsible for
keeping a record as to when a map will expire.
   (b)   Extensions. The City or the applicant filing the tentative map may
request an extension of the tentative map approval or conditional approval by
filing a minor modification application prior to the expiration date with the
Community Development Director. The applicant shall state the reasons for
requesting the extension. A maximum of two (2) discretionary time extensions,
not to exceed a cumulative length of forty-eight (48) months, except where
otherwise required by the Subdivision Map Act, may be approved by the Community
Development Director. The applicant or any aggrieved party may appeal the
decision of the Director to the Planning Commission within fifteen (15) days
after the decision of the Director.
   (c)   Time limits for extensions. Any extension of a tentative map approval
or conditional approval shall not exceed the time limits provided in the
Subdivision Map Act (Section 66452.6 of the Government Code of the State).
   (d)   Effect of map modifications on extensions. The modification of a
tentative map after approval or conditional approval shall not extend the time

Sec. 9-3.801. Application.
   A vesting tentative map may be filed for residential, commercial, and
industrial developments. Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as
implemented and supplemented by this chapter, requires the filing of a
tentative map or tentative parcel map, a vesting tentative map may instead be
filed in accordance with the provisions of this article. If a subdivider does
not seek the rights conferred by the vesting tentative map statute, the filing
of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any
proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to
construction.

“vesting tentative map.”
(§ 3, Ord. 935-NS, eff. October 7, 1986)
Sec. 9-3.803. Consistency.
   A vesting tentative map may not be filed and no land shall be subdivided and
developed pursuant to a vesting tentative map for any purpose or use which will
be inconsistent with the City’s General Plan, any applicable Specific Plan or
not permitted pursuant to the zoning or other applicable provisions of this
code. Instead, any necessary General Plan Amendment or zone change must be
obtained before any such proposed map may be properly filed.
(§ 3, Ord. 935-NS, eff. October 7, 1986)

acceptance.
   (a)   Prior to submitting a final map or parcel map of a proposed
subdivision for approval pursuant to Section
9-3.946 of Article 9 of this chapter, the subdivider and all owners of land in
the subdivision substantially interested in the subdivision shall execute an
improvement agreement, in a form approved by the City Attorney, and as
prescribed by the City Engineer, whereby the subdivider is bound to construct
the improvements which have not been completed and accepted by the City prior

of Title 9 of this Code.
   (c)   Nothwithstanding the above, construction requirements of parcel maps
and on parcels designated as remainders when a subdivision is of a portion of
any unit of improved or unimproved land shall not be required until such time
as a permit or other grant of approval for development of the parcel is issued
by the City, unless construction is required pursuant to an agreement between
the City and the subdivider, or unless the City Engineer requires construction
within a reasonable time following the approval of the parcel map and prior to
the issuance of a permit or grant of approval for development upon a finding
that construction is necessary for reasons of public health and safety or the
orderly development of the surrounding area. The time of the completion of the
construction requirements for subdivisions which have multiple final maps may
be specified by the City Engineer, including the authority to require the
completion of improvements on any of the multiple final maps, regardless of the
sequence of the construction of the final maps by the subdivider, where the
improvements are desirable to serve the residents of the subdivision being
constructed or to accommodate the public generally who will be impacted by the
subdivision.
   (d)   The agreement, executed by the subdivider, shall be submitted to the
City Engineer, who shall execute the agreement on behalf of the City only after
approval of the final map and the exhaustion of any appeal to the City Council
provided under Section
9-3.946(e) of this chapter.
   (e)   The City Engineer’s action under this section may be appealed to the
Council within ten (10) calendar days of the date of the action in the same
manner that decisions of the Planning Commission are appealed to the Council
pursuant to Section

approved as to form by the City Attorney, that are consistent with this
section. In consideration for an amendment, the City Engineer may require,
inter alia, the following:
   (1)   Revisions of improvement plans to provide for current design and
construction standards when required by the City Engineer or Community
Development Director;
   (2)   Revised improvement construction estimates to reflect current
improvement costs, as approved by the City Engineer;
   (3)   Increase in the amount of improvement securities in accordance with
revised construction estimates; and
   (4)   Increase of inspection and plan-check fees to reflect current
construction costs or changes in the method of calculation, or both.
   (g)   Upon satisfactory completion of the improvements under the improvement
agreement, the City Engineer may accept the improvements on behalf of the City,
and in accordance with Streets and Highways Code § 1806(c), may accept streets
and roads or portions thereof, into the City street system.
   (h)   Should the subdivider fail to complete the improvements in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the improvement agreement, the City Engineer
may cause any or all uncompleted improvements to the completed and the
subdivider and sureties shall be firmly bound for the payment of all necessary
costs incurred by the City.

Sec. 9-3.1102. Amount of improvement security.
   Improvement security posted for the improvements required for the proposed
subdivision shall be for the full amount of the estimated costs of the
improvements as determined by the City Engineer pursuant to Section
9-3.1014 of Article 10 of this chapter. In addition, security shall be posted
to secure payment by the subdivider to the contractor, his subcontractors, and
to persons renting equipment or furnishing labor or materials to them for the
improvement of the proposed subdivision in the full amount of the estimated
costs of such materials and services as determined by the City Engineer. Five
Hundred and no/100ths ($500.00) Dollars of the required improvement security
shall be in the form of a cash deposit with the City. No interest shall be
earned on the deposit. Such cash deposit may be used by the City in correcting
unsafe or emergency road conditions occasioned by or arising out of the
performance of any work in constructing the subdivision improvements, in weed
abatement within the subdivision, in periodic street cleaning, or in the
removal of trash from within the subdivision. The City may use the cash deposit
only if the City is unable, after reasonable attempts, to contact the developer
(or his contractor) to perform the required emergency work, weed abatement, or
trash removal or if the developer or his contractor refuses to forthwith
perform the required work after being informed of its necessity by the City. If
any part of the Five Hundred and no/100ths ($500.00) Dollar cash deposit is
used by the City, the developer shall be charged for the cost of the required
work and shall remit to City, within (10) days after written notice of such
expenditures, sufficient cash to bring the deposit to Five Hundred and no/
100ths ($500.00) Dollars once more. Any portion of the cash deposit which has
not been used by the City at the time the street improvements are accepted into
the City roads system shall be returned to the developer. Any improvement
security required in addition to the Five Hundred and no/100ths ($500.00)
Dollars may be of any type specified in Section 66499 of the Subdivision Map
Act.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)

subdivider, acceptance of the public improvements by the City Engineer, and the
posting of the guarantee security pursuant to Section
9-3.1005 of Article 10 of this chapter, the City Engineer shall exonerate all
improvement security posted to secure the execution of the agreement. The City
Engineer may accept a cash deposit or a certificate of deposit necessary to
accomplish the required performance in lieu of all or part of such performance
when he finds it is reasonable and necessary under all of the circumstances.
Upon a request of the subdivider, the City Engineer, in his discretion, may
reduce the amount of the improvement security by partial exoneration in an
amount not exceeding ninety (90%) percent of the total estimated costs of the
improvements of the subdivision when a corresponding percentage amount of
improvements has been fully completed to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.
However, under no circumstances shall such partial exoneration constitute
acceptance of the improvements upon which such partial exoneration is granted.

   Prior to recording a notice of merger the City of Thousand Oaks shall cause
to be mailed by certified mail to the then current record owner of the property
a notice of intention to determine status, notifying the owner that the
affected parcels may be merged pursuant to standards specified in Section
9-3.1210 and advising the owner of the opportunity to request a hearing on
determination of status and to present evidence at the hearing that the
property does not meet the criteria for merger. The notice of intention to
determine status shall be filed for record with the recorder of the county in
which the real property is located on the date that notice is mailed to the
property owner.
(§ 1, Ord. 974-NS, eff. September 8, 1987)
Sec. 9-3.1213. Request for hearing.
   At any time within thirty (30) days after recording of the notice of

by complying with all the applicable requirements for the subdivision of land
as provided by this chapter. The filing of the final map or parcel map shall
constitute the legal merging of the separate parcels into one parcel and the
resubdivision of such parcel, and the real property shall thereafter be shown
with the new lot or parcel boundaries on the assessment roll. Any unused fees
or deposits previously made pursuant to this chapter pertaining to the property
shall be credited pro rata towards any requirements for the same purposes which
are applicable at the time of the resubdivision. Any streets or easements to be
left in effect after the resubdivision shall be adequately delineated on the
map. After the approval of the merger and the resubdivision, the map shall be
delivered to the County Recorder. The filing of the map shall consist of the
legal merger and the resubdivision of the land affected thereby and shall also
consist of the abandonment of all street and easements not shown on the map.

Sec. 9-3.1218. Voluntary lot mergers.
   (a)   Intent and Purpose. Concurrent Processing with Discretionary Projects.
The purpose of this Article is to establish ministerial procedures for
processing voluntary merger applications to merge contiguous lots under common
ownership into a single lot as authorized by California Government Code Section
66499.20.3. The approval of voluntary merger applications and subsequent review
and approval of the certificate of merger and deeds are ministerial acts not
subject to CEQA. In instances where a voluntary merger is requested in
conjunction with a project involving an application for a development permit or
other discretionary City land use approval involving some or all of the
property subject to the voluntary merger, the voluntary merger application
shall be processed concurrently with the application for the discretionary land
use approval, including for purposes of evaluating the project’s potential
environmental effects. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City’s approval of a
voluntary merger is, in and of itself, a ministerial act.
   (b)   Application. Applications for the approval of a Voluntary Merger shall
be filed with the Community Development Department. No application shall be
accepted for filing and processing if there is an open investigation pertaining
to a documented violation of the TOMC on the subject lot(s) unless:
      (1)   The acceptance of the application is necessary to abate the
existing violation and otherwise conforms to the requirements of this Chapter;
      (2)   Contains in a full, true, and correct manner, the required
information prescribed by the forms supplied by the Community Development
Department; and
      (3)   Is accompanied by the appropriate fees.
   (c)   Filing and Processing Requirements.
      (1)   The application for a Voluntary Merger shall be processed by the
Community Development Department if all information and documents requested in
the application, including each item listed below in Section
9-3.1218(c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(vii), are submitted and concurrently reviewed
to the satisfaction of the Community Development Department until deemed
complete.
         (i)   A deposit of the required fees pursuant to the City's Fee
Schedule to process and record a certificate of voluntary merger.
         (ii)   A current preliminary title report showing all parties with a
legal or equitable interest in the lots and all easements, covenants, and other
encumbrances and interests in the affected lots at the time of the filing of
the application for the voluntary merger.
         (iii)   All parties having any record title interest in the lots
subject to the voluntary merger application have consented in writing to the
voluntary merger subject to the exceptions set forth in Government Code Section
66436.
         (iv)   If any of the existing lots are developed, a site plan prepared
by the project surveyor that depicts the location of any buildings or
structures with a notation of setback distances from the resulting adjusted lot
lines.
         (v)   Documentation, as required by the Community Development
Department, to establish that each of the lots that are subject to the
voluntary merger are legal lots. The applicant is encouraged to consult with
the Community Development Department prior to submitting a voluntary merger
application that involves illegally created lots to confirm compliance with
Section
9-3.1218(g)(1)(2)(11).
         (vi)   Legal description and map, prepared by a person authorized to
practice land surveying or land surveyor, of the new boundaries of the merged
lot as adjusted by the voluntary merger. The map shall also include: (i) the
boundaries of each of the existing lots at the time of application; and (ii) a
north arrow and the bearings and distances for the merged lot lines. A record
of survey may be voluntarily submitted as a substitute for a map.
         (vii)   Draft certificate of voluntary merger (see Section
9-3.1218(k) below) and deed(s) reflecting the adjusted property boundaries.
      (2)   Unless otherwise specified in this Article, the voluntary merger
application shall be processed ministerially without a public notice or
hearing.
   (d)   Community Development Department and City Engineer Review.
      (1)   The Community Development Department and City Engineer shall review
the voluntary merger application. If additional information is needed, the
applicant shall provide the documents and information requested by the
Community Development Department and City Engineer in order to deem the
application complete. If the application is determined to be incomplete, the
applicant shall be notified in writing of the reasons therefor and informed of
the information needed to make the application complete.
      (2)   The City Engineer or designee shall determine whether the documents
required to effectuate the Voluntary Merger are technically correct, including
the legal description and map. When the City Engineer or designee is satisfied
that the documents to be recorded to complete the voluntary merger are
technically correct, the City Engineer shall transmit the documents to the
Community Development Department for recordation with the Office of the County
Recorder upon final approval of the application by the advisory agency pursuant
to Section
9-3.1218(j) of this Chapter.
   (e)   Termination of Incomplete Application. An incomplete voluntary merger
application may be terminated in the same manner for terminating an incomplete
land use permit application as set forth in Section
9-4.2817(a)(1), and (a)(2) "Applications incomplete for processing.”
   (f)   Designated Advisory Agency. The Community Development Director or
designee is the designated advisory agency for ministerial voluntary merger
applications under this Article.
   (g)   Standards for Approval. The Community Development Director, in
consultation with the City Engineer, shall approve or conditionally approve a
voluntary lot merger without public notice or hearing if, on the basis of the
complete application that demonstrates the following:
      (1)   Each of the lots to be merged are legal lots. However, a legal lot
that was illegally subdivided thus creating two or more illegal lots may be
merged back into its original configuration as the legal lot existed prior to
the illegal subdivision so long as the other criteria of approval set forth in
this section are met;
      (2)   If one or more involved parcels is subject to a conditional
certificate of compliance, the conditions of development must be fully
satisfied by the merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a condition of
development that would not be satisfied relates to minimum parcel size, the
merger shall be approved with the condition that the deed or deeds recorded to
effectuate the merger contain an express statement that the resulting parcel
remains subject to the conditional certificate of compliance, whose recording
information shall be noted on the deed or deeds;
      (3)   The lots to be merged are contiguous to each other;
      (4)   The lots to be merged are under the same ownership;
      (5)   If there are any liens or deeds of trust, they shall encumber the
entire merged lot. There cannot be any liens or deeds of trust encumbering only
a portion of the merged lot;
      (6)   The voluntary merger will not adversely affect existing easements
of record on any of the lots or any conditions of approval, dedications, offers
to dedicate, or security arising from a previously recorded map that created
any of the lots subject to the voluntary merger application;
      (7)   The lot merger shall not impair existing easements, or it shall
include the relocation of existing easements, utilities, or infrastructure
serving adjacent lots, parcels, or public lands and streets;
      (8)   The lot merger shall not impair existing access or create a need
for access to adjacent lots or parcels;
      (9)   The lot merger will not alter the exterior boundary of the lots to
be merged;
      (10)   The City Engineer or designee has approved the legal description
as accurately representing the exterior boundaries of the resulting merged lot;
      (11)   The voluntary merger will not render any existing conforming
structures or existing conforming uses on any of the involved lots to become a
nonconforming structure or use. Existing legal nonconforming structures or uses
on any of the lots subject to the application are not grounds to deny the
voluntary merger; and
      (12)   The deed or deeds submitted to the Community Development to
effectuate the merger shall contain an express statement of the grantor(s),
pursuant to section 1093 of the California Civil Code, that the intent of the
grantor(s) and the purpose of the deed(s) is to merge all of the property
described in the deed(s) into a single lot.
   (h)   Conditional Approval:
      (1)   The only conditions the Advisory Agency may impose on the approval
of a voluntary merger are those required:
         (i)   Conform the merged lot to all objective standards and
requirements of the General Plan, Zoning Ordinances and City of Thousand Oaks
Improvement Standards and Specifications; and
         (ii)   Facilitate the relocation of existing utilities,
infrastructure, or easements.
      (2)   If the voluntary merger application is conditionally approved, the
advisory agency shall send a letter of conditional approval notifying the
applicant of the conditions to be fulfilled prior to recordation of the
voluntary merger. If the conditions are not fulfilled within one year of the
date of the letter, the voluntary merger shall expire and become null and void
unless the applicant obtains a written extension from the Advisory Agency
pursuant to Section 9-9-3.1218(i), "Extension of Conditional Approval" of this
Chapter.
      (3)   A conditionally approved voluntary merger shall be deemed ready for
recordation when the advisory agency determines that the conditions have been
fulfilled and is in receipt of the following:
         (i)   An up-to-date preliminary title report;
         (ii)   The voluntary merger documents approved by the City Engineer
(e.g., legal description and a map); and
         (iii)   All deeds prepared for recordation as approved by the
Community Development Director pursuant to Section
9-3.1218(c)(1)(vii) of this Chapter.
      (4)   Upon receipt of the documents required by Section
9-3.1218(h)(3) above, the Advisory Agency shall cause each of the Community
Development Director-approved voluntary merger documents and deeds to be
recorded in the Office of the County Recorder.
         (i)   Extension of Conditional Approval. Prior to the expiration of
the conditional approval of the voluntary merger application pursuant to
Section
9-3.1218(h)(2) above, the Advisory Agency may grant one extension of up to six
(6) months if the applicant demonstrates good cause.
         (ii)   Certificate of Voluntary Merger. The recordation of a
Certificate of Voluntary Merger and the deed(s) shall effectuate the voluntary
merger of the separate lots into a single lot for the purposes of the
Subdivision Map Act and this Chapter, and the lots shall thereafter be treated
in all respects as a single lot. The Certificate of Voluntary Merger shall
constitute a Certificate of Compliance for the merged lot.
         (iii)   Certificate of Voluntary Merger Requirements. A Certificate of
Voluntary Merger shall include all the following:
      (5)   All parties having any record title interest in the merged lot
shall execute the Certificate of Voluntary Merger before a Notary Public and
submit it to the Community Development Department, excepting all those
interests that are excepted pursuant to the provisions of Government Code
Section 66436. The Community Development Director shall also execute the
Certificate of Voluntary Merger, but the signature need not be notarized.
      (6)   The Certificate of Voluntary Merger shall include an express
written statement that the consolidation of the legal descriptions of the lots
is intended by the owner(s) to merge those lots into a single lot as set forth
in the legal description of the merged lot.
      (7)   Either: (a) The deed or deeds that comprise the ownership interests
of each lot subject to the voluntary merger shall be attached to the
certificate of voluntary merger, or (b) the recorder number of each deed to
each lot subject to the Voluntary Merger shall be referenced in the Certificate
of Voluntary Merger.
      (8)   The legal description of the merged lot approved by the City
Engineer shall be attached to the Certificate of Voluntary Merger.

constructed to the standards otherwise specified in this section. The
subdivider shall also provide proper ties to the location of the center line
monuments, and such ties shall be shown on a tie sheet of a form approved by
the City Engineer. A minimum of three (3) such ties shall be required for each
monument. All monuments set shall be permanently marked or tagged with the

City therefor may be utilized to reimburse the subdivider as set forth in this
section.

Sec. 9-3.1601. Dedication of land and/or payments in lieu of fees for school
facilities.
   The requirements and provisions of Chapter 8 of Title 9 of this Code shall
be applied to maps processed under this chapter.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.1602. Dedication of land for park and recreational purposes.
   The Council does hereby find, determine, and declare as follows:
   (a)   In 1965, the Legislature of the State amended the Subdivision Map Act
(formerly Sections 11500, et seq., of the Business and Professions Code of the
State) to enable counties to require either the dedication of land, the payment
of fees, or a combination of both for park or recreational purposes as a
condition of the approval of a subdivision map; and
   (b)   In 1972, the Legislature of the State amended the Subdivision Map Act
(formerly Section 11596 of the Business and Professions Code of the State), to
enable cities and counties to also require either the dedication of land, the
payment of fees, or a combination of both for park or recreational purposes as
a condition of the approval of a parcel map for a division of land not a
subdivision; and
   (c)   Before a city or county may avail itself of said Act, it shall have a
General Plan containing a recreational element with definite principles and
standards for park and recreational facilities to serve the residents of the
city or county; and
   (d)   The Council has amended the General Plan of the City to include such
recreational element; and
   (e)   The revised Subdivision Map Act continues the earlier substantive
provision as Section 66477 of the Government Code of the State.

Sec. 9-3.1603. Subdividers required to provide park and recreational
facilities.
   Every subdivider who subdivides land requiring either a final map or a
parcel map shall dedicate a portion of such land, pay a fee, or do both, as set
forth in this article, for the purpose of providing park and recreational
facilities to serve the future residents of such divided property.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.1604. Application of article provisions.
   The provisions of this article shall apply to all subdivisions, as that term
is defined in Section 66424 of the Government Code of the State, and to time
extensions with regard to any map; provided, however, the provisions of this
article shall not apply to industrial subdivisions or to condominium projects
which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building
which is more than five (5) years old when no new dwelling units are added (see
paragraph (d)of Section 66477 of the Government Code of the State).
Furthermore, the provisions of this article shall only apply to a subdivision
not requiring a final map if the subdivision is to be made by or on behalf of a
person engaged in the business of developing and selling real estate as
distinguished from a private owner making an occasional sale. A person shall
not be deemed to be engaged in the developing and selling of real estate if he
has made no more than four (4) sales in either of the last two (2) preceding
years. Subdivisions containing less than five (5) parcels and not used for
residential purposes shall be exempted from the requirements of this article;
provided, however, a condition may be placed on the approval of the parcel map
for such a division of land to the effect that if a building permit is
requested for the construction of a residential structure or structures on one
or more of the parcels within two (2) years, the fee may be required to be paid
by the owner of each such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such permit.
(See subsection(a)(8) of Section 66477 of the Government Code of the State.)

Sec. 9-3.1605. Relation of land required to population density.
   It is hereby found and determined:
   (a)   That the public interest, convenience, health, welfare, and safety
require that the following acreage for each 1,000 persons residing within the
City be devoted to park and recreational purposes:
   (1)   Five (5) acres of neighborhood park lands;
   (2)   Two (2) acres of playfields; and
   (3)   Two (2) acres of community park lands;
   (b)   That one-half (1/2) of such requirements will be satisfied in part by
the City, the Conejo Recreation and Park District, and local school districts;
and
   (c)   That the remaining one-half (1/2) of such requirements amounting to
two and one-half (2-1/2) acres of neighborhood park lands, one acre of
playfields, and one acre of community park lands shall be supplied by
subdividers under the requirements of this article.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.1606. Determination of population density.
   Population density, for the purposes of this article, shall be determined in
accordance with the following standards, to wit:
   (a)   Single-family detached dwellings = 3.8 persons per dwelling unit;
   (b)   Single-family attached dwellings less than, or equal to, seven (7)
units per net acre density = 2.8 persons per dwelling unit;
   (c)   Condominiums and other attached dwellings, other than apartments, over
seven (7) units per net acre = 2.4 persons per dwelling unit;
   (d)   Apartments = 2.0 persons per dwelling unit; and
   (e)   Mobile homes = 1.75 persons per dwelling unit.
   The basis for determining the total number of dwelling units shall be the
number of such units permitted by the City on the property included in the
subdivision at the time the tentative subdivision tract map or parcel map is
approved by the City.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.1607. Amount of land to be dedicated.
   The amount of land to be dedicated by a subdivider pursuant to this article
shall be based on the following formula:
   (a)   A = 4.5 (D.F. ( D.U.)
   1000
   (b)   Definitions of terms:
   (1)   A shall mean the area in acres required to be dedicated as park sites
or to be approved for a fee payment in lieu of dedication.
   (2)   D.F. shall mean the density factor obtained from Section
9-3.1606 of this article as applicable to the proposed development.
   (3)   D.U. shall mean the number of dwelling units in the subdivision.
   (4)   4.5 shall mean the number of acres per one thousand (1,000) persons to
be provided by the developer.
   (5)   1,000 shall mean the number of persons.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.1608. Amount of fees in lieu of land dedication.
   Where a fee is required to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the amount of
such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which
would otherwise be required to be dedicated pursuant to the provisions of
Section
9-3.1607 of this article. The amount of such fee shall be a sum equal to the
fair market value of the amount of land, including full street improvements,
either dedicated or to be maintained by a property owner, that would otherwise
be required to be dedicated pursuant to the provisions of Section
9-3.1607 of this article. The fee shall be calculated by multiplying “A,” as
derived from said Section
9-3.1607, by the fair market value per acre and including the actual cost for
the full street improvements; however, where a subdivision includes a Primary
or controlled access Secondary Highway as designated on the Circulation Element
of the General Plan, the land area and actual costs for street improvements in
excess of the design standards for a collector street shall not be included in
such fee calculation.
   The fair market value shall be determined prior to the approval of the final
map or parcel map in accordance with the following:
   (a)   The fair market value shall be determined by the application of
accepted assessment practices, and the initial determination may be based upon
the current assessed value, modified equal to market value, in accordance with
the standards established by the current practices of the County Assessor; or
   (b)   If either the City, the Conejo Parks and Recreation District, or the
developer objects to such evaluation, either party, at the developer’s expense,
may obtain an appraisal of the property by a neutral qualified real estate
appraiser approved by the City, which appraisal shall be considered in addition
to the provision of subsection (a) of this section by the Council in reaching
its decision as to fair market value; or
   (c)    The City, Conejo Parks and Recreational District, and the developer
may agree to the fair market value.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.1609. Credit for private open space.
   Where private open space for park and recreation purposes is provided in a
proposed subdivision, and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by
the future residents of the property, such areas may be credited against the
requirement of dedication for park and recreation purposes, as set forth in
Section
9-3.1607 of this article, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as set forth
in Section
9-3.1608 of this article, provided the Planning Commission finds it is in the
public interests to do so and the following standards are met:
   (a)   That yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open areas required to be
maintained by the zoning and building provisions of this Code shall not be
included in the computation of such private open spaces; and
   (b)   That the private ownership and maintenance of the open space is
adequately provided for by written agreement; and
   (c)   That the use of the private open space is restricted for park and
recreational purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of
the future owners of the property within the tract and which cannot be defeated
or eliminated without the consent of the Planning Commission; and
   (d)   That the proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for the
use for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors
as size, shape, topography, geology, access, and the location of the private
open space land, and
   (e)   That the facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial
accordance with the provisions of the Recreation Element of the General Plan
and are approved by the Planning Commission.
   The Council, upon a recommendation by the Planning Commission, may adopt
more specific guidelines and standards to be utilized in determining the actual
percentage of credit that may be given for private park and recreational
facilities in any proposed subdivision. Such guidelines and standards shall be
adopted as a resolution by the Council, upon a recommendation by the Planning
Commission, only after a public hearing, noticed and conducted in the manner
required for zone changes, in accordance with the provisions of Article 29 of
Chapter 4 of this title.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.1610. Choice of dedication of land or payment of fees or both.
   (a)   Procedure. The procedure for determining whether the subdivider shall
dedicate land, pay a fee, or both shall be as follows:
   (1)   Determination by the subdivider. At the time of filing a tentative
tract map for approval, the owner of the property, as a part of the filing,
shall indicate whether he desires to dedicate property for park and
recreational purposes or whether he desires to pay a fee in lieu thereof. If he
desires to dedicate land for such purposes, he shall designate the area thereof
on the tentative tract map as submitted.
   (2)   Action of the City. At the time of the tentative tract map approval,
the Planning Commission, upon the advice of the Conejo Recreation and Park
District, shall determine as a part of such approval, whether to require a
dedication of land within the subdivision, the payment of a fee in lieu
thereof, or a combination of both.
   (3)   Prerequisites for acceptance of final maps. Where dedication is
required, it shall be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of the
Subdivision Map Act and conveyed to the Conejo Recreation and Park District, or
to the City if the District does not have any jurisdiction within the
subdivision. Where fees are required, they shall be deposited with the Conejo
Recreation and Park District, or with the City if the District does not have
any jurisdiction within the subdivision, prior to the acceptance of the final
tract map. If the Conejo Recreation and Park District refuses to accept either
the park dedication or the fees, such dedication shall be conveyed to the City
or its assignees and/or the fees will be held by the city in a trust fund for
the Conejo Recreation and Park District. Open space covenants for private park
or recreational facilities shall be submitted in a form approved by the City
Attorney and Community Development Director prior to the Council accepting the
final tract map and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final tract
map.
   (b)   Determination. Whether the Planning Commission, upon the advice of the
Conejo Recreation and Park District, accepts the land dedication or elects to
require the payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall
be determined by consideration of the following:
   (1)   The Recreation Element of the General Plan;
   (2)   The topography, geology, access, and location of the land in the
subdivision available for dedication;
   (3)   The size and shape of the subdivision and the land available for
dedication;
   (4)   The location of existing or proposed park sites and trailways; and
   (5)   The desirability of developing the land proposed for dedication for
park and recreational purposes as determined by a schematic site plan submitted
by the subdivider.
   The determination of the Planning Commission as to whether land shall be
dedicated, or whether a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof shall be
final and conclusive, unless appealed to the Council. On subdivisions involving
fifty (50) lots or less, only the payment of fees shall be required.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.1611. Designation of development time.
   Prior to the acceptance of the final tract map, the Council, upon the advice
of and written agreement with the Conejo Recreation and Park District, shall
develop a schedule specifying how and when it will use the land or fees, or
both, to develop park or recreational facilities. Any fees collected shall be
committed within five (5) years after the payment of such fees or the issuance
of building permits on one-half (1/2) of the lots created by the subdivision,
whichever occurs later. If such fees are not committed, they shall be
distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same
proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all lots
within the subdivision.
(Ord. 744-NS, eff. April 17, 1980)
Sec. 9-3.1612. Limitations on the use of land and fees.
   The land and fees received pursuant to the provisions of this article shall
be used only for the purpose of providing park and recreational facilities to
serve the residences of the development for which received, and the location of
the land and the amount of the fees shall bear a reasonable relationship to the
use of the park and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the
property.

shall be filed in the office of the County Recorder in which the original map
was filed. Upon such filing, the County Recorder shall index the names of the
fee owners and the appropriate tract designation shown on the amending map or
certificate of correction in the general index and map index respectively.

Subdivision Map Act, has been filed for record by the County Recorder.
   (c)   The conveyance of any part of a division of real property for which a
final or parcel map is required by this chapter shall not be made by parcel or
block number, initial, or other designation unless and until such map has been
filed for record by the County Recorder.
   (d)   This section shall not apply to any parcel of a subdivision offered

Sec. 9-3.1802. Remedies.
   (a)   Any deed of conveyance, sale, or contract to sell real property which
has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the
provisions of this chapter or the Subdivision Map Act shall be voidable at the
sole option of the grantee, buyer, or person contracting to purchase, or his
heirs, personal representative, or trustee in insolvency or bankruptcy, within
one year after the date of the discovery of the violation, but the deed of
conveyance, sale, or contract to sell shall be binding upon any successor in
interest of the grantee, buyer, or person contracting to purchase, other than
those above enumerated, and upon the grantor, vendor, or person contracting to
sell, or his assignee, heir, or devisee.
   (b)   Any grantee, or his successor in interest, of real property which has
been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the
provisions of this chapter or the Subdivision Map Act, within one year of the
date of the discovery of such violation, may bring an action in the Superior
Court to recover any damages he has suffered by reason of such division of
property. The action may be brought against the person who divided the property
in violation and against any successors in interest who have actual or
constructive knowledge of such division of property.
   (c)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to the conveyance of
any parcel of real property identified in a certificate of compliance filed
pursuant to this Code and Section 66499.35 of the Subdivision Map Act, or
identified in a recorded final map or parcel map, from and after the date of
recording. The provisions of this section shall not limit or affect in any way
the rights of a grantee or his successor in interest under any other provision
of law.
   (d)   This section shall not bar any legal, equitable, or summary remedy to
which the City or other public agency, or any person, firm, or corporation, may

   (e)   The City shall not issue a permit or any approval necessary to develop
any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a
division, in violation of the provisions of this chapter or the Subdivision Map
Act if the City finds that the development of such real property is contrary to
the public health or the public safety. The authority to deny such a permit or
such approval shall apply whether the applicant therefor was the owner of
record at the time of such violation or whether the applicant therefor is
either the current owner of record or a vendee of the current owner of record
pursuant to a contract of sale of the real property, with or without actual or
constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of his
interest in such real property.

any such real property, may impose such additional conditions as would have
been applicable to the division of the property at the time the applicant
acquired his interest in the property.
   (f)   Whenever any construction activity, including grading or earth moving,
is being done on any property for which an approved final map exists contrary
to the provisions of this chapter or any approval of the map, the Community

on any person engaged in doing or causing such activity to be carried out, and
any such person shall forthwith stop the activity until authorized by the
Community Development Director to proceed.

   (a)   Any person owning real property within the City, or a purchaser under
a contract of sale of such property, may request the Community Development
Director to determine whether such real property complies with the provisions
of this chapter and the Subdivision Map Act.
   (b)   Upon making such determination, the Community Development Director
shall cause a certificate of compliance to be filed for record with the County
Recorder. The certificate of compliance shall identify the real property and
shall state that the division of land complies with the applicable provisions
of this Code and the Subdivision Map Act.
   (c)   If the Community Development Director determines that such real
property does not comply with the provisions of this Code or the Subdivision
Map Act, he may, as a condition to granting a certificate of compliance, impose
any of the conditions permitted by this Code or the Subdivision Map Act. The
condition shall be set out in and recorded with the certificate. Such
conditions may be fulfilled and implemented by the property owner who has
applied for a certificate of compliance pursuant to this section or by a
purchaser of such property owner. If such conditions are not fulfilled or
implemented by the applicant property owner or the purchaser, the certificate
of compliance shall have no force or effect upon any subsequent transfer of the
property, and any subsequent transferee or assignee shall make a new
application for a certificate of compliance pursuant to this section, and the
City may impose such conditions as would have been applicable at the time such
assignee or transferee acquired the property.
   (d)   A validly recorded final map or parcel map shall constitute a
certificate of compliance with respect to the parcels of real property
described therein. It shall be at the discretion of the Community Development

general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding
of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate
provision for transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, roads, and other
public facilities and improvements, and to establish the most beneficial and
convenient relationships among the residential, commercial, industrial,
agricultural, recreational, and undeveloped areas, having regard to their
suitability for the various uses appropriate to each of them and their
potentiality for such uses, as indicated by existing conditions and trends in
population, in the direction and manner of the uses of land, in building
development, and in economic activity.
(§ 8111, T.O.O.C.)
Sec. 9-4.103. Interpretation.

   (b)   It is not intended by this chapter to interfere with or abrogate or
annul any easement, covenant, or other agreement between parties.
   (c)   When the provisions of this chapter impose a greater restriction upon
the use of buildings or land or upon the height of buildings, or require larger
open spaces than are imposed or required by other laws, rules, and regulations,
or by easements, covenants, or agreements, the provisions of this chapter shall

this chapter, but such prosecution or action shall be prosecuted to its
finality under the former law the same as if this chapter had not been adopted,
and, to this end, the former law shall remain in effect and be applicable until
such prosecution or action has been terminated. Any violation of the provisions
of the former law for which prosecution or legal action has not been instituted

E-1Ac., R-O-1Ac., R-1-2Ac., R-E-2Ac., and R-0-2Ac. Zones by adding suffix “Av.”
to any of such zones.
   Lands classified in any of the “Av.” sub-zones may contain lots of a minimum
lot area as prescribed in the following table, provided that the average lot
area of all the lots so zoned shall not be less than the square footage
required by that sub-zone and provided, further, that in computing such
average, only those lots not exceeding one and one-half (1- 1/2) times the
square feet of the sub-zone will be considered. The following table shows the
minimum and average lot areas allowed for each sub-zone classification:
Sub-Zone Classification Minimum Lot Area Allowed Area Average Lot Area
Sub-Zone Classification Minimum Lot Area Allowed Area Average Lot Area
8000 Av.                7000 Square feet              8000 Square feet
9000 Av.                7000 Square feet              9000 Square feet
10000 Av.               7000 Square feet              10000 Square feet
13000 Av.               8000 Square feet              13000 Square feet
20000 Av.               13000 Square feet             20000 Square feet
30000 Av.               20000 Square feet             30000 Square feet
1 Ac. Av.               30000 Square feet             1 Ac.
2 Ac. Av.               1 Ac.                         2 Ac.
 
   (b)   Sub-zones for the R-P-D Zone may be established. The requirements for
the R-P-D Zone shall apply to the respective R-P-D sub-zones except that the
suffix for the R-P-D designation shall be the maximum average number of
dwelling units per acre, followed by the letter "U." Land proposed for
development in the R-P-D Zone pursuant to an approved specific plan may be
zoned with an overall density for the entire residential area of master plan
without regard to ownership. Land so zoned shall be designated with the letters
"SP" and shall be subject to the land use and development requirements
specified in the underlying specific plan.
   The following are examples of sub-zones:
   (1)   The sub-zone of the R-E-20 Zone which requires a minimum average lot
area of 20,000 square feet shall be R-E-20 Av.
   (2)   The Residential Planned Development Zone (R-P-D) which permits a
maximum average of twenty (20) dwelling, units per acre shall be R-P-D-20U; a
maximum average of six (6) dwelling units per acre shall be R-P-D-6U.
   (3)   The sub-zone of R-P-D-3U-SP would permit a total density of three (3)
dwelling units per acre, multiplied by the total number of acres for the total
area. Assuming one thousand (1,000) acres were subject to R-P-D-3U-SP, the
total density available would be three thousand (3,000) dwelling units.
Assuming eight hundred (800) acres were devoted to open space or park areas,
the three thousand (3,000) dwelling units would be permitted to be applied over
the remaining two hundred (200) acres.

wherever the latter appears in any paper, record, or document relating to
previous zoning ordinances or regulations of the City.
   The zones established by this article and the boundaries of such zones are
shown upon a map which is made a part of this chapter and which is designated
as the "Official Zoning Map." Such zoning map may, for convenience, be divided
into parts, and each such part may, for purposes of more readily identifying
areas within such zoning map, be subdivided into units, and each such part and
unit may be separately used for purposes of amending the zoning map or for any
official reference to the zoning map. Such map, and each such part and unit,
and the notations, references, and other information shown thereon, shall be as
much a part of this chapter as if the matters and information set forth by such
map were all fully described in this chapter.

   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any zone as shown on any
zoning map, or part thereof, the following rules of construction shall apply:
   (a)   Where such boundaries are indicated as approximately following street
and alley lines or lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be such
boundaries.
   (b)   In the case of unsubdivided property and where a zone boundary divides
a lot, the locations of such boundaries, unless the same are indicated by
dimensions, shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on such
zoning map.
   (c)   Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the
zoning regulations applicable to abutting property on each side of the center
line shall apply up to the center line of such vacated or abandoned street or
alley on each respective side thereof.
   The Commission shall determine such uncertainties.
(§ 8116, T.O.O.C.)
Sec. 9-4.306. Ambiguities.

particular use within the meaning and intent of this chapter, or if ambiguity
exists with respect to matters of height, yard, or area requirements, or the
determination of the exact location of zone boundaries, it shall be the duty of
the Commission to ascertain all pertinent facts concerning such use or matter
and, by resolution of record, to set forth its findings and its interpretation.
Such resolution shall be forwarded to the Council for review and determination,
and thereafter the administrative interpretation fixed by the Council shall
govern the matter until and unless changed by subsequent administrative
interpretation or by an amendment to the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   For the purposes of this section and for determining conditions and
limitations for variances and permits of any kind, the following matters shall
be considered:
   (1)   Technical evidence and scientific means of measurement, where

   The intent and purposes of the Residential Planned Development Zone are as
follows:
   (a)   To provide a means for encouraging creative and innovative
developments that are environmentally pleasing through the application of
imaginative land planning techniques not permitted within other residential
zones by the enforcement of more rigid standards;
   (b)   To assure conformance of the project with the stipulations of the
General Plan with respect to use, density, open space, circulation, public
facilities, and the preservation of natural features, as well as with the
standards, principles, and goals as set forth within the General Plan;
   (c)   To maximize the preservation and development of a natural landscaped
public and private open space areas. Such areas may include, but not be limited
to, scenic easements, historical areas, scenic areas, active and passive
recreational areas, pedestrian ways, equestrian and hiking trails, plazas, and
distinct spatial separations between pedestrian and vehicular areas;
   (d)   To provide for an orderly and cohesive urban growth and physical
development pattern in the City by discouraging fragmentation with unrelated
elements and encouraging the efficient delivery of City services;
   (e)   To encourage the design of all residential planned developments to be
compatible to both existing and potential land uses, including a proper
functional relationship with such adjacent areas;
   (f)   To encourage the optional utilization of the land to provide a degree
of diversity of dwelling unit types, sites, and a range of rents or sales
prices;
   (g)   To relate the residential development to public and private support
services through the submittal of a fiscal impact report (cost-revenue
analysis) to determine the effect on such services and City revenues;
   (h)   To promote an equitable distribution of public facilities by
encouraging developers to provide such facilities as allowed by the Government
Code of the State in order to avoid the overcrowding of existing facilities
used by established residents and provide for a balance of community services;
   (i)   To provide a planning process involving public participation in the
review of residential projects; and
   (j)   To provide the City and developer with reciprocal latitude to consider
alternate standards in return for increased amenities to serve the inhabitants
of the development and surrounding areas.
   The Commission may grant a residential planned development permit for land
in the R-P-D Zone which the Commission finds meets the requirements of this
article. The Commission may impose such additional conditions and requirements
upon a residential planned development permit as the Commission finds are
reasonable and necessary to carry out the purposes and requirements of the R-P-
D zone.

to ensure the public health, safety, and welfare within the R-P-D Zone and to
accomplish the intent and purpose of this article:
   (a)   Construction sequence. The applicant shall submit a construction
sequence for the land covered by the permit showing the order in which
particular structures will be constructed, and, upon the approval of the
sequence, the applicant shall not deviate from such sequence without written
approval by the Community Development Director. At no time shall there be more
than an average of the allowable units per net acre constructed, or under
construction, on the portion of the land which has been developed or is under
development.
   (b)   Parking spaces. The number of parking spaces required shall be based
on the requirements by type of residential development as set forth in Sec.
9-4.2402 of this chapter. The Commission may require additional uncovered
parking spaces when it is found that such parking is necessary for the
development, taking into consideration the availability of on-street parking
facilities in and adjacent to the development. All covered parking shall be
obscured from the public view where visible from perimeter streets by means of
a wall enclosure or landscape screening consisting of dense vegetation and
earth mounding.
   (c)   Open parking areas, driveways, and parking lots. The general
requirements for open parking areas, including driveway and parking lots, shall
be as follows:
   (1)   Size. Each off-street parking space shall be at least nine (9’) feet
by twenty (20’) feet, exclusive of drives and aisles. The twenty (20’) foot
depth may be reduced to eighteen (18’) feet, and bumper stops may be waived;
provided the parking space faces a minimum six (6’) foot wide planter for each
row of parking, and the area of car overhang will not damage or interfere with
plant growth and its irrigation. Concrete bumper guards or wheel stops shall be
provided for all parking spaces where deemed necessary by the Community
Development Director, i.e., to channelize traffic flow, protect structures and
landscaping, and prevent overhang into a pedestrian area, except as otherwise
set forth in this subsection or for parallel parking.
   (2)   Improvements. Improvements shall conform to those requirements set
forth in subsection (1) of subsection (c) of Section
9-4.2404 of Article 24 of this chapter.
   (3)   Driveways.
   (i)   Each entrance and exit to a parking lot shall be constructed and
maintained so that any vehicle entering or leaving the parking lot shall be
clearly visible at a distance of not less than ten (10’) feet to a person
approaching such entrance or exit on any pedestrian walk or footpath.

   (iii)    Appropriate directional signs shall be maintained where needed and
as required by the Community Development Director.
   (iv)   Driveway access to parking spaces for single-family dwellings shall
not be less than ten (10’) feet in width throughout, and turnaround areas may
be used for the required parking spaces.
   (v)   Driveway and vehicular access ways shall have thirty-six (36') feet of
pavement width when:
   (aa)    The design indicates that parallel parking may occur which is
permitted on one side of the driveway only;
   (ab)    A hazardous type of construction is allowed;
   (ac)    Access drives are longer than one hundred fifty (150') feet, or
structures are three (3) stories or more in height and are located on both
sides of the drive; and
   (ad)    It is a main access route through the proposed development, which
route either directly or indirectly services the entire project.
   (vi)   Driveways and vehicular access ways may have thirty (30’) feet of
pavement width when:
   (aa)    The design indicates that perpendicular parking will not allow
parallel parking, and structures are not over two (2) stories in height on both
sides of the access drives;
   (ab)    Structures are not more than two (2) stories in height and have
tuck-under parking on one side of the access drive and a carport or open
parking on the opposite side. All parking shall be perpendicular parking; and
   (ac)    Access driveways are not more than one hundred fifty (150') feet in
length, and structures are not more than three (3) stories in height.
   (vii)    Driveways and vehicular access ways may have twenty-five (25’) feet
of pavement width when the driveways are used strictly for vehicle parking, and
the driveway is not used for direct access to any structure within the project.
All parking shall be perpendicular.
   (4)   General conditions. Access requirements for all residential planned
development permits shall be as follows:
   (i)   At least two (2) different routes of entrance and exit for emergency
vehicles where streets are longer than 800 feet; and
   (ii)   Cul-de-sacs shall be limited to eight hundred (800’) feet in length
and shall be terminated by a turnaround not less than eighty (80’) feet in
diameter, or a hammerhead, or T-shaped turnaround area.
   (5)   Circulation.
   (i)   No parking spaces shall be located so that a vehicle will maneuver
within ten (10’) feet of a vehicular entrance to the property.
   (ii)   A turnaround area shall be provided of at least twenty-five (25’)
feet for ninety (90) degree parking, eighteen (18’) feet for sixty (60) degree
parking, fourteen (14’) feet for forty-five (45) degree parking, and twelve
(12’) feet for thirty (30) degree or parallel parking (provided there are at
least four (4’) feet between each two (2) parallel spaces).
   (iii)    The length of all private driveways connecting with major private
roads and all public streets shall be a minimum of twenty (20’) feet.
   (6)   Landscaping.
   (i)   Five (5%) percent of any open parking and driveway areas containing
parking spaces for at least ten (10) vehicles, and not more than twenty-one
(21) vehicles, shall be landscaped. Ten (10%) percent of any open parking and
driveway areas containing more than twenty-one (21) parking spaces shall be
landscaped. Such landscaped areas shall be distributed through the entire
parking area as required by the Community Development Director. All such
required landscaped areas shall be computed on the basis of the total amount of
parking and driveway areas provided (except spaces provided for enclosed
vehicle storage areas).
   (ii)   Four (4) copies of separate landscape and irrigation plans meeting
the City’s standards shall be submitted, with a landscape plan check fee as
specified in the City’s Master Fee Resolution, to the Community Development
Department and be approved by the Landscape Supervisor before issuance of an
occupancy permit.
   (iii)   Landscape trees shall be selected and planted in such a manner as to
minimize root damage to parking lot hardscape. All trees planted shall be from
the planting pallets contained within the Forestry Master Plan unless another
species is approved by the Community Development Director. Trees known to have
shallow or invasive roots shall not be planted within parking lot areas. Tree
species should be chosen to maximize canopy coverage of parking lot areas.
Trees shall be provided with a minimum four (4’) foot by six (6’) foot planting
hole (six (6’) feet by six (6’) feet preferred) or the largest planting area
possible within any landscape design. In addition, deep root watering methods
shall be designed and incorporated to supply water for parking lot trees and
root guards shall be placed behind any curb in the vicinity of the planted tree
(s).
   (iv)   No approved landscaping shall be removed or tree pruned of live
tissue in any parking lot area without the written authorization of the
Community Development Department upon the submittal of a tree pruning proposal
by a certified arborist or landscape architect. Topping of trees or pruning to
reduce canopy coverage within parking lots is prohibited.
   (v)   Plant material of a drought tolerant nature shall be used to the
greatest extent possible in any parking area landscape design and planting.
   (vi)   Approved landscaping shall be permanently maintained in accordance
with Section
1-6.01(e) of this Code. Any redesign or alteration of an existing project
landscaping shall be subject to approval of the Community Development
Department and shall be accomplished through the filing of a Landscape Plan
Check application, provided such alteration is consistent with all City codes,
policies, and project entitlement conditions.
   (d)   Height, yards, and setbacks.
   (1)   Building height. Refer to Sec.
9-4.2501(a) of this chapter for standards pertaining to building height in the
R-P-D zone.
   (2)   Yards.
   (i)   Front yards. Front yards shall have a minimum of a twenty (20’) foot
setback to all structures when adjacent to any public street, but this may be
reduced to fifteen (15’) feet except where adjacent to primary or secondary
highways and provided the structures are staggered by ten (10’) feet or more.
   (ii)   Side yards.
   (aa)    Apartment dwellings shall have side yards of fifteen (15’) feet or
more, and the sum of the yards to the nearest foot shall equal or exceed thirty
(30’) feet.
   (ab)    Single-family detached dwellings shall have a minimum side yard of
five (5’) feet for one-story walls, or portions thereof, and a minimum of ten
(10’) feet for two (2) story walls, except in the case of zero lot line
dwellings or other types of housing utilizing a wall constructed on the lot
line. Directly opposite side walls shall have a minimum separation of ten (10’)
feet for one-story walls and twenty (20’) feet for two-story walls. Single-
family detached dwellings built as zero lot line dwellings shall have a minimum
side yard as specified in Section
9-4.904(d)(2)(ii)(ad) of this section.
   (ac)    “Townhouse” or “rowhouse” dwellings shall provide a side yard as
required by the Uniform Building Code and by the residential planned
development permit conditions.
   (ad)    Zero lot line dwellings that have no side yard on one side of the
structure shall have a minimum side yard of ten (10’) feet on the opposite side
of the structure. In addition, if the zero lot line dwelling is greater than
one story in height, the second story shall be set back at least ten (10’) feet
from the property line upon which the structure directly abuts.
   (iii)    Rear yards.
   (aa)    Rear yards for multiple-family or townhouse dwellings shall be
specified as part of the residential planned development permit where deemed
necessary by the Commission.
   (ab)    Single-family detached dwellings shall have a minimum rear yard of
at least twenty (20’) feet for one and two (2) story structures, and there
shall be a minimum distance between directly opposite rear walls of at least
forty (40') feet.
   (iv)    Yards: General.
   (aa)    No part of any structure shall be constructed less than twenty
(20’') feet from any property line which is adjacent to a primary or secondary
highway. If such structure exceeds a height of twenty-five (25’) feet, it shall
be set back from the property line an additional five (5’) feet for each ten
(10’) feet in height, or portion thereof, by which such structure exceeds
twenty-five (25’) feet.
   (ab)    For single-family dwellings when walls facing different yards or
walls of different heights are directly opposite, there shall be a minimum
separation of the sum of one-half (1/2) the required distance that each wall
would require if it faced on an identical wall. The walls of structures facing
adjoining undeveloped land (including parks, greenbelts, channels, and the
like) shall have a minimum of fifty (50%) percent of the applicable separation
between opposite wall requirements unless adequate evidence is provided that
future construction will conform to these requirements.
   (ac)    For single-family detached and townhouse dwellings, no accessory
building or covered patio shall be erected closer than five (5’) feet to any
side or rear property line. Such structure shall, however, observe the standard
side yard requirements for corner lots (ten (10’) feet) on the street side. No
covered patio shall cover more than forty (40%) percent of any required rear
yard and no accessory building shall cover more than twenty-five (25%) percent
of any required rear yard.
   (e)   Lot size, usable open space, and recreational requirements.
   (1)   There shall be provided for each single-family detached dwelling on
each lot in a subdivision one thousand (1,000) square feet of usable open
space, as defined in this subsection, plus an additional two hundred (200)
square feet of usable open space for each sleeping room over two (2) in such
dwelling. However, if a dwelling is on a lot contiguous to permanent open space
available to and usable by adjacent owners or the public, the area of required
usable open space may be reduced by not more than twenty-five (25%) percent.
   “Usable open space,” for the purposes of this subsection, shall mean an open
area on each lot for each single-family detached dwelling which is designed and
intended to be used for outdoor living or recreation. An area of usable open
space shall not exceed a grade of ten (10%) percent, shall have a minimum
dimension of at least twenty (20’) feet, and shall be adequately screened from
the view of the general public; provided, however, up to twenty-five (25%)
percent of this requirement may be provided in a side yard with a minimum
dimension of not less than ten (10’) feet for a dwelling facing upon and
orienting to such side yard. “Usable open space” may include private deck areas
or balconies with direct access to the dwelling and a minimum dimension of six
(6’) feet and a minimum area of seventy (70) square feet. “Usable open space”
shall not include any portion of off-street parking spaces, driveways,
turnaround areas, rooftops, required front yards or required side yards on the
street side of a corner lot, covered patio pedestrian access ways between
buildings, or any accessory building except those portions of any accessory
building used for recreational purposes.
   (2)   There shall be an average of five thousand five hundred (5,500) square
feet of lot area of a detached single-family dwelling unit in a residential
planned development subdivision; provided, however, no lot area shall be less
than five thousand (5,000) square feet.
   (3)   Wherever common greenbelts are provided contiguous to or integrated
with lots containing detached single-family dwelling units in a residential
planned development subdivision, such lots may be reduced to a minimum of five
thousand (5,000) square feet without being computed within the average lot size
as set forth in subsection (2) of this subsection. However, such greenbelt
areas shall be:
   (i)   Less than ten (10%) percent grade;
   (ii)   A minimum of five hundred (500) square feet for each contiguous lot;
   (iii)    At least thirty (30’) feet wide; and
   (iv)   In addition to the usable open space requirements for such lot as set
forth in subsection (1) of this subsection.
   (4)   All townhouse ownership units with a density of seven (7) units per
net acre or less shall have a minimum private yard area of four hundred (400)
square feet with a minimum dimension of fifteen (15’) feet and with direct
access to the unit. Townhouse ownership units in excess of the density set
forth in this subsection shall have private yard areas as required by the
residential planned development permit.
   (5)   All apartment units shall have a minimum private patio or balcony area
of one hundred (100) square feet and a minimum dimension of seven (7’) feet and
with direct access to the unit.
   (6)   The provisions of Article 26 of this chapter relating to the
dedication of land, payment of fees, or both, for park and recreational
purposes shall be applicable to land for which R-P-D permits are required. Said
provisions shall serve to supplement the on-site recreational facilities as
required in each R-P-D permit. The applicant is also encouraged to provide on-
site recreational facilities consisting of, but not limited to, those park
elements as described in an adopted Council resolution for granting credit.
   (f)   Space allocation formula. The formula set forth in this subsection is
an evaluative tool to assist in determining the adequacy of space relationships
involving structural covering, paved areas, and the open space system based on
the density category of each project. The definition of the space allocation
components consists of:
   (1)   Structural coverage: all buildings, including carports and garages;
   (2)   Paved areas: driveways and parking areas; and
   (3)   Open space: all greenbelts, private yards, and open areas which are
not less than fifteen (15’) feet in dimension and are not located in the
setback area adjacent to frontage streets that are public rights-of-way.
   The following is a breakdown of the formula which should be used as a
guideline in composing and evaluating the plot plans for each project:
 
                    Structured Coverage Paved Areas Open Space All Other Areas
Low density (0 to
4.5 units per net   40%                 15%         40%        5%
acre)
Medium density (4.5
to 15 units per net 30%                 20%         45%        5%
acre)
High density (15 to
30 units per net    35%                 25%         35%        5%
acre)
 
   (g)   General standards.
   (1)   All new and existing utilities adjacent to or on the subject property
shall be placed underground unless otherwise waived through the approval of an
underground utility waiver application.
   (2)   All oak trees on the subject property shall be preserved in accordance
with Article 42 of this chapter. Such trees shall be integrated within the
landscaping plan, unless otherwise authorized for removal or relocation by an
oak tree permit.
   (3)   The expiration of permits and the time extensions therefor shall be as
set forth in Section
9-4.2811 of Article 28 of this chapter.
   (4)   For townhouse and apartment projects, adequate trash areas shall be
provided and enclosed by a six (6’) foot high decorative block or slumpstone
wall in locations approved by the Community Development Director. Adequate
solid gates and vehicular access to such areas shall be provided. This may be
waived where individual pick-up service to the units is provided.
   (5)   All surface-mounted mechanical equipment, including transformers,
terminal boxes, or meter cabinets, shall be screened by landscaping and/or
treated to match the materials and colors of the surrounding buildings.
   (6)   There shall be no open storage of materials or equipment within the
project area except as approved by each permit.
   (7)   The storage of recreational vehicles within this zone shall only be
permitted subject to the following provisions:
   (i)   Single-family residences. Recreational vehicles may be stored on a lot
occupied by a single- family detached home subject to the provisions of Section
9-4.2503(d). Recreational vehicles may also be stored within a common storage
facility, as provided herein.
   (ii)   Multiple-family residences. Recreational vehicles may only be stored
within an enclosed or covered parking space, or within a common storage
facility, as provided herein.
   (iii)   Common storage facilities. Recreational vehicles may be stored in a
separate common storage facility for a development within the Residential
Planned Development Zone. The storage facilities shall be enclosed with a six
(6') foot or higher decorative block wall with exterior landscaping, and the
location and size shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.
   (iv)   Relationship to prior entitlements. The regulations of this
subsection shall supersede conflicting conditions of any Residential Planned
Development permit granted prior to December 1, 2005, where the conditions may
prohibit the storage of recreational vehicles or restrict the storage to a
greater degree than provided by this section.
   (8)   The Commission may allow minor specified commercial uses, subject to
the approval of a special use permit (within an area covered by the residential
planned development permit) when the Commission finds that:
   (i)   The commercial uses are primarily designed for the use of residents
within the permit area; and
   (ii)   The proposed commercial uses are incidental to, and compatible with,
the nature and type of development proposed for the permit area.
   (9)   Approved landscaping shall be permanently maintained in accordance
with Section
1-6.01(e) of this Code. Any redesign or alteration of an existing project
landscaping shall be subject to approval of the Community Development
Department and shall be accomplished through the filing of a Landscape Plan
Check application, provided such alteration is consistent with all City codes,
polices, and project entitlement conditions.
   (h)   Building expansions and other improvements within existing townhouse,
multi-family condominium, and apartment projects.
   (1)   Proposed expansions and improvements limited to an individual
townhouse or multi-family condominium unit shall be reviewed and processed in
accordance with the provisions of Article 18 (Design Review: Requirements and
Procedure), including the filing of a Precise Plan of Design application where
required by that article. Applications for modifications that deviate from any
development standard shall require the filing and processing of a major
modification application.
   (2)   Proposed expansions and improvements that involve more than one
individual townhouse or multi-family condominium unit, or that involve the
common area of a townhouse or condominium project, or that involve improvements
or expansions at an apartment building or project shall be processed as a
modification to the underlying Residential Planned Development permit.
Applications for said modifications may be processed as minor modifications
where they comply with all the conditions and limitations set forth in this
chapter and the guidelines and standards adopted pursuant to Section
9-4.1806 of this chapter. In other cases, filing and processing of a major
modification application is required.

Sec. 9-4.905. Residential planned development permits (R-P-D).
   (a)   The pre-application program provides an opportunity to establish a
working relationship between the City staff and prospective applicants prior to
filing a formal development request. A basic purpose for this procedure is to
provide the staff the opportunity to inform the applicant’s design team
regarding the City’s development policies, Code requirements, and other
pertinent information which may affect the proposal during the early inception
stages of a project. External relationships, including parks, schools, and
major streets, will also be discussed. The steps of the preapplication program
are as follows:
   (1)   The prospective applicant may request a work session involving the
City staff to discuss the project’s conceptual design elements and the property
owners’ development objectives prior to preparing specific project plans.
   (2)   A preapplication session shall be required prior to filing the request
in order to inform the prospective applicant regarding certain requirements
before substantial expense in preparing the detailed plans is incurred and to
avoid processing delays. Materials for the work session should include, but not
be limited to, the following:
   (i)   A conceptual site plan drawn to scale, including the location and
description of all the physical and natural elements within the project area.
The relationship to surrounding properties and public facilities shall also be
defined; and
   (ii)   The architectural theme and the project’s overall design
characteristics shall also be identified on conceptual elevation plans and
shall include specific exterior features.
   The substance of the project details shown on these conceptual site and
elevation plans will have a direct bearing on the amount of City staff input
and guidance. It is, therefore, encouraged that the prospective applicant
provide the staff with as much detailed information as possible.
   (b)   Applications for the approval of construction plans for four (4) or
fewer single-family detached dwellings within the R-P-D Zone may be processed
as an administrative approval. Applications for all other uses permitted in the
R-P-D Zone shall require an application to the Commission for a residential
planned development permit. Applications for administrative approvals and
residential planned development permits under this subsection shall be
submitted in the manner set forth in Article 28 of this chapter provided there
will not be more than an average of the number of dwelling units per net acre
as specified by the applicable R-P-D sub-zone.
   (c)   The applicant shall submit to the Commission complete development
plans showing the proposed uses for the property, including the dimensions and
locations of all proposed structures, parking spaces, streets, parks,
playgrounds, school sites, and open spaces, and such additional information as
may be requested by the Commission.
   (d)   The applicant shall submit a fiscal impact report for all residential
planned development permits, the contents of which are set forth in this
subsection. At the discretion of the Community Development Director, any of the
following reports required to be submitted pursuant to the provisions of this
section may be waived or the required content reduced if the reports would not
be necessary in view of existing adequate capacity and the close proximity of
urban services and facilities:
   (1)   Reports that describe the existing systems, community facilities, and
services, to include: the vehicular circulation system, the sewer and water
supply system; the flood control system; community facilities, i.e., schools,
parks and recreation, open space, etc., and community services; i.e., police
protection, fire protection, etc.
   The reports for such systems, community facilities, and services shall
state: the name of the responsible agency; the present capacity of the system;
the present amount of demand or use of the system; the programmed additions of
capacity; and the anticipated load resulting from the proposed development;
   (2)   Reports that describe the proposed systems, community facilities and
services to be constructed and/or operated by the applicant. The reports for
such systems, facilities, and services shall state: the name of the agency
which will assume responsibility; the proposed capacity of the system; and the
projected demand which is anticipated at the completion of the entire
development;
   (3)   Reports that describe the total number of dwelling units and the
percent of proposed dwelling units that are within each residential density
category. Such reports shall identify and describe the potential assessed value
as applied to the percentages of the proposed dwelling units that are within
each density category. From this the applicant will derive the projected
population of the proposed development by the proposed density categories and
will project the general socioeconomic characteristics of the proposed new
residents, i.e., the number of persons per dwelling unit, the number of school-
aged children per dwelling unit, the average income, etc.; and
   (4)   Reports that describe the cost/revenue relationship for the existing
and proposed public utilities, i.e., sewer and water, schools, community
facilities and services, special districts, and service areas.
   (e)   The applicant shall submit evidence showing that the proposed
development is designed to be consistent with the provisions of Section
9-4.901 of this article.

Sec. 9-4.907. Density transfer considerations (R-P-D).
   The transfer of density within the confines of a residential planned
development permit area shall be subject to review by the Commission to
determine the appropriateness of transferring density from hillside terrain
over ten (10%) percent slope to more developable land. The Commission shall
find, before approving a residential planned development permit involving
density transfer, that such a transfer of density is substantially in
compliance with all the following criteria:
   (a)   That the proposed plot plan density is in compliance with the
provisions of the General Plan;
   (b)   That the design and improvement of the proposed project is in
compliance with the General Plan;
   (c)   That the site is physically suitable for the type of development;
   (d)   That the site is physically suitable to tolerate the proposed density
of the development; and
   (e)   That the design of the proposed project and the improvement will not
cause substantial environmental damage.
(§ 1, Ord. 459-NS, eff. July 4, 1974)
Sec. 9-4.908. Residential planned development permits: Lands designated  SP (R-
P-D).
   Applicants for permits for lands zoned RPD-SP shall follow and be subject to
an approved specific plan and, except as provided in this section as follows,
shall be subject to all the other provisions governing the R-P-D Zones:
   (a)   No R-P-D permit shall be issued upon any portion of land zoned R-P-
D with an "SP" designation until there has been submitted to the Commission a
specific plan of the entire area, showing the proposed densities and the open
space or park areas for all portions of such land, and the specific plan is
approved by the Council.

acre.
   (a)   The standards referred to in subsection (b) may be applied to R-P-
D Zones for construction of detached dwelling units on land zoned at a density
greater than R-P-D four and one-half (4.5) dwelling units per net acre in “in-
fill” areas, which are defined as being substantially surrounded by existing or
approved development, to: (1) provide for more efficient land utilization for
startup and retirement families, (2) substitute for single-family and
multifamily attached dwelling units, (3) improve housing product with smaller
lot sizes for variety within the City, (4) enhance streetscape variety within
the City, (5) provide housing with less exterior yard maintenance and
maintenance cost, (6) facilitate clustered development with greater expansion
of common open space areas, (7) avoid the cost and added regulations by a
homeowners association or condominium restrictions, and (8) simplify insurance
requirements for homeowners.
   (b)   Reduced building setbacks, reduced driveway lengths, reduced guest
parking, smaller lot sizes, reduced useable private open space, greater
building heights but limited to two stories and different configurations of
single-family detached dwelling units may be considered on property zoned for
single-family attached and multi-family projects with an R-P-D sub-zone or
Specific Plan designation with a density greater than four and one-half (4.5)
dwelling units per net acre in “in-fill” areas. The development standards for
such single-family detached projects shall be as established by the Planning
Commission, with findings of justification for any modification from current R-
P-D standards in conjunction with the approval of the R-P-D permit and the
permit will comply with the intent and purpose of the R-P-D Zone and this
section.

Sec. 9-4.1004. Residential planned development permits (R-3).
   In order to provide a method whereby land in the R-3 Zone may be designed
and developed as a unit for residential uses by taking advantage of modern site
planning techniques, and in order to produce an environment of stable,
desirable character which will be in harmony with the existing or potential
development of the surrounding neighborhood, and in order to produce
development which meet standards of open space, light, air, pedestrian and
vehicular circulation, and maximum density of dwelling units, the Commission
may grant a residential planned development permit for land in the R-3 Zone
which the Commission finds meets the requirements of this section. The
residential planned development permit may modify the requirements of Articles
22 and 24 of this chapter, which would otherwise be applicable to land in R-
3 Zones, in the manner and to the extent set forth in this section. The
Commission may impose such additional conditions and requirements upon a
residential planned development permit as the Commission finds are reasonable
and necessary to carry out the purposes and requirements of this section.
   (a)   The applicant may submit to the Commission an application for a
residential planned development permit pursuant to the provisions of this
section in the manner set forth in Article 27 of this chapter.
   (b)   The applicant shall submit to the Commission complete development
plans showing the proposed uses for the property, including dimensions and
locations of all proposed structures, parking spaces, streets, parks,
playgrounds, school sites, and open spaces, and such additional information as
may be requested by the Commission or may be pertinent to a determination that
contemplated uses shall be allowed pursuant to the provisions of this section
rather than the provisions otherwise applicable to R-3 property.
   (c)   The applicant shall submit evidence showing that the proposed
development is designed to produce an environment of stable and desirable
character and that areas of open space and parking and recreational facilities
are consistent with the anticipated population of the development.
   (d)   The Commission may allow, within an area covered by the permit
referred to in this section, minor specified commercial uses when the
Commission finds:
   (1)   The commercial uses are designed for the sole use of residents within
the permit area; and
   (2)   The proposed commercial uses are incidental to, and compatible with,
the nature and type of development proposed for the permit area and shall be
confined within the units of the development.
   (e)   Each residential planned development permit shall contain the
following conditions and such other conditions deemed by the Commission to be
reasonably necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section:
   (1)   The land shall be developed with a maximum average density of not more
than thirty (30) units per acre of land covered by the permit.
   (2)   The applicant shall submit a construction sequence for the land
covered by the permit showing the order in which particular structures will be
constructed, and, upon approval of the sequence, the applicant shall not
deviate from such sequence without written approval by the Community
Development Director. At no time shall there be more than an average of thirty
(30) units per acre constructed, or under construction, on the portion of the
land covered by the permit, which land has been developed or is under
development.
   (3)   Unless otherwise authorized by the Commission, no part of any
structure shall be constructed less than twenty (20’) feet from any property
line which is adjacent to a perimeter street. If part of any structure exceeds
a height of twenty-five (25’) feet, such part shall be set back from the
property line an additional five (5’) feet for each ten (10’) feet in height,
or portion thereof, by which such part of any structure exceeds twenty-five
(25’) feet.
   (4)   Parking shall be provided in accordance with Article 24 of this
chapter.
   (5)   Landscape trees shall be selected and planted in such a manner as to
minimize root damage to parking lot hardscape. All trees planted shall be from
the planting pallets contained within the Forestry Master Plan unless another
species is approved by the Community Development Director. Trees known to have
shallow or evasive roots shall not be planted within parking lot areas. Tree
species should be chosen to maximize canopy coverage of parking lot areas.
Trees shall be provided with a minimum four (4’) foot by six (6’) foot planting
hole (six (6’) feet by six (6’) feet preferred) or the largest planting area
possible within any landscape design. In addition, deep root watering methods
shall be designed and incorporated to supply water for parking lot trees and
root guards shall be placed behind any curb in the vicinity of the planted tree
(s).
   (6)   No approved landscaping shall be removed or pruned of live tissue in
any parking lot area without the written authorization of the Community
Development Department upon the submittal of a tree pruning proposal by a
certified arborist or landscape architect. Topping of trees or pruning to
reduce canopy coverage within parking lots is prohibited.
   (7)   Plant material of a drought-tolerant nature shall be used to the
greatest extent possible in any parking area landscape design and planting.
   (8)   Approved landscaping shall be permanently maintained in accordance
with Section
1-6.01(e) of this Code. Any redesign or alteration of an existing project
landscaping shall be subject to approval of the Community Development
Department and shall be accomplished through the filing of a Landscape Plan
Check application, provided such alteration is consistent with all City codes,
policies, and project entitlement conditions.
   (f)   The provisions of Articles 24 and 25 of this chapter shall not be
applicable to land for which a residential planned development permit has been
granted so long as such land is developed and maintained in accordance with the
provisions of this section and all the conditions of the permit.
   (g)   The provisions of Article 26 of this chapter relating to the
dedication of land, payment of fees, or both for park and recreational purposes
shall be applicable to land for which R-P-D permits are required.
   (h)   Refer to Section
9-4.904(h) of this article for regulations regarding building modifications and
expansions within existing multi-family apartment projects.

   The MU or Mixed-Use Zone and the MUOZ or Mixed-Use Overlay Zone are intended
to provide a method by which land located in the zone may be designed and
developed for both commercial and residential uses compatible and harmonious
with the existing or potential development of adjacent areas. This zone will be
implemented on all parcels designated as Mixed-Use per the zoning map. For
areas where there is an existing specific plan, the Mixed-Use Zone is applied
as a Mixed-Use Overlay Zone (MUOZ). The Mixed-Use Overlay Zone standards
supersede the specific plan standards. The specific plan standards still apply
except where specifically modified by the Mixed-Use Overlay Zone.

an integrated unit using modern site planning techniques. The primary tenants
will usually be one or more major department stores, and the center will offer
convenience goods and a full range of shopping goods and services with wide
selections in many categories. Shopping centers of this size will be designated
and located so as to minimize traffic congestion on public highways and streets
in the vicinity and to best fit the general land use pattern of the area to be
served.

Article 18. Design Review: Requirements and Procedure*
*   Article 18 entitled “Precise Plans of Design: Requirements and Procedures,”
consisting of §§ 9-4.1801–9-4.1808 codified from Ordinance No. 107-NS, as
renumbered by Ordinance No. 173-NS and amended by Ordinance Nos. 142-NS, 385-NS
and 713-NS, was amended in its entirety by Section 1, Ordinance No. 1177-NS,
eff. April 27, 1993.
Sec. 9-4.1800. Purpose.
   It is hereby found and declared that the City and the larger community of
the Conejo Valley is situated in a unique natural setting of rolling hills,
mountains, open space and natural scenic beauty; that the retention of this
natural setting must be fostered while recognizing that this unique historic
and scenic environment will be a catalyst for attracting a variety of new
developments and encouraging upgrading of existing projects; that the design of
these new projects needs to take into consideration this natural setting, the
relationship to nearby development and a desired semi-rural environment,
particularly along freeway corridors and major highways; that new or modified
buildings or parking structures should be visually and functionally compatible
yet distinctive within a nearby development area and, in the development of
single-family residential homes, to achieve compatibility and to preserve the
character and permanency of desirable nearby residential development area
without physical and visual over intensification on established lots; that
developing and maintaining an appropriate appearance of all sections within the
City is necessary to uphold and enhance its economic position within the region
in order to stabilize, protect and maintain property values, retain
environmentally sensitive and natural open space areas, promote trade and
commerce, and to ensure a continued managed growth in accordance with the
adopted General Plan and to retain the well-being of its economy and its
people.
   While encouraging quality and creative architectural and landscaping designs
and without depriving a property owner of any authorized uses of property, the
development and architectural design of buildings and structures in the City
shall comply with the architectural design guidelines adopted by resolution of
the City Council. The intent of the guidelines is to encourage architectural
creativity and to be used as standards for design, construction and development
to ensure that the aesthetic environment of the City will become culturally
matured and will have a material or substantially beneficial effect upon the
historic, economic, social and cultural well-being and development of the
community or the peace, health, safety, and general economic welfare of its
inhabitants.
(§ 1, Ord. 1177-NS, eff. April 27, 1993)
Sec. 9-4.1801. Architectural design review required.
   (a)   No person shall erect any structure, and no permit or zone clearance
shall be issued for any new structure or for any exterior modification of a
structure unless and until an architectural design review is first conducted in
accordance with this article and approval of the design is obtained. It shall
be unlawful for any person to proceed with the construction or exterior
modification of any structure without first obtaining such approval and
complying with all of the terms and conditions thereof.
   (b)   Architectural design review and approval is required in connection
with any application for, or modification of, a development permit, residential
planned development permit, trailer park development permit, planned
development permit, special use permit, hillside planned development permit, or
any similar entitlement required by this chapter, and which would authorize the
construction or modification of a structure, except for single-family
subdivisions and individual townhome and condominium units where architectural
design review shall be conducted in conjunction with the submittal of a minor
modification or precise plan of design application.
   (c)   If the property is located within a subdivision governed by CC&R's
which require approval of modifications to the property by a Property Owners
Association or other private entity, the property owner(s) are advised to
obtain appropriate approvals prior to submitting an application to the City.
Project approvals by the City do not constitute compliance with any applicable
CC&R.

application pursuant to Section
9-4.1801(b) of this article, the hearing body or officer reviewing the
underlying application shall include architectural design review in the review
and decision on said application. In rendering a decision, said hearing body or
officer shall consider:
   (1)   The Architectural Design Review Guidelines and standards adopted
pursuant to Section
9-4.1806 of this article; and
   (2)   The design review criteria set forth in Section

9-4.2804 of this chapter, unless any of the following conditions apply, in
which case the precise plan of design application shall be referred directly to
the Planning Commission:
   (1)   For existing single family detached homes located in developments that
are exclusively single-story per the original tract entitlements:
   (i)   Two-story additions;
   (ii)   Demolition and rebuilding of a single family detached home exceeding
one hundred fifty (150%) percent of the original building footprint.
   (2)   For existing single family detached homes located in developments that
are a mix of single-story and two or more story homes per the original
entitlements:
   (i)   Two-story additions or second floor additions, where the added floor
area exceeds fifty (50%) percent of the original building footprint;
   (ii)   Demolition and rebuilding of a single family detached home where
either the total floor area exceeds one hundred fifty (150%) percent of the
original building floor area, or where the second story floor area exceeds
seventy-five (75%) percent of the original building footprint.
   (c)   Precedent-setting issues. If, in the opinion of the Community
Development Director or the Director’s designee, the precise plan of design
application presents potentially precedent-setting issues, the Director shall
schedule the application for a public hearing before the Planning Commission.
Hearing and appeal requirements shall be as provided in Article 28 of this
chapter, and notice shall be given as required by Chapter 12 of this title.
   (d)   Planning Commission hearings required. Whenever a precise plan of
design is reviewed as part of the application for another permit requires a
public hearing to be held prior to approval, or is otherwise reviewed by the
Planning Commission, whether on original jurisdiction or appeal, a public
hearing shall be held to review the precise plan of design application. Hearing
and appeal requirements shall be as provided in Article 28 of this chapter, and
notice of said hearing shall be given in the manner required by Chapter 12 of
this title.
   (e)   Conduct of hearings and findings. The decision-making officer or body
shall review the precise plan of design to ensure that the functional
arrangement and the general appearance of the structure(s) conform to the
intent and requirements of this article. The decision-maker may approve,
conditionally approve, or deny the precise plan. A precise plan of design shall
be denied if any one of the following findings are made:
   (1)   The design would be substantially and materially incompatible or out
of scale with the natural environment and surrounding properties; or
   (2)   The design would deter an orderly and attractive development of the
community in general and surrounding property in particular; or
   (3)   The design would otherwise adversely affect the public peace, safety,
or general economic welfare; or
   (4)   The design would not materially comply with the adopted architectural
design guidelines and standards.
   (5)   The design would not be compatible with neighboring properties to
ensure a minimal loss of privacy and visual impact on adjacent properties where
reasonable designs have not been explored to allow for solar access to adjacent
gardens, patios, pools or rooms and where privacy of neighboring properties has
been substantially compromised without careful positioning and/or limitation of
the size, mass and height of the new construction.

consisting of Sections 9-4.1901 through 9-4.1919, recodified from Sections
8139.1 through 8139.20, T.O.O.C., as added by Ordinance No. 93, as renumbered

Sec. 9-4.1901. Purpose and intent.
   The conversion of rental apartments or mobile home parks to ownership status
and the change of use of mobile home parks impacts the supply and availability
of rental housing, and may cause displacement of residents, particularly
seniors and families with children who may be required to move from the
community due to lack of replacement housing. A reduction in the supply of
rental housing creates pressure for higher rents in the remaining rental
housing. However, conversions may sometimes provide unique opportunities for
lower income households to purchase their own homes.
   The City seeks to avoid the problems that beset condominium conversion
projects, and to assure a reasonable balance of rental and ownership housing
and a variety of individual choices of tenure, type, price, and location of
housing and to maintain a supply of rental housing for low and moderate income
persons and families.
   The City finds that the unique problems and opportunities presented by the
conversions of existing residential rental housing units and rental mobile home
parks to ownership status and the change of use of rental mobile home parks to
other uses require special considerations pursuant to this article.

Sec. 9-4.1902. Definitions.
   For the purpose of this article, unless otherwise apparent from the context,
the following definitions are provided:
   (a)   “Community apartment project” shall mean a project in which an
undivided interest in the land is coupled with the right of exclusive occupancy
of any apartment located thereon.
   (b)   “Condominium” shall mean an estate in real property consisting of a
separate interest in a dwelling unit together with an undivided interest in the
balance of the property (land and improvements) which is owned in common by the
owners of the individual dwelling units.
   (c)   “Condominium conversion” shall mean the conversion or division of a
single-ownership parcel with a building or buildings containing two or more
existing dwellings (such as an apartment building) into a condominium,
community apartment project, or stock cooperative project form of ownership
involving separate ownership or permanent right of exclusive use of individual
dwelling units. Condominium conversion does not include conversion of a rental
mobile home park into a mobile home park subdivision.
   (d)   “Condominium conversion project” shall mean the entire parcel of real
property subject to condominium conversion including all structures thereon or
appurtenant thereto.
   (e)   “Mobile home” shall mean a structure, as defined under California
Civil Code Section 798.3, designed for human habitation as a dwelling and
transport over streets and highways under permit in accordance with the
California Vehicle Code. This term shall include “manufactured homes” as
defined in the Health and Safety Code Section 18007. A recreational vehicle
shall not be considered to be a mobile home unless it has been manufactured
with plumbing, heating and electrical systems for human habitation and it
occupies a mobile home site in a mobile home park where that recreational
vehicle is permitted to be used as a permanent residence in accordance with
Civil Code Section 798.3(b). The term mobile home shall not include a
commercial coach as defined by Health and Safety Code Section 18010 or factory-
built housing as defined by Health and Safety Code Section 19971.
   (f)   “Mobile home park” or “park” shall mean an area of land where two or
more mobile home sites are rented, or held out for rent, to accommodate mobile
homes used for human habitation. This term shall include “trailer park.”
   (g)   “Mobile home park change of use” shall mean closure, cessation or
change of use of a mobile home park to another use either as to an entire
mobile home park or more than ten (10) percent of the mobile home spaces
therein. However, the Community Development Director may find that a mobile
home park change of use has not occurred if he or she determines that park
management is making a good faith effort to lease the spaces that are
unoccupied by mobile homes to mobile home owners. A mobile home park change of
use does not include closure due to physical destruction by fire, flood or
other disaster, conversion of a mobile home park to a mobile home park
subdivision, closure of a mobile home park as a result of an adjudication of
bankruptcy, nor the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a park rule or
regulation.
   (h)   “Mobile home park subdivision” shall mean a division of land for the
purpose of converting a rental mobile home park to ownership status. Mobile
home park subdivisions include developments in which each mobile home owner
receives title to the individual space where his or her mobile home is located,
together with an undivided interest in the common areas of the park. The term
mobile home park subdivision also includes stock cooperative projects where
each mobile home owner receives an exclusive right to occupy, but not title to,
his or her individual mobile home space, together with an undivided interest in
the common areas of the park.
   (i)   “Stock cooperative project” shall mean a project wherein a corporation
is formed or availed primarily for the purpose of holding title to an apartment
project or mobile home park, if all, or substantially all, of the shareholders
of such corporation receive a right of exclusive occupancy in a dwelling unit
or mobile home space in the project, title to which is held by the corporation,
which right of occupancy is transferable only concurrently with the transfer of
shares of stock in the corporation held by the person having such right of
occupancy.

be approved. City staff shall conduct a preapplication work session with the
applicant to discuss the City’s requirements and the project’s ultimate impact
on the residential housing stock of the City prior to the preparation of plans
and/or tentative tract maps in order to avoid the possible expenditure of
substantial energy and expense in a manner not consistent with the guidelines
for such projects, and also to allow the applicant to make changes, at an early
stage, prior to the preparation and filing of entitlement applications.
   (b)   Application requirements in general. After completion of the required
preapplication review, an applicant for a condominium conversion, mobile home
park subdivision or mobile home park change of use may file the necessary
entitlement application(s) for the specific action sought. Said entitlement
requests may include a tentative tract map, residential planned development
permit (or major modification thereto), trailer park development permit (or

   (d)   Required findings of fact. In addition to the other findings required
by this Code, the decision-making body shall make the following affirmative
findings prior to the approval of a condominium conversion project:
   (1)   That the proposed project would not adversely affect the supply and

determination that the current vacancy rate for rental units within the City is
not less than five (5%) percent, as determined by the most recent Community

the City; or that mitigating circumstances exist which justify approval of the
condominium conversion when the vacancy rate is lower than five (5%) percent.
In addition to other mitigating circumstances that may be found, this
determination must also be based on at least one of the following two findings:
   (i)   That new rental units are to be constructed which will replace those
to be converted. The number of replacement units will equal or exceed the
number of units proposed to be converted. Replacement units will be completed
and occupancy permits issued prior to recordation of the final map for the

providing a substantial percentage of its units at affordable prices and the
provision of such housing opportunities outweighs any loss of rental units.

assistance to households displaced by the condominium conversion; and
   (3)   That the proposed condominium conversion complies with the
requirements of the Thousand Oaks Municipal Code.

such relocation assistance shall be applied as a credit to the cost of the
unit.
   (12)   The applicant shall offer a lifetime lease to households in which the
head of household or spouse is sixty-two (62) years of age or older at the time

Superior Court Case No. 56-2008-00328552 (7-13-2009), a ruling was issued which
invalidated the bracketed language found in the foregoing § 9-4.1905.
Sec. 9-4.1906. Mobile home park change of use.
   (a)   No mobile home park shall be closed and cease to operate and no
application or permit necessary for a mobile home park change of use shall be
approved, without first obtaining approval of an Impact Report as described in
this section and in Section 65863.7 of the Government Code.
   (b)   Within ninety (90) days before a mobile home park change of use
occurs, as defined in Section
9-4.1902 (g), park management shall provide written notification to the
Community Development Director and shall either file an Impact Report as
described in Section
9-4.1906 (c)(3) or shall petition the Community Development Director to make a
finding that a change of use is not occurring because park management is making
a good faith effort to lease the spaces that are unoccupied by mobile homes to
mobile home owners.
   (c)   Application Requirements. The application necessary for a mobile home
park change of use shall include the following:
   (1)   Certification that residents and mobile home owners have been notified
of the proposed change of use in accordance with Civil Code Section 798.56 (g)
(1). Certification shall consist of a letter signed by the applicant certifying
that the required notice has been given and when the notice was given, with a
copy of the written notice attached.
   (2)   A certified list of the names and addresses of all tenants residing in
the mobile home park and where applicable, nonresident mobile home owners,
complete as of the time the application is filed. The names and addresses shall
also be provided in a digital file to facilitate mailing of public hearing
notices.
   (3)    An Impact Report as required under Section 65863.7 of the California
Government Code, which shall include the following:
   (i)   The names and addresses of all resident mobile home owners, absentee
mobile home owners and residents who are not mobile home owners; the length of
time each space has been occupied by the current mobile home, mobile home owner
and resident; the age, size and type of each mobile home; and the current
monthly rent charged for each mobile home space.
   (ii)   An evaluation of the availability of adequate replacement housing in
mobile home parks within twenty (20) miles of the proposed change of use. The
evaluation shall include the name of each park surveyed and whether or not
there are spaces available for relocation. If there are spaces available in a
particular park, then the evaluation shall include, but not be limited to, a
location map of the mobile home parks and a comparison between those parks and
the park proposed for a change of use. At a minimum, the evaluation shall
address the following factors: distance from the park proposed for a change of
use, park amenities, space availability, rent and rent control requirements,
park restrictions with respect to mobile home size, age, condition or other
factors, security deposit requirements, utility connection charges, resident
restrictions and any other factors that affect the feasibility of relocation.
   (iii)   Itemized estimates of the costs of relocating each mobile home and
mobile home resident to a mobile home park within twenty (20) miles, including
relocation of the mobile home and associated accessories and relocation of the
residents and their possessions. Relocation costs include at a minimum the
costs of disassembly, removal, transportation and reinstallation at the new
site, including replacement or reconstruction of blocks, skirting, siding,
porches, decks, awnings or earthquake bracing, if necessitated by the
relocation. Relocation costs also include payment of insurance for potential
damage to personal property caused by the relocation, reasonable living
expenses of displaced mobile home park residents from the date of actual
displacement until occupancy at the new park, any security deposit required at
the new park, utility connection changes and the difference between the rent
paid at the existing park and any higher rent at the new park during the first
twenty-four (24) months of tenancy at the new park.
   (iv)   A list of the mobile homes proposed for relocation to a mobile home
park within twenty (20) miles of the change of use and the mobile homes that
are not proposed for relocation together with an explanation why each home is
or is not proposed for relocation.
   [(v)   An estimate of the in-place market value of each mobile home not
proposed for relocation or later found to be not eligible for relocation, in
its current location, assuming the continued operation of the mobile home park
in a safe, sanitary and well-maintained condition and an explanation of the
basis used for estimating the in-place market value of each mobile home.]**
   (vi)   A "Relocation Assistance and Mitigation Plan" which shall include a
timetable for physically relocating each mobile home and a proposal for payment
of relocation assistance and measures to mitigate the impacts of the change of
use pursuant to Section
9-4.1906 (d).
   (4)   The nomination of a Relocation Counselor to be approved and contracted
by the City of Thousand Oaks, paid for by Applicant, with expertise in
assisting individuals and families in matters of forced relocation.
   (d)   In approving an Impact Report, the decision-making body shall impose
measures as conditions of approval to mitigate the adverse impacts of the
change of use on mobile home owners and residents in the mobile home park. The
specific conditions of approval of a particular application shall be determined
on an application-by-application basis with regard to the facts and
circumstances of the park subject to the change of use and all of the
information contained in the application, and as suggested by the Relocation
Counselor, but shall not exceed the reasonable cost of relocation. The
"reasonable cost of relocation" shall be defined as not less than as set forth
below in (d)(1), following; or, in the event no mobile home park within twenty
(20) miles of the current mobile home site of the tenant proposed to be
displaced is willing to accept the tenant's mobile home, or the mobile home is
not capable of being moved and replaced functionally intact, a combined total
of the consideration set forth below in (d)(2), (3), (4) and (5):
   (1)    Payment of the cost of relocating each mobile home to another mobile
home park within twenty (20) miles of the change of use, including any
combination of the costs of relocation described in Section
9-4.1906(c)(3)(iii);
   [(2)   Payment of a lump sum equal to the in-place market value of each
mobile home in its current location, based upon the assumption that the mobile
home park will continue operation in a safe, sanitary and well-maintained
condition regardless of actual plans;]**
   (3)   Payment of a lump sum equal to the costs of moving displaced mobile
home park residents to alternative housing;
   (4)   Payment of a lump sum equal to the first and last month rent and any
security deposit in alternative rental housing for displaced mobile home park
residents.
   [(5)   In no case shall any "cost of relocation" be less than that which
would be required under the California Relocation Assistance Law, California
Government Code § 7260, et seq., as if the project were deemed to be caused by
State action.]**
   (6)   Should there be any disagreement regarding the value to be paid under
any of the provisions of this measure, the parties shall forthwith arbitrate
said matter before the City's Rent Stabilization Board, which decision shall be
final, subject only to reversal by a trial de novo in the Superior Court.
Should the party demanding a trial de novo not receive a more favorable
determination from the Superior Court than that provided by the Rent
Stabilization Board, then that party shall pay the other party his/her/its
costs, including reasonable attorney fees.
   (7)   Once the reasonable cost of relocation has been paid, Tenant shall be
relieved of any cost related to the removal of Tenant's mobile home from
Applicant's property. No tenant shall be required to vacate any mobile home
park until all payments required hereunder have been paid.
   (e)   The applicant and any mobile home owner or resident in the mobile home
park may agree to a mutually satisfactory relocation assistance and mitigation
program. To be valid, such agreement shall be in writing in the form and
content required by applicable state law and shall include the following:
   (1)   A provision stating that the tenant is aware of the provisions of this
Section
9-4.1906;
   (2)   A copy of this Section
9-4.1906 as an attachment; and
   (3)   A provision in at least twelve (12) -point type that clearly informs
the tenant of the right to seek the advice of an attorney prior to signing the
agreement.
   (f)   Relocation Assistance Adjustment.
   (1)   Any person who files an application for a mobile home park change of
use may simultaneously request an adjustment to the relocation assistance
obligations that could otherwise be required as mitigation for the impacts on
displaced mobile home owners and residents in accordance with Section
9-4.1906(d).
   (2)   If an adjustment to the relocation assistance obligations is
requested, the Impact Report described in Section
9-4.1906(c)(3) shall also include all of the following:
   (i)   A statement that the applicant is requesting an adjustment to the
relocation assistance obligations that could otherwise be required in
accordance Section
9-4.1906(d);
   (ii)   An estimate of the total cost of the relocation assistance
obligations that could be required in accordance Section
9-4.1906(d);
   (iii)   A report prepared by an expert such as a real estate financing and
development consultant substantiating why the relocation assistance obligations
would result in a take of property in violation of the United States or
California Constitutions and, if so, the minimum extent that such obligations
would have to be adjusted to prevent a taking of property;
   (iv) Such other information that the applicant believes to be pertinent, or
which may be required by the Community Development Director.
   (3)   The decision-making body may consider an application for a Relocation
Assistance Adjustment only for one (1) or both of the following reasons:
   (i)   That the requirement for relocation assistance would eliminate
substantially all reasonable use or economic value of the property. Such
justification may only be established if it is demonstrated that the imposition
of the relocation requirements would prevent the reasonable use or economic
value of the property for other, alternate uses and that the continued use of
the property as a mobile home park is not a reasonable economic use of the
property.
   (ii)   That a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that the mobile
home park closure or cessation of use of the property as a mobile home park is
necessary, and that such court has taken further action that would prohibit or
preclude the payment of relocation assistance benefits. Notwithstanding this
provision, the Land Use designations and zoning would remain in place, subject
to a vote of the citizens of Thousand Oaks.
   (g)   Special notice requirements.
   (1)   At least thirty (30) days prior to a hearing or any other action on
any entitlement application for a mobile home park change of use, or any
hearing on an Impact Report, the City shall inform the applicant in writing of
the provisions of Section 798.56 of the Civil Code and all applicable local
requirements which impose a duty on the applicant to notify residents and
mobile home owners of the proposed change of use and shall specify the manner
in which the applicant shall verify that residents and mobile home owners have
been notified of the proposed change of use. No hearing or other action shall
be taken on any entitlement application for a mobile home park change of use or
Impact Report until the applicant has verified to the satisfaction of the City
that the residents and mobile home owners have been adequately notified.
   (2)   At least thirty (30) days prior to the Planning Commission hearing on
an Impact Report, the applicant shall provide written notice to the residents
of the park that the applicant will be appearing before the Planning Commission
to request permission or permits for a change of use and provide a copy of the
Impact Report described in Section
9-4.1906(c)(3) to the residents of the mobile home park with notice of the
hearing date.
   (3)   In addition to other public hearing notice requirements, the City
shall mail written notices of a public hearing on any applications related to a
mobile home park change of use to all tenants residing within the affected
mobile home park and all non-resident owners of mobile homes within the
affected mobile home park.
   (h)   Required findings of fact. The decision- making body shall make the
following affirmative findings prior to approving or recommending approval of
an Impact Report:
   (1)   That the Impact Report, as approved, is adequate and contains
reasonable measures for mitigating the impact of the change of use on displaced
mobile home owners and residents.
   (2)   That the Impact Report, as approved, complies with the requirements of
the Thousand Oaks Municipal Code.
   (i)   Conditions of approval.
   (1)   All of the mitigation measures imposed herein shall be performed prior
to actual change of use of the mobile home park.
   (2)   No mobile home or mobile home resident shall be required to vacate a
mobile home park until all of the mitigation measures applicable to that mobile
home and resident set forth in the approved Impact Report have been completed.
   [(3)   After approval of a mobile home park change of use Impact Report,
management of the park shall provide each mobile home owner twenty-four (24)
months or more written notice of termination of tenancy and a copy of the
approved Impact Report.]*
   (4)   No grading permit or building permit shall be issued unless the
mitigation measures as described in the approved Impact Report have been
completed for every mobile home in the park.
   (5)   As a condition of approval of an Impact Report for a mobile home park
change of use, the owners of the mobile home park shall enter into a written
agreement with the City to ensure compliance with this Section
9-4.1906 and the mitigation measures contained in the approved Impact Report.

   *In Vallecito Mobile Estates, Ltd v. City of Thousand Oaks, Ventura County
Superior Court Case No. 56-2008-00328552 (7-13-2009), a ruling was issued which
invalidated the bracketed language found in the foregoing § 9-4.1906.
   **In City of Thousand Oaks v. 1200 Newbury LLC, Ventura County Superior
Court Case No. 56-2009-00354680 (1-28-2010), a ruling was issued which
invalidated the bracketed language found in the foregoing § 9-4.1906.
Sec. 9-4.1907. Denial for coercive acts.
   The decision-making body may deny any proposed condominium conversion,
mobile home park subdivision or mobile home park change of use where there is
evidence that tenants have been coerced to publicly support or approve such
proposal, or to refrain from publicly opposing it, or to forego any assistance
to which they may be entitled.
   It is against the public policy to attempt to avert the provisions of this
article by coercing the waiver of any rights or privileges created or protected
herein. Any provision of a lease or rental agreement which purports to waive a
tenant's rights under this article or which require prior consent to the
condominium conversion, mobile home park subdivision or mobile home park change
of use shall be null, void and unenforceable.

Article 20. Mobile Home Park Development Zones
Sec. 9-4.2001. Purpose (T-P-D).
   Because of their unusual characteristics, the large area required for
operation, the congestion of persons and property customarily found in such
activities, the traffic problems created thereby, and other conditions caused
by their presence which might adversely affect the public safety, health,
morals, and welfare unless adequate safeguards are imposed, trailer parks,
trailer courts, mobile home parks, and public trailer camps shall require
special consideration as to their proper location and character in relation to
adjacent uses and to the development of the City and as to the conditions under
which each such use may be permitted. Therefore, such uses shall be permitted
only if a planned development permit is obtained in the manner set forth in
Article 28 of this chapter and such use conforms to every term and condition of
the permit. The Commission shall not grant a permit for any use when it finds
that the use will be injurious or detrimental to the public health, safety, or
welfare or to the property in the vicinity or zone in which the use will be
situated, and, secondly, that the imposition of conditions upon the requested
use will not prevent such effects.

Sec. 9-4.2003. Senior mobile home park overlay zone (SMHP).
   The purposes of this zone are:
   (a)   To recognize senior mobile home parks as walkable communities where
seniors may live actively and independently among peers, the preservation of
those qualities being central to residents' continued health, welfare, and
financial stability.
   (b)   To recognize that senior mobile home parks provide one of the few
housing options within Thousand Oaks available to seniors that are unsubsidized
and allow for independent living in a detached dwelling.
   (c)   To preserve a significant source of unsubsidized, senior housing by
ensuring that senior mobile home parks within the City's jurisdiction remain
predominantly available to seniors and are not converted to allow occupancy by
persons of all ages.
   (d)   To recognize mobile home parks as communities in which residents are
substantially invested and to provide for the security of tenancy comparable to
that of other residential communities less vulnerable to redevelopment.
   (e)   To meet the purpose of the federal Housing for Older Persons Act of
1995 (42 U.S.C. § 3607).
   (f)   To prevent senior mobile home parks from converting or becoming all-
ages mobile home parks.
   (g)   To ensure a sufficient supply of land for this type of use remains in
the City for seniors.

the specific plan will govern permitted uses. In its regulation of permitted
uses, a specific plan may regulate permitted land uses as follows:
   (1)   Specific Plan as Zoning. Where the City's zoning maps established
pursuant to Sec.
9-4.304 of this chapter only show the applicable specific plan label and do not
show the property as being within one or more zoning districts established by
this chapter, or where the land is zoned R-P-D with the SP (Specific Plan)
subzone, then the specific plan shall define the permitted uses within that
specific plan area. This listing may also reference the permitted uses within
one or more zoning districts established pursuant to this chapter as the
permitted use regulations within the specific plan or a portion thereof.
   (2)   Specific Plan Overlaying Zoning Districts. Where the land within the
specific plan is also designated on the City's zoning maps established pursuant
to Sec.
9-4.304 of this chapter as being within one or more underlying zoning districts
(e.g., M-1 or C-3), then the permitted use regulations of the applicable zoning
district set forth in this article shall apply unless provided otherwise by the
specific plan.
   (3)   Specific Plan No. 15. Appendix A of this Title sets forth regulations
for Specific Plan 15, including permitted uses in addition to those shown in
this article for the applicable City zoning district.

Sec. 9-4.2107. Findings for approval of entitlements for permitted uses.
   It is presumed that a use allowable by development permit, hillside planned
development permit, residential planned development permit, or trailer park
development permit is appropriate at any location within a zone in which it is
permitted, subject to the limitations of the applicable sub-zone (e.g., density
subzone in the RPD zone) and overlay zone (e.g. Protected Ridgeline), and if
the applicable findings set forth in Section
9-4.2803(c) of this chapter are made.
   Such a presumption is not applicable to special use permits. It is
recognized that uses listed as special uses may not be appropriate at every
location within a given zone because of the nature of the use. A special use
permit may only be approved if the decision-making body makes all of the
applicable findings in Section
9-4.2803(c) of this chapter.

Article 22. Objective Design Standards for Residential Development
   Editor’s note: Former Article 22. Civic Districts was repealed by Ord. 1556-
NS, eff. July 1, 2011
Sec. 9-4.2201. Intent and purpose.
   The Objective Design Standards provide mandatory development standards for
specified residential development. Under State Law, Objective Design Standards
involve no personal or subjective judgement by a public official and are
uniformly verifiable by reference to an external and uniform benchmark. The
Objective Design Standards are requirements for residential development, as
well as mixed use development that includes residential uses. For any
qualifying project that does not comply with these standards, these standards
may be modified through the applicable discretionary application process or as
allowed under State Density Bonus Law.
(§ 2, Ord. 1698-NS, eff. April 29, 2022)
Sec. 9-4.2202. Applicability.
   (a)   The Objective Design Standards (Objective Standards) apply to all
residential and mixed-use development, which include the new construction of
two (2) or more residential units. The Objective Standards were created in
response to legislative provisions such as the Housing Accountability Act, that
limit local jurisdictions' ability to deny or reduce density of housing
projects that are consistent with "objective standards" and multi-family
residential projects meeting affordability and other criteria can only be
subject to "objective" planning standards to be approved through a ministerial
process. These standards also apply to redevelopment that creates two (2) or
more new residential units, including but not limited to adaptive reuse of
existing buildings. In addition, these standards apply to groups of two (2) or
more attached townhomes (row houses), regardless of whether multiple townhomes
occupy the same lot, or each townhome is located on a separate lot. The
Objective Standards do not apply to residential development approved pursuant
to Article 37 (Urban Lot Splits and Two-Unit Housing Developments) and Article
45 (Accessory Dwelling Units).
   (b)   If a conflict occurs between these Objective Standards and other
provisions of the City of Thousand Oaks Municipal Code Title 9, Chapter 4,
these Objective Design Standards will supersede the standards provided in other
Articles of this Chapter. Terms defined within this Article govern the
application of these standards and the underlying zoning requirements for
qualifying projects. The Objective Standards apply to all residential projects
that have not been accepted as complete for processing prior to the effective
date of this Article. Terms used in this Article have the same meaning as those
terms which are used in Title 9, Chapter 4, except for those terms specifically
defined within this Article.
   (c)   Unless otherwise allowed as a ministerial approval by State law,
projects subject to these Objective Standards require application and approval
of a Residential Planned Development Permit along with a fee prescribed by City
Council and may not be entitled through a modification process. The Community
Development Director shall have approval authority for Residential Planned
Development permits for projects that comply with these Objective Standards
that do not include a Tentative Tract Map. When considering a Residential
Planned Development permit, the Community Development Director may approve,
with conditions, based on the following findings:
      (1)   The project is consistent with the Thousand Oaks General Plan and
any applicable specific plan;
      (2)   The project complies with all applicable laws, regulations and
policies, including the Thousand Oaks Municipal Code; and
      (3)   The project has been reviewed in conformance with the provisions of
the California Environmental Quality Act.
   (d)   If a project does not comply with these Objective Standards, unless
otherwise waived under current State density bonus law, the Community
Development Director may approve up to three (3) modifications for Building
Massing and Articulation, Accessory Structures, or Site and Building Elements.
If the applicant requests more than three (3) modifications to these standards,
the request and accompanying entitlements will be referred to the Planning
Commission. Requests of one or more modifications to the remaining standards in
this Article will be referred to the Planning Commission.
   (e)   Approval of modifications to these standards by the Community
Development Director and the Planning Commission must be based on making the
following findings:
      (1)   The modification, while not consistent with a specific provision of
this Code, is justified by its intent or by design hardship and allows
reasonable and conforming use that is consistent with the General Plan goals
and policies and underlying zoning district.
      (2)   The modification would result in development consistent with the
scale and character of existing and allowable development in the vicinity under
the same zoning.
      (3)   The modification would result in development that is not
detrimental to or that would not adversely impact adjacent properties.

2022; § 5, Ord. 1732-NS, eff. November 22, 2024)
Sec. 9-4.2203. Definition of terms.
   The following definitions apply to terms used in this Article.
   (a)   Open space and related terms.
      (1)   “Usable, open space” means outdoor or unenclosed area on the
ground, or on a roof, balcony, deck, porch or terrace designed and accessible
for outdoor living and recreation, but excluding parking facilities, driveways,
sidewalks, pedestrian paths, utility or service areas, required front or street
side yards, any landscaped area not usable for outdoor living or recreation, or
areas with slopes greater than five percent (5%). The area and dimensional
requirements of the underlying building type and zoning district must be met.
      (2)   “Open space, private” means a usable open space adjoining and
directly accessible to a dwelling unit, reserved for the exclusive use of
residents of the dwelling unit and their guests.
      (3)   “Open space, common/shared” means a usable open space within a
residential development reserved for the exclusive use of all residents of the
development and their guests.

Sec. 9-4.2205. Objective design standards.
   Residential development that is subject to this Article must be consistent
with the following standards:
   (a)   Street and pedestrian connectivity and vehicular access streets are
defined as a public or private thoroughfare consisting of vehicular travel
lanes with street parking, bike lanes as needed, parkways and sidewalks, which
affords principal access to abutting property. Alleys are defined as the
secondary means to access the property parking and services. Driveways serve as
direct access points to on-site covered or structured parking facilities that
do not exceed forty feet (40') from the street right of way.
      (1)   Internal connectivity. New public streets must form a connected
vehicular and pedestrian network within the development.
      (2)   External connectivity. Public streets, alleys, and pedestrian
pathways within a proposed subdivision or development site must be connected
with existing and planned streets in adjacent neighborhoods to create a
continuous street pattern.
      (3)   Cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets. Creation of new cul-de-sacs and
dead-end streets are prohibited, unless topographical constraints or existing
development prohibit development of through streets. Any public cul-de-sac or
other dead-end street longer than three hundred feet (300') must be connected
to internal or external streets by a pedestrian or bicycle path.
      (4)   Gates/barriers prohibited. Gates or barriers are prohibited on
public or private streets. Driveway and pedestrian path access points into the
building site may be gated or otherwise restrict public access.
      (5)   Streets and driveways. All proposed private streets and driveways
must be configured to meet City of Thousand Oaks standards for public streets,
including sidewalks and parkways for street trees. Proposed development sites
over two acres in size must have parking accessed from new internal streets and
alleys or driveways. Alleys may only be dead-end if they allow for non-
vehicular connection to adjacent streets, alleys, public pedestrian paths or
open space.
         (i)   Driveways that provide direct access to subterranean parking
garages are exempt from these requirements when other means of pedestrian
access is provided.
      (6)   Flag lots. Creation of flag lots is prohibited in new subdivisions.
      (7)   Access to parking. Curb cuts and driveways providing access to
parking facilities must be from an alley or secondary street when present,
rather than the principal street along the front property line.
   (b)   Site development standards.

and such primary building entry. Where a site is located on two (2) or more
public streets, the primary building entry must be oriented toward the street
with the shorter of the two (2) street frontages. If a site fronts two (2)
public streets of equal length, the project applicant may determine on which
frontage to meet the standard.
         (ii)   In courtyard-style developments in which residential buildings
are located in the interior of a block, entries must face interior courtyards,
walkways, paseos or a pedestrian corridor. Those buildings, or portions of
buildings, adjacent to the public street must include a primary entry facing
the street, with direct pedestrian access between the entry and the public
sidewalk.
         (iii)   Dwelling units abutting common open space areas require a
minimum of one window, in addition to a porch (ground floor) or balcony (upper

parking when private streets are incorporated into the project design. Such
parking spaces must not be angled or perpendicular.
         (iii)   Surface parking lots, garages, or carports must be located to
the side or rear of residential buildings in relation to adjacent streets. If a
site fronts on two (2) or more streets, the standard must apply on the primary
street frontage. If a site fronts on two (2) public streets of equal
classification, the project applicant may determine on which frontage to meet
the standard.
         (iv)   If subterranean parking is not integrated into the building
design, parking spaces and structures must be setback a minimum of twenty feet
(20') behind the principal building frontage.

Article 23. Sign Regulations*
*   Sections 9-4.2301 through 9-4.2310, recodified from Sections 8159 and
8159.1 through 8159.6, T.O.O.C, as added by Ordinance No. 95, as amended by
Ordinance Nos. 126, 222, 135-NS, effective January 27, 1970, 141-NS, effective
March 26, 1970, and 162-NS, effective August 27, 1970, renumbered by Ordinance
No. 173-NS, effective November 5, 1970, amended in their entirety by Section I,
Ordinance No. 248-NS, effective January 6, 1972.
Sec. 9-4.2301. Purpose and intent.
   (a)   Purpose and intent. It is the purpose of this article that a
comprehensive system of sign regulations is hereby adopted to assure proper
expression through visual communications involving signs that are compatible
with the character and environment of this community to promote the growth of
the City in an orderly, efficient, and attractive manner. It is further
declared that these regulations serve to reveal a great deal about the
community's pride and morale, aesthetic level, vitality, diversity,
originality, culture, and sense of order, giving it a distinctive appearance
and reinforcing the character of the Conejo Valley in its natural setting as
adopted in the General Plan. Such standards shall be uniformly applied to
promote fairness in competition and retain identity within the business
community. It is further determined that these regulations in and by themselves
cannot achieve the end result desired unless the community voluntarily upholds
these conditions within an atmosphere of responsible freedom, utilizing
principles of good design and mutual cooperation. Minimum standards are
provided to safeguard the life, health, property, and public welfare by
regulating and controlling the design quality of materials and the
construction, illumination, location, and maintenance of all signs, sign
structures, and billboards, and at the same time attempting to provide
functional flexibility, encourage variety, and create an incentive to relate
signing to the basic principles of good design while trying to eliminate visual
blight.
   (b)   Message neutrality. It is the policy of the City of Thousand Oaks to
regulate signs in a manner that does not favor commercial speech over non-
commercial speech, and that does not regulate protected non-commercial speech
by message content.
   (c)   Message substitution policy. Subject to the private property owner's
consent, a constitutionally protected non-commercial message of any category or
content may be substituted, in whole or in part, for any allowed commercial
message or any other protected non-commercial message, provided that the sign
structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content.
Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or
permitting. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any favoring of
commercial speech over non-commercial speech, or favoring of any particular
protected non-commercial message over any other protected non-commercial
message. Message substitution is a continuing right which may be exercised any
number of times. The message substitution right does not:
   (1)   Create a right to increase the total amount of sign display area on a
site or parcel;
   (2)   Create a right to substitute an off-site commercial message in place
of an on-site commercial message or in place of a non-commercial message;
   (3)   Affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device must
be properly permitted;
   (4)   Authorize changing the physical method of image presentation, such as
digital or neon display without a permit;
   (5)   Authorize a physical change to the sign structure without compliance
with applicable building codes, safety codes, and neutrally-applicable rules
for sign size, height, orientation, setback, separation or illumination.

seal. The permit and seal requirements shall not be applicable to temporary
political signs.

and erected in compliance with all applicable State, Federal, and City laws and
regulations.
   (b)   Maintenance. Every sign and all parts, portions, units, and materials

preservation. The display surface of all signs shall be kept neatly painted
and/or posted.
   (c) Notices to maintain, alter, or repair. Upon a written notice from the

maintenance, alterations, or repairs shall be made within ten (10) days after
the date of such notice.
   (d)   Removal. Signs pertaining to enterprises or occupants which are no
longer using the premises to which the sign relates shall be painted out,
obliterated, or removed from the premises within thirty (30) days after the
associated enterprise or occupant has vacated the premises. Permitted temporary
signs, such as political or construction signs, shall be displayed no sooner
than forty-five (45) days before, and removed no later than seven (7) days
after, the occurrence or completion of the event or election or other purpose
serviced by the sign.
   (e)   Public nuisances: Abatement. Any sign violating the provisions of this
section shall constitute a public nuisance and shall be subject to abatement
pursuant to the provisions of this section. The Community Development Director,
upon a determination that a sign is in violation of this article, shall give
notice to the candidate, property owner, sign owner, or, when a ballot
proposition is involved, the person or group advocating the vote described on
the sign to remove the offending sign. After reasonable opportunity has been
given to remove the sign or remedy the violation, the Community Development
Director may cause the sign to be removed, and the cost of removal shall be
billed to the sign’s owner, the property owner, or other responsible party,
which, in the case of political signs, shall be the candidate for which the
sign is displayed or the group advocating the position on the ballot
proposition which the sign supports. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Community Development Director may cause any sign which is an immediate peril

it is reasonably possible after the removal.
   (f)   Unauthorized removal of political signs. No person shall remove,
destroy, relocate, or otherwise disturb any political sign without the
permission of the party who erected the sign. It shall be presumed, as to signs
for political candidates, that the political candidate or his or her
representative is the party who erected the sign. It shall further be assumed
that the committee who has registered with the Secretary of the State to
support a position on a ballot proposition is the party who erected the sign
taking the position on a ballot measure. Nothing in this subsection shall
prohibit the owner of a piece of property, or his or her authorized
representative, from removing a sign from his or her property when the
political sign has been erected without his or her consent; and provided,

   On-site freestanding signs shall be subject to the following design
standards:
   (1)   General requirements. The provisions of the City’s Architectural
Design Review Guidelines Resolution for freestanding monument signs shall
apply.
   (2)   Signage area. The maximum sign copy area of any monument sign shall
not exceed thirty-two (32) square feet, and no portion of the proposed sign

which means that any interior lighting source shall not penetrate the material
and illuminate the background but shall be limited to illuminating the sign
letters and any state and/or federal registered trademark or service mark only.
The background material, as well as the frame and sign base of the freestanding
sign shall be constructed with materials similar to those used on the building
(s), in accordance with the City’s Architectural Design Review Guidelines.
   (4)   Signage colors. The colors of the letters used on the freestanding
monument sign shall be consistent with the approved sign colors for the on-

designs which utilize halo, back-lit, or concealed exterior illumination.
Internal illumination can be used only when it is limited to lighting the sign
letters and any state and/or federal registered trade mark or service mark.
   (7)   Signage letter height. The portion of the sign having text with a
height of less than four (4") inches, shall not occupy more than twenty-five
(25%) percent of the area of the sign copy.
   (8)   Each side, front, back and top of a freestanding monument sign shall
include breaks. Design elements such as off-sets, curved forms, reveals, etc.,
are encouraged. In addition, the design and character of the monument sign
shall complement the architectural theme and design of the projects.
   (9)   There shall be at least two (2") inches between the sign copy and the
edge or frame of the sign and a neutral space between the sign’s text shall be
provided to create an aesthetically proportioned and balanced looking sign.
   (10)    Evidence of registration of state and/or federal agency trade mark
or service mark must be
provided, where such mark is proposed to be used on a sign.
   (11)    Nonconforming signs shall not be required to comply with these
design standards when the requested change to a sign involves a face copy
change only. If the requested change involves any alteration (other than change
of face copy), or the removal of an existing sign and the installation of a new
sign, then the provisions within this section shall apply to the design of the
sign.
   (12)    For easy access by emergency vehicles and passing motorists, the
inclusion of the building’s street address number is encouraged on the monument
sign, either on the front of the sign or on the side. The height of the numbers
shall be proportioned to the sign area.

Article 24. Off-Street Parking
Sec. 9-4.2401. Intent and purposes.
   The problem of providing adequate streets, highways, and parking to meet the
present and future traffic needs is of prime concern to both the City
government and individual citizens of the City. All types of property,
regardless of location or use, are harmed by inadequate off-street parking
facilities. Cars parked on the streets, as a result, create a safety hazard,
impede the flow of traffic, and delay emergency equipment. The provision of
adequate off-street parking, on the other hand, benefits the property owner by
adding security and stability to his property; benefits his neighbors by
relieving congestion; and benefits the entire City by allowing the streets to
be used as traffic movers.
   The City, after considerable research and study, has found that the
requirements set forth in the article are the minimum standards for off-street
parking facilities. A developer or builder will, though, often find it
necessary to exceed the minimum requirements to insure adequate parking space
for a successful development.
   A parking structure is an alternative method of complying with the off-
street parking requirements of the City. Parking structures can reduce the site
area devoted to exposed, surface parking lots, and achieve reasonable densities
that are dictated by the site’s natural and/or man-made limitations, with the
goal of improving the overall visual aesthetics of a project.
   Certain types of parking structures are to be encouraged, where appropriate
in certain areas, and discouraged in other areas within the Community. The
overall goal of establishing guidelines for parking structures is to maintain
the continuous commitment of the City in preserving the perception of a semi-
rural character that has shaped the quality of development within the City, as
viewed by residents and visitors alike. While not intended to be used for the
sole purpose of intensifying development, it is recognized that appropriately
designed parking structures may increase the intensity of development on a
given site. In establishing these guidelines, it should be emphasized that the
safety, visual appeal and increased landscaping associated with such parking
structures will be key elements of their design, carefully reviewed and
strongly implemented.
   The purpose of this article is to set forth the conditions under which
parking structures may be incorporated in a project and to provide guidelines
for their location and design.
   A Parking Structure Design Review Board, as appointed by the City Council,
may be formed to review any proposed development project that includes a
parking structure. The review shall be conducted at the early stages of the
development process, at the pre-application meeting, to review the proposed
parking structure design for compliance with this article, prior to the
processing of the project.

Sec. 9-4.2403. Computation of off-street parking spaces.
   (a)   Required off-street parking. All off-street parking spaces shall be
computed as set forth in Section
9-4.2402 of this article, except as follows:
   (1)   When the application of said Section
9-4.2402 results in the requirement of a fractional parking space, any fraction
up to one-half (1/2) may be disregarded, and any fraction equaling one-half (1/
2) or more shall be construed as requiring one full parking space.
   (2)   When required parking computations are based on floor area, floor area
devoted exclusively to parking shall have no off-street parking space or
landscaping requirements.
   (b)   Mixed uses. In the case of mixed uses, the total requirements for off-
street parking spaces shall be the sum of the requirements for the various
uses. Off-street parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as
providing parking facilities to any other use.
   The Commission, and in cases not otherwise involving permits which require
approval by the Commission, the Community Development Director or a designee
may approve alternating use of parking facilities where parties wish to
cooperatively establish and operate parking facilities and where these uses
generate parking demands primarily during hours when the remaining uses are not
in operation (for example, if one use operates during the daytime or on
weekends and the other use operates at other times).
   The burden of proof for a reduction in the total number of required parking
spaces, however, shall remain with the applicant, and documentation shall be
submitted to the decision-making body or officer substantiating the reasons for
this requested parking reduction. As a condition precedent to approving such
alternating use, the decision-making body or officer shall require:
   (1)   That whenever alternative units of measurement are required for
computing off-street parking requirements, that unit of measurement which
provides the greatest number of off-street parking spaces shall control;
   (2)   The submission of satisfactory statements by the parties providing
such facilities, and the parties such facilities are to serve, describing the
nature of the uses and times when such uses operate so as to indicate the lack
of conflict between them; and
   (3)   Such additional documents or agreements as the Commission and City
Attorney may deem necessary in each particular case to assure provisions for
and the maintenance of the required off-street parking spaces.
   (c)   Uses not specified. The parking space requirements for uses not listed
in Section

shall be based upon the requirements for the most comparable use specified in
said Section
9-4.2402.
   (d)   Non-retail business and professional offices.
   (1)   New multi-tenant buildings. For the purpose of calculating parking
space requirements for multi-tenant nonretail business, professional offices
and other similar uses, approved under this Title after August 22, 1997, the
square footage described in subsections (26) and (28) of Section
9-4.2402(c) shall mean only the building’s gross leasable floor area. For the
purpose of this calculation, “gross leasable floor area” shall mean the area
within the total dimensions on each floor as measured from the outside walls,
but excluding the interior common areas used for corridors, lobbies, stairways,
common restrooms, elevator or mechanical shafts, and for any unmanned
electrical or mechanical rooms. In order to qualify as a “corridor” under this
section, the area shall be a shared interior circulation hallway or common
walkway feature more than five (5') feet in width with permanent walls on both
sides that are constructed from floor to ceiling.
   (2)   Other buildings. For the purpose of calculating parking space
requirements for any nonretail business, professional offices, other similar
uses, and for multi-tenant offices approved under this title prior to August
22, 1997, which buildings are not covered by subsection (d)(1) of this section,
the square footage described in subsections (26) and (28) of Section
9-4.2402(c) shall mean the building’s gross floor area. For the purposes of
this calculation “gross floor area” shall mean the entire area within the total

site as the dwelling they are to serve. Covered or enclosed spaces required for
all dwelling units shall maintain an unencumbered interior width of nine (9')
feet and an unencumbered interior depth of twenty (20') feet.
   (2)   Other uses. Parking spaces shall be located either on the same lot or
parcel as the building or use they are to serve or on a contiguous lot unless
otherwise approved by the Planning Commission.
   (3)   Overhang. Depths for standard parking stalls may be reduced to a
dimension of eighteen (18') feet and depths for compact parking stalls may be
reduced to a dimension of fifteen (15') feet when spaces abut a landscape
planter with a minimum width of six (6') feet or a sidewalk or similar paved
area with a minimum width of six (6') feet. In cases involving overhang or
projection of vehicles from more than one direction into the same unencumbered
area, a minimum planter or sidewalk width of eight (8') feet shall be required.
   (4)   Tandem parking shall be prohibited in commercial, industrial and
manufacturing zones unless approved by the City.
   (c)   Access and circulation.

   (i)    Adequate vehicular and pedestrian sign visibility shall be provided
and maintained at all intersections of public streets and private driveways in
accordance with the criteria specified within Plate D-10 of Public Works
Department standards and also at all points of interchange within the interior
of the parking lot facility. The improvement plans for all projects shall
demonstrate compliance with this plate and a means to execute ongoing
maintenance to guarantee preservation of sight visibility. Stopping sight
distance shall be a principal criteria in determining appropriate location of
on-site or off-site improvements. It is especially critical that mature
landscaping be considered in evaluating visibility, not just the barren ground.
Stopping sight distance less than the minimum criteria as specified within
Plate D-10 shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission, if
determined necessary by the City Traffic Engineer or the Community Development
Director. Where applicable, C.C. and R’s shall require continued compliance
with this condition and the requirements contained within Plate D-10.

   (1)   All multi-family residential, institutional, commercial and
manufacturing-type land uses may utilize parking spaces of reduced size to
satisfy the off-street parking requirements not to exceed the percentages
listed below, provided it is demonstrated that the utilization of compact
stalls or reduced-size stalls will benefit the development site design, by, but
not limited to, reduction of unsightly paved areas, increasing landscape areas,
reduction of grading and reduction in use of retaining walls, providing site
design flexibility for properties with physical constraints, or aiding existing
developments which are characterized by a substantiated deficiency in off-
street parking or substandard circulation. Utilizations of compact stalls or
reduced size stalls is not appropriate solely to achieve land use
intensification.
   (i)   Multiple-family residential uses: A maximum of thirty-five (35%)
percent of all required guest parking may be compact spaces.
   (ii)   Institutional uses: A maximum of twenty-five (25%) percent of all
required parking may be compact spaces.
   (iii)   Commercial, retail, service and general office uses: A maximum of
twenty-five (25%) percent of all required parking may be compact spaces.

back-up space for compact spaces shall be as mandated in subsection (c)(2)(ii).
There shall be no reduction of driveway or aisle widths for compact stalls.
   (ii)   Location. Compact spaces shall be dispersed evenly throughout the
parking lot. For developments characterized by distinct, segmented parking
areas the maximum permitted percentage of compact stalls shall apply to each
area or segment of the parking lot. Compact spaces shall be located in areas
characterized by a “through” method of circulation and shall avoid locations
adjacent to retaining walls or other formidable barriers which prevent adequate
vehicle overhang. Compact stalls within commercial, retail, service and office
uses shall be located adjacent to paved or landscaped areas in order to
accommodate vehicle overhang. The location of all compact stalls shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Community Development Director.
   (iii)    Marking. All compact car spaces shall be clearly designated with
pavement and/or wheelstop/curb signs to the satisfaction of the Community
Development Director.
   (iv)   Landscaping. New developments electing to incorporate compact stalls
into an overall site design (i.e., developments which have not inaugurated an
approved use in accordance with Section
9-4.2811(c) of this Code) shall be required to exceed minimum parking lot
landscaping area requirements by an additional area not less than twenty-five
(25) square feet for each compact car space.
   (v)   Restriping existing parking facilities. Existing multi-family
residential, commercial, manufacturing and institutional parking facilities may
be restriped to accommodate compact parking stalls after approval of a
modification application or a comparable review procedure as determined by the
Community Development Director. All proposals shall be subject to the
requirements set forth in this article.
   (e)   Landscaping.
   (1)   Ten (10%) percent of open parking and driveway areas shall be
landscaped. This shall be in addition to landscape requirements for setback
areas, perimeter property line landscaping and landscape planters located
adjacent to structures. Such landscape areas shall be evenly distributed
through the entire parking area as required by the Community Development
Director. The ten (10%) percent parking requirement shall be calculated based
on the total amount of parking and driveway areas on the approved plan(s),
except parking spaces provided for display purposes or for enclosed vehicles
storage areas. The Community Development Director or the Planning Commission
may allow any landscaped area which would be within an open service or work
area and not viewable from any perimeter street to be relocated to a more
functional location within the other parking areas on the property provided
such relocation does not decrease the total required percentage of required
interior landscaping of the parking area.
   (2)   A ten (10') foot wide landscape strip, with planting maintained at
either a height of three (3’) feet or a height otherwise approved by the
Community Development Director or designee, shall be provided along the
property lines adjacent to any public or private street or alley (except within
the approved exit and entrance ways) whenever the parking or circulation abuts
such streets or alleys except:
   (i)   In the C-2 Zone, in which a twenty (20') foot wide landscape strip
shall be provided along the front property line, with a ten (10') foot wide
landscape strip in all other locations as required by this subsection; and
   (ii)   In the C2/AM Zone, in which a fourteen (14') foot wide landscape
strip shall be provided along the front property line, with a four (4') foot
wide landscape strip in all other locations as required by this sub-section.
The regulations of this sub-section for the C2/AM zone shall supersede
conflicting conditions of any entitlement granted prior to the effective date
of the ordinance adopting this sub-section, where said conditions require a
wider landscape strip than provided by this sub-section.
   (3)   A four (4') foot wide landscape strip, with planting maintained at
either a height of three (3') feet or a height acceptable to the Community
Development Director, shall be provided along the interior property lines or
along interior project boundaries for projects occupying a portion of a larger
parcel of property (except within the approved exit and entrance ways) when
adjacent to parking facilities and paved areas.
   (4)   Any of the following driveways or open parking areas shall be
separated by a planting strip four (4') feet wide:
   (i)   Where there are two (2) or more driveways or two (2) or more buildings
or parcels, each of which has one (1) or more parking lots;
   (ii)   Where there are two (2) or more parking lots for vehicles adjacent to
one another which do not use a common driveway;

   (5)   Landscape trees shall be selected and planted in such a manner as to
minimize root damage to parking lot hardscape.
   (6)   All landscaping in or adjacent to any parking lot area shall be
installed and maintained in accordance with the applicable approved project
conditions and landscape plans, the City's adopted landscape design, planting
and maintenance standards, and Chapter 27 of Title 5 of this Code.
   (f)   Maintenance. While encouraging upgrades of parking lots through a
maintenance program, public safety and security shall be taken into
consideration in upgrading the facilities, regarding lighting, traffic
circulation, and landscaping.
   (1)   The following improvements to parking lots shall be considered “minor”
repair and maintenance and shall not require any type of permit application to
the Community Development Department:
   (i)   Repair of defects in the surface of the parking areas, including holes
and cracks;
   (ii)   Restriping of a parking area with identical delineation of parking
spaces;
   (iii)   Repair or replacement in the same location of damaged planters and
curbs;
   (iv)   Slurry coating and restriping the parking stall lines in same

described in this section. The intent of these guidelines is to provide a
benefit to the community while offsetting the visual impact of parking
structures when viewed by pedestrians and motorists from the adjacent public
right-of-way. This benefit can be achieved by using superior site and
architectural design, which incorporates the requirements of this section.
   (a)   Below-grade parking structures.
   (1)   Definitions.
   (i)   A “basement parking structure” shall mean a parking structure that is
under a building designed for human occupancy where the floor level above the
parking structure is not more than six (6') feet above finished grade for at
least fifty (50%) percent of the perimeter, and does not exceed twelve (12')
feet above finished grade at any point.
   (ii)   A “stand-alone below-grade parking structure” shall mean a parking
structure that is not under a building designed for human occupancy where its
floor level is more than four (4') feet below finished grade for more than
fifty (50%) percent of the total perimeter, or more than eight (8') feet below
finished grade.
   (2)   Permitted zones:
   (i)   C-2, C-3, C-4, M-1, M-2, and P-L Zones.
   (ii)   R-3 and Residential Planned Development Zones, if needed to
accommodate residential densities of 20 or more dwellings per net acre.
   (3)   Special development requirements.
   (i)   Non-residential projects: The minimum lot size for projects proposing
below grade parking structures shall be 1 acre, unless otherwise permitted by
the Planning Commission or City Council or as specifically authorized in an
adopted specific plan.
   (ii)   Below-grade parking structures shall be located to minimize the
visual impact from adjacent streets as much as possible, in order to screen the
parking structure from public view. Furthermore, the specific location of the
parking structure must also comply with the Thousand Oaks Police Department
security and safety requirements.
   (iii)   In order to improve the overall project aesthetics, and to minimize
the potential design conflict with nearby existing developments, projects
incorporating below-grade parking structures shall provide increased
landscaping setbacks from streets and property lines, both for the parking
structure itself and its associated development, as follows:
   (aa)   Front yard and any street frontage landscape setbacks shall be
increased by a minimum of five (5') feet, as compared to the requirement of the
underlying zone.
   (ab)   Rear yard landscape setbacks shall be increased by a minimum of five
(5') feet, as compared to the requirement of the underlying zone.
   (ac)   Side yard landscape setbacks shall be increased by a minimum of four
(4') feet, as compared to the requirement of the underlying zone.
   (iv)   The perimeter of any below-grade parking structure, above grade,
visible to view, shall be provided with a landscape planter of at least five
(5') feet in width at ground level.
   (v)   Structure Design. The following guidelines shall apply to the design
of both types of below-grade parking structures:
   (aa)   The height of the above-grade, visible portions of the below-grade
parking structure shall not be included in the overall maximum building height
as defined in Section
9-4.202. Furthermore, the entry elevation to the parking structure, with its
unavoidable visible above-grade walls, should be designed and located in a
manner that reduces its impact and exposure to public view.
   (ab)   Any exposed elevations of the below-grade parking structure shall be
designed to reflect architectural compatibility with existing or proposed
structure(s). The above-grade, visible portions of the
exterior elevations of the below-grade parking structure shall be designed to
minimize the use of blank facades through the combined use of appropriate
architectural treatment such as heavy
textured concrete, planters, openings, indentations, and projections of
exterior walls to provide visual interest.
   (vi)   All parking stalls within below-grade parking structures shall be
designed for the use of owners, tenants, and employees only. Appropriate
signing and circulation access devices shall be installed to assure compliance
with this requirement.
   (b)   Single-level above-grade parking structures.
   (1)   Definitions.
   (i)   A “freestanding single-level parking structure” is a parking structure
with only one aboveground parking level that is not an integral part of a
building designed for human occupancy where its floor level is not more than
four (4') feet below finished grade for more than fifty (50%) percent of the
total perimeter, nor more than eight (8') feet above finished grade at any
point.
   (ii)   An “intermixed single-level above-grade parking structure” is a
parking structure with only one aboveground parking level that is an integral
part of a building designed for human occupancy where the floor above the
parking structure is more than six (6') feet above finished grade for more than
fifty (50%) percent of the perimeter of the structure, or more than twelve
(12') feet above finished grade at any point.
   (2)   Permitted zones.
   (i)   C-2, C-3, C-4, M-1, M-2, and P-L Zones.
   (ii)   R-3 and Residential Planned Development Zones: Intermixed single-
level above grade parking structures are permitted if needed to accommodate
residential densities of 20 or more dwellings per net acre.
   (3)   Special development requirements. The following site design guidelines
shall apply to both types of single-level above-grade parking structures:
   (i)   Non-residential projects: The minimum lot size shall be 3 acres,
unless otherwise permitted by the Planning Commission or City Council or as
specifically authorized in an adopted specific plan.
   (ii)   Single-level above-grade parking structures shall be located to
minimize the visual impact from adjacent streets as much as possible. Single-
level above-grade parking structures should be located at the rear of the
subject property, or behind the proposed or existing building in order to
screen the parking structure from public view. Furthermore, the specific
location of the parking structure must also comply with Thousand Oaks Police
Department security and safety requirements.
   (iii)   Non-residential projects: In order to improve the overall project
aesthetics and to minimize the potential design conflict with nearby existing
developments, projects incorporating single-level above-grade parking
structures shall provide increased landscaping setbacks from streets and
property lines, both for the parking structure itself and its associated
development, as follows:
   (aa)   Front yard and any street frontage landscape setbacks shall be
increased by a minimum of seven (7') feet, as compared to the requirement of
the underlying zone,
   (ab)   Rear yard landscape setbacks shall be increased by a minimum of five
(5') feet, as compared to the requirement of the underlying zone,
   (ac)   Side yard landscape setbacks shall be increased by a minimum of four
(4') feet, as compared to the requirement of the underlying zone.
   (iv)   All parking stalls within a single-level above-grade parking
structure, for office use only, may be designated for the use of owners,
tenants, and employees only, with the approval of the Planning Commission and/
or City Council. However, if the single-level above-grade parking structure is
designed for general parking use, then appropriate security measures, as deemed
necessary by the Thousand Oaks Police Department, shall be incorporated within
the proposed project. Parking stalls within a single-level above-grade parking
structure, for commercial retail uses, other than office, may be designed for
general parking use by the public. Appropriate signing and circulation access
devices shall be installed to assure compliance with this requirement.
   (v)   Single-level above-grade parking structures shall comply with the
height requirements of the underlying zone or applicable Specific Plan.
Furthermore, the height of the above-grade, visible portions of the single-
level above-grade parking structure shall be included in the overall maximum
building height as defined in Section
9-4.202.
   (vi)   The perimeter of any single-level above-grade parking structure shall
be provided with a landscape planter of at least five (5') feet in width at
ground level. The landscaping plans for the project as submitted and approved
by the Community Development Department, shall incorporate these requirements.
   (vii)   Single-level above-grade parking structures, visible from streets,
which give the appearance of surface parking lots due to their visual and
physical relationship to the street will be required to meet the landscape
percentage requirements of a surface parking lot.
   (viii)   Any exposed elevations of a single-level above-grade parking
structure shall be designed to reflect architectural compatibility with
existing or proposed structure(s) within the project. The exterior elevations
of a single-level above-grade parking structure shall be designed to minimize
the use of blank facades through the combined use of appropriate architectural
treatment such as heavy textured concrete, planters, openings, indentations,
and projections of exterior walls to provide visual interest.
   (c)   Multi-level above-grade parking structures.
   (1)   Definitions.
   (i)   A “freestanding multi-level parking structure” is a parking structure
with two or more aboveground parking levels that is not an integral part of a
building designed for human occupancy.
   (ii)   An “intermixed multi-level aboveground parking structure” is a
parking structure with two or more aboveground parking levels that is an
integral part of a building designed for human occupancy.
   (2)   Permitted zones:
   (i)   C-2, C-3, C-O, M-1, M-2, and P-L Zones.
   (ii)   R-3 and Residential Planned Development Zones: Intermixed multilevel
above grade parking structures are permitted if needed to accommodate
residential densities of 20 or more dwellings per net acre.
   (3)   Special development requirements.
   (i)   Non-residential projects: The minimum lot size shall be 5 acres,
unless otherwise permitted by the Planning Commission or City Council or as
specifically authorized in an adopted specific plan.
   (ii)   Non-residential projects: In order to improve the overall project
aesthetics, and to minimize the potential design conflict with nearby existing
developments, projects incorporating multi-level above-grade parking structures
shall provide increased landscaping setbacks from streets and property lines,
both for the parking structure itself and its associated development, as
follows:
   (aa)   Front yard and any street frontage landscape setbacks shall be
increased by a minimum of ten (10') feet, as compared to the requirement of the
underlying zone.
   (ab)   Rear yard landscape setbacks shall be increased by a minimum of seven
(7') feet, as compared to the requirement of the underlying zone.
   (ac)   Side yard landscape setbacks shall be increased by a minimum of four
(4') feet, as compared to the requirement of the underlying zone.
   (iii)   Separations between a multi-level above-grade parking structure and
other buildings on the same site shall comply with the Uniform Building Code.
However, for buildings located on adjacent parcels, there shall be a minimum
separation between structures that is one and one-half (1-1/2) times the height
of the proposed multi-level above-grade parking structure.
   (iv)   All parking stalls within a multi-level above-grade parking
structure, for office use only, may be designated for the use of owners,
tenants, and employees only, with the approval of the Planning Commission and/
or City Council. However, if the multi-level above-grade parking structure is
designed for general parking use, then appropriate security measures, as deemed
necessary by the Thousand Oaks Police Department, shall be incorporated within
the proposed project. Parking stalls within a multi-level above-grade parking
structure, for commercial retail uses other than office, may be designed for
general parking use by the public. Appropriate signing and circulation access
devices shall be installed to assure compliance with this requirement.
   (v)   Multi-level above-grade parking structures shall comply with the basic
height requirements of the underlying zone or applicable specific plan;
provided, however, that the height of the multi-level above-grade parking
structure may not exceed the basic height limit even if the property is subject
to H overlay zoning.
   (vi)   The perimeter of any multi-level above-grade parking structure shall
be provided with a landscaped planter of at least ten (10') feet in width at
ground level. The width of this planter shall be increased at increments of
five (5') feet for each additional allowed exposed level, above two (2).
   (vii)   Due to the impracticality of significantly landscaping exposed upper
level parking decks, there shall be a transfer of parking landscape
requirements to visible ground level locations. No less than ten (10%) percent
of the multi-level above-grade parking structure footprint shall be utilized as
additional surface parking lot landscaping at ground level adjacent to public
rights-of-way or adjacent to proposed structures.
   (viii)   Multi-level above-grade parking structures should be located in
such a manner as to “fit-in” and not be visually imposing on the site. To
achieve this design concept, the structure should be situated within the rear
portion of the site where it can be screened, as much as possible, from public
view and adjacent public streets and thus minimize its visual effect on
surrounding properties. However, any portion of a multi-level above-grade
parking structure visible from a public right-of-way should be treated
architecturally to mitigate its negative impacts, such as visible parked
vehicles and exposed interior lighting fixtures. Furthermore, the specific
location of the parking structure must also comply with Thousand Oaks Police
Department security and safety requirements.
   (ix)   Multi-level above-grade parking structures shall be architecturally
designed to be compatible and consistent, but subordinate, to the existing or
proposed structure(s). However, if the multi-level above-grade parking
structure is located on a prominent location on the subject property, visible
to vehicular and pedestrian public view, then it should be architecturally
designed to be compatible and consistent with the existing or proposed
structure(s). The exterior elevations of multi-level above-grade parking
structures shall be designed to minimize the use of blank facades through the
combined use of appropriate architectural treatment such as heavy textured
concrete, planters, trellises (on roof levels), openings, indentations, and
projections of exterior walls to provide visual interest, and where
appropriate, roof elements. Furthermore, to reduce the perceived scale of the
structure, each level may be “stepped-back” from the lower level. When such
stepped parking level designs are used, the requirements for additional five
(5') feet of perimeter landscaping width for each level above two (2) levels,
shall not be required, provided that each parking level, above two (2), is
stepped back a minimum distance of five (5') feet from the level below it.
   (x)   Parked vehicles located on roof decks and within multi-level above-
grade parking structures shall be screened from public view from the adjoining
street levels on each parking level through the combined use of landscaping
planters, trellises and/or decorative screen walls. Additional screening of
roof decks shall be required where adjoining streets or public rights-of-way
are higher than the parking deck roof.
   (d)   Hybrid parking structure configurations.
   (1) Definition: “Hybrid configuration parking structure” shall mean a
project utilizing more than one design approach for a parking structure.
   (2)   This type of parking structure shall comply with the more restrictive
of the standards and guidelines of the types utilized.
   (e)   The construction and use of parking structures cannot be approved
administratively unless they are part of a housing project that is allowed “by
right” under California law.
   (f)   Standards and design guidelines applicable to all parking structures.
   (1)   Appropriate security measures shall be incorporated into the design of
parking structures, including, but not limited to, location of the structure,
entrances, exits and openings, the use of security video systems, security
gates, fencing, lighting, security patrols, twenty-four (24) hour surveillance,
limited hours of operation, graffiti control measures and other means deemed
necessary by the Thousand Oaks Police Department.
   (2)   An eight-foot two inch (8'2") minimum vertical clearance shall be
required for all entrances and exits, including turnaround areas for vehicular
required access. The vertical clearance dimension shall be measured from the
finished surface of the parking level to the lowest structural surface, or
electrical, plumbing, mechanical or signage appurtenance above.
   (3)   Parking structures shall comply with the provisions of Sections
9-4.2404 and
9-4.2405 of this article, with regard to parking stall dimensions, aisle
widths, disabled parking and the general installation requirements for parking
areas.
   (4)   Unless otherwise permitted by the decision-making body, all areas used
exclusively for parking and turnarounds, shall be designed with grades not to
exceed a maximum of two and one-half (2.5%) percent slope. Grades exceeding two
and one-half (2.5%) percent slope up to five (5%) percent slope may be allowed
on parked access ramps. A slope of seven and one-half (7.5%) percent up to ten
(10%) percent may be allowed on unparked access ramps with a non-skid surface.
   (5)   If an access ramp is provided to a public street, all access points
shall meet sight distance requirements as specified in the City Road Standards,
and shall be designed to the satisfaction of the City Traffic Engineer.
   (6)   No loading/unloading activities, trash enclosures or recycling bins
shall be permitted within a parking structure. These activities shall be
designed and provided for separately, within the site, to serve the proposed
project.
   (7)   Surface water, rainfall and other forms of water runoff, must be
collected and diverted to the storm drain system. Water runoff may not be
directed to the wastewater system.
   (8)   Interior architectural lighting with a uniform lighting level shall be
provided, in accordance with the Building and Security Ordinance, Section
8-1.22 of this Code. Additional architectural lighting may be required at
public entrances.
   (9)   Parking structures shall provide variations in finish materials and
colors at public entrances that include use of accent tiles, floor pavers and
other special wall, floor and ceiling finishes and colors.
   (10)   Parking structures shall use landscape planters, light wells, and
other amenities that provide a visually pleasing aesthetic effect.
   (11)   Parking structures shall provide natural ventilation and openings to
the outside where possible.
   (12)   Non-residential projects: Above-grade parking levels shall not be
permitted within twenty-five (25') feet of any adjacent residentially zoned
properties, unless a determination is made that unusual site, topography, and/
or physical and legal constraints are present that would prevent compliance. As
a condition of any waiver of this regulation, the walls of the parking
structure adjacent to and facing residentially zoned properties shall be
designed to prohibit any direct openings through which noise, light or air
pollutants may be transmitted.
   (13)   Due to the impracticality of significantly landscaping exposed upper
level parking decks, there shall be a transfer of parking landscape
requirements to visible ground level locations. No less than ten (10%) percent
of the parking structure footprint shall be utilized as additional surface
parking lot landscaping at ground level adjacent to public rights-of-way or
adjacent to proposed structures.
   (14)   No on-building identification or advertisement signs, except
directional or parking entrance signs, shall be allowed on the exterior
elevations. The frontage of such structure shall not be used in calculating the
size of permitted signs for the project.

   (a)   Whenever two (2) or more main buildings, one of which is to be used
for residential purposes, are constructed on a lot or parcel of land, there
shall be a minimum distance of twenty (20') feet between such main buildings in
lieu of any required yard.
   (b)   No yard area or other open space provided around any building for the
purpose of complying with the provisions of this chapter shall be considered as
providing a yard or open space for any other building.
   (c)   No yard or open space on adjoining property shall be considered as
providing required yard or open space for another lot or parcel for the purpose
of complying with the provisions of this chapter.
   (d)   Vehicles may be parked, but not stored, on a driveway or other City-
approved parking area for a residential dwelling unit. No vehicle may be parked
within any front yard area as defined by this chapter except on a driveway as
stated above. No vehicle may be parked or stored within three (3) feet of any
side property line or within twenty (20) feet of any rear property line. Except
as specifically provided elsewhere in this chapter, no required yard are or
open space provided around any building shall be used for garages or other
accessory buildings. For purposes of this subsection, “stored” shall mean the
keeping and maintaining of a vehicle, as defined by the State Vehicle Code,
continuously for a period of time in excess of thirty (30) days in the driveway
or approved parking area without operating and moving said vehicle.
   (e)   Detached garages or other accessory buildings shall not be located
within any required front yard.
   (f)   For the purpose of side yard requirements, the following dwellings
shall be considered as one building occupying one lot provided such dwellings
have common party walls:
   (1)   Two-family dwellings;
   (2)   Three-family dwellings;
   (3)   Four-family dwellings; and
   (4)   Row houses which are not more than two (2) rooms deep.
   (g)   In computing the depth of a rear yard for any building rearing upon an
alley, one-half (1/2) the width of such alley may be considered as a portion of
the required rear yard for the purposes of this chapter.
   (h)   For dwellings permitted above nonresidential structures, the front,
side, and rear yard requirements for residential uses shall not be applicable
provided all yard requirements for the zone in which such structure is located
are complied with.

Sec. 9-4.2504. Front yards.
   (a)   Residential zones.
   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in Section
9-4.2510 of this article, in the R-A, R-E, R-1, R-2, and R-3 Zones, each lot
shall have a front yard of not less than twenty (20') feet.
   (2)   In the R-0 Zone each lot shall have a front yard of not less than
twenty-five (25%) percent of the depth of the lot, except that such front yard
need not exceed thirty-five (35') feet.
   (b)   Commercial zones.
   (1)   In the C-2 Zone every lot shall have a front yard of not less than
twenty (20') feet, unless waived by the Commission.
   (2)   In the C-1 and C-3 Zones no permanent building or structure shall be
located within one hundred (100') feet of the center line of any public road,

dwelling units pursuant to Article 45.
   (1)   Detached accessory buildings, including garages, or parking spaces
required in the absence of garages, may occupy not more than twenty-five (25%)
percent of a required rear yard provided such building is not more than fifteen
(15') feet in height and the wall of such building or parking space is located
not less than six (6') feet from the nearest wall of a main building on the
same lot or a contiguous lot.
   (2)   Except for the R-3 Zone, no accessory building in excess of fifteen
(15') feet in height shall occupy any part of a required rear yard.
   (3)   In the case of reversed frontage, no accessory building shall be
erected nearer than six (6') feet to the line of the abutting lot to the rear
thereof.
   (4)   On the rear one-third (1/3) of a lot the walls of an accessory
building not used for human habitation may be built to within five (5') feet of
the interior lot line and the rear lot line, but on a corner lot the accessory
building shall observe the stated side yard setback requirement on the street
side.
   (5)   A breezeway connecting a main building to an accessory building may be
permitted. Such breezeway shall remain open on one side and shall not be
considered part of the main building.
   (b)   Accessory buildings in front yards on through lots. In any case where
a through lot has a depth not more than one hundred forty (140') feet,
accessory buildings not exceeding fifteen (15') feet in height may be located
in one of the required front yards provided every portion of such accessory
building is not less than ten (10') feet from the nearest front line.
   (c)   Covered patios. A covered patio, attached or unattached, which is
enclosed on not more than three (3) sides may extend into the required rear
yard provided the distance between the rear property line and the patio at the
nearest point is not less than ten (10') feet.
   (d)   Architectural features. Eaves, cornices, canopies, belt courses,
sills, buttresses, or other similar architectural features may project into
required yards provided such extensions shall not be nearer than two (2') feet
to any rear or side line of the lot or parcel. Where more than one building is
located on the same lot or parcel, such features shall not be nearer than two
(2') feet to a line midway between the main walls of such buildings.
   (e)   Chimneys and fireplaces. Masonry chimneys and fireplaces may project
into required yards not more than two (2') feet provided such chimneys or
fireplaces shall not be nearer than three (3') feet to any side line or the lot
or parcel. Where more than one building is located on the same lot or parcel,
such chimneys or fireplaces shall not be nearer than three (3') feet to a line
midway between the main walls of such buildings.
   (f)   Balconies, fire escapes, and stairways. Open, unenclosed stairways or
balconies not covered by roofs or canopies may extend into required rear yards
not more than four (4') feet and into required front yards not more than two
and one-half (2-1/2') feet.
   (g)   Landings and porches. Uncovered porches, platforms, or landings which
do not extend above the level of the first floor of the building may extend
into required yards not more than six (6') feet; provided, however, an open-
work railing not more than two and one-half (2-1/2’) feet in height may be
installed or constructed on such porch, platform, or landing.
   (h)   Depressed ramps. Open-work fences, hedges, guard railings, or other
landscaping or architectural devices for safety protection around depressed
ramps may be located in required yards provided such devices are not more than
three and one-half (3-1/2’) feet in height.
   (i)   Fences and walls.
   (1)   General. A fence, wall or hedge not to exceed six (6’) feet in height
may be located or maintained along the side or rear lot lines, but may not be
located closer than ten (10’) feet from the front lot line. A fence, wall or
hedge may be placed in the front yard as allowed by the applicable zone if it
does not have a height of more than three (3’) feet, except as allowed along
side lot lines as stated above or otherwise provided herein. The height of a
fence, wall or hedge shall be measured from the adjacent grade level facing the
public right of way, except that the height of a fence, wall or hedge along a
side or rear lot line that is sloped shall be measured from the highest side of
the adjacent grade level. The height limits of this subsection may be exceeded
as authorized in Subsection
9-4.2805(b)(8). In cases of corner lots, such fence, wall or hedge also shall
not extend into the side yard required adjacent to the side street nor into
that portion of the rear yard abutting the intersection street, in which
portion accessory buildings are prohibited, unless that fence, wall or hedge is
found by the Traffic Engineer and the Community Development Director to provide
adequate vehicular and pedestrian sight visibility which shall be maintained at
all intersections of public streets and private driveways and that adequate
means are available to offset the visual impact of the fence, wall or hedge.
Such a fence review shall be initiated upon application to the Community
Development Director. This subsection shall not prohibit the erection of fences
enclosing school sites if such fences do not extend beyond the front line of
the main building. This subsection shall not apply to a fence or wall required
by any law or regulation of the State, or any agency thereof.
   (2)   Noise attenuation along arterial roads. Notwithstanding subsection (1)
above, a fence or wall not to exceed nine (9' 0") feet in height may be located
or maintained along a rear property line, or in the case of a corner lot, a
side property line, when the Community Development Director finds that the
criteria listed in this subsection are satisfied. Any fence or wall not meeting
the following criteria may be authorized by the Planning Commission.
   (i)   The location of the fence or wall is adjacent to an arterial that is
designated as a four (4) or more lane road in the Circulation Element of the
General Plan; and,
   (ii)   The additional height and material is necessary and effective to
attenuate noise at the site to acceptable levels as specified as goals in the
Noise Element of the General Plan; and,
   (iii)   The additional height will not interfere with adequate sight
visibility of pedestrians or vehicles entering, leaving, or passing the
property or adjacent properties as determined by the Traffic Engineer and
Community Development Director; and,
   (iv)   Any fence or wall shall be terraced unless a terraced fence or wall
design is not feasible due to physical constraints related to the location of
the fence or wall; and,
   (v)   The materials and colors of a fence or wall are consistent or
compatible with the materials and colors of the existing approved fences or
walls and/or tract perimeter fences or walls; and,
   (vi)   A fence or wall is decorative and utilizes architectural elements,
including but not limited to, pilasters, planters, horizontal bands, or
landscaping, to soften the mass of the structure. Materials such as smooth
vinyl or untreated cinderblock may not be used unless determined to be
consistent with existing fence/wall design along the perimeter.
   (j)   Pilasters. Freestanding decorative pilasters in the required front
yard area of single-family detached residences shall be permitted as follows:
   (1)   The design of pilasters shall take into consideration existing site
conditions, i.e., topography, existing landscaping, etc., regarding their
location and proportional relationship of the pilaster’s width, depth and
height.
   (2)   The side of the pilaster that faces the public right-of-way shall not
exceed forty-eight (48”) inches in height, measured from the adjacent grade
level to the top of the pilaster cap. The use of ornamental features, including
lighting fixtures, shall not be included in the height of the pilaster.
   (3)   The height of light fixtures or ornamental features on top of the
pilasters shall not exceed one-half (1/2) the overall height of the pilaster.
Lighting fixtures shall be designed and selected to avoid excessive spillage of
illumination onto public right-of-way and adjacent properties, by using a
subdued light source in keeping with the character of the residential
neighborhood.
   (4)   The footprint of any pilaster shall be in proportion to its height,
and shall not exceed twenty-four (24”) inches nor be less than sixteen (16”)
inches in width.
   (5)   The spacing of pilasters shall not be less than twelve (12’) feet
measured from the exterior face. When pilasters are used as a sidewalk entry
features, the spacing shall not be less than four (4’) feet.
   (6)   The height of decorative solid fencing/walls between pilasters shall
not exceed thirty (30”) inches. However, wrought-iron fencing between pilasters
either as an addition to the thirty (30”) inches solid fencing, or as the only
fencing used, with a height that matches the height of the pilasters, shall be
permitted.
   (7)   Decorative caps shall be provided on top of pilasters and also on any
proposed walls between pilasters.
   (8)   Colors and materials of pilasters and any other proposed fencing shall
be compatible with the principal residence being served.
   (9)   If address numbers are to be installed on the pilasters, the letters
shall be a minimum of six (6”) inches in height.
   (10)   A building permit shall be required for pilasters exceeding thirty
(30”) inches in height. An electrical permit shall also be required if lighting
fixtures are proposed.
   (11)   The placement of driveway gates with pilasters shall comply with
Public Works Department’s Plate E-1 regarding design standards for residential
driveways.
   (12)   The review and approval of pilasters shall be in accordance with
Section
9-4.1803 of the Architectural Design Review Ordinance of the Thousand Oaks
Municipal Code.
   (13)   Where corner lots occur, such pilaster(s) shall not extend into the
required side yard adjacent to the side street nor encroach into that portion
of the rear yard abutting the intersecting street, unless the design and
placement of the pilaster(s) are found by the City Traffic Division and the
Community Development Department not to impair the required vehicular and
pedestrian sight visibility which shall be maintained at all intersections of
public streets, including sidewalks and private driveways.

Sec. 9-4.2509.1. Setback reductions in residential areas.
   After holding a noticed public hearing, the Planning Commission may grant a
yard setback reduction for structures in residential zones as provided in this
section.
   (a)   When the distance between the two (2) structures is or will be equal
to the combined normally required setbacks for both adjacent yard areas, and
the structures are likely to remain such a distance apart, a reduction of up to
one hundred (100%) percent of a yard setback requirement may be granted,
provided the Commission finds that:
   (1)   No other reasonable design and layout of the proposed structure can be
accommodated on the lot and such a reduced setback is necessary for any viable
use of that property; or
   (2)   Because of a prior mistake in the construction of the structure, an
encroachment into the normally required setback area occurred, and the owner
purchased the property without knowledge of such an illegal encroachment, and,
further, that an unreasonable hardship will be incurred by the property owner
in removing the encroachment.
   (b)   The likelihood of the structure’s separation distance remaining as
found above is established when the adjacent property is burdened with an
easement, deed restriction, zoning restriction or similar development
restriction that would legally prevent the construction of any structure,
excluding fences, within this minimum separation area.
   In authorizing the setback reductions described in this section, the
Commission may impose such conditions, development standards, and restrictions
as it deems necessary to protect the public safety, health and welfare.
(§ 3, Ord. 1136-NS, eff. February 18, 1992)
 Sec. 9-4.2509.2. Electrical, barbed wire, broken glass, etc. in fencing.
   (a)   Electrical charges to fencing. No fence installed or maintained in the
City shall be charged with electricity for security or any other reasons except
as provided in this section. Electrically charged fences may be approved by the
Community Development Department for farming, ranching, or the keeping of
horses in the R-A, R-E or R-O zones, provided, the amount of electrical charge
is only sufficient to restrain the animal without harm to humans, and such
fences are posted with warning signs of a size equal to two feet by two feet
(2’ x 2’), and placed no greater than at twenty (20’) foot intervals and such
other warnings or restrictions as determined appropriate by that department.
   (b)   Barbed wire, razor wire, other security measures. No fence or wall
shall include barbed wire, razor wire, or other types of sharp, pointed wire,
metal or glass in any zone except as provided in this section. Barbed wire is
authorized for oil and gas facilities as set forth in Section
9-4.2814, and for the keeping of livestock animals or horses in the R-A, R-
E and R-O zones if within a recognized agricultural preserve, or the fence has
been approved as part of a farm animal permit, special use permit or other
entitlement. In the manufacturing/industrial and commercial zones, barbed wire,
razor wire or other types of security devices may be utilized in a fence or
wall, provided:
   (1)   That type of fence is authorized as part of a development permit or
special use permit;
   (2)   The barbed wire, razor wire or other sharp security device does not
project over the public right-of-way;
   (3)   The barbed wire, razor wire or other sharp security devices are
securely placed on top of a six (6') foot high, or taller, chain link fence,
wrought iron fence, or other types of approved fencing or wall;
   (4)   The barbed wire, razor wire or other sharp security device does not
project over any exterior property line, and if the property abuts a
residentially zoned or used parcel, such material shall be at least six (6')
feet over the ground level of the abutting parcel;
   (5)   The barbed wire, razor wire or other sharp security device is not
observable from any public right-of-way or road, however, screening material or
landscaping may be used;
   (6)   Warning signs are posted in conspicuous locations.
   (c)   Security fencing standards and conditions. The Community Development
Department may develop other written standards and criteria, consistent with
this section, for the placement of any fencing mentioned in this section, and
describing where such fencing must be located on the parcel in relationship to
street frontage, and such standards needed to mitigate any aesthetic impact
caused by that fencing.
(§ 1, Ord. 1030-NS, eff. June 27, 1989)
Sec. 9-4.2509.5. Area requirements for accessory buildings.
   (a)   Accessory buildings, excluding any secondary residential accessory
dwelling units authorized by Article 45, in all R Zones shall not have a floor
area in excess of six hundred (600) square feet nor shall any accessory
building in any R Zone have a floor area in excess of fifty (50%) percent of
the footprint of the principal or main building unless otherwise authorized as
part of a residential planned development permit in the RPD and HPD zones or
subject to the approval of an Administrative Approval in the R-A, R-E, R-O, R-
1 and R-2 Zones in accordance with Section

   (a)   Reverse-corner lots. Interior side yards for reverse-corner lots of
record prior to being rezoned from Zone A-4 shall be as provided as prescribed
in this chapter. However, in such cases the side yard requirements for the
street side shall not be interpreted to reduce the buildable width of such lots
to less than twenty-eight (28') feet nor to prohibit accessory buildings where
such prohibition cannot reasonably be complied with.
   (b)   Wedge-shaped lots. The required width of wedge-shaped lots shall be
measured along the required front and rear yard lines which are set back the
required distance from property lines. The resultant front and rear yard areas
shall be deemed to be the areas required by the provisions of this chapter.
Permitted accessory buildings or structures may not occupy more than forty
(40%) percent of such resultant rear yards. Wedge-shaped lots shall conform to
all the other requirements of this chapter for the zone in which they are
located.

Sec. 9-4.2512. Lot splits.
   (a)   One main building per lot. All buildings hereafter erected or
structurally altered shall be located on the lot as set forth in this chapter,
and in no case shall there be more than one main building and its accessory
buildings on one lot except as expressly authorized in a particular zone and as
set forth in this section.
   (b)   Individual parcels of land. Every individual parcel of land which was
of record on April 18, 1947, shall be deemed to be one lot, and not more than
one main building shall be permitted on such parcel except as authorized and
provided for the particular zone in which located or as required by the
provisions of Section 9-4.2708 of Article 27 of this chapter. Such parcel may
not be divided into more than four (4) parcels unless and until a subdivision
tract map is recorded with the County Recorder in the manner provided by law
for subdivisions. However, if such parcel contains an area of fourteen thousand
(14,000) square feet or more, but not more than two (2) acres, an additional
separate building may be erected for each seven thousand (7,000) square feet of
area contained in such parcel if located in any R Zone; provided, however, all
other regulations pertaining to such R Zone shall be complied with.
   (c)   Creation of nonconforming lots. Every individual parcel of land which
was of record on April 18, 1947, shall be deemed to be one lot. No such lot

or street indicated as a major or secondary highway on the circulation element
of the County master or general plan (also known as the General Plan of
Highways) and for which there is on file in the office of the City Engineer a
City Engineer’s map of such size, scale, and detail that the exact location on
the ground which the highway, road, or street is to occupy can be ascertained.
   (b)   No person shall hereafter erect, without a permit, any building or
structure, other than a temporary structure costing less than Five Hundred and
no/100ths ($500.00) Dollars, within the area of any mapped highway.
   (c)   Prior to issuing any building permit, the Building Official, or such
other person as may be appointed, shall examine the circulation element of the
County master or general plan (also known as the General Plan of Highways) and
determine if there is on file in the office of the City Engineer a City
Engineer’s map indicating the exact location on the ground which the mapped
road or highway is to occupy. If he finds that the building or structure
proposed to be erected will lie within the boundaries of any mapped highway, he
shall grant a permit if the cost of the proposed building or structure is Five
Hundred and no/100ths ($500.00) Dollars or less. Otherwise, he shall refuse
such permit and notify the owner or applicant for the permit the reason for
such refusal.
   (d)   Any person aggrieved by the refusal of a building permit under this
section may request a hearing on the matter before the Commission. Before
taking any action authorized by this section, the Commission shall hold a
hearing at which the applicant and any other interested persons shall have an
opportunity to be heard. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be
mailed to the applicant, property owner of record, and any other interested
persons not later than ten (10) days prior to the date of such hearing. Written
notice of the time and place of the hearing shall also be given to the City
Engineer, Community Development Director, Buliding Official, and City Manager.
   (e)   The Commission shall authorize the granting of the permit if it finds
any of the following is true:
   (1)   That the property on which the mapped highway location is a part is of
such nature that the owner of the land will be substantially damaged by the
refusal to grant the permit;
   (2)   That the property will not earn a reasonable return on the owner’s
investment unless the construction is authorized; or
   (3)   That in balancing the interests of the public in preserving the
integrity of mapped highways against the interests of the owner of the land in
using his property, the granting of the permit is required by considerations of
justice and equity.
   (f)   The Commission shall not authorize the granting of the permit if it
finds any of the following is true:
   (1)   That the owner of the land will not be substantially damaged by
locating the proposed structure on his land other than within the bed of the
mapped highway; or
   (2)   That in balancing the interests of the public in preserving the
integrity of mapped highways against the interests of the owner of the land in
using his property, the resulting disadvantages to the City would be
unreasonable and disproportionate to the advantages of the owner from using the
property.
   (g)   Any owner or applicant dissatisfied with the decision of the
Commission may appeal the decision to the Council in the manner set forth in
Section
9-4.2807 of Article 28 of this chapter.

denial of an application for a permit by the Commission or the Council, written
notice of the denial shall be sent to the applicant at the address shown on his
application and to the property owner of record. At the expiration of a period
of six (6) months after the date of mailing of any such notice, the permit
shall be issued upon the request of the owner or applicant if the City has not
acquired such property or has not instituted legal proceedings to acquire such
property.
   (i)   The City has adopted a circulation element of the County master or
general plan (also known as the General Plan of Highways) in conformity with
the provisions of Chapter 3 of Division 7 of the Government Code of the State
containing many miles of proposed County major and secondary highways.

any person with a disability or a developer of housing for people with
disabilities, when the application of a land use, zoning or building
regulation, policy or practice acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities.
A person with a disability is a person who has a mental or physical disability
as defined in Section 12926 of the Government Code (California Fair Employment
and Housing Act).
   (c)   Application Requirements. A request for a reasonable accommodation

being made requires some other discretionary approval (including, but not
limited to, a precise plan of design), the applicant may file the request for
concurrent review with the other application for discretionary approval.
   (d)   Review Authority.
   (1)   A request for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by the
Community Development Director, or designee, if no approval is sought other
than the reasonable accommodation. The Community Development Director, or

accommodation concurrently with the decision on the other discretionary
application.
   (e)   Findings and Conditions of Approval.
   (1)   Findings. The written decision to grant a request for reasonable
accommodation shall be based on consideration of the following findings:
   (i)   That the housing which is the subject of the request will be used by a
person with disabilities;
   (ii)   That the request is necessary to make the housing which is the
subject of the request available to a person with a disability;
   (iii)   That the request would not impose an undue financial or
administrative burden on the City;
   (iv)   That the request would not require a fundamental alteration in the
nature of a City program or law, including but not limited to land use and

   (v)   That there is no alternative reasonable accommodation that would be
less at variance with City standards.
   (2)   Conditions of Approval. In granting a request for reasonable
accommodation, the reviewing authority may impose any conditions of approval
deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation
complies with the required findings.
   (f)   Appeals. A determination to grant or deny a request for reasonable
accommodation by the Community Development Director may be appealed to the
Planning Commission in compliance with Section
9-4.2807 (b) and (c) and a determination by the Planning Commission may be
appealed to City Council in compliance with Section

Sec. 9-4.2607. Amount of fees in lieu of land dedication.
   Where a fee is required to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the amount of
such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which
would otherwise be required to be dedicated pursuant to the provisions of
Section
9-4.2606 of this article. The amount of such fee shall be a sum equal to the
fair market value of the amount of land, including full street improvements,
either dedicated or to be maintained by a property owner, that would otherwise
be required to be dedicated pursuant to the provisions of Section
9-4.2606 of this article. The fee shall be calculated by multiplying the
applicable percentage from the Density Formula set forth in Section
9-4.2606 of this article by the total gross acreage and, in turn, multiplying
this product by the fair market value per acre and including the actual cost
for the full street improvements; however, where a permit includes a Primary or
controlled access Secondary Highway as designated on the Circulation Element of
the General Plan, the land area and actual costs for street improvements in
excess of the design standards for a collector street shall not be included in
this fee calculation.
   The fair market value shall be determined prior to the issuance of the
building permit for R-P-D and H-P-D projects and the certificate of occupancy
for T-P-D projects in accordance with the following:
   (a)   The fair market value shall be determined by the application of
accepted assessment practices, and the initial determination may be based upon
the current assessed value, modified equal to market value, in accordance with
the standards established by the current practices of the County Assessor; or
   (b)   If either the City or the developer objects to such evaluation, either
party may, at the developer’s expense, obtain an appraisal of the property by a
neutral qualified real estate appraiser approved by the City, which appraisal
shall be considered in addition to the provisions of subsection (a) of this
section by the Council in reaching its decision as to fair market value; or
   (c)   The City and the developer may agree to the fair market value.

Sec. 9-4.2608. Credit for private open space.
   Where private open space for park and recreation purposes is provided in a
proposed development and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by
the future residents of the property, such areas may be credited against the
requirement of dedication for park and recreation purposes, as set forth in
Section
9-4.2606 of this article, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as set forth
in Section
9-4.2607 of this article, provided the Commission finds it is in the public
interests to do so and the following standards are met:
   (a)   That yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open areas required to be
maintained by the zoning and building provisions of this Code shall not be
included in the computation of such private open space; and
   (b)   That the private ownership and maintenance of the open space is
adequately provided for by written agreement; and
   (c)   That the use of the private open space is restricted for park and
recreational purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of
the future owners of the property within the development and which cannot be
defeated or eliminated without the consent of the Commission; and
   (d)   That the proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use
for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as
size, shape, topography, geology, access, and the location of the private open
space land; and
   (e)   That facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial
accordance with the provisions of the Recreation Element of the General Plan
and are approved by the Commission.
   The Council, upon a recommendation of the Commission, shall adopt more
specific guidelines and standards to be utilized in determining the actual
percentage of credit that may be given for private park and recreational
facilities in any proposed development. Such guidelines and standards shall be
adopted as a resolution by the Council, upon a recommendation by the
Commission, only after a public hearing, noticed and conducted in the manner
required for zone changes, in accordance with the provisions of Article 29 of
this chapter.
(§ III, Ord. 376-NS, eff. May 31, 1973)
Sec. 9-4.2609. Choice of dedication of land or payment of fees or both.
   (a)   Procedure. The procedure for determining whether the developer is to
dedicate land, pay a fee, or both shall be as follows:
   (1)   Determination by the developer. At the time of filing an R-P-D, H-P-D,
or T-P-D permit application for approval, the owner of the property shall, as a
part of the filing, indicate whether he desires to dedicate property for park
and recreational purposes or whether he desires to pay a fee in lieu thereof.
If he desires to dedicate land for this purpose, he shall designate the area
thereof on the plot plan as submitted.
   (2)   Action of the City. At the time of an R-P-D, H-P-D, or T-P-D permit
approval, the Commission or the Council, upon the advice of the Conejo
Recreation and Park District, shall determine, as a part of such approval,
whether to require a dedication of land within the development, the payment of
a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both.
   (3)   Prerequisites for the issuance of building permits or certificates of
occupancy for R-P-D, H-P-D, or T-P-D permits. Where dedication or fees are
required, the park property shall be dedicated to, or the fees shall be
deposited with, the Conejo Recreation and Park District, or to the City if the
District does not have any jurisdiction for the property, prior to the issuance
of the building permit, in the case of R-P-D and H-P-D permits, or the
certificate of occupancy, in the case of T-P-D permits. If the Conejo
Recreation and Park District refuses to accept either the park dedication or
the fees, such dedication shall be conveyed to the City or its assignees and/or
the fees will be held by the City in a trust fund for the Conejo Recreation and
Park District. Open space covenants for private park or recreational facilities
shall be submitted to, and approved by, the City Attorney and Community
Development Director and be recorded prior to the issuance of the building
permit, in the case of R-P-D and H-P-D permits, or the certificate of occupancy
in the case of T-P-D permits.
   (b)   Space determination. Whether the Commission or the Council, upon the
advice of the Conejo Recreation and Park District, accepts the land dedication
or elects to require the payment of fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of
both, shall be determined by consideration of the following:
   (1)   The Recreation Element of the General Plan;
   (2)   The topography, geology, access, and location of the land in the
development available for dedication;
   (3)   The size and shape of the development and the land available for
dedication;
   (4)   The location of existing or proposed park sites and trailways; and
   (5)   The desirability of developing the land proposed for dedication for
park and recreational purposes as determined by a schematic site plan submitted
by the subdivider.
   The determination of the Commission as to whether land shall be dedicated,
or whether a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof shall be final and
conclusive, except in the case of H-P-D permits, unless appealed to the
Council.
(§ III, Ord. 376-NS, eff. May 31, 1973)
Sec. 9-4.2610. Designation of development time.
   At the time park land is dedicated or fees are paid, the Council, upon the
advice of and written agreement with the Conejo Recreation and Park District,
shall designate the probable time when the development of the park and
recreational facilities shall be commenced and where the specific fees wills be
utilized for park purposes. If such agreement has not been consummated at the
time of the issuance of a building permit, the fees will be held in a trust
fund for the District until the agreement has been adopted by the Council.
(§ III, Ord. 376-NS, eff. May 31, 1973)
Sec. 9-4.2611. Limitations on use of land and fees.
   The land and fees received pursuant to the provisions of this article shall
be used only for the purpose of providing park and recreational facilities to
serve the property for which received, and the location of the land and the
amount of the fees shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park
and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the property.

Article 27. Nonconforming Buildings and Uses
Sec. 9-4.2701. Nonconforming uses of land.
   (a)   Abatement of use when no main building is involved. Where no main
buildings are used in connection with the nonconforming use of land, or where
the only buildings used are accessory or incidental to such use, the
nonconforming use of such land shall be discontinued not later than three (3)
years after such use becomes nonconforming, and all uses thereafter shall
conform to the regulations of the applicable zone classification and the
provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   Expansion. A nonconforming use of land shall not be expanded of
extended in any way, either on the same or any adjoining land.
   (c)   Discontinuance or change. The discontinuance of a nonconforming use of
land for more than ninety (90) days shall constitute abandonment and
termination of the nonconforming use, and thereafter the use of the land shall
conform to the regulations of the applicable zone classification. The City
shall provide written notice to property owner that the use is abandoned and
terminated and that future use of the property must conform to the applicable
zoning regulations.
   (d)   Nonconforming keeping of animals. The nonconforming housing, keeping,
pasturing or confining of any animal within territory annexed to the City shall
be terminated within ninety (90) days of the effective date of the annexation,
and keeping of animals shall comply with the applicable City zoning standards
from that time forward.
   (e)   Nonconforming fences. Where no main buildings are used in connection
with the nonconforming use of land, and the nonconforming use is the
construction or maintenance of a fence, such nonconforming use shall be
discontinued not later than ninety (90) days after such use becomes
nonconforming.

4, Ord. 1230-NS, eff. April 18, 1995)
Sec. 9-4.2702. Nonconforming buildings: Nonresidential.
   (a)   Intent and purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish
regulations pertaining to modifications to existing nonresidential buildings
and structures and their associated on-site improvements which are
nonconforming with respect to existing development standards and regulations.
In general, it is the policy of the City to encourage the continued exterior
upgrading and proper maintenance of nonconforming nonresidential buildings, and
their associated parking areas and facilities. When a modification to a
nonconforming nonresidential building is requested, the City shall require
compliance with current development and zoning standards commensurate with the
extent of improvements proposed to upgrade the building and/or property. This
section establishes graduated improvement requirement for these buildings and
properties, which are subject to the Design Review Requirements set forth in
Article 18 of Title 9 of this Code.
   (b)   General. Except in residential zones and as permitted by State law,
nonconforming nonresidential buildings or structures may be maintained subject
to the following conditions:
   (1)   If any nonconforming building or structure is demolished or destroyed
voluntarily, every building or structure occupying the property thereafter, and
any uses of such buildings, structures, or premises shall conform to the
current standards and requirements of the applicable zone.
   (2)   If any nonconforming building or structure is demolished or destroyed
involuntarily by an explosion, flood, fire, tornado, hurricane or any other
natural occurrence, any new building or structure on the premises may be
constructed according to the zoning standards and requirements existing at the
time the demolished structures were originally constructed.
   (3)   Nothing in this section prohibits or is intended to prohibit
maintenance or repair to the exterior walls or roof of any nonconforming
building, which work does not alter the building’s architectural design or
enlarge the size of the structure.
   (c)   Exterior building upqrading. The addition of exterior architectural
design features to existing nonconforming buildings and structures, with no
expansion of the existing floor area of the building, is permitted subject only
to the review and approval by the City of an Administrative Action (AA)
pursuant to Section
9-4.2805 of this Code. To assure compliance with the City’s architectural
design review guidelines, the following conditions shall be met as conditions
of approval of an Administrative Action (AA):
   (1)   Existing nonconforming zoning aspects of the building and site
improvements may be allowed to continue, but the degree of nonconformance shall
not be increased;
   (2)   Any unpaved parking area in the site serving the building shall be
paved and striped in accordance with the specifications of Article 24 of Title
9 of this Code (off-street parking);
   (3)   All corrective work must be undertaken to remove any existing
deficiencies with respect to Title 8 of this Code (Building Regulations) which
the Building Official and/or his/her designee finds may endanger public safety;
   (4)   Relief from full compliance with the provisions of Article 18 of Title
9 of this Code and the Architectural Design Guidelines referenced therein may
be granted by the Community Development Director as determined necessary to
achieve the general purpose of this chapter.
   (d)   Building additions and/or expansions.
   (1)   A one-time addition or expansion to a nonconforming building not to
exceed the lesser of ten (10%) percent of the existing gross building floor
area, or eight thousand (8,000) square feet, may be approved as a minor
modification to the project’s entitlement by the Community Development
Director. In approving said modification, the Director may waive full
compliance with the Architectural Design Guidelines referenced in Article 18 of
Title 9 of this Code. Furthermore, the following modified standards may be
imposed by the Director on the modification request:
   (i)   Parking. The number of on-site parking spaces may be retained at the
current parking ratio found on the property. Reductions to these pre-existing
parking spaces may be made to facilitate new parking spaces for the physically
challenged and to correct safety, landscaping and site visibility requirements.
In addition, up to one hundred (100%) percent of the spaces may be compact
spaces without the submittal of a special use permit.
   (ii)   New parking. The required number of parking spaces for the new
building additions and/or expansions to a nonconforming building, may be
reduced by ten (10%) percent from the parking requirements set forth in Section
9-4.2902 of this Code.
   (iii)   Building setback, yard area, landscaping. The existing building
setback, yard area, and landscaping may be retained to accommodate building
enlargement to the nonconforming building and may be reduced up to fifty (50%)
percent from the applicable standards. If landscaping setback either existing
or created would be three (3') feet in width or less, then a one hundred (100%)
percent setback reduction could be granted, if such landscaping would be
ineffective in the opinion of the Community Development Director.
   (2)   If the proposed addition and/or expansion to an existing nonconforming
building or structure exceeds the lesser of ten (10%) percent of the total
gross building floor area or eight thousand (8,000) square feet, the proposed
addition and/or expansion shall comply with the currently adopted zoning
standards and zoning requirements, by filing the applicable modification
application to the project’s entitlement.

shall be the purpose of the Commission and the Council to determine the
reasonable unamortized value of such nonconforming building or structure and to
make an allowance of not less than two and one-half (21/2%) percent per annum
of the original cost in determining the date by which such nonconforming
building or structure shall be removed or converted to a conforming status.
   (c)   If any nonconforming building or structure is demolished or destroyed
involuntarily by an explosion, flood, fire, tornado, hurricane or any other
natural occurrence, such demolished or destroyed structures may be
rehabilitated or reconstructed according to the zoning standards and
requirements existing at the time the structures were originally constructed.
If the building or structure was originally constructed prior to incorporation
of the City of Thousand Oaks, the zoning standards in effect during the year of

   (b)   The nonconforming use of a nonconforming building or structure may be
changed to another use of the same zoning classification
provided no exterior structural alterations are made therein.
   (c)   The nonconforming use of any nonconforming building may be changed to
any use which is permitted in a more restrictive zone, except no residential
use shall be permitted to replace nonconforming uses within commercial or
industrial zones. The sequence of such zones, the first being the most
restrictive and the last being the least restrictive, is as follows: R-1, R-O,
R-E, R-A, R-2, H-P-D, R-P-D, R-3, T-P-D, C-O, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, M-1, and M-2.

immediately prior to January 14, 1965, or whenever any amendment to this code
thereafter becomes effective if such existing use was not then in violation of
the law and the zoning amendment does not provide for a specific abatement
period. Whenever the zone classification is changed, any property being used
pursuant to a variance or permit may be used thereafter in the manner
authorized by such variance or permit as a nonconforming use for the duration
of the variance or permit.

Sec. 9-4.2707. Nonconforming lots.
   Any lot of record, prior to the effective date of an applicable zone
classification on the property, may be used as a building site even though the
lot has less lot area or lot width than the zoning requirements. This use is
authorized provided the owner of such lot does not own, in whole or in part,
any contiguous recorded lot as of March 22, 1973. Whenever two (2) or more
nonconforming lots, or a nonconforming and conforming adjoining lot, are held
in common ownership, the lots shall be merged in order to achieve the required
lot width and area requirements of the underlying zoning in accordance with
Article 1.5 of Chapter 3 of the Subdivision Map Act, commencing with California
Government Code Section 66451.10 and Sections
9-3.1210 through

variance application or other appropriate procedure. This merger clause shall
not apply to lots in common ownership where any portion of the rear lot lines
of each lot are coterminous and each lot has a separate street frontage. In the
case of lots containing less than the required width of the zone, the side yard
of any building may be reduced to not less than ten (10%) percent of the
average lot width or three (3') feet, whichever is greater, and all other yard
requirements shall be met. Furthermore, the minimum lot width and lot area of
any nonconforming lot to be used as a building site shall not be less than
thirty (30') feet in width or three thousand (3,000) square feet in area.

Article 28. Variances and Permits
Sec. 9-4.2801. Variances: Authorized.
   Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall be granted only when,
because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including size,
shape, topography, location, or surroundings, the strict application of the
provisions of this chapter deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by
other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning classifications.
   Any variance granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that
the adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special
privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the
vicinity and zone in which such property is situated.
   The applicant shall have the burden of proving the probative facts upon
which he relies to prove the existence of such ultimate facts. No written
findings of such ultimate facts need be made by the Commission unless the
applicant requests such findings before the Commission renders its decision.
   A variance shall not be granted for a parcel of property which authorizes a
use or activity which is not otherwise expressly authorized by the zoning
regulations governing the parcel of property.

Sec. 9-4.2802. Permits, filing applications and payment of fees.
   Whenever the provisions of this chapter, or Section

administrative action, or other approval for use or improvement of land, or a
variance from the standards set forth in this chapter, applications shall be
made and fees paid as follows:
   (a)   Filing applications. The Council shall prescribe the form and scope of
applications for permits, variances, and administrative actions. Such
applications shall be filed with the Community Development Department and shall
contain such information as may be required to evaluate the application and
provide notice of any hearings on it. No application shall be accepted as
complete for filing or processing unless it conforms to the requirements of
this chapter and contains the information, data, documents and exhibits
prescribed for said applications.
   (b)   Standing to file. An application for a permit, variance or
administrative action, or modification thereof, may be only filed by any of the
following:
   (1)   The owner of the property subject to the application;
   (2)   A person with a power of attorney from the owner of the property; or
   (3)   A lessee who holds a written lease, the terms of which authorize the
use for which the permit is sought.
   An application for a modification of any permit, variance, or administrative
action may also be filed by a member of the Commission or an authorized person
in the Community Development Department.
   (c)   Fees. An application for a permit or variance, or modification
thereof, shall be accompanied by the applicable fee as set forth by resolution
of the City Council. No part of said fee shall be refundable. No application
for a permit or variance, or modification thereof, shall be accepted for filing
or processing unless the fee is paid; provided, however, there shall be no fee
charged for an application for an administrative action necessary to correct
zoning violations discovered through reports of residential building records.
   (d)   Unless otherwise authorized in advance by the City Council, no
application for a permit or variance shall be deemed filed and accepted for
filing unless the use of land requested in said application is permitted by the
regulations of the underlying zone, Specific Plan (if any) and General Plan
designation in which the property is located. When the Council deems it to be
in the public’s interest or appropriate for the proper planning of the subject
property, the Council may allow an entitlement application authorized by this
article to be filed and processed concurrently with a proposed change of the
zone classification, Specific Plan, and/or General Plan or amendment thereto,
where such change is necessary to accommodate the proposed use. Where
concurrent processing is permitted, the required public hearings for the
entitlements and associated land use legislative actions shall be combined, and
the Council shall make the final decision on the entitlement application(s).

Sec. 9-4.2805. Administrative actions.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the administrative action procedure is to
provide a method whereby applications for certain minor modifications of the
provisions of this chapter may be considered and acted upon the by the
Director; provided, however, that any such application which is considered by
the Director to present a policy or precedent-setting matter shall be referred
to the Commission for determination.
   (b)   When applicable. The Community Development Director may grant
administrative actions in the following cases:
   (1)   A modification in the yard area provisions in residential zones up to
fifty (50%) percent of the requirements. In R-A, R-E, R-1, R-2, and R-
3 Residential Zones, when the distance between two (2) structures on separate
lots will be or is at least equal to the combined normally required setback
distances for both adjacent yard areas, a reduction of up to seventy-five (75%)
percent of a yard area setback requirement may be granted, provided the
Director finds that:
   (i)   This minimum distance is likely to remain and no other reasonable
design and layout of the proposed structure can be accommodated on the lot and
such a reduced setback is necessary for any viable use of the property, or
   (ii)   This minimum separation distance is likely to remain and, because of
a mistake in the construction of the structure, an encroachment into the
normally required setback area occurred where that owner was not a party to the
mistake and purchased the property without the knowledge of such an illegal
encroachment and an unreasonable hardship will be incurred by the property
owner in removing the encroachment.
   The likelihood of the structure’s separation distance remaining the same may
be established by the adjacent property being burdened with an easement, deed
restriction, zoning restriction or similar development restriction that would
legally prevent the construction of a structure within this separation area;
   (2)   A modification of the structure’s height requirements in residential
zones for up to a fifty (50%) percent increase in the height limits, when the
Director finds that:
   (i)   Because of the topography or separation of buildings, such added
height will not interfere with any view from an adjoining property and not
create an invasion into the privacy expectations of neighbors, or
   (ii)   The height is compatible with the structures in the surrounding
neighborhood;
   (3)   A modification of the park space and loading zone provisions up to ten
(10%) percent of the requirements;
   (4)   A modification to the number of animals or fowl allowed on a parcel up
to fifty (50%) percent of the maximum permitted if all the application conforms
to all the other provisions of this chapter;
   (5)   Underground utility waivers pursuant to Section
7-5.203 of this Code;
   (6)   A modification of area requirements for accessory buildings in the R-
A, R-E, R-O, R-1 and R-2 Zones, not to exceed fifty (50%) percent of the
maximum permitted floor area;
   (7)   A fixed term permit subject to those conditions, locations, standards
and criteria as adopted by the City Council resolution for the following
businesses:
   (i)   Mobile car washing (other than mobile car detailing),
   (ii)   Mobile auto repair and oil change businesses,
   (iii) Food and catering truck businesses.
   (8)   A modification in the height of fences or hedges in a front yard area
of any residential zone for up to fifty (50) percent of the requirements of
subsection
9-4.2509(i) when the Director finds that because of the topography of other
factors associated with the property the added height will not interfere with
the safety and welfare of pedestrians or vehicles entering, leaving or passing
the property or adjacent properties. A permit application requesting an
increase in the height of fences or hedges in any residential zone to exceed
fifty (50%) percent of the requirements of subsection
9-5.2509(i) may be granted by the Planning Commission.
   (c)   Prior to rendering a decision on an administrative action application,
a notice of application shall be provided as required by Sec.
9-12.202 of this title.
   (d)   If a written statement opposing the application or requesting an
administrative public hearing is submitted to the Community Development
Department prior to the proposed decision date as set forth in the notice of
application, the Director shall not proceed with rendering a decision on the
date specified in the notice of application, but shall instead schedule and
hold at least one administrative public hearing on the application in
accordance with the provisions of this article. Notice of the hearing shall be
provided in the manner required by Section
9-12.202 of this title.

further notice thereof shall be required; provided, however, that the person

An act or decision of the Commission shall require the concurrence of at least
a majority of those voting, except for an automatic referral of an entitlement
application to the City Council as the result of an unbreakable tie vote as
described in subsection (e) of this section.
   (d)   The person presiding at the hearing, or the Secretary of the Planning
Commission, as applicable, shall enter the decision on the application in the
minutes or records of the meeting, and shall communicate the decision to the
applicant, the appropriate public officials, and other interested parties.
   (e)   Where, due to the absence of a Commissioner(s), a tie vote is cast by
the Commission on a motion to approve, conditionally approve, or deny an
appeal, a permit or entitlement, or on the recommendation to the City Council
for the approval or denial on a permit or entitlement, (in the case of
applications being processed concurrently with legislative actions), and the
Commission is unable to break the tie vote situation through further
deliberation and votes during that meeting and immediately following the tie
vote, then the Commission shall reopen the hearing and continue the matter on
an open hearing basis until the next Commission meeting at which the tie might
be broken through the participation of the Commissioner(s) absent at the
original hearing.
   If the Commission determines that the tie cannot be broken within the next
twenty-one (21) days due to the announced conflict and abstention of a
Commissioner in the matter, a vacancy, or a long term absence, then no
entitlement shall be granted and the matter shall be automatically referred to
the City Council for a decision with no recommendation implied or made by the
Commission.

Sec. 9-4.2807. Appeals of administrative decisions to the Planning Commission.
   (a)   Except where provided otherwise by Section
9-4.1809 of this chapter, the applicant or any aggrieved person, or City
official may appeal a decision of the Community Development Director, or the
Director’s designee, rendered pursuant to Section
9-4.2804 or Section
9-4.2805 of this article to the Planning Commission. The City Council may, on
its own motion, elect to submit a decision by the Community Development
Director, or the Director’s designee, to the Planning Commission for
consideration and decision.
   (b)   Any appeal of an administrative decision made pursuant to this section
shall be filed with the Community Development Director within ten (10) calendar
days after an administrative decision is rendered. A referral by the City
Council of an administrative decision to the Planning Commission may be made by
majority vote of the City Council within ten (10) days after an administrative
decision is rendered. An appeal may be commenced only by filing with the
Community Development Department the required appeal form specifying the action
the appellant requests the Commission to take. A fee prescribed by Council
resolution shall be paid with the filing of the appeal; provided, however, no
filing fee shall be charged or collected for any appeal filed on behalf of the
City by a City officer, employee, board, or commission. An appeal of the
Planning Commission decision shall be filed in accordance with Section
9-4.2808.
   (c)   The Planning Commission shall conduct one public hearing on the appeal
in accordance with the requirements of this article, which hearing shall be
noticed as required by Chapter 12 of this title. The Commission shall consider
the matter de novo and shall approve, conditionally approve or deny the permit,
administrative action, or entitlement for which application was originally
made.
(§ 32, Ord. 1178-NS, eff. April 27, 1993, as amended by § 14, Ord. 1210-NS,
eff. May 24, 1994, and Part 7, Ord. 1446-NS, eff. October 25, 2005)
Sec. 9-4.2808. Appeals to Council.
   (a)   Filing. After the Commission has rendered a decision, and except as
provided otherwise in Section
9-4.1809 of this chapter, an appeal to the Council may be taken by the
applicant, any person aggrieved, or by any officer, department, board, or
commission of the City affected by the decision. Notwithstanding the definition
of “aggrieved person” in Section 9-4.203.8, any member of the City Council may
also be considered an aggrieved person affected by such a decision for purposes
of this section. An appeal shall be commenced by filing with the Community
Development Department, a notice of appeal which specifies the grounds of the
appeal and the action which the appellant wants the Council to take, within ten
(10) days of the date of the Commission’s decision. Appeals shall be submitted
on the forms provided for that purpose by the Community Development Department,
and shall be accompanied by the applicable fee set by Council resolution.
   Prior to and as a prerequisite of filing a notice of appeal, the appellant
shall obtain a certification from the department that an appeal is authorized
and that all information, documents, and maps required in connection with the
appeal have been filed with the City. That Department shall note the date and
time such notice was filed and forthwith send a copy to the City Attorney. A
fee, as prescribed by Council resolution, shall be paid to the Community
Development Department with the filing of each appeal. No filing fee shall be
charged for any appeal filed by a City officer, employee, board or Commission
member on behalf of the City.
   In addition, the City Council may, on its own motion within ten (10) days
after the final decision by the Planning Commission, elect to review and
consider any decision of the Planning Commission. No application for an appeal
need be filed by the City Council, or any member representative thereof, when
the City Council elects, by majority vote on its own motion, to review and
consider a decision of the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Hearings. After the City Clerk’s receipt of the Notice of Appeal on
the proper form, the City Clerk shall consider the pending City Council agenda
requests and, except for matters to be heard in connection with a tentative
subdivision map appeal, set the matter for a public hearing at the earliest
reasonable and available date, which shall be within at least ninety (90) days
of receipt of the filing. Hearings on permits connected with any appeal of a
tentative subdivision map decision shall be set for a date within thirty (30)
days of the filing. The City Clerk shall give notice of the hearing in the
manner required by Chapter 12 of this title.
   (c)   Records on appeals. The Community Development Director shall deliver
all papers and files constituting the record of the matter on appeal to the
Council at the time of the hearing unless otherwise directed by the Council.
   (d)   Hearings: Procedure. The Council may prescribe rules governing the
procedure of hearings for appeals conducted by it. A quorum for a hearing shall
consist of at least three (3) members. Any act or decision shall require the
concurrence of a majority of the members of the Council present. The Council
may refer a matter on appeal back to the Commission for further report,
information, or study.
   (e)   Appellate decisions. The Council shall announce its decision not more
than fifteen (15) calendar days following the termination of the hearing.
Whenever a matter has been referred back to the Commission, the Commission
shall report back and the Council shall announce its decision not more than
forty-five (45) calendar days following the day of such referral. The Council’s
decision shall thereafter be set forth in a resolution with any required
findings. In the event of a tie vote and the failure to break the tie vote
within fifteen (15) calendar days, the decision of the Commission shall be
reinstated and deemed rendered, and no further action or proceeding thereon may
be taken by the Council. The Council may sustain, modify, reject, or overrule,
wholly or partly, any decision by the Commission. It may impose such conditions
and limitations it deems necessary to assure that the general purpose and
intent of this chapter will be observed, the public interest, health, safety,
and welfare secured, and substantial justice will be done. The resolution shall
recite the conditions and limitations imposed. It need not recite any findings
for the decision unless the appellant so requests before the Council renders
its decision.
   (f)   Appellate decisions: Notice. Not later than ten (10) calendar days
following the day on which the decision is rendered, the City Clerk shall mail
a copy of the resolution to the appellant, the applicant, the Commission, and
the City official, department, board, or commission whose order, requirement,
permit, decision, or determination is the subject of the appeal.
   (g)   Finality of decisions: Procedural time limits. After rendition, a
decision shall become final and conclusive and shall not thereafter be
considered or modified or vacated. The time limits set forth in this section
are procedural only and do not limit or affect the jurisdiction and power of
the Council to act on any permit or variance.
   (h)   Appeal of certain conditions. Whenever any person appeals only certain
conditions or restrictions on a permit or variance, and the final action of the
Council is to grant the permit or variance, either in its original form or in a
modified form, all conditions and restrictions not appealed from shall be
automatically carried over and shall continue to govern and limit the permit or
variance, unless the action of the Council clearly indicates otherwise.

by the Commission or the Council in order to discharge its duties and
responsibilities pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

   All applications for any variance or permit within the scope of this
chapter, or for the modification or revocation of any variance or permit
heretofore or hereafter granted, shall be processed and reviewed in accordance
with the provisions of this article and chapter, and any section, subsection,
clause, or phrase in any other article of this chapter inconsistent with, or
contrary to, any provision of this article shall be processed and reviewed in
accordance with the provisions of this article and chapter, and any section,
subsection, clause, or phrase in any other article of this chapter inconsistent
with, or contrary to, any provision of this article shall be inapplicable to
such application.

Sec. 9-4.2811. Revocation.
   A petition for the revocation of any variance or permit may be filed by any
person or political entity aggrieved, or by any officer, department, board, or
commission of the City affected by the decision.
   Any variance or permit heretofore or hereafter granted may be revoked by the
Commission after appropriate proceedings, as provided in this article, for any
of the following causes:
   (a)   That any term or condition of the variance or permit has not been
complied with;
   (b)   That the property subject to the variance or permit, or any portion
thereof, is used or maintained in violation of any statute, law, or regulation;
   (c)   That the use for which the variance or permit was granted has not been
exercised for at least twelve (12) consecutive months, or has ceased to exist,
or has been abandoned; and
   (d)   That the use for which the variance or permit was granted has been so
exercised as to be detrimental to the public health or safety or as to
constitute a nuisance.
   After the revocation of a variance or permit, the property affected thereby
shall be subject to the regulations of the applicable zone classification. The
failure of the Commission or Council to revoke a variance or permit whenever
cause therefor exists or occurs shall not constitute a waiver of such right
with respect to any subsequent cause for revocation.
(§ 8163.11, T.O.O.C., as renumbered by § XIV, Ord. 173-NS, eff. November 5,
1970, and as renumbered by § 32 and amended by § 34, Ord. 1178-NS, eff. April
27, 1993)
Sec. 9-4.2812. Expiration.
   (a)   Expiration. Unless otherwise specified below or in the conditions of
the permit or variance, any variance or permit granted shall expire and become
null and void if not exercised or the use has not been inaugurated or the
construction of the structure has not been commenced and the use has not been
diligently pursued, within thirty-six (36) months after the date of issuance.
Residential planned development and hillside planned development permits
approved for land subject to a tentative tract shall expire on the date of the
expiration of that tentative tract. The date of issuance of a permit or
variance shall be defined as the date of the final approval of such permit or
variance by the Community Development Director, the Planning Commission, or
City Council, whichever is applicable. If the permit or variance is denied by
the Community Development Director or the Commission, and subsequently approved
on an appeal by the City Council, then the date of issuance shall be the date
such appeal was granted. After the expiration of a variance or permit, the
property affected thereby shall be subject to the regulations of the applicable
zone classification.
   (b)   Phased construction. The time periods for phased projects shall be
stated in the conditions of the permit so as to avoid a lapse of progressive
development following the completion of the preceding phase. If no condition is
imposed, the construction of the succeeding phase shall commence within twelve
(12) months after the completion of the previous phase, or the permit will
expire.
   (c)   Use inauguration. The inauguration of a permit or variance involving a
building or buildings shall be deemed to have occurred when the construction of
the structure’s foundation has been undertaken by the actual placing of the
construction materials in their permanent position and fastened in their
permanent manner. Inauguration may be otherwise defined by the Commission, the
Council or by the Community Development Director by a condition imposed on the
permit at the time of approval, issuance or prior to inauguration. Such
condition(s) may specify that other or further acts in the preparation for on-
site construction may constitute inauguration of the use, consisting of, but
not limited to: heavy on-site grading involving the substantial alteration of
the natural terrain; the significant installation of public improvements beyond
those normally required; the release of building permits authorizing at least
twenty (20%) percent of the total value of the work to be performed; or any
other major preparatory act prior to construction which is substantial in
nature.
   (d)   Diligent pursual required after inauguration. Following the
inauguration of the permit or variance as constituted by a condition or as
defined in this section, the completion of the project shall be diligently
pursued with continuous construction activity on the subject property. If, in
the judgment of the Community Development Director, the project is not being
diligently pursued to completion, the applicant shall be notified that the
permit or variance shall expire within thirty (30) days after the cessation of
activity on the site, and a time extension shall be obtained through the
appropriate procedures in order to allow further pursuit of the project.
   (e)   Time extensions.
   i.   A time extension may be approved as a minor modification to the
approved permit or variance for a period not to exceed twenty-four (24) months.
   ii.   A maximum of two (2) time extensions, not to exceed forty-eight (48)
months, may be approved by the Community Development Director. The applicant
may appeal the decision of the Director to the Planning Commission within
fifteen (15) days after the decision.
   iii.   Any time extension for a permit approved in conjunction with a
tentative tract map or land division which has not yet been recorded shall be
considered in conjunction with the time extension for the underlying tentative
map or land division.
   iv.   Any permit that has not expired and was approved in conjunction with a
tentative map or land division that receives an automatic extension of time
pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act shall receive an equivalent automatic
extension of time.

case may be, need not grant such variance or permit for all the land, property,
or uses requested in the application. In the absence of any provisions in a
variance or permit designating the land, property, or uses for which the
variance or permit is granted, the variance or permit shall be granted for the
land, property, and uses set forth in the application.

to any permit issued prior to November 30, 1961, shall apply to any drilling or
other activity commenced after November 30, 1961:
   (a)   Whenever the drilling or redrilling of any oil or gas well commenced

permittee, the derrick, portable drilling rig, and machinery or equipment used
to operate in connection with drilling shall be enclosed with fire-resistant
and soundproofing material.
   (b)   The exercise of any right granted by the permit shall conform in all
respects to the regulations and requirements of the Regional Water Pollution
Control Board No. 4 of the State, and all water, mud, oil, or any other
substances removed as waste material from the land for which the permit is
issued shall be deposited in a disposal site approved by the Commission and the
Regional Water Pollution Control Board of the State.
   (c)   No earthen sump shall be constructed or maintained within five hundred
(500') feet, and no drilling shall be permitted within one hundred (100') feet,
of any natural channel in which there is or may be flowing water.
   (d)   Within ninety (90) days after a well is producing, the derrick, all
boilers, and all other drilling equipment shall be removed from the premises
unless permission to store them on the premises is obtained from the
Commission.
   (e)   All sumps, debris basins, or depressions, ravines, gullies, barrancas,
or the like which are used for the impounding or depositing of water, mud, oil,
or any other fluid, semifluid, or any combination thereof, shall be fenced.
When any such place is located more than one-half (1/2) mile away from any
school, playground, or dwelling, such place shall be enclosed by a cattle fence
with wood or steel posts not less than four (4') feet above the ground with not
less than three (3) strands of barbed wire secured horizontally to posts. When
any such place is located within one-half (1/2) mile of any school, playground,
or dwelling, such place shall be enclosed by a wire fence of a wire mesh type
with a maximum of two (2") inches by four (4") inches opening, and such fence
shall be secured to steel posts not less than five (5') feet in height above
the ground, and such posts shall have forty-five (45) degree arms attached to
the top of the posts with three (3) strands of barbed wire attached thereto.
   (f)   No permanent buildings or structures shall be erected within one
hundred (100') feet of the boundaries or the right-of-way of any public street
or highway.
   (g)   The permittee shall at all times comply with the provisions of the
Public Resources Code of the State relating to the protection of underground
water supply and in connection with oil and gas extraction.
   (h)   Upon the abandonment of any well or the cessation of drilling
operations, all earthen sumps or other depressions containing drilling mud,

products into the land by disking, harrowing, and leveling to restore the land
to the condition existing prior to the issuance of the permit as nearly as
practicable so to do.
   (i)   Unless otherwise provided in the terms of a permit, the permit shall
expire no later than when the permittee’s ownership, lease, or other right to
develop the property in the manner described in the application is terminated.

   (1)   The Commission has approved the transfer;
   (2)   The Commission has been furnished satisfactory evidence of the
transfer;
   (3)   The transferee files with the Commission a writing wherein he
obligates himself to comply with every term and condition of the permit; and
   (4)   The transferee has filed an approved bond.
   (j)   No drilling or other uses for which the permit is granted shall be
commenced or continued unless and until the permittee has filed, and the
Commission has accepted, a bond in the penal amount of Two Thousand Five
Hundred and no/100ths ($2,500.00) Dollars for each well which is drilled or to
be drilled. Any operator may, in lieu of filing such bond for each well
drilled, redrilled, produced, or maintained, file a bond in the penal amount of
Ten Thousand and no/100ths ($10,000.00) Dollars to cover all operations
conducted in the City, conditioned upon the permittee well and truly obeying,
fulfilling, and performing each and every term and provision in the permit. In
the event of any failure by the permittee to perform or comply with any term or
provision thereof, the Commission may, by resolution, declare the bond
forfeited, and the sureties and principal shall be jointly and severally
obligated to pay forthwith the full amount of the bond to the City. The
forfeiture of any bond shall not insulate the permittee from liability in
excess of the sum of the bond for damages for injuries, expenses, or liability
suffered by the City from any breach by the permittee of any term or condition
of such permit or of any applicable law or of the bond. The transfer of the
permit, as provided in subsection (i) of this section, shall not be effective
unless and until the transferee has also complied with such condition for
posting an approved bond.
   (k)   All drilling and production operations shall be conducted in such a
manner as to eliminate, as far as practicable, dust, noise, vibration, or
noxious odors, and shall be in accordance with the best accepted practices
incident to drilling for, and the production of, oil, gas, and other
hydrocarbon substances. Where economically feasible, generally accepted and
used technological improvement for reducing factors of nuisance and annoyance
shall be employed by the permittee.

Sec. 9-4.2902. Initiation.
   A proposed change of the boundaries of a zoned area, or a proposed change of
zone classification, or a proposed amendment to the provisions of this chapter
may be initiated as follows:
   (a)   By the adoption of a resolution by the Council requesting the
Commission to set the matter for hearing, report, and recommendation;
   (b)   By the adoption of a resolution by the Commission setting the matter
for hearing and study; and
   (c)   By filing with the Community Development Director a verified
application of a change of zone classification by the owner of the property, by
a person with a power of attorney from the owner, or by the attorney-at-law of
the owner. If the applicant complies with all the provisions of this article,
the Community Development Director shall set the matter for public hearing. An
application submitted to the Community Development Department after 5:00 p.m.
on Monday shall not be considered filed until the following Monday.
   The Community Development Director shall not accept for processing a zone
change application which proposes zoning inconsistent with the adopted Elements
of the General Plan. If a zone change application is presented for filing with
the Community Development Director which is inconsistent with the General Plan,
the following procedures shall apply:
   (d)   The Community Development Director shall notify the applicant of his
determination of the inconsistency of the proposed zoning with the General Plan
and his reasons therefor. The Community Development Director shall also advise
the applicant of his right to appeal this determination and, alternatively, the
procedure for initiating an amendment to the General Plan.
   (e)   Within twenty (20) calendar days after such notification by the
Community Development Director, an appeal of this determination may be taken by
the applicant. An appeal may be commenced only by filing with the Community
Development Department a notice of appeal which specifies the grounds of
appeal.
   (f)   Upon the receipt of a notice of appeal, the Community Development
Director shall schedule the matter for Commission consideration and shall
notify the applicant of the hearing date. Such consideration shall only deal
with the decision of the Community Development Director as to the consistency
of the proposed zoning with the General Plan and shall not include a discussion
of the merits of the proposed zone change application itself.
   (g)   If the Commission approves the appeal and reverses the decision of the
Community Development Director, and if all other aspects of the application are
in order, the Community
Development Director shall accept the zone change application for processing in
the manner specified in this article.
   (h)   If the Commission denies the appeal of the applicant, this decision
shall become final upon the expiration of ten (10) days following such denial
unless the applicant files, within ten (10) days after such denial, a written
application with the Commission requesting that the matter be forwarded to the
Council for further consideration and final appeal.
   (i)   Upon the receipt of the proper notice of appeal within ten (10) days
after a denial, the Commission shall forward to the Council the resolution
denying the appeal and all reports relating thereto. Upon the receipt of such
resolution and reports, the City Clerk shall set the matter for hearing by the
Council.
   (j)   If the Council denies the appeal, the zone change application shall
not be processed by the Community Development Department. If the Council
approves the appeal and reverses the decision of the Commission, and if all
other aspects of the application are in order, the Community Development
Director shall accept the zone change application for processing in the manner
specified in this article.

making the application, are offered in support of, or in opposition to, an
application, such signatures may be received the Council or Commission as
evidence of notices having been served upon them of the pending application or

determination of a proper amendment to the provisions of this chapter, and,
upon adoption of such resolution of intention, the property designated by the
resolution or application shall be considered as a part of the larger or more
extended area involved. The Community Development Director may also elect to
include a larger area or additional land which, in his determination, is a

resolution, those applications for which the Commission recommends the adoption
of an ordinance by the Council. In the case of applications for which the
Commission recommends a denial and which the Commission does not recommend the
adoption of an ordinance, a resolution setting forth such determination shall
be forwarded to the City Council. The action of the Commission shall become
final following such denial, unless:
   (1)   The applicant files, no later than five (5) days after the Planning
Commission files its resolution with the City Council, a written application
with the City Clerk requesting that the matter be set for a public hearing
before the Council; and

prescribed by Council resolution.
   Filing of the Planning Commission resolution with the City Council for the
purposes of subsection (b)(1) shall be accomplished at the next regularly

matter may be deferred by the Commission indefinitely. In the event the Council
requests a report, the Commission shall forward a report thereon which
indicates its approval or disapproval within forty (40) days after the date of
the request or such other period designated by the Council. The failure of the
Commission to make a report within such prescribed period shall be deemed to be
an approval of the proposed change, plan, or amendment.
   (d)   In any case where a recommendation by the Commission is required, a
copy of any specific plan, regulation, or amendment to the provisions of this
chapter shall be submitted to the Council and shall be accompanied by a written
recommendation which shall include the reasons for the recommendation. Such
recommendation shall be forwarded to the applicant, if any, within fifteen (15)

recommendation, but the Planning Commission shall not be required to hold a
public hearing thereon. Failure of the Planning Commission to report within
forty (40) days after the reference, or such longer period than specifically
designated by the City Council, shall be deemed to be an approval of the
proposed modification.

which its hearing is concluded, except that in any case when the provisions of
Section
9-4.2917 of this article are applicable, the decision shall be made and
announced as early as possible. The ordinance amendment or resolution need not

   Not later than ten (10) days after the decision of the Council, the City

   Without following the procedures otherwise required preliminary to the

health, and welfare, may adopt as an urgency measure an interim ordinance
prohibiting any uses which may be in conflict with a contemplated zoning
proposal which the Council, Commission, or the Community Development Department
is considering or studying or intends to study within a reasonable time. Such
urgency measure shall require a four-fifths (4/5) vote of the Council for
adoption. Such interim ordinance shall be of no further force and effect one
hundred (120) days from the date of adoption thereof; provided, however, after
notice pursuant to the provisions of Section
9-4.2910 of this article and a public hearing, the Council may, by a four-
fifths (4/5) vote, extend such interim ordinance for one year. Not more than
two (2) such extensions shall be adopted. When such interim ordinance has been

   Unincorporated territory adjoining the City may be prezoned for the purpose
of determining the zoning which will apply to such property in the event of
subsequent annexation to the City. The method of accomplishing such prezoning
shall be as provided for zoning territory within the City. Such zoning shall
become effective at the same time the annexation becomes effective.
   If territory which is annexed has not been prezoned, an urgency interim
ordinance may be adopted in accordance with the provisions of Section
9-4.2920 of this article. If neither a prezoning nor an urgency interim
ordinance has been adopted, the territory shall retain its County zoning
classification upon annexation to the City.

Sec. 9-4.3001. Conflicting licenses, permits, and certificates.
   All departments, officials and public employees vested with the duty or
authority to issue permits, licenses, or certificates shall conform to the
provisions of this chapter. No such license, certificate, or permit, or the
renewal or extension thereof, for uses, buildings, or purposes shall be issued
where the same would be in conflict with the provisions of this chapter. Any
such license, permit, or certificate issued in conflict herewith shall be null
and void.
   Whenever an ordinance which changes the zone classification of any property
is adopted, no building permit shall be issued or renewed for any construction
or improvement or other work which is not permitted by the new zone
classification. If for any reason the ordinance does not become effective
within the time prescribed by law, such restriction shall become null and void
as to the subject property.
   Notwithstanding anything in this Code to the contrary, if the applicable
use, height, area, or other zoning regulations are changed after the owner of
property or a party of interest has lawfully started construction of a building
or structure and has incurred obligations for work and material relating to
such construction before the date of adoption of the zoning ordinance, and, as
a result, such building or structure or use does not conform to the new zoning
regulations, work on such building or structure or use may proceed as
authorized in the building permit at any time within one year after the
effective date of the change of zoning, but after that year such permit shall
be null and void. However, if substantial work on a building or structure above
the foundations is done before the expiration of such one-year period, the
proposed building or structure may be completed as authorized in the building
permit within two (2) years after the effective date of the change of zoning,
but after that time such permit shall be null and void.

ordinance becomes effective, issue a building permit for construction on such
property upon receipt of a notice in writing by the Community Development
Director or other responsible City official stating that such construction
conforms to the City zoning, subdivision, and other regulations, and, secondly,

the provisions of this chapter with respect to land uses, building heights,
yards, area coverage, and lot width, and with respect to all other regulations,
conditions, and limitations prescribed by this chapter as applicable to the
same zone or sub-zone in which such use, building, or land is located.
   (b)   While a nonconforming use exists on any lot, no other use of a more
restricted classification shall be permitted even though such other use would
otherwise be a conforming use.

   It shall be unlawful for any person to use or maintain any building,
structure, or land, or to erect, structurally alter, or enlarge any building or
structure, except for the uses permitted by this chapter and in accordance with
the provisions of this code. The violation of any term or condition of, or

Sec. 9-4.3006. Abatement of nuisances.
   (a)   Declaration of nuisances: Abatement. Any building or structure
constructed, erected, altered, moved, or maintained contrary to the provisions
of this chapter, and any property used contrary to the provisions of this
chapter, or any failure to comply with any condition attached to the granting
of any development permit, special use permit, or variance shall be, and the
same is hereby declared to be, unlawful and a public nuisance. Upon the
discovery of facts constituting a nuisance, the duly constituted authorities of
the City shall immediately commence actions or proceedings for the abatement,
removal, and enjoinment thereof in the manner provided by law. Such authorities
shall take such other steps or may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction
to grant such relief as will abate and remove such buildings, structures, or
uses and restrain and enjoin any person, firm, or corporation from
constructing, erecting, altering, moving, maintaining, or using any property
contrary to the provisions of this chapter or failing to comply with any
condition attached to the granting of any development permit, special use
permit, or variance.
   (b)   Service stations. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this
chapter to the contrary, gasoline service stations are hereby declared to be a
special class of land use.
   (1)   Any change from a service station use shall only be permitted through
the issuance of a special use permit, even though the proposed new use is
otherwise permitted in the zone without such a permit. No special use permit
may be issued for any use not otherwise, conditionally or unconditionally,
allowed by the zoning. Any change from a service station use without the prior
issuance of a special use permit shall be unlawful, and the buildings and
structures which are the subject of such a change in use are hereby declared to
be a public nuisance.
   (2)   When the service station use of any service station structure and
building is discontinued and such use is not reestablished for a period of
ninety (90) days or a special use permit for a new use has not been applied for
within the same ninety (90) day period, any existing special use permit or
variance shall immediately become null and void, and the service station’s
buildings and structures shall be, and are hereby declared to be, a public
nuisance and shall be abated following notice and a hearing by the Commission.
If, after notice and a hearing as herein provided, the Commission declares that
the buildings and structures are public nuisances, the burden of proof shall be
upon the applicant to show that the ninety (90) day abatement requirement will
cause irreparable and unnecessary hardship. If the owner submits facts
sufficient to convince the Commission that a hardship as described in this
section exists, then the Commission, at its discretion, may grant one ninety
(90) day period in which a special use permit for a change in use or to
reestablish the service station use may be applied for.
   (c)   Remedies nonexclusive. The procedure provided in this section shall be
in addition to any other remedy provided elsewhere by law.

the Community Development Director, after consultation with the City Attorney,
may order the work stopped by notice in writing served on any persons engaged

permittee, and any such person or persons shall forthwith stop such work until
notified in writing by the Community Development Director that the work may
again proceed.

part of the City’s total environment. Due to their physical dominance on the
City’s landscape, development of the hillside areas will definitely affect the
visual and environmental character of the community. The City’s primary
objective regarding hillside development is to preserve the natural terrain,
quality environment, and aesthetic character of the City while encouraging
creative, innovative, and safe residential development with a variety of
housing types. Such characteristics will only be achieved when special
consideration is given to those developments, subdivisions, and lot splits
within hillside areas on an individual basis and proper consideration of the
variations in conditions, design criteria, and other requirements which must be
flexible in order to achieve a development that meets the foregoing purpose
consistent with the policies set forth in this section.
   Subdivisions and other developments in hillside areas shall be subject to
the provisions of this article where the H-P-D Zone has been assigned to
specific hillside areas as a result of public hearings held pursuant to the
provisions of Article 29 of this title.
   In enacting the provisions of this article, it is the intention and policy
of the City to:
   (a)   Encourage only minimal grading which relates to the natural contour of
the land, and which will round off, in a natural manner, sharp angles at the
top and ends of cut and fill slopes, and which does not result in a “staircase”
or “padding” effect;
   (b)   Require the retention of trees and other vegetation which stabilize
steep hillsides, retain moisture, prevent erosion, and enhance the natural
scenic beauty and, where necessary, require additional landscaping to enhance
the scenic and safety qualities of the hillsides,
   (c)   Encourage a variety of building types and design, when appropriate, to
materially reduce grading and disturbance of the natural character of the area;
   (d)   Require immediate planting wherever appropriate to maintain necessary
cut and fill slopes, to stabilize them by plant roots, and to conceal the raw
soil from view;
   (e)   Require the retention of natural landmarks and prominent natural
features which enhance the character of a specific area, for example, the
natural skyline; and
   (f)   Impose appropriate conditions on the development of all slopes to
obtain conformity with the approved development policies of the Thousand Oaks
Development Plan and the policies set forth in this section.

Sec. 9-4.3101. Hillside areas defined: Application of article provisions (H-P-
D).
   “Hillside areas” shall mean those areas so designated on the Hillside
Development District Map which areas, in general, have an average slope before
grading of ten (10%) percent or more. Such map shall be proposed to the Council
for adoption by a resolution by the Commission only after a public hearing,
noticed and conducted in the same manner required for zone changes in
accordance with the provisions of Article 29 of this chapter. All properties
located within such district shall be considered for possible H-P-D zoning, and
the development thereof shall be subject to the criteria set forth in this
article.

Sec. 9-4.3105. Density (H-P-D).
   No more than seven (7) units shall be permitted on any one net acre through
a density transfer in the H-P-D Zone. The density for property within an H-P-
D Zone shall depend on the average slope of the natural terrain of the area
within the proposed development and a consideration of all requirements of this
Code.
   “Average slope” of a parcel or any portion thereof shall be computed by
applying the formula:
   S = 0.00229 I L
    A
to the natural slope of the land before any grading is commenced, as determined
from a topographic map conforming to national mapping standards and having a
scale not less than one (1") inch equals two hundred (200') feet and a contour
interval not less than five (5') feet. The formula letters represent the
following:
   S   =   Average percent slope;
   I   =   Contour interval, in feet;
   L   =   Summation of length of contours, in feet; and
   A   =   Area in acres of the parcel being considered.
   The density for property within this zone shall be computed in accordance
with the following scale:
 
Average Percent of Slopes Maximum Density (D/U per Gross Acre)
10 – 14.9%              2.0
15 – 19.9%              1.6
20 – 24.9%              1.2
25 – 29.9%              .8
30 – 34.9%              .4
35 and over               .1
 
   For certain unique properties within this zone, where the average slope
percentage is less than ten (10%) percent, the Council may allow the maximum
density of four (4.0) units per gross acre for the entire development.
   All parcels of record which have been recorded prior to September 9, 1971,
and which subsequently are placed in the H-P-D Zone, shall be subject to all
the provisions of this article except, when such parcels are located in natural
slope areas of twenty-four and nine-tenths (24.9%) percent and above, all
parcels shall be permitted at least one dwelling unit.

Sec. 9-4.3106. Grading control (H-P-D).
   (a)   Land with twenty-five (25%) percent or greater slope shall not be
graded except pursuant to an H-P-D permit only where it can be shown that a
minimum amount of development is in the spirit of, and compatible with, the
purposes and policies set forth in this article.
   (b)   The following table is the minimum percentages of the site’s ground
surface which shall remain in a natural state (no cut or fill) or be developed
solely for recreational purposes based on the average percent slope of a
parcel:
                              Minimum percent of Site to Remain in Natural
Average Percent Slope of Site State (No Cut or Fill) or Be Developed Solely for
                              Recreational Purposes
                              Minimum percent of Site to Remain in Natural
Average Percent Slope of Site State (No Cut or Fill) or Be Developed Solely for
                              Recreational Purposes
0.0–14.9%                   32.5%
15.0–17.4%                  40.0%
17.5–19.9%                  47.5%
20.0–22.4%                  55.0%
22.5–24.9%                  62.5%
25.0–27.4%                  70.0%
27.5–29.9%                  77.5%
30.0–32.4%                  85.0%
32.5–34.9%                  92.5%
35.0 and above %              100.00% (except minimum grading for dwelling and
                              driveway areas)
 
   (c)   In order to keep all graded areas and cuts and fills to a minimum, to
eliminate unsightly grading, to preserve the property’s natural appearance and
beauty as far as possible, and serve the other purposes of this article,
specific conditions and requirements shall be placed on the size of the areas
to be graded, the size of building footprint, the shape, size, height, and
angles of cut and fill slopes. Retaining walls may also be required.
   (d)   Land remaining undeveloped in a natural state or open space or land
developed solely for recreational purposes shall be owned and maintained in
accordance with the provisions of Section
9-4.3107 of this article.
(§ 1, Ord. 224-NS, eff. September 9, 1971, renumbered by § 11, Ord. 383-NS,

Sec. 9-4.3107. Open space ownership and maintenance (H-P-D).
   Those areas covered by a hillside development permit which are to remain as
undeveloped open spaces, such as undevelopable slopes and natural landmarks,
etc., or which are to be used for recreational purposes may be offered, through
dedication, to a governmental jurisdiction as part of an open space and park
system. If, however, the district or City does not accept such an offer, the
developer shall make provisions for the ownership and care of the open space in
such a manner that there can be necessary maintenance thereof. Such area shall
be provided with appropriate access and shall be designated as separate parcels
which may be maintained through special fees charged to the residents of the
subject development or through an appropriate homeowners’ association. All cuts
and fills above or below the height of the first terrace would have to be
maintained in perpetuity and guaranteed through the bond of the developer.

Sec. 9-4.3108. Development standards (H-P-D).
   The following development standards are established as the minimum deemed
necessary to insure the public health, safety, and welfare within the H-P-
D Zone and to accomplish the intent and purposes of this article:
   (a)   Circulation.
   (1)   Hillside street standards should reflect a rural, rather than urban,
character. Street alignments, where possible, should be parallel to contours in
valleys or on ridges. Where a location between a valley and ridge is
unavoidable, directional pavements should be split, with the principal of
grading being half cut and half fill versus all fill or all cut. The detailed
design characteristics for each type of street shall be very carefully
considered within the framework of requiring absolute minimum geometric
standards. The following schedule and diagrams are suggested as being
consistent with this premises:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/977a5bef2a567583a2455481bb9d667bb5787785/
IMAGES/0-0-0-15.gif]
Above fourteen (14%) percent grade, concrete pavement shall be required. Public
utility easements may be required outside the street right-of-way if necessary.
The Public Works Director and the County Fire Department may modify the above
street standards as necessary to meet the purposes and policies set forth in
this article.
   (2)   Sidewalks and walkways shall be provided in accordance with a
carefully conceived total pedestrian circulation plan and not rigidly appended
onto every street.
   (3)   Bicycle and equestrian trails should be integrated into the overall
circulation plan for any project in this zone.
   (4)   Street lighting in hillside areas should be of low profile design,
unobtrusive, and designed to enhance a rural character.
   (b)   Parking.
   (1)   Parking should be provided off the street, and parking lanes may be
omitted. The intermittent widening of streets for parking and turnarounds shall
be encouraged at appropriate places.
   (2)   The following on-site parking standards are suggested as being the
minimum desirable and acceptable for residential units within this zone. In
cases where half spaces occur with single units, the standard would be
increased to the next whole figure, notwithstanding the fact that adjoining
properties might share common parking areas. Each required parking space shall
be accessible at all times and shall be accessible at all times and shall not
include driveway or turnaround areas:
 
Use                        Parking Spaces
Studio units               1 covered space, plus 0.5 open space
One-bedroom units          1 covered space, plus 1 open space
Two-bedroom units          1.5 covered spaces, plus 1 open space
Three-bedroom units        2 covered spaces, plus 1.5 open spaces
Four-bedroom units or more 2 covered spaces, plus 2 open spaces
 
   Modifications of the above standards may be permitted by the Council if such
modifications will better meet the purposes and policies set forth in this
article.
   (c)   Building design. Building design and architectural features shall be
compatible with the specific parcel to be developed and with the purposes and
policies set forth in this article. Lot sizes, building types, height limits,
and setbacks shall be flexible in order to achieve this end; however, safety
considerations shall be of foremost concern.
   (d)   Fire protection.
   (1)   The lot size and the placement of buildings thereon shall be such that
adequate clearance of hazardous, flammable vegetative cover may be performed
within the limits of the development.
   (2)   The roofs and exteriors of buildings shall be of fire retardant
materials as provided by the Building Code.
   (3)   The buildings shall be spaced in such a manner as to minimize the
exposure risk, from an adjacent structural fire, from structure to structure as
approved by the County Fire Department.
   (4)   All easements for firebreaks for the fire safety of built-up areas
shall encompass access for fire-fighting personnel and equipment which may mean
motorized travel in some cases; such easements shall be dedicated to this
specific purpose by being recorded.
   (5)   Where parking lanes are not provided, a lane eight (8') feet wide and
fifteen (15') feet on each side of fire hydrants shall be provided and posted
“No Parking.”
   (6)   All brush, as determined by the County Fire Department, shall be
removed and cleared within twenty (20') feet of each side of every roadway.
This includes all flammable vegetation or other combustible growth. This should
not apply, however, to single specimen trees, ornamental shrubbery, and
cultivated ground cover, such as green grass, ivy, succulents, or similar
plants used as ground covers, provided they do not form a means of readily
transmitting tire where brush is removed by the requirements of the County Fire
Department.
   (7)   That portion of any tree which extends within ten (10') feet of the
top of the chimney shall be removed or trimmed.
   (8)   All combustible vegetation cover or other combustible growth shall be
removed prior to the construction of buildings a distance of one hundred (100')
feet, as specified in the Fire Code.
   (9)   Grass and other vegetation located more than thirty (30') feet from
the structure and less than eighteen (18") inches in height above the ground
may be maintained where necessary to stabilize soil erosion.
   (e)   Erosion control.
   (1)   All manufactured slopes, other than those constructed in rock, shall
be planted or otherwise protected from the effects of storm runoff erosion
within thirty (30) days after the completion of the grading. Planting shall be
designed to blend the slope with the surrounding terrain and development.
Manufactured slopes in rock should be provided with soil pockets to contain
landscaping. Irrigation facilities shall be required to provide for the proper
maintenance of the planted areas.
   (2)   Landscaping and irrigation plans shall be submitted and approved in
accordance with the established provisions of this Code and the policies for
all manufactured slopes and public areas. The Council may require additional
landscaping where the Council deems necessary.
   (f)   Parks and recreation. The provisions of Article 26 of this chapter
relating to the dedication of land, payment of fees, or both for park and
recreational purposes shall be applicable to land for which H-P-D permits are
required.

   (a)   The applicant shall submit to the Community Development Department an
application for a hillside plan development permit with the appropriate fee as
prescribed by City Council resolution.
   (b)   The applicant shall submit statistical information and a complete
development plan showing the proposed use(s) for the property, including the
dimensions and locations of all proposed structures, parking spaces, streets,
recreation areas, open spaces, a site-grading plan, and plotting of all trees
and vegetation, and such additional information as may be requested by the
Community Development Director. The application shall also include grading,
phasing, the sequence of construction, and a certified soil report and
geological report from a civil engineer or geologist registered with the State.
A three-dimensional scale model displaying the site before and after grading,
or on-site mock-ups outlining structures shall be required when deemed
necessary by the Director, Commission, or Council. A certified and current
topographic survey shall be submitted to verify average slopes of the entire
property, and shall identify the location and area in slope categories of
0–10%, 10%–25%, and over 25%.

land forms and dotted with prominent knolls including, but not limited to, the
Santa Monica Mountains, the Conejo Mountain, the Mt. Clef Ridge, and the Conejo
Ridge. The visitors to and residents of the City and benefitted by the
preservation of these scenic vistas and their natural features. The
preservation of these natural views and open space areas by the overlay zone
described in this article will enhance the public health, safety, and welfare
of such visitors and residents by promoting a rural sense of openness,
protecting natural and visual assets of the community, preserving areas of
native vegetation and wildlife, preventing soil erosion resulting from grading
in such steep areas, promoting a less urban feeling and maintaining the
identity of this community. The ridgeline preservation overlay zone and
regulations of this article are also enacted to implement those policies of the
City’s General Plan for the preservation of significant natural land forms, the
maintenance and preservation of open space, and the protection of the scenic
backdrop to the City’s major roadways.

term “protected ridgeline” when used in this article shall mean those
ridgelines depicted on the maps in that Ridgeline Study, and any other
ridgeline identified by the City Council from time to time. Such ridgelines
shall be protected by the application of the (PR) overlay zone or specific plan
described in this article, applied pursuant to zoning procedures of Article 29
of this chapter. In considering the application of the (PR) overlay zone to a
particular property, the Planning Commission shall consider and advise the
Council, as part of its recommendation to the Council, whether public interest
would best be served by the public acquisition of the property.
(§ 1, Ord. 1099-NS, eff. April 25, 1991)
Sec. 9-4.3502. Protected ridgeline development standards.
   (a)   Within the Protected Ridgeline Overlay Zone, no new structure or
addition to an existing structure shall be placed or constructed, no grading
shall occur and, except as to meet fire clearance requirements, no native
vegetation shall be removed within three hundred (300') feet horizontally or
one hundred (100') feet vertically of the crest of a protected ridgeline.
However, if because of the limited size of a parcel, the topography or other
physical site constraints there is no suitable location for the addition to an
existing structure or the development of one single family detached home on
residential zoned parcel or a viable use on a commercial or industrial zoned
parcel, minor encroachments into this area or development on the parcel may be
authorized by the Planning Commission consistent with subsection (b) of this
section. No subdivision map shall be approved creating a parcel or a lot within
three hundred (300') feet horizontally or one hundred (100') feet vertically of
the crest of a protected ridgeline, unless all development and grading activity
on said parcel(s) or lot(s) is prohibited, or limited to antennae, open space
uses, water reservoirs or similar uses of benefit to the general public.
   (b)   If, because of the parcel’s limited size or other physical or
topographic constraints, development, grading or clearance of native vegetation
can only occur within the restricted area of a Protected Ridgeline Overlay Zone
the following development standards shall apply:
   (1)   Any structure shall be located on the portions of the parcel which are
least visible from roadways depicted on the Circulation Element of the General
Plan and existing developed areas.
   (2)   No structure shall be placed or constructed in such a way that it
silhouettes against the skyline above the ridgeline when viewed from any
roadway depicted on the Circulation Element of the General Plan.
   (3)   No grading or berming shall occur which alters the natural contours or
changes the elevation of the crest of the ridgeline in order to create a pad.
   (4)   All buildings shall be low profile. No residential structure shall be
higher than seventeen (17') feet measured from the finished grade at the center
of the building wall to the highest roof elevation and any new dwelling unit,
including any garage and accessory structures, shall not exceed, in total, two
thousand (2,000) square feet. For existing structures, no alteration or
addition to that structure shall raise the height or the elevation of the
existing roof.
   (5)   All buildings shall be setback at least fifty (50') feet from the edge
of the finished pad.
   (6)   Berms, rounded contour grading and landscaping shall be used when
necessary to soften the visual impacts created by structures and grading.
   (7)   The grading, design, construction, vegetation clearance, landscaping
and development shall sensitively conform to and fit into the natural terrain
through creative development techniques, such as, but not limited to, split-
level designs, terracing, use of native plant types, and natural blending
architectural features (such as the angle of the roof line appearing as an
extension of the adjacent downslope).
   (8)   Only low profile shaded street lighting, if needed, shall be used to
reduce down slope light spillover and night glare.
   (c)   An applicant may request modification of the provisions of subsection
(a) of this section pertaining to subdivision maps, and modification of the
standards set forth in subsections (b) (4) and (b) (5) of this section through
the filing of a Special Use Permit application. The Planning Commission shall
evaluate such requests on a case-by-case basis in conjunction with their
consideration of other entitlement applications for a project, if any. The
Commission may approve, deny, or conditionally approve such permits. The
decision whether to grant modifications in conjunction with approval of a
project shall be based upon the extent to which the project meets the intent
and purpose set forth in Section
9-4.3500, above. A permit modifying the standards of this section may be
granted, if the findings set forth in subsection (d) are made. Any decision of
the Commission may be appealed to the City Council pursuant to the provisions
of Article 28 of chapter 4 of Title 9 of this Code.
   (d)   Required findings.
   (1)   Where subdivision of land within the Protected Ridgeline Overlay Zone
is permitted, that the project, as approved, complies with the intent of the
Protected Ridgeline Overlay Zone in that it protects the scenic quality of
identified ridgeline areas by preserving in a natural state the significant and
prominent natural landforms which bound the Conejo Valley and the prominent
knolls within it.
   (2)   Where the limitation on size of a residential structure set forth in
subsection (b) (4) is modified, that the project complies with the intent of
the Protected Ridgeline Overlay Zone in that the permitted structure does not
increase the project’s effect on ridgeline viewsheds, and that the size of
structure permitted is compatible with other residential structures in the same
general area.
   (3)   Where the required setback from edge of pad set forth in subsection
(b) (5) is modified, that the project complies with the intent of the Protected
Ridgeline Overlay Zone in that the setback reduction does not increase the
structure’s visual impact on ridgeline viewsheds.

   An Urban Lot Split created pursuant to this Article shall comply with the
following standards and requirements so long as such standards do not preclude
a land division that allows for two units of at least 800 square feet per unit
on each resulting lot. However, if the application of an objective standard
would have the effect of physically precluding either or both units from being
at least 800 square feet in floor area, such standard shall be waived but only
to the extent necessary to allow construction of the affected unit(s) of a size
no greater than 800 square feet in floor area:
   (a)   Exceptions. No Urban Lot Split shall be approved if any of the

final map for the Urban Lot Split. A dwelling unit must exist on the property
at time of approval.
   (p)   Maintenance of Non-Conformities. The City shall not require the
correction of nonconforming zoning provisions as a condition of approval for
the Urban Lot Split. However, the project may not exacerbate an existing
nonconforming building or condition. Unpermitted structures may be required to
be permitted or removed as a part of the Urban Lot Split process.
   (q)   Separate Conveyance Between Resulting Lots. Separate conveyance of the
resulting lots is permitted. If dwellings or other structures (such as garages)
on different lots are adjacent or attached to each other, the Urban Lot Split
boundary may separate them for conveyance purposes if the structures meet

   The purpose of this article is to establish a zone referred to as the “C-2/
AM” or “Highway and Arterial Business/Auto Mall Zone,” in order to encourage
the grouping of dealerships, automotive sales and leasing uses, and also allow
automotive support services such as automotive equipment installation, parts
sales, auto body and mechanical repair to operate within the designated C-2/AM
Zone. The C-2/AM Zone is to be applied at those locations in the City in which
a grouping of automobile sales and services may be developed and operated in a
manner which is compatible with adjacent land uses, that displays visual
characteristics that enhances the appearance of this area to promote trade and
commerce, and accommodates the convenience of motorists with adequate vehicular
access and circulation. The City’s intent is to recognize the special needs
associated with auto dealerships and automobile uses within an auto mall area
and to develop appropriate development and performance standards to facilitate
their growth and prosperity in a manner that is harmonious and sensitive to the
surrounding community.

Article 40. Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Standards for New
Development
Sec. 9-4.4001. Purpose, authorization and intent.
   Transportation demand management (TDM) programs are designed to reduce the
need, or demand, for automobile trips, especially during congested commute
times. TDM strategies include a wide range of activities to encourage transit
use, ridesharing and making trips at less congested times or not making trips
at all. Successful TDM programs reduce the number of cars driven which
generally results in less congestion and improved air quality.
   State law requires each City and the County to adopt their own
transportation demand management or trip reduction ordinance. The Ventura
County Transportation Commission (VCTC) is responsible for the preparation of
the Congestion Management Program (CMP) in Ventura County. Among the state-
mandated elements of the CMP is a Trip Reduction and Travel Demand Management
Element that promotes alternative transportation methods, such as carpools,
vanpools, transit, bicycles, walking and park-and-ride lots, improvement in the
balance between jobs and housing, and other strategies, including flexible work
hours, telecommuting and parking management programs (California Government
Code Section 65089(b)(3)). The goals and policies of the CMP also support the
increased use of low- and no-emission vehicles. The VCTC must determine
biennially whether the County and cities within the county are conforming to
the CMP. (California Government Code Section 65089.3.)
   This article is intended to promote trip reduction and travel demand
measures in the City of Thousand Oaks and meet the TDM facilities ordinance
adoption requirement as set out in the Ventura County Congestion Management
Program. The requirements of Ventura County Air Pollution Control District
(VCAPCD) Rule 210 are separate from this article which sets forth the minimum
requirements for meeting CMP. Employers are encouraged to offer or provide
additional inducements to use alternatives to single- occupant vehicles to
their employees necessary to meet Rule 210 requirements.

Sec. 9-4.4002. Definitions.
   For the purposes of this article, unless otherwise apparent from the
context, certain words and phrases used in this article are defined as follows:
   (a)   “Alternate transportation” shall mean the use of modes of
transportation other than the single-passenger motor vehicle, including but not
limited to carpools, vanpools, buspools, public transit, walking and bicycling.
   (b)   “Applicable development” means any development project that is
determined to meet or exceed the project size threshold criteria contained in
Section
9-4.4003 and the provisions of Section
9-4.4004 of this article.
   (c)   “Buspool” shall mean a vehicle (bus) with more than sixteen (16)
seating positions used and maintained primarily for carrying commuters to and
from work.
   (d)   “Carpool” shall mean a vehicle (passenger automobile) occupied by two
(2) or more persons aged sixteen (16) years or older commuting to or from work
and/or school.

addition of new building square footage. Additions to buildings which existed
prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this article and which
exceed the thresholds defined in Section
9-4.4003 shall comply with the applicable requirements but shall not be added
cumulatively with existing square footage; existing square footage shall be
exempt from these requirements. All calculations shall be based on gross square
footage.
   (i)   “Employee parking area” shall mean the portion of total required
parking at a development project used by on-site employees. Based upon
information developed by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), broad
employee parking needs shall be calculated as follows:
 
Type of Use                  Percentage of Total Required Parking Devoted to
                             Employees
Commercial and retail sales  30%

management and trip reduction measures:
   (a)   Nonresidential development standards. The developer shall provide
calculations or information for determining the number of employees expected to
work at the proposed development project site or work center on the development
entitlement application submitted to the City. If the developer is unable to
provide sufficient information to accurately determine the expected number of
employees, then an estimate shall be made which may be subject to verification
by the City at a later date. A typical calculation to estimate the number of
employees shall be based on: the number of parking spaces required as
determined in Section
9-4.2402 of this title entitled, Parking Space Required; assume one employee
per parking space; and the “employee parking area” factors listed under Section
9-4.4002(i) of this article.
   Compliance with this criteria shall be provided on the site or floor plans
for each entitlement request.
   (1)   Nonresidential development projects capable of holding fifty (50)
employees or more shall provide a bulletin board, display case or kiosk
displaying transportation information located where the greatest number of
employees are likely to see it. Information displayed shall include, but is not
limited to, the following: current map routes and schedules for public transit
routes serving the site; ridesharing promotional material supplied by commuter-
oriented organizations; telephone numbers for referrals on transportation
information including numbers for the regional ridesharing agency; Dial-A-Route
and local transit operators; bicycle route and facility information, including
regional and local bicycle maps and bicycle safety information; and a listing
of facilities and services available for carpoolers, vanpoolers, bicyclists,
transit riders and pedestrians at the site. All proposed public, private
streets or driveways that serve as the main access from project buildings to
the exterior street system shall include sidewalk facilities per City standards
for pedestrians and bike routes as feasible. In cases involving multiple
tenants, a bulletin board/display case shall be provided by each tenant, or it
shall be provided at a common area acceptable to the Public Works and Community
Development Departments.
   (2)   Nonresidential development projects capable of holding one hundred
(100) employees or more shall comply with subsection (a)(1) of this section and
shall provide all of the following measures:
   (i)   Not less than ten (10%) percent of “employee parking area” (employee
parking area shall be calculated from Section
9-4.4002(i) of this article and Section
9-4.2402 of this chapter) shall be located as close as is practical to the
employee entrance(s), and shall be reserved for use by carpool/vanpool
vehicles, without displacing handicapped and customer parking needs. This
preferential carpool/vanpool parking area shall be identified on the site plan
upon application for development permit or other applicable entitlement. A
statement that preferential carpool/vanpool spaces for employees is available
and a description of the method for obtaining such spaces must be included on
the required transportation information board. Spaces will be signed and
striped. Additional carpool/vanpool spaces shall be provided as demand
warrants. The following minimum spaces shall be provided in any case: at least
one space for projects of fifty thousand (50,000) gross square feet to one
hundred thousand (100,000) gross square feet and two (2) spaces for projects
over one hundred thousand (100,000) gross square feet will be signed and/or
striped for carpool and/or vanpool vehicles.
   (ii)   Preferential parking spaces reserved for vanpools must be accessible
to vanpool vehicles. When located within a parking structure, a minimum
vertical interior clearance of seven (7') feet two (2") inches shall be
provided for those parking spaces and access ways to be used by such vehicles.
Adequate turning radii for vanpool vehicles shall be provided. Parking space
dimensions in vanpool parking areas shall be a minimum nine (9') feet by twenty
(20') feet.
   (iii)    Bicycle racks or other secure bicycle parking shall be provided
near building entrances to accommodate four (4) bicycles per the first fifty
thousand (50,000) gross square feet of nonresidential development and one
bicycle per each additional fifty thousand (50,000) gross square feet of
nonresidential development. Calculations which result in a fraction of 0.5 or
higher shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. A bicycle parking
facility may also be a fully enclosed space or locker accessible only to the
owner or operator of the bicycle, which protects the bike from inclement
weather. Specific facilities and location (e.g., provision of racks, lockers or
locked bike room) shall be per the requirements of the Public Works and
Community Development Departments imposed as conditions on each entitlement
request.
   (iv)   Safe and convenient bicycle access shall be provided from the
external circulation system (e.g., from public access bike paths, bike lanes,
and/ or bike routes) to bicycle parking facilities on-site. Safe access shall
be provided so as to minimize conflicts with other vehicles and pedestrians as
determined by the Public Works Department.

Development Departments to mitigate project impacts, bus stop improvements
shall be provided. Appropriate bus service improvements as determined by the
Public Works Director include bus turnouts, bus pads (thickened pavement
structural section where bus travels or stops), bus shelters, bus benches, bus
stops, bus lighting, etc. When locating bus stops and or planning building
entrances, entrances should be designed to provide safe and efficient access to
nearby transit stations and/ or stops as determined by the Public Works
Director and the Community Development Director.
   (iv)   Development design shall incorporate, to the extent feasible as
determined by the Public Works Director and the Community Development Director,
showers, changing rooms, lockers, etc., for employees who bicycle, jog or walk
to work.
   (v)   Development design shall incorporate an eating area and shall
incorporate to the extent feasible as determined by the Departments of Public
Works and Community Development cafeterias, eating establishments, ATMs, day
care facilities, gyms, and other facilities which will reduce the need for mid
day driving. The requirement of this subparagraph will be deemed to be
satisfied if the developer enters into a written agreement with a neighboring
project to mutually share approved TDM facility or facilities such as eating
areas, cafeterias, eating establishments, ATMs, day care facilities, and gyms.
   (b)   Residential development standards.
   (1)   Residential development projects of one hundred (100) dwelling units
or more shall provide the following which shall be provided on the site plans
for each entitlement request:
   (i)   Safe, convenient and direct pedestrian and bicycle access from the
internal circulation system to collector and/or arterial roadways. The project
residential street system shall include sidewalks per City standards. The
project residential street system may also serve as bicycle routes to connect
to the collector and/or arterial roadways. These types of standard facilities
should satisfy this requirement; however, development projects may be required
to provide additional off-street pedestrian and or bicycle facilities as
determined by the Public Works and Community Development Departments.
   (ii)   If determined necessary by the Public Works Department, bus stop
improvements including but not limited to bus turnouts, shelters, benches,
lighting, etc. shall be provided.
   (2)   Residential development projects of five hundred (500) dwelling units
or more shall comply with subsection (b)(i) of this section, and shall:
incorporate development project design to the greatest extent possible and as
appropriate based on adjacent land use and market services such as dry
cleaners, eating establishments, child care facilities, grocery markets,
neighborhood work centers, ATMs, gyms, and other facilities which will reduce
home-based vehicle trips and vehicle miles traveled. This requirement could be
satisfied if the proposed development project is to be located in proximity to
existing or planned services as determined by the Community Development
Department.
   All facilities and improvements constructed or otherwise required by this
section shall be maintained in a state of good repair.
   A reduction in the number of project-required parking spaces and/or parking
space size (i.e., compact parking space size in lieu of standard space size)
may be allowed in certain cases, as determined by the Public Works and
Community Development Departments. To be considered for a parking reduction,
the developer, by imposed conditions, shall agree to provide and guarantee
approved TDM measures and/or TDM program enhancements that exceed the
requirements of this article for the development project. The extent of the
credit for TDM measures in lieu required parking spaces shall be consistent
with requirements of this chapter and shall be approved by the City.
(§ 1, Ord. 1199-NS, eff. March 1, 1994)
Sec. 9-4.4004. Applicability of TDM development standards.
   The provisions of this article shall not apply to projects for which a
development application has been deemed “complete” by the City pursuant to
Government Code Section 65943, prior to the effective date of the ordinance
codified in this article. Phased development projects, development projects
subject to a development agreement, or development projects requiring
subsequent approvals, need not repeat this process as long as no significant
changes are made to the project. It shall remain the discretion of the City of
Thousand Oaks to make this determination.
(§ 1, Ord. 1199-NS, eff. March 1, 1994)
Sec. 9-4.4005. Review of transit impacts.
   Prior to approval of any development project for which an environmental
impact report (EIR) will be prepared pursuant to the requirements of the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) or based on a local determination,
regional and municipal fixed-route transit operators providing service to the
project shall be identified and consulted with to provide input. Projects for
which a notice of preparation (NOP) for a draft EIR has been circulated
pursuant to CEQA prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
article shall be exempted from the provisions of this section. Transit
operators shall be sent a NOP for all contemplated EIRs and shall, as part of
the NOP process, be given opportunity to comment on the impacts of the project,
to identify recommended transit service or capital improvements which may be
required as a result of the project, and to recommend mitigation measures which
minimize automobile trips on the CMP network. Impacts and recommended
mitigation measures identified by the transit operator shall be evaluated in
the environmental impact report prepared for the project. Related mitigation
measures adopted shall be monitored through the mitigation monitoring
requirements of CEQA.
(§ 1, Ord. 1199-NS, eff. March 1, 1994)

Article 42. Oak Tree Preservation and Protection
Sec. 9-4.4201. Purpose.
   The City lies in the Conejo Valley, the beauty of which is greatly enhanced
by the presence of large numbers of majestic oak trees. At one time, the area
was almost completely covered by an oak forest, however, development of the
City has resulted in the removal of a great number of these trees. Further
uncontrolled and indiscriminate destruction of oak trees would detrimentally
affect the safety and welfare of the citizens of Thousand Oaks. The
preservation program outlined in this chapter contributes to the welfare and
aesthetics of the community and retains the great historical and environmental
value of these trees.
   This chapter sets forth the policy of the City to require the preservation
of all healthy oak trees, unless otherwise exempt from this chapter or
reasonable and conforming use of the property justifies the removal, cutting,
pruning and/or encroachment into the protected zone of an oak tree.

Article 45. Accessory Dwelling Units
Sec. 9-4.4501. Intent and purpose.
   The intent and purpose of this Article is to expand opportunities in the
City to create additional housing, allow more efficient use of existing housing
stock, and provide a range of housing opportunities through the creation of new
accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and junior accessory dwelling units (JADUs) on
lots in designated zones that already contain one established unit, or in
conjunction with the construction of a new residential unit. It is the intent
of this article to permit ADUs and JADUs, in conformance with state law, in
designated zones subject to such local standards that will ensure the units
contribute to a suitable living environment for people of all ages and economic
levels, while preserving the integrity and character of residential
neighborhoods in a manner consistent with the City's General Plan.
(§ 2, Ord. 1732-NS, eff. November 22, 2024)
Sec. 9-4.4502. Authority.
   (a)   California Government Code Sections 66310-66342 allow local agencies
to provide for the creation of ADUs and JADUs, respectively, in areas zoned for
single-family and multi-family residential use. The City may designate areas
for ADUs based on the adequacy of water and sewer services and the impact on
traffic flow and public safety.
   (b)   If a conflict is found between this Article and California Government
Code Sections 66310-66342, California Government Code Sections 66310-66342, as
it may be amended, shall prevail.

without an ADU permit and a building permit. Whenever an ADU or JADU is
proposed as a project, an application shall be submitted to the Community
Development Department on a form provided by said department along with any
necessary supporting information. An application for development of a ADU or
JADU created pursuant to this Article will be reviewed ministerially, without
discretionary review or a hearing, and approved if it meets all the
requirements set forth in Sec. 9-4.4504 through Sec. 9-4.4508 (inclusive).
   (b)   ADU and/or JADU applications must be ministerially approved or denied
within 60 days from the date a complete application is submitted if there is an
existing single- or multi-family dwelling on the lot, unless the applicant
requests a delay, in which case the 60-day time period is tolled for the period
of the delay. A denied application for an ADU and/or JADU shall include a full
set of comments to the applicant with a list of items that are defective or
deficient and a description of how the application can be remedied.
   (c)   If the permit application to create or serve an ADU and/or a JADU unit
is submitted with a permit application to create a new single-family dwelling
on the lot, the Community Development Department may delay approving or denying
the permit application for the ADU and/or JADU until the Community Development
Department approves or denies the permit application to create the new single-
family dwelling, but the application to create or serve the ADU and/or JADU
shall be considered without discretionary review or hearing.
   (d)   The City shall not deny an application for a permit to create an
accessory dwelling unit due to the correction of nonconforming zoning
conditions, building code violations, or unpermitted structures that do not
present a threat to public health and safety and are not affected by the
construction of the accessory dwelling unit.
   (e)   A certificate of occupancy for an ADU or JADU may not be issued before
issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the primary dwelling.
   (f)   The permitting of an ADU and/or a JADU is subject to the California
Building Code (CBC) and California Residential Code (CRC), except that the
construction of an accessory dwelling unit shall not constitute a Group R
occupancy change under the local building code, as described in Section 310 of
the California Building Code (Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations),
unless the Building Official makes a written finding based on substantial
evidence in the record that the construction of the accessory dwelling unit
could have a specific, adverse impact on public health and safety.
   (g)   Modifications to an approved ADU or JADU require a new permit,
processed pursuant to this Section.

Sec. 9-8.01. Findings and purpose.
   The Council does hereby find and declare as follows:
   (a)   Adequate school facilities shall be available for children residing in
new residential developments within the City.
   (b)   Public and private residential developments within the City require
the expansion of existing public schools or the construction of new school
facilities.
   (c)   Funds for the construction of new classroom facilities within the City
are not available when new development occurs, resulting in the overcrowding of
existing schools.
   (d)   New housing developments within the City cause conditions of
overcrowding in existing school facilities which cannot be alleviated under
existing law within a reasonable period of time.
   (e)   The General Plan of the City provides for the location of public
schools.
   (f)   For the reasons set forth in this section, this chapter is enacted for
the purpose of providing a new and improved method of financing for interim
school facilities necessitated by new residential developments within the City.
(§ 1, Ord. 684-NS, eff. August 17, 1978)
Sec. 9-8.02. Definitions.
   For the purposes of this chapter, unless otherwise apparent from the
context, certain words and phrases used in this chapter are defined as follows:

School District.
   (d)   “Dwelling unit” shall mean a building, or portion thereof, or a mobile
home designed for residential occupation by one or more persons.
   (e)   “Residential development” shall mean a project containing residential
dwellings, including mobile homes, of one or more units or a division of land
for the purpose of constructing one or more dwelling units. “Residential
development” shall include, but is not limited to, a preliminary or final
development plan, a subdivision tentative or final map, a parcel map, a
conditional use permit, a building permit, or any other discretionary permit
for a new residential use.
(§ 1, Ord. 684-NS, eff. August 17, 1978)
Sec. 9-8.03. Application of chapter provisions.
   For the purpose of establishing an interim method of providing classroom
facilities where conditions of overcrowding exist, the City hereby requires the
dedication of land, the payment of fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of
both for classroom and related facilities for elementary, intermediate, or high
school purposes as a condition to the approval of a residential development in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all residential developments
within the City. The Council, from time to time, by resolution, may adopt
regulations to provide for the administration and implementation of this
chapter.
(§ 1, Ord. 684-NS, eff. August 17, 1978)
Sec. 9-8.04. Findings required.
   If the governing body of the district makes a finding supported by clear and
convincing evidence that conditions of overcrowding exist in one or more
attendance areas within the district which will impair the normal functioning
of educational programs, including the reason for such conditions existing, and
that all reasonable methods of mitigating conditions of overcrowding have been
evaluated and no feasible method for reducing such conditions exists, the
governing body of the district shall notify the Council of such findings. The
notice of findings sent to the City shall specify the mitigation measures
considered by the district and the reasons for their rejection. If the Council
concurs in such findings, the Council shall not adopt an ordinance rezoning
property to a residential use, grant a discretionary permit for residential
use, or approve a tentative subdivision map for residential purposes within
such area unless:
   (a)   The dedication of land, the payment of fees in lieu thereof, or a
combination of both for classroom and related facilities for elementary,
intermediate, or high schools is imposed as a condition to the approval of a
residential development; or
   (b)   The school district has entered into an agreement with the applicant
of a proposed residential development, which agreement provides a feasible
means for mitigating any aggravation of such conditions of overcrowding which
would otherwise be caused by the proposed residential development; or
   (c)   The Council finds there are specific overriding fiscal, economic,
social, or environmental factors which, in the judgment of the Council, would
benefit the City, thereby justifying the approval of a residential development
otherwise subject to the imposition of such a condition.
   The methods for mitigating the conditions of overcrowding which the district
shall consider when making its findings required by this section shall include,
but not necessarily be limited, to the following:
   (a)   Agreements between a subdivider and the district whereby temporary use
buildings will be leased to the district or temporary use buildings owned by
the district will be used;
   (b)   The use of relocatable structures, student transportation, and school
boundary realignments;
   (c)   The use of available bond or State loan revenues to the extent
authorized by law; and
   (d) The use of funds which could be available from the sale of surplus
school district real property and funds available from other appropriate
sources, as determined by the governing body of the district.
(§ 1, Ord. 684-NS, eff. August 17, 1978)
Sec. 9-8.05. Dedication of land or payment of fees required.
   Unless otherwise specifically excepted, every owner or developer of a
residential development situated in or served by an attendance area with
conditions of overcrowding shall dedicate land, pay fees in lieu thereof, or a
combination of both for classroom and related facilities for elementary or high
schools as a condition to the approval of a residential development.
   When a fee is required to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the amount of
such fee shall be the sum of Two Thousand Two Hundred and no/100ths ($2,200.00)
Dollars per pupil which, in either the current fiscal year or any one of the
next succeeding four (4) fiscal years, will be expected to reside in the
dwelling unit or units authorized by the proposed residential development
permit and will be expected to enroll in a school or schools serving the
attendance area in which such dwelling unit or units will be located. The
amount of such fee per pupil, and the factor or criteria to be used in
determining the estimated number of pupils expected to reside in the dwelling
units authorized by the permit and expected to enroll in a school or schools
serving the attendance area, may be determined and modified from time to time
by resolution of the Council on the basis of evidence submitted to it by the
school district and other interested parties.
   The minimum amount of land required to be dedicated pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter shall be at least equal in monetary value to the
fees which would be otherwise required by this section. The Council shall
determine and establish the monetary value of land area for the purposes of
this chapter.
   Only the payment of fees shall be required in subdivisions containing fifty
(50) parcels or less.
(§ 1, Ord. 684-NS, eff. August 17, 1978)
Sec. 9-8.06. Choice of dedication or payment of fees: Procedures.
   The procedure for determining whether the dedication of land, the payment of
fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both for classroom and related
facilities for elementary, intermediate, or high schools as a condition to the
approval of a residential development shall be as follows:
   (a)   Requests of owners. At the time of filing an application for a
residential development, the owner of the property, as a part of the filing,
shall state whether he desires to either dedicate land or pay a fee in lieu
thereof. If he desires to dedicate land for such purpose, he shall designate
the area thereof on the tentative tract map or the plot plan submitted.
   (b)   Action by City. At the time of the approval of such residential
development, the Planning Commission or the Council, upon the advice of the
district, shall determine, as a part of such approval, whether to require a
dedication of land, the payment of fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of
both for classroom and related facilities for elementary or high schools. Only
the payment of fees shall be required in subdivisions containing fifty (50)
parcels or less.
   (c)   Dedication procedures. Where dedication is required, the land shall be
conveyed directly to the district in accordance with standard conveyance
procedures as approved by the County Counsel and shall be recorded prior to the
issuance of a building permit.
   (d)   In lieu fee procedure. When the payment of in lieu fees is required,
such fees shall be deposited with the district, and a receipt therefor from the
district shall be filed with the Community Development Department prior to the
issuance of a building permit.
   (e)   Criteria for determinations. Whether the Planning Commission or the
Council, upon the advice of the district, determines to require a dedication of
land, the payment of an in lieu fee, or a combination of both shall be
determined by consideration of the following criteria:
   (1)    The City’s General Plan;
   (2)   The topography, geology, access, and location of the land in the
development available for dedication;
   (3)   The size and shape of the development and the land available for
dedication;
   (4)   The location of existing or proposed classroom and related facilities
for elementary or high schools within and adjacent to the attendance area of
the development; and
   (5) The desirability of developing the land proposed for dedication as
determined by a schematic site plan submitted by the owner or developer.
   The determination of the Planning Commission as to whether land shall be
dedicated, or whether a fee shall be paid, or a combination thereof shall be
final and conclusive, unless appealed to the Council, or unless the
determination is made directly by the Council on a matter regarding which final
discretionary approval is vested in the Council.

utilities), construction quality, and exterior design. The bedroom and bathroom
mix for inclusionary units shall be proportional to the bedroom and bathroom
mix in corresponding market-rate units. Inclusionary units shall have same
exterior finishes and features as the market-rate units. The Inclusionary units
shall have the same type or quality of appliances, fixtures, and finishes as
the market rate units in the development.

affordable housing production requirement would violate the California and/or
United States Constitutions.
   (2)   In-lieu fees shall be paid according to a fee schedule adopted by the
City Council and will be adjusted annually based on the percentage change in
new home prices and average apartment rent increases in Ventura County.

units shall meet the following requirements:
   1.   No more than fifteen (15%) percent of the off-site inclusionary units
shall be studios.
   2.   At least forty (40%) percent of the off-site inclusionary units shall
include two (2) or more bedrooms.

(15%) percent of the rental units and affordable to eligible very low-income
households.
   (4)   Location of the units:
   (i)   The land to be dedicated shall be located within one (1) mile of the
market-rate development that is subject to the inclusionary housing
requirement, unless the units are located within a moderate or higher resource
area as defined by the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (CTCAC)
Opportunities Mapping.
   (ii)   The inclusionary units constructed on the land to be dedicated shall
not create an overconcentration of deed-restricted affordable dwelling units in
any specific neighborhood, unless the units are located within a moderate or
higher resource area as defined by the California Tax Credit Allocation
Committee (TCAC) Opportunities Mapping.

developer has provided evidence that cleanup was performed in accordance with
applicable law.
   (v)   The land has not been improved with any residential use for at least
five (5) years prior to the submission of the land dedication proposal.
   (vi)   The land's existing General Plan and Zoning allows for residential
use at a density sufficient to permit the development of the required number of
inclusionary units.
   (vii)   The land is suitable in terms of size, configuration, and physical
characteristics to allow cost-efficient development of the required number of
inclusionary units.
   (viii)   The land is fully served by the necessary infrastructure to support
the required number of inclusionary units prior to the conveyance to the City.
   (6)   The developer shall submit all necessary information to evaluate
compliance with the requirements of this Chapter, including:

income households by requiring applicable nonresidential development pay a fee
to be used for the production, preservation, or rehabilitation of affordable
housing units.
(§ 1, Ord. 1506-NS, eff. October 9, 2008, as amended by § 5, Ord. 1543-NS, eff.

nonresidential use changing seven thousand five hundred (7,500) square feet or
more of gross floor area from one (1) Nonresidential Use Category to a more
intensive Nonresidential Use Category where no fee has previously been paid.
For purposes of this article, intensification of a Nonresidential Use means
change from one (1) Nonresidential Use Category to another Nonresidential Use
Category having a higher linkage fee amount.

   For the purposes of determining the linkage fee amount to be charged, every
nonresidential development will be classified into one of the following
nonresidential land use categories:
   (a)   Retail/Commercial – includes but is not limited to retail, service,
and commercial uses, or similar uses in a center, stand alone, or mixed use
format;

the assignment of specific uses to each Nonresidential Use Category.
   (2)   In the case of land uses not designated in said City Council
resolution, the Community Development Director shall determine the appropriate
Nonresidential Use Category from those set forth in Sec.
9-10.404 above, based on the characteristics of each use.
   (b)   Multiple Uses in a Project. When a nonresidential development includes
uses that are classified in different categories (e.g., a project with some
retail commercial space and some office space), then the total gross floor area
of the project shall be allocated among each applicable Nonresidential Use
Categories for purposes of determining the fee.
(§ 1, Ord. 1506-NS, eff. October 9, 2008)
Sec. 9-10.406. Method of calculation.
   For each nonresidential development subject to the provisions of this
article, linkage fees shall be calculated by multiplying the fee amount by for
each applicable Nonresidential Use Category by the gross square footage of the
new construction, addition, intensification or conversion. No application for a
building permit or discretionary permit for a nonresidential development
subject to this article shall be deemed complete for processing unless the
application contains:
   (a)   A calculation of the gross floor area of the nonresidential
development and the gross floor area of each intended nonresidential use in the
nonresidential development.
   (b)   For nonresidential developments involving the conversion of
residential use to nonresidential use, or the intensification of a
nonresidential use to another nonresidential use, the gross floor area of each
existing use and each intended use.
(§ 1, Ord. 1506-NS, eff. October 9, 2008)
Sec. 9-10.407. Determination and payment of fees.
   (a)   In calculating an applicable linkage fee, the Community Development
Director or designee shall impose those fees in effect at the time of issuance
of the building permit or, if no building permit is required, at the time of
issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
   (b)   Where applicable, linkage fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of
a building permit or, where no building permit is required, prior to the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy, as applicable.
(§ 1, Ord. 1506-NS, eff. October 9, 2008)
Sec. 9-10.408. Adjustment and review of fees.
   Linkage fee rates shall be set by City Council resolution and may be
adjusted biennially in an amount equal to the percentage change, if any, in the
construction cost index for Los Angeles for the corresponding period of time,
as published by Engineering News Record/McGraw-Hill Construction Weekly or any
substitute index that the City Council may adopt by resolution. In the future,
the City Council may direct that further study and analysis be conducted to
determine the continuing reasonableness of current fees and whether linkage
fees should be applied to additional Nonresidential Use Categories.
(§ 1, Ord. 1506-NS, eff. October 9, 2008)
Sec. 9-10.409. Use of linkage fees.
   All linkage fees shall be deposited into the Affordable Housing Trust Fund

processed as a minor modification to the project's entitlement and be granted
if the modification is substantially in compliance with the original density
bonus plan and other conditions of approval of the project's entitlement(s).
More substantial proposed changes to the density bonus plan shall be processed
as a major modification to the project's entitlement. The Community Development
Director shall select the type of modification process in the Director's sole
discretion.

and all Affordable Housing Agreements, regulatory agreements, covenants, resale
restrictions, promissory notes, deed of trust, and other requirements placed on
inclusionary units, and other affordable units, by civil action and any other

such enforcement action as is authorized under the Municipal Code and/or any
other action authorized by law or equity or by any regulatory document,
restriction, or agreement executed under this chapter.

Sec. 9-10.604. Waiver requirements.
   (a)   A developer may request that the requirements of this chapter be
adjusted or waived based on a showing that applying the requirements of this
chapter would effectuate an unconstitutional taking of property or otherwise
have an unconstitutional application to the property. A developer may also
request that the requirements of this chapter be satisfied by the developer in
another manner which would result in reasonably comparable compliance with this
chapter.
   (b)   Any request for a waiver, adjustment, or reduction under this section
shall be submitted concurrently with the inclusionary housing plan required by
Section
9-10.304, or density bonus plan required by Section
9-10.506, or with the application for a non-residential development. The
applicant shall bear the burden of presenting substantial evidence to support
the request and set forth in detail the factual and legal basis for the claim,
including all supporting technical documentation.
   (c)   The request for a waiver, adjustment, or reduction shall be processed,
reviewed, and approved or denied by the City Council, and may be processed
concurrently with the discretionary applications, if required, for the
development project. In making a determination on an application for waiver,
adjustment, or reduction, the applicant shall bear the burden of presenting
substantial evidence to support the claim.
   The waiver, adjustment, or reduction may be approved only to the extent
necessary to avoid an unconstitutional result, or if it is determined that an
adjustment would result in a reasonably comparable compliance with this
chapter, after adoption of written findings, based on substantial evidence,
supporting the determinations required by this section. If a waiver,
adjustment, or reduction is granted, any change in the use within the project
shall invalidate the waiver, adjustment, or reduction.

purposes. Generally such property is held in perpetuity for said purposes. From
time to time, however, it may become appropriate and beneficial to the citizens
of Thousand Oaks that property of this nature shall be sold, exchanged, or
otherwise disposed for the public benefit.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedural requirements which
must be met prior to the disposition of open space property owned by the City.

occur entirely below the surface of the land.
   (b)   “Open space” land shall mean land owned by the City which has been
designated for the preservation of the surface of that land in essentially an
open, natural, and undeveloped state. Open space may contain limited
improvements and uses which are compatible and consistent with open space use.
   City property shall be “open space” property if any one or more of the
following apply:
   (1)   The deed, recorded tract map, or other instrument transferring the
property to the City designates the property as open space, or some document
appurtenant to the transfer stipulates that the purpose of the transfer is to
maintain the property as open space;
   (2)   The City Council declares by resolution that the property is open
space. Said resolution may be adopted before, concurrent with, or after the

(§ 1, Ord. 1194-NS, eff. December 14, 1993)
Sec. 9-13.203. Consolidation of hearings.
   If the proposed use of the open space property requires an entitlement from
the City, then the required public hearing on the proposed sale, disposition,
transfer, lease, or grant of easement may be consolidated with the public
hearing on the entitlement. If an administrative officer or Planning Commission
has decision-making authority over the entitlement, any decision on said
entitlement shall not be final unless ratified by the City Council following a
public hearing as required by this article.

APPENDIX A: SPECIFIC PLAN NO. 15

1. Authority for Specific Plan No. 15.
   Specific Plan No. 15 is approved in accordance with, and is authorized by,
Sections 65450 through 65457 of the California Government Code, and Sections
9-2.401 through
9-2.403 of the Thousand Oaks Municipal Code.
   The original territory within Specific Plan No. 15 was located within the
unincorporated area of Ventura County, within the Sphere of Influence of the
City of Thousand Oaks as defined by the Local Agency Formation Commission, and
within the Thousand Oaks Planning Area, as defined by the Thousand Oaks General
Plan.
2. Boundary of Specific Plan No. 15.
   The original boundaries of Specific Plan No. 15 were coterminous with the
boundaries of the Rancho Conejo Reorganization and were described in the
official legal description for said Reorganization, as approved by the Local
Agency Formation Commission on October 18, 1990. Said legal description was
incorporated by reference as the legal description of the boundaries of
Specific Plan No. 15. These boundaries were also depicted on the Specific Plan
Map, attached to Ordinance 1132-NS which adopted this Appendix. Current
specific plan boundaries as amended by this ordinance are depicted on the
Specific Plan Map Exhibit A, attached to Ordinance 1573-NS.
3. Intent and Purposes.
   Specific Plan No. 15 has been created to provide specific development
standards for industrial properties which are currently in this unincorporated
area, but which are being annexed to the City of Thousand Oaks. Because of the
unique development history, use patterns, and existing development, the
Specific Plan is unique and requires special use authorization and standards.
   The purpose and intent of Specific Plan No. 15 is to provide continuation of
development and use standards equivalent, except as provided herein, to those
under existing Ventura County standards as of the date of annexation, to
authorize continuation of the special uses and standards previously approved in
the unincorporated area, and to provide adequate assurances to property owners
within Specific Plan No. 15 of an orderly transition to City governance.

which are set forth as permitted within the City’s M-1 (Industrial Park) Zone,

Code, subject to the type of permit required by the applicable Code section.
The following additional uses are also permitted subject to the applicable type
of permit:

number of parking spaces shall be calculated solely on the basis of the
applicable ratio of parking spaces to floor area, with no requirement for a
relationship between the number of parking spaces and the number of employees
on the largest shift or spaces for company vehicles. Provided, however, that
uses which do have a large number of fleet vehicles shall demonstrate that
sufficient parking is provided for the fleet vehicles.
   B)   Unless the City can demonstrate good reason to require a lower
percentage, industrial uses, research and development uses, and large scale
employment centers (e.g. corporate offices) shall be granted a compact parking
ratio of thirty-five (35%) percent.
8. Minimum Lot Size.
   The provision of Section
9-4.1605(k) of the Thousand Oaks Municipal Code, which provides for a minimum
lot area of twenty thousand (20,000) square feet for lots created after

   C. Restriping of a parking area with the identical delineation of parking
spaces.

access routes, for protection and sealing the paved areas only.
   E. Refurbishment of plant material.
   F. Parking area overlay, defined as the addition of a layer of asphalt over
the existing pavement.
   Pursuant to Section
9-4.2404(f)(1) of the Municipal Code, the above-listed activities shall not
require submittal or approval of a minor modification application by the City.
   The following activities shall not be considered “minor repair and
maintenance,” and shall require submittal of a minor modification application
pursuant to Section
9-4.2404(f)(1):
   A. Restriping in which the number of parking spaces or their configuration
is changed.
   B. Alteration of the number, shape, or size of parking area planters.
10. Nonconforming Buildings.
   Buildings which have met or meet the current County Zoning Code at the time
of annexation to the City, but which do not meet the requirements of the City
Code, may be maintained and altered or expanded in accordance with applicable
regulations, including Specific Plan No. 15, provided that the specific
nonconformity is not increased. In the event of involuntary destruction, such
buildings may be replaced or rebuilt to the same size and height and in the
same location, with the same parking, and site improvements.
11. Other Conditions and Limitations.
   The requirements in the above paragraphs do not cover all the conditions,
limitations, and requirements for development permits and special use permits
relating to the property within Specific Plan No. 15. Any and all conditions,
limitations, and requirements not expressly addressed in this Specific Plan No.
15 shall be the same as those which were part of the Planned Development Permit
or Conditional Use Permit issued by the County of Ventura for that property
prior to the annexation to the City of Thousand Oaks.
   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in or referred to in this
Specific Plan, no conditions, limitation, or requirements (including but not
limited to side yards, rights of ingress/egress, etc.) which are different from
the Ventura County requirements, as defined in the County-issued Planned
Development Permit or Conditional Use Permit, shall apply to the Owners’
Property.
12. Applicability.
   Specific Plan No. 15 shall apply to all land within the Specific Plan upon
annexation to the City. For Property Owners who do not execute a development
agreement with the City, all future changes to Specific Plan No. 15 shall apply
to their property. For Property Owners executing a development agreement with
the City relating to Specific Plan No. 15, such Development Agreement shall
govern the applicability of all City zoning, development, and land use
ordinances, resolutions, regulations, administrative policies, and changes to
Specific Plan No. 15.
   For purposes of interpretation, all references herein to ordinances,
resolutions, regulations, and policies are to those as currently written.
13. Severability.
   If any condition or term herein is declared illegal, null and void, or
unenforceable, the other terms and conditions shall remain in full force and
effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.
14. Amendment.
   Amendments to Specific Plan No. 15 shall be considered pursuant to
procedures established by Section 65453 of the State of California Government
Code. In addition to any other manner that is required by law, notice of any
public hearings on any future Specific Plan amendment shall also be provided to
all property owners within the Specific Plan area.
15. Adoption.
   Upon the approval of Specific Plan No. 15 by the City, and pursuant to the
provisions of California Government Code Section 65453, the City shall adopt an
ordinance establishing Specific Plan No. 15 and codifying it as part of Title 9
(Planning and Zoning) of the Thousand Oaks Municipal Code.

Pretreatment may be necessary to restrict or prevent the discharge of certain
waste constituents, to distribute peak discharges of industrial wastewaters
more equally over a longer time period or to accomplish any pretreatment result
required by this Title. Pretreatment may also require a gravity separation
interceptor, equalizing tank, neutralization chamber, as well as other means of
mitigation as determined necessary by the Public Works Director. Such
pretreatment facilities shall be maintained in good working order and
installed, maintained and operated at the expense of the discharger, subject to
the requirements of this Title and all other applicable codes and laws.
   (1)   Where pretreatment is required, plans, specifications, and other
pertinent data or information relating to such pretreatment shall first be
submitted by a professional engineer registered with the State of California to
the Public Works Director for approval. Such approval shall not exempt the
discharger or said facilities from compliance with any applicable rule or
ordinance of any governmental authority. Any alterations or additions to such
pretreatment facilities shall not be made without written notice to the Public
Works Director for prior review and approval.
   (2)   All applicable federal pretreatment standards which specify quantities
or concentrations of pollutants discharged by a specific industrial subcategory
will be enforced by the City as required by the federal Clean Water Act.
Compliance by existing industrial users with categorical pretreatment standards
shall be achieved within three (3) years of the date the standard is
promulgated unless a shorter time is specified by the Environmental Protection
Agency or other governmental agency.
   (c)   Notification by industrial users of changed discharge. All industrial
users shall notify the Public Works Director in advance of any substantial
change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge.
   (d)   Protection from accidental discharge. Each industrial user shall
provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other
regulated wastes. Each floor drain or floor sink located in an area where
regulated chemicals are stored or used shall be protected in a manner approved
by the Public Works Director to prevent uncontrolled or accidental discharges
of these regulated constituents from directly entering the wastewater system.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge shall be provided and maintained at
the owner's and/or operator's expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
Public Works Director for review and approval prior to construction of said
facilities. Such review and approval of plans and operating procedures shall
not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying said
facilities, as necessary to meet the other requirements of this article.
   Any person that causes or discovers a discharge of hazardous waste or an
uncontrolled or accidental discharge or slug load of regulated waste into a
wastewater line shall immediately notify the Public Works Department by
telephone in order that corrective action may be taken to protect the
wastewater system. In addition, the person responsible for the discharge shall
file a written report to the Public Works Department detailing the date, time
and cause of the accidental discharge, the quantity and characteristics of the
discharge and corrective action taken to prevent future discharges. The report
shall be filed within five (5) days of the discharge occurrence.

wastewater containing grease shall install and regularly maintain an
interceptor to prevent excessive discharges of grease into the waste-water
system. The type and size shall be as regulated by the building provisions of
the Municipal Code or as required by the Public Works Director.
   (2)   Vehicle service stations or garages. Service stations or garages with
non-domestic fixtures or drains (i.e. mop sinks, floor drains) connected to the
wastewater system shall be required to install and regularly maintain an
interceptor designed to prevent the discharge of sand, silt, grease and oil to
the wastewater system. The type and size shall be as regulated by the building
provisions of the Municipal Code or as required by the Public Works Director.
   (3)   Approved designs. The Public Works Director may maintain an
information file, available for public use, of acceptable designs of sand,
grease and oil interceptors. The provision of such information relative to
design or size requirements shall not impute any liability to the City for the
adequacy of the interceptor under the actual conditions of use. The owner or
proprietor shall meet all discharge limitations as set forth by Council action
including alteration of the interceptor as required.
   (4)   Maintenance of interceptors/traps. Any required sand and/or grease
interceptor or trap shall be readily accessible for inspection and properly
maintained by the property owner and/or occupant to assure that the
accumulations of sand, grease and oil do not impair the efficiency of the
interceptor or exit the interceptor in concentrations exceeding discharge
limitations. All required interceptors/traps shall have a record of every time
the interceptor is cleaned. This record shall include the date and name of the
pumper or person who cleaned it and the signature of the person in responsible
charge and shall be reviewed by the Public Works Department during each
inspection. Persons hauling liquid wastes removed from these interceptors or
traps shall be registered to do so by the State of California. An interceptor
shall not be considered properly maintained if sand and/or grease accumulations
total more than twenty-five (25%) percent of the operating fluid capacity. If
it is found that an interceptor or trap is improperly maintained or adequate
records are not being kept, a warning will be issued to the owner and/or user
of the property. If on subsequent inspections, it is found that one of the
above conditions continues to exist, a fine to be set by Council action will be
levied against the owner and/or user of the property.
   (5)   Existing interceptors/traps. An interceptor legally and properly
installed at a vehicle service station, car wash establishment or restaurant
shall be acceptable provided such interceptor is capable of removing sand,
grease and oil so that the discharge from the interceptor does not exceed the
limitations as set forth by Council action and is installed such that it can be
inspected and properly maintained.
   (6)   Limitations on the use of garbage grinders. On all new permits issued,
the waste from garbage grinders shall not be discharged into the City's
wastewater system except when generated in preparation of food in a residence.
   If an interceptor is incapable of retaining adequately the sand and oil in
the wastewater flow from a service station or a car wash establishment, or
grease emissions from a restaurant, the owner shall receive a written notice
requiring that an adequate interceptor be installed within sixty (60) days.

   (c)   Trade secrets and Confidential Information. When requested by the
person furnishing a report and as permitted by laws, those portions which may
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
public inspection. Wastewater constituents and characteristics shall not be
recognized as confidential information. Information and data on a User obtained
from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, individual
wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from inspection and
sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the Discharger specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Public Works Director that the release of such information
would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must
be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When
requested and demonstrated by the Discharger furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the HCTP-NPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. If City withholds such information and suit is filed to
obtain such information, User shall defend City in any litigation. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR
2.302 shall not be recognized as confidential information and shall be
available to the public without restriction.
   (d)    Permit conditions. The permit shall constitute the performance
specification to which each discharger must conform in order to maintain
authorization to use the wastewater system. Permits shall be expressly subject
to all provisions of this section, Federal pretreatment standards and

of pollutants into the treatment works;
   (7)   Applicable Federal pretreatment standards which are more stringent
than local limitations;
   (8)   Self monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification, resampling and
record-keeping requirements. These requirements shall include an identification
of pollutants (or best management practice) to be monitored, sampling location,
sampling frequency, and sample type based on Federal, State, and local law.
   (9)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the User's discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a User to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the User to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   (10)   Other conditions to ensure compliance with this section.
   (11)   Proposed new, increased or additional contributions may be
conditioned or denied by the Public Works Director.
   (e) Compliance schedules.
   (1)   A compliance schedule included in the industrial waste discharge
permit for those industries regulated by Federal pretreatment standards shall
be based on the following conditions;
   (i)   A list of dates for the commencement and completion of major events
leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required
for the industrial user to meet Federal pretreatment standards or local
discharge limits as applicable. The time period between events shall not exceed
nine (9) months.
   (ii)   Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule
and final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress
report to the City stating whether or not it complied with the expected
progress and steps which are being taken to correct any delays.
   (iii)   Within ninety (90) days following the date of final compliance with
applicable Federal pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new discharge,
following the commencement of the introduction of wastewater to the wastewater
system, any industrial user subject to Federal pretreatment standards shall
submit to the City a report indicating the nature and concentration of
Federally limited pollutants and the estimated average and maximum daily flow
for the processes which are subject to such Federal standards. A statement
shall be included which indicates whether the industrial user is meeting the
Federal pretreatment standard on a consistent basis and, if not, which steps
will be taken to bring the discharge into compliance. Such a statement must be
signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to
by a qualified professional.
   (2)   A compliance schedule included in the industrial waste discharge
permit for all industrial users not regulated by Federal pretreatment standards
shall contain the following conditions:
   (i)   An expected date of compliance, which, if it is permitted to exceed
six (6) months from the date of permit, must be supplemented by increments of
progress such as acquisition of funds, equipment, etc.;
   (ii)   Within ninety (90) days following the date of final compliance with
the applicable discharge limits or in the case of a new discharge, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater to the wastewater system, the
industrial user shall submit to the City a report indicating the nature and
concentration of those pollutants regulated by the industrial user's industrial
waste discharge permit. The report shall include the results of a minimum of
three self-monitoring analyses of the user's discharge, collected and analyzed
within the allowable ninety (90) day period. The report must be signed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified
professional.
   (f)    Duration of permits. Permits are issued for no more than (3) three
years, and may be issued for a period of less than one year or may be stated to
expire on a certain date. The terms and conditions upon which the permit is
issued may be modified during the period for which the permit is in effect. The
user shall be informed of the permit changes thirty (30) days prior to the
effective date of the change. Any new conditions in the permit shall include a
reasonable compliance schedule proposed by the industrial user and approved by
the Public Works Director.
   (g)   Transfer of a permit. Permits are issued to a specific user for a
specific operation. It shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new
owner, new user, different premises or a new or changed operations. Any
attempted transfer, assignment or other alteration shall render the permit null
and void as to the transferor or transferee.
   (h)   Revocation of a permit. Any user who violates the conditions of his
permit, this article or applicable State and Federal regulations is subject to
permit revocation. Violations include, but are not limited to, the following:
   (1)   Failure of a user to accurately report their wastewater constituent
concentrations and characteristics or to comply with their self-monitoring
requirements.
   (2)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations.
   (3)   Refusal of access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection
or monitoring.
   (4)   Violation of permit conditions.
   (i)   Preliminary determination of and penalties for noncompliance with
permit requirements. For those industrial users not regulated by Federal
pretreatment standards, pollutant discharge limits enforced as concentration
limits (mg/l) will be modified when user consistently attempts to use dilution
of the waste stream as a means of meeting the concentration limits. In such a
case and/or at the discretion of the Public Works Director, said user will be
required to meet a maximum mass emission rate, based on the user's average
water usage for the past three years and the applicable pollutant concentration
discharge limits.
   For all industrial users, initial noncompliance with permit requirements may
be determined by an analysis of a grab or composite sample of the effluent of a
discharger for any constituent or condition specified in the user's permit. If
the effluent of a user contains prohibited substances or is found to be in
excess of the required concentration or conditions of this article, then a
sampling and evaluation program shall be initiated by the City. The industry
shall be required by the Public Works Director to implement any changes
necessary to achieve compliance within a time limit proposed by the user and
approved by the Public Works Director. Any user that refuses to cooperate in
this effort, shall pay penalty charges based on the results of the sampling and
evaluation program, as established by Council action.
   (j)   Public notification will be by publication annually, in the largest
daily local newspaper, listing all local industries regulated by pretreatment
standards or requirements who, during the previous twelve (12) months, were
found to be in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards
or other pretreatment requirements. For the purposes of this provision, an
industrial user is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or
more of the following criteria:
   (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined as those in
which sixty-six (66%) percent or more of all the measurements taken during a
six (6) month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric Pretreatment Standard
or Requirement including instantaneous limits as defined in 40 CFR 403.3(l) (as
may be amended), the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same
pollutant parameter.
   (2)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined as those in which
thirty-three (33%) percent or more of all of the measurements for the same
pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period equal or exceed the
product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement including
instantaneous limits as defined in 40 CFR 403.3(l) (as may be amended), daily
maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4
for BOD, Suspended Solids, and Oil and Grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants
except pH).
   (3)   Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement
including instantaneous limits as defined in 40 CFR 403.3(l) (as may be
amended), that, as determined by the Public Works Director, has caused, alone
or with other discharges, interference with treatment processes, pass-through
(including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public) or
violations of the City's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
Permit.
   (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to
human health, welfare or to the environment, or which has resulted in the
City's use of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
   (5)   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone for starting construction, completing
construction or achieving final compliance.
   (6)   Failure to provide required reports within thirty (30) days after the
due date.
   (7)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
   (8)   Any other violation of group of violations which, as determined by the
Public Works Director, has adversely affected the operation of the pretreatment
program.
   (k)   The penalties for noncompliance shall continue to accumulate on a
daily basis until the industrial user can show corrective action has been taken
or compliance achieved. If the period of noncompliance continues for more than
ten (10) consecutive working days, or if the Public Works Director determines
that the violation presents or may present imminent or substantial danger to
the health or welfare of persons, to the environment or causes interference
with the operation of the treatment plant, the City may proceed with the
following:
   (1)   Amend the existing permit only when the discharger has shown good
faith in trying to comply and requires additional time for construction and/or
acquiring equipment. The permit may be amended for a period not to exceed one
hundred eighty (180) days.
   (2)   Proceed with enforcement action.

Article 7. Charges
Sec. 10-1.701. Wastewater connection charge.
   (a)   Charge basis. Prior to receiving wastewater service for any residence,
building or parcel of land, a connection charge shall be paid. The connection
charge shall be in addition to the requirements for construction of or payments
towards wastewater main pipeline systems. The owner of the property shall be
responsible for payment of all unpaid charges not collected, or collectable
from the developer, user or occupant.
   (b)   Connection charge rate. The amount of the wastewater connection charge
shall be as set by Council action.
   (c)   Calculation of connection charge. A plumbing fixture unit shall be as
defined in the current edition of the Plumbing Code. Only those fixtures that
contribute wastes to the wastewater system shall be counted and charged. Any
fixture not listed in the applicable section of the Plumbing Code to be
installed shall be given a unit count by the Public Works Director. The total
plumbing fixture unit count for each application/location shall not be less
than that of a single family residence. Private plumbing fixtures are those
plumbing fixtures enclosed within the area of a single business, company or
organization intended for the use of employees only. Public plumbing fixtures
are those plumbing fixtures that are provided for use by employees, customers,
guests and/or the general public, including those fixtures intended for use by
two or more tenants in a multi-tenant building. The charges set forth in this
section shall apply, except for those buildings with a total floor area equal
to or greater than twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet where the
provisions of subsection (e) of this section may apply as determined by the
Public Works Director. Motels, hotels and any other buildings on a parcel of
land with a common ownership that cannot at some future date be divided shall
be considered on an overall basis, and the minimum charge shall not apply to
each individual building.
   (d)   Escalation. All wastewater connection charges shall be adjusted
biennially and by Council action by a factor based upon the increase or
decrease in the Engineering News Record (ENR)’s Construction Cost Index for Los
Angeles based upon the change from the preceding two (2) years’ July-to-July
period.
   (e)   Special situations. For special situations such as combined use
buildings, multiple occupant developments, or any other facilities where the
computed connection charge does not, in the opinion of the Public Works
Director, result in an equitable connection charge, the actual charge shall be
determined based on criteria such as, but not limited to: environmental impact;
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System requirements, water
consumption; peak loading; residential equivalency; treatment plant capacity
and capital costs. However, in no event shall the minimum rates be altered.
   (f)   Submittals. Commercial and industrial projects shall submit building
and/or plumbing plans for the Public Works Department's permanent records in
sufficient detail to allow the determination of the number of fixture units and
the appropriate connection charge.
   (g)   Time of Payment. No parcel of property shall be connected to the
wastewater system and receive permanent wastewater service from the City until
a the appropriate wastewater connection charge has been paid. The connection
charge shall be paid prior to, or concurrent with, the issuance of a building
permit.
   Payment of connection fees cannot be made earlier than the following:
   (1)   For tract/subdivision projects, no sooner than recordation of the
tract or parcel map;
   (2)   For other projects, no sooner than:
   (i)   Approval of wastewater system drawings,
   (ii)   At the time of application for a wastewater permit, which should
coincide with finalization of documents necessary for a building permit for
approved projects, which must be accepted for plan check by the Department.
   For affordable housing projects, payment of connection charges may be
delayed until such time as the applicant makes a request to the Public Works
Department for occupancy clearance. All charges must be paid in full prior to
issuance of an occupancy permit by the Public Works Department. The amount paid
shall be based on the charges in effect at the time the wastewater permit for
construction of the project was issued.
   (h)   Installment payments. Where an individual property owner has been
required to connect an existing housing unit to the public wastewater system,
and where payment of the wastewater connection fee would present an undue
hardship to the property owner, and where the City's interest is best served by
the properties being connected to the public wastewater system, the Public
Works Director may approve payments of the wastewater connection fee on an
installment basis. Payments shall be subject to a written and recorded
agreement between the City and the property owner, and shall include, in
addition to the principal connection fee amount, payment of interest charges as
determined by the Finance Department. The agreed-to-payment amounts shall be
billed separately from the property owner's regular wastewater billing and are
subject to interest and penalties as allowed by Council action. The agreement
shall be recorded at the Office of the Ventura County Recorder to provide
beneficial notice to any future purchaser of the property. If full payment of
the wastewater billing becomes more than sixty days delinquent, the City, at
its option, may require payment in full of the entire amount still owing on the
connection fee.
   (i)   Credits for prior payment of wastewater connection fee. A parcel or
other division of property having paid a connection charge shall be credited
with current value service units paid. The credit may not be transferred or
conveyed to another parcel, except to transfer to another public agency, where
the facilities previously using the credit were removed and/or destroyed and
cannot be reused again the future, subject to the approval of the Public Works
Director. In the case of non-residential condominiums, the Property Owner
Association shall have managing authority upon fixture credits as specified in
Section
10-1.303.
   (j)   Termination of service and impact on connection charges. A property
which terminates service will be credited with a charge as determined herein.
If the property is then reconnected at a later date, then the then-current
connection charge shall be due and payable, less the credit amount.
   (k)   Changed uses: Additional charges. If a building or the use of a parcel
of property is enlarged, altered or changed, including the addition of an
accessory dwelling unit, a new connection charge is greater than that credited
to the parcel of property, the difference (based on fixture units or equivalent
service units) shall be paid to the City. The payment is due before the
issuance of a plumbing permit or building permit, as appropriate. The
provisions of this subsection shall not apply, however, to the enlargement of a
single family dwelling.
   (l)   Reduced uses. If a building or the use of a parcel of property is
diminished, altered or changed in any way that would reduce the connection
charge, no refund shall be made; but the credit given shall remain a credit to
that property against any future facilities.
   (m)   Subdivision of parcels. If a parcel of property having a connection
charge credit is divided, that connection charge credit may be divided also in
any way that the owner instructs the City in writing; provided, however, the
credit remaining with any parcel connected to the wastewater system shall not
be less than the amount that would be required as a connection charge for that
parcel using current rates. In the absence of written instructions, the Public
Works Director may divide the credit.
   (n)   Non-residential Condominium.
   Each detached building shall pay for a minimum of twenty (20) fixture units
at the time of building permit issuance or prior to condominium map
recordation. Each condominium unit shall pay connection fees as specified in
the current User Fee Ordinance.
   Wastewater fixture units paid for shall be attached to the parent property
and may be transferred between buildings or separate ownerships within the
parent property at the discretion of the Property Owners Association. Pursuant
to Section
10-1.701 (k) and (l), all fixture units within the parent property shall be
assigned to common area fixtures or assigned to member condominiums prior to
purchasing additional fixture units for the property. Purchases of additional
fixture units shall be made solely by the Property Owners Association. The City
reserves the right to, at its sole discretion, redistribute the fixture units
in a manner it determines to be in the best interest of the City.
   It is the intent of this provision to ensure that a minimum of twenty (20)
fixture units remain permanently assigned to each building. Fixture units in
excess of the minimum of twenty (20) may be transferred by the Property Owners
Association, upon approval of the Public Works Department, to another building
which is lacking an adequate fixture unit count for the proposed use.

   (b)   Where the costs associated with a specific City improvement project
such as a major pipeline project exceed that which normally could be collected
via the wastewater connection charge.

used or taken advantage of free of charge by any person, persons, association,
firm or public agency, including the United States of America, the State or any
public corporation, political subdivision, including City, County and district
agencies. If the wastewater service is provided outside the City limits, the
service charge shall be further increased over and above the in-City charge in
an amount set by Council action. All properties with buildings, houses, etc.,
wherein there is a capability of generating and discharging wastewater to the
public wastewater system shall pay a wastewater service charge irrespective of
the occupancy/vacancy status of the property.
   Individual portions of a common property such as stalls, office spaces and
others where it is determined by the Public Works Director that independent
discharge to the wastewater system can be made, shall pay a wastewater service
charge.
   (b)   Charges. Monthly wastewater service charges shall be as set by Council
action.
   (c)   Combined water and wastewater charges. Where the City provides both
wastewater and water service to properties and the wastewater service charges
are not collected via direct assessment on the Ventura County property tax
roll, a combined bill will be prepared. In all such cases, the City shall have
the right to discontinue water service to any person or property whose combined
water and wastewater bill/invoice is delinquent.

Sec. 10-1.705. Miscellaneous repair and/or maintenance costs.
   When Public Works Department crews are involved in repairs or maintenance
wherein such work is done for the protection of the Public Works Department's
system or where the work is a result of damage to the Public Works Department's
facilities by a private individual or company, then the City shall charge that
individual or company. Such charges shall include materials, equipment, labor,
all as determined by the Public Works Department and overhead at a rate set by
Council action.
(Ord. 1515-NS, eff. June 5, 2009)

Article 8. Main Line Extension and Oversizing Agreements
Sec. 10-1.801. Reimbursement Agreement - General.
   A developer or owner may request reimbursement for a portion of the cost
associated with the installation of a wastewater facility, typically a
pipeline. Any reimbursement shall be by agreement and pursuant to the
requirements outlined in this article.
   The City may require, or a developer may elect to construct, an off-site
wastewater main which may, in the opinion of the Public Works Director, qualify
for reimbursement subject to payback through a reimbursement agreement. Where a
wastewater line must be extended to serve a property, the wastewater line
extension normally shall be constructed by the property owner requesting
service. That portion of the project costs, as approved by the Public Works
Director, which benefits other properties may be subject to payback through a
reimbursement agreement. To qualify, there must be (1) benefiting properties
which have agreed to participate or that can be required to participate through
normal City procedures, and (2) improvements which provide a substantial
benefit to those properties.
(Ord. 1515-NS, eff. June 5, 2009)
Sec. 10-1.802. Main line extension.
   (a)   General. Each reimbursement agreement shall state the total dollar
amount which is subject to reimbursement and shall identify the wastewater line
(s) which are the subject of the agreement and the entire area benefitted by
the extension or oversizing of such wastewater line(s). Preparation of and
entering into a reimbursement agreement typically would occur at or near the
conclusion of construction of the project so that costs can be compiled.
Methods of determining the pro-rata shares may be: (1) by area of the
benefiting properties; (2) by the number of benefiting properties, if that is
judged by the City to be more equitable; (3) by the number of single family
dwellings; or (4) any other method approved by the Public Works Director. The
methodology used to determine benefit and the selection of the properties which
are considered to benefit shall be at the sole discretion of the City.
   (b)   Eligible and Ineligible Project costs. The eligible project costs may
consists of the construction contract price, including all labor and materials
costs incurred for the construction of the wastewater line(s), engineering
design and surveying costs, bond issuance costs, fees paid to the City, such as
for plan check, inspection, encroachment permits, easement documents, and other
costs approved to be eligible. Ineligible costs shall include attorney fees,
interest paid on construction loan financing, and contract administration costs
in excess of ten (10%) percent of total construction costs. Only that portion
of the project cost which benefits other properties, as approved by the Public
Works Director, shall be subject to payback through a reimbursement agreement.
The reimbursement agreement shall be based upon actual constructed costs, not
estimates. Documentation of costs shall be provided to the City in the form of
signed, executed contracts, and certified payroll sheets showing the names of
employees, their wages and all deductions for state and federal taxes, health
benefits, workers' compensation, union dues (if applicable), social security
and any other standard deductions. In a case where an applicant is personally
involved in the construction of the improvements (such as operation of a
backhoe or other equipment), the hourly charges for said person may not exceed
the prevailing wage rate for operation of said piece of equipment, and shall be
approved by the Public Works Director.
   (c)   Reimbursement payments. Each reimbursement agreement shall include
provision for the amount and timing of payments to the developer, its
successors or assigns as received by the City from benefiting properties. The
maximum duration of the agreement shall be ten (10) years commencing on the
date of City Council acceptance of the mainline extension or the date of
approval of the reimbursement agreement by City Council, whichever comes first.
The applicant shall be responsible for providing a current mailing address to
the city over the life of the reimbursement agreement. The City's
responsibility for making reimbursement payments to the applicant shall be
limited to mailing such reimbursements to the last known address provided by
the applicant. Where reimbursement payments are returned to the City as
undeliverable, the City will disburse said monies to applicant upon
notification by the applicant of a new mailing address without benefit of
paying accrued interest of such monies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event the City has retained any returned funds, those funds shall be returned
to the participating property owner after six months, and the applicant shall
have no recourse to said funds from the City after this time period. If
collected monies are returned to the City as undeliverable from applicant and
participating property owner, City may retain such funds for its own use. Any
direct collection of funds/monies by the applicant from participating property
owners shall nullify and void the agreement.

Article 6. Cross Connection and Backflow Prevention
Sec. 10-2.601. Cross Connections - General.
   Cross connection can be defined as any unprotected connection between any
part of a water system used or intended to supply water for drinking purposes
and any source or system containing water or substances that are not or cannot
be approved as safe, wholesome, and potable for human consumption. The term is
used in conjunction with backflow prevention. Bypass arrangements, jumper
connections, removable sections and other devices through which backflow can
occur are considered cross connections. Backflow is the physical process by
which contaminants can enter the potable water supply.
   No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained
by the Public Works Department unless the water supply is protected as required
by said State regulations and the provisions of this section.
   The purposes of the provisions in this section are to:
   (a)   Protect the public water supply against actual or potential cross
connections by isolating within the premises contamination and pollution that
may occur because of some undiscovered or unauthorized cross connection on the
premises;
   (b)   Eliminate known cross connections.
(Ord. 1516-NS, eff. June 5, 2009)
Sec. 10-2.602. Other applicable codes or standards.

   The Cross Connection Control Officer for the City is appointed by the Public
Works Director and is responsible for overseeing that backflow prevention
devices are properly installed, maintained and tested. The area of
responsibility for the Cross Connection Control Officer shall be limited to the
City's water service area.
(Ord. 1516-NS, eff. June 5, 2009)
Sec. 10-2.604. Backflow prevention devices.
   (a)   Approval and installation. Both the selection and installation of
backflow prevention devices required by the provisions of this section shall be
approved by the City and shall be installed by and at the expense of the
customer.
   (b)   Testing and maintenance. The devices shall be tested annually by a
certified tester with repairs and maintenance as needed. Records of such tests
and repairs shall be kept by the customer and made available to the Cross
Connection Control Officer. All of the above shall be at the sole cost of the
customer. A property owner failure or refusal to have a device tested, or take
corrective action to repair any backflow device which has failed its annual
test is a public nuisance under TOMC Section
1-6.01 et seq. As additional to remedies provided therein, the City may hire a
company to perform the annual test and/or repair the failed device, and the
property owner shall be billed for all charges paid to said company, along with
any manpower or out-of-pocket costs or charges incurred by the City or any
other additional charges or fees as may be set by the Council action. As an
alternative, with an owner who refuses to repair a failed backflow device, the
City may, after giving thirty (30) days written notice to the property owner,
shut off the domestic water supply to the premises which is to be protected by
said backflow device until such time as the device has been repaired by the
property owner.

Sec. 10-2.606. Where devices are required.
   Backflow devices are required at or near the point of service from the
public potable water system to any location:
   (a)   Having an auxiliary supply, including a groundwater well;
   (b)   Where chemicals are manufactured or processed or are used within the
premises that could be potentially harmful;
   (c)   Where hospitals or doctors' offices, either for humans or animals,
with medical and surgical facilities are maintained;
   (d)   Where oils and gasses are produced or developed;
   (e)   Where there is a mortuary;
   (f)   Where there is food processing;
   (g)   Where there is a landscape irrigation system;
   (h)   Where natural and synthetic rubber, rubber goods and tires are
manufactured;
   (i)   Where a brewery is operated;
   (j)   Where the use within the building might impart an objectionable taste,
odor or color;
   (k)   Where there is a wastewater treatment facility or pumping station;
   (l)   Where there is need for a backflow prevention device for protection of
the public potable system.
   Backflow prevention devices fall into the following categories: Reduced
pressure principle device (RP), double check detector valve, air gap, pressure
vacuum breaker, and atmospheric vacuum breaker. The specific device required
for a particular location shall be per the Water Design and Construction
Standards or as required by the Cross Connection Control Officer.
(Ord. 1516-NS, eff. June 5, 2009)
Sec. 10-2.607. Device requirements.
   The following rules are to be used in conjunction with those rules contained
in Title17 of the California Administrative Code and Section 12 of the Water
Design and Construction Standards as well as the judgment of the Cross
Connection Control Officer. These rules are aimed at protecting the City's
water system near the water meter as opposed to internal protection within a
building where such internal protection is provided and is approved by the
City's Cross Connection Control Officer, protection at the meter may not be
required.
   (a)   Requirement for devices. Any service connection to the public water
system from a premises having a potential for harmful or objectionable
substances to enter the public water system through backflow cross connections
shall be protected.
   (b)   Auxiliary water supply. Whenever a building or premises has a
connection to both the public water system and an auxiliary water supply, the
latter shall be protected with either a reduced pressure device or a double
check valve depending upon the potential and severity of the cross connection,
unless the system was accepted by the City as an additional source of public
system water.
   (c)   Air gaps. Are required at the service connection to any premises on
which any material dangerous to health or toxic in nature may be handled under
pressure. Also, air gaps shall be used to protect the potable system at
wastewater treatment or pumping facilities. The air gap shall be located as
close as practicable to the service cock. Other types of devices would only be
approved if the air gap is not physically possible.
   (d)   Reduced pressure principle devices. Are required at industrial and/or
commercial facilities using potentially harmful chemicals, hospitals, doctor's
offices, irrigation systems (unless protected by air gap or pressure vacuum
breaker), fire sprinkler systems using chemical additives, mortuaries, and as
required by the Cross Connection Control Officer.
   (e)   Double check valve assemblies. Are required where products used within
the building or premises might impact an objectionable taste, odor or color but
would not be hazardous.
   (f)   Double check detector valves. Are required where there is no other
meter between the water source and the building such as a fire service line for
building.
   (g)   Whenever it is not practical to protect drinking water systems on
premises against the entry of water from a source or piping system or equipment
that cannot be approved as safe or potable for human use, an entirely separate
potable water system shall be installed to supply water at points convenient
for consumers.
(Ord. 1516-NS, eff. June 5, 2009)
Sec. 10-2.608. Fire systems.
   Water systems for fighting fire, derived from a supply not approved as safe
for potable use shall be kept wholly separate from the potable system. In cases
where the domestic water system is used for both drinking and firefighting
purposes, approved backflow prevention devices shall be installed to protect
the domestic system. Fire protection classes and required devices are as
follows:
   (a)   Classes I and II. Direct connections from the public water mains only;
no tanks, reservoirs, or physical connection from other water supplies, no
anti-freeze or, other additives, no booster pumps creating less than a positive
ten (10) psi suction pressure; all outlets discharging to atmosphere.
Generally, Classes I and II do not require backflow prevention devices (i.e.,
at fire hydrants connected to public main).
   (b)   Class III. Direct connection from public water system plus either
elevated storage tank, fire pumps taking suction from such tanks/reservoirs, or
pressure tanks. The water in the storage tanks shall be potable. Generally,
Class III requires only double check valves to prevent stagnant waters from
backflowing into the potable system.
   (c)   Classes IV, V and VI. Like Class I and II, but with an auxiliary water
supply within one thousand two hundred (1,200') feet of the pumper connection.
This class requires a reduced pressure device or double check valve depending
upon the quality of the auxiliary water supply. If auxiliary supply is
nonpotable source such as contaminated water, industrial water systems or
contains chemical additives, an air gap may be required.
(Ord. 1516-NS, eff. June 5, 2009)
Sec. 10-2.609. Process waters.
   Potable water pipelines connected to equipment for industrial processes or
operations shall be disconnected therefrom if practicable. Where disconnection
is not practicable, a suitable backflow prevention device located beyond the
last point from which drinking water may be taken shall be provided on the feed
line to process piping or equipment. In the event the particular process liquid
is especially corrosive or apt to prevent reliable action of the backflow
prevention device, air gap separation shall be provided.

Article 7. Charges
Sec. 10-2.701. Plant investment fee.
   (a)   Fee basis. Prior to receiving water service for any residence,
building, irrigation meter or parcel of land, a plant investment fee shall be
paid. The plant investment fee shall be in addition to the requirements for
construction of or payments towards service mains and connections and water
meters. All requests for irrigation meters shall be accompanied with payment of
the plant investment fee, regardless of whether or not such facilities will
eventually be dedicated to the City or another public agency. The owner of a
property or the owner at the time the charge was generated shall be responsible
for payment of all unpaid charges not collected or collectable from the
applicant, user or occupant. Payment(s) of plant investment fees are not
transferable from one property to another, except to another public agency,
where operations and other onsite plumbing revisions have altered water demand,
subject to the approval of the Public Works Director.
   (b)   Fee amount. The amount of the plant investment fee shall be based upon
the size of the required meter and shall be as set by Council action. For
special situations where, in the opinion of the Public Works Director, the
calculation of the plant investment fee does not result in an equitable charge,
such fee shall be determined in accordance with best available information and
professional engineering practices. All fee amounts shall correspond to the
amount currently in effect at the time payment is made.
   (c)   Time of payment. No parcel of property shall be connected to the water
system until all water connection fees have been paid. The water connection
fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit.
   Payment of water connection fees cannot occur earlier than the following:
   (1)   For tract/subdivision projects, no sooner than recordation of the
tract map;
   (2)   For other projects, no sooner than:
   (i)   Approval of water system drawings.
   (ii)   Recordation of a parcel map.
   (iii)   At the time of application for a water permit, which should coincide
with finalization of documents necessary for a building permit for approved
projects, which must be accepted for plan check by the Public Works Department.
   (d)   Escalation. All plant investment fees, special facilities surcharge
fees, and fire flow surcharges shall be adjusted biennially and by Council
action by a factor based upon the increase or decrease in the Engineering News
Record (ENR)’s Construction Cost Index for Los Angeles based upon the change
from the preceding two (2) years’ July-to-July period.
   (e)   Credits or refunds for prior payment of plant investment fee. When a
larger service (meter) is requested than that which was previously paid for,
then the credit shall be for the current value of the plant investment fee for
the meter size previously paid. When a smaller service (meter) is desired there
shall be no refund for the previous over payment. However, these shall remain a
credit to the property for the larger water service (meter).
   (f)   Subdivision of parcels. If a parcel of property having a plant
investment fee credit is divided, that credit may be divided also in any way
that the owner instructs the City in writing provided, however, the credit
remaining with any parcel connected to the water system shall not be less than
the amount that would be required as a plant investment fee for that parcel
using current rates. In the absence of written instructions, the Public Works
Director may divide the credit
   (g)   Non-residential Condominiums. The Property Owners Association, or
property management firm acting on behalf of the Property Owners Association,
encompassing a single building or a group of buildings or individual ownerships
on the parent property, shall be billed and shall pay for monthly water use

Article 8. Main Line Extension and Oversizing Agreements and Local Shares
Sec. 10-2.801. Reimbursement Agreement - General.
   A developer or owner may request reimbursement for a portion of the cost
associated with the installation of a water facility, typically a pipeline. Any
reimbursement shall be by agreement and pursuant to the requirements outlined
in this article.
   The City may require, or a developer may elect to construct, an off-site
water main which may, in the opinion of the Public Works Director, qualify for
reimbursement subject to payback through a reimbursement agreement. Where a
water main must be extended to serve a property, the main extension normally
shall be constructed by the property owner requesting service. That portion of
the project costs, as approved by the Public Works Director, which benefits
other properties may be subject to payback through a reimbursement agreement.
To qualify, there must be (1) benefiting properties which have agreed to
participate or that can be required to participate through normal City
procedures, and (2) improvements which provide a substantial benefit to those
properties.

Sec. 10-2.802. Main line extension.
   (a)   General. Each reimbursement agreement shall state the total dollar
amount which is subject to reimbursement and shall identify the water line(s)
which are the subject of the agreement and the entire area benefitted by the
extension or oversizing of such line(s). Preparation of and entering into a
reimbursement agreement typically would occur at or near the conclusion of
construction of the project so that costs can be compiled. Methods of
determining the pro-rata shares may be: (1) by area of the benefiting
properties; (2) by the number of benefiting properties if that is judged by the
City to be more equitable; (3) by the number of single-family dwellings; or any
other method approved by the Public Works Director. The methodology used to
determine benefit and the selection of the properties that are considered to
benefit shall be at the sole discretion of the City.
   (b)   Eligible and Ineligible Project costs. The eligible project costs may
consists of the construction contract price, including all labor and material
costs incurred for the construction of the water line(s), engineering design
and surveying costs, bond issuance costs, fees paid to the City, such as for
plan check, inspection, encroachment permits, easement documents, and other
costs approved to be eligible. Ineligible costs shall include attorney fees,
interest paid on construction loan financing, and contract administration costs
in excess of ten (10) percent of the total construction costs. Only that
portion of the project cost which benefits other properties, as approved by the
Public Works Director, shall be subject to payback through a reimbursement
agreement. The reimbursement agreement shall be based upon actual constructed
costs, not estimates.
   Documentation of costs shall be provided to the City in the form of signed,
executed contracts, and certified payroll sheets showing the names of
employees, their wages and all deductions for state and federal taxes, health
benefits, workers' compensation, union dues (if applicable), social security
and any other standard deductions. In a case where an applicant is personally
involved in the construction of the improvements (such as operation of a
backhoe or other equipment), the hourly charges for said person may not exceed
the normally accepted union rate for operation of said piece of equipment and
shall be approved by the Public Works Director.
   (c)   Reimbursement payments. Each reimbursement agreement shall include
provision for the amount and timing of payments to the developer, its
successors or assigns as received by the City from benefiting properties. The
maximum duration of the agreement shall be ten (10) years commencing on the
date of City Council acceptance of the mainline extension or the date of
approval of the reimbursement agreement by City Council, whichever comes first.
The applicant shall be responsible for providing a current mailing address to
the City over the life of the reimbursement agreement. The City's
responsibility for making reimbursement payments to the applicant shall be
limited to mailing such reimbursements to the last known address provided by
the applicant. Where reimbursement payments are returned to the City, the City
will deposit said monies in a holding account, and will disburse said monies
upon notification by the applicant, without benefit of paying accrued interest
of such monies. In the event the City has retained any returned funds, those
funds shall revert to the City six months after the expiration of said
agreement, and the applicant shall have no recourse to said funds after this
time period. Any direct collection of funds/monies by the applicant from
participating owner(s) shall nullify and void the agreement.

   (a)   Any person who owns or possesses a water well or monitoring well that
is abandoned or about to become abandoned, but who does not desire to destroy
the well, or a person who desires to return an abandoned well to active status,
may submit to the City a report prepared and signed by a registered inspector
as required by Section
10-2.1013(e). Recommendations for repair must be submitted for review and
approval of the City. If the City determines that the well would not result in
pollution of groundwater and would not create a hazard to health and safety,
the City may issue a certificate of exemption or may approve the well to be
returned to active status. Either alternative requires a satisfactory well
condition inspection report.
   (b)   A certificate of exemption shall expire five years after issuance and
may be terminated by the City at any time prior to expiration upon a
determination that destruction of the well is necessary to prevent pollution or
contamination of groundwater or to avoid a hazard to health or safety.
Successive certificates of exemption may be issued with respect to a well in
the same manner as the original certificate was issued. The well condition
inspection report shall only be valid when the report has been shown to meet
the requirements of Section
10-2.1013(e). The well condition inspection report will expire after 12 months
and a new well condition inspection report will be necessary for well status
changes.

effect at all times and are permanent. Violations of this section shall be
considered waste and an unreasonable use of water.
   (a)   Limits on Watering Hours: Watering or irrigating landscape and
vegetated areas with potable water is prohibited between the hours of 8:00 a.m.
and 6:00 p.m. on any day, except by use of a hand-held bucket or similar
container, or by use of a hand-held hose equipped with a positive self-closing
water shut-off nozzle or device, or for short periods for the express purpose
of adjusting or repairing an irrigation system, or for turf refurbishment on a
public playing field.
   (b)   Limits on Watering Duration: Watering or irrigating landscape and
vegetated areas with potable water using a sprinkler system that includes spray
heads and/or bubblers or a watering device that is not continuously attended is
limited to no more than 10 minutes of watering per day per station or
irrigation zone. Drip irrigation systems (including subsurface) and water
efficient devices such as rotator stream nozzles are permitted to operate for a
longer period such that an equivalent volume of water is dispensed. In the
absence of manufacturer specifications, rotator stream nozzles are permitted to
run for 20 minutes and drip systems for up to 60 minutes provided that there is
no water runoff.
   (c)   No Excessive Water Runoff: Runoff, overspray, or excessive water flow
from a property from potable water use or from irrigation of any landscape or
vegetated areas onto an adjoining property, sidewalk, driveway, street, alley,
gutter or ditch is prohibited.

maps, drawings, and all other relevant information, including a written
statement of the applicant.
   (3)   Required Findings for Waiver: An application for a waiver will be
denied unless the City finds, based on the information provided in the
application, supporting documents, or such additional information as may be
requested, and on water use information for the property as shown by water use
records, all of the following:
   (i)   That the waiver would not constitute a grant of special privilege over
other residents and businesses; and
   (ii)   That the authorizing of such waiver will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent properties and will not materially affect the ability of
the City to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and will not be detrimental
to the public interest.
   (4)   Approval Authority: The Public Works Director must act upon any
completed application no later than 14 days after submittal and may approve,
conditionally approve, or deny the waiver. The applicant will be promptly
notified in writing of any action taken. Unless specified otherwise, at the
time a waiver is approved, the waiver will apply to the subject property during
the period of the mandatory water supply shortage condition. The waiver may be
revoked or modified upon written notice from the Public Works Director.
   (5)   Applicants may file an appeal with the City Manager's office within 14
days of receipt of the decision of the Public Works Director on the waiver
application. The appeal must include an additional processing fee in the amount
set for the initial waiver.
The additional fee will be refunded if the appeal is successful. The City
Manager or his/her designee must act upon the appeal within 14 days and this
decision is final.
